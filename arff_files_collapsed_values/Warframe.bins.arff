"great fun. its clearly still beta as the game offers little information about how to actually set up your character, luckily the wiki is superb. think left 4 dead with space ninjas. loads of classes and even more weapon variety.",4

"warframe is kind of like mass effect 3s multiplayer but better in many ways. it has a power system similar to me3s power system, but it has a variety of missions instead of only a deffence/horde mode. it has some really cool weapons. and it has bows. these bows are what sold me when i first started. i saw a bow in the store and spent $10 to buy the thing faster than *put flash joke here*. its not a pvp game. some of the warframes, like rhino, are really op in pvp. but overall its a good time, especially with friends. i should note that you can buy almost anything in the game via plat, this does lead to a pay 2 win kind of game. you can get almost anything in the game via plat / trading, but you can get everything in the game without paying anything. a lot of the weapons in the store are around 275 plat (which is really overpriced) and warframes will run from 75-375. (which is a little better because of the pain it is to build them) i must stress here that warframe is the most fun when you are just playing and not grinding for something. yes, grinding is something that you have to do in order to get anyware in warframe, but (at least for me) this does not ruin the overall experience.",3

"definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over, and expecting a different result. this game = insanity incarnate. heres why: -play the same level, over and over again, expecting to actually get a mod/prime/resource -play this game over and over again, expecting it to not be the most rage-inducing game youve ever played. -complain in the forums over and over, expecting nerfs/buffs on demand. however, i still reccomend. somtimes its fun to be insane....",5
"this game is based on the biography of the late abraham lincoln. it takes place in 1998, right after lincoln finished his music career in rap/hip-hop. his number 1 single of the time was the fresh prince of bel air his life ended in a very tragic way, as he overdosed on prescription lincoln logs.",1

"you are tenno. what is tenno? nobody really knows. all they see is the suit. the frame. beautiful and deadly. an instrument of war and destruction. you awaken, weak and powerless, with no memory of who or what you are. vay hek, leader of the grineer, the genetically modified mechanically enhanced remnants of humanity, is after you. he wants to harness the power of your warframe to fuel his campaign for galaxy wide domination. you cannot defeat him. you must escape. if you somehow manage to elude vay hek, and escape into the depths of the dark and unforgiving galaxy, you might just encounter other lost and memoryless frames. perhaps your race has a chance for survival. as you explore the galaxy, you are guided by a mysteriously entity known only as lotus. for reasons unknown, lotus has taken an interest in the tenno, and appears to be on your side. for now. your mission: disrupt the three dominant powers of the galaxy through terrorist missions and guerrilla warfare. amass the most powerfull and exotic weapons and frames known to galactic life. discover the mysteries of the galaxy, and the secrets of the tenno race. if you can do all this, maybe there is hope after all.",5

"went to grind so much i ended up in a corner office of a theripist... he said i had an addiction. i asked him what kind?! his only response was, the same damn addiction i have, now pay me and gtfo, i need the money to pay for more platinum you fool!!! 10/10 would grind again",3
"this game is soooo well made! its the best free to play ive played. its a fun free to play, yay! i love the way you dont even need to pay out real money into this game to get that epic gear you want. good work, de.",1
"everytime i return to this game, i always get excited to see what i could do. everytime i leave this game, i always have the same feeling.",2

"its darn good for a free to play title, and it does that excellently as well. pick it up!",1
"pros: - fun to play solo or co-op - very cool action - parkour :d - vast amount of areas to play cons: - some times its hard to connect with your friends :l - can get pretty repetitive - some items are very hard to get, other than buying them. overall: it is a fun and exciting co-op game for you and your friends :d think left 4 dead 2 but while in space! 7/10 stars!!",1
"the core gameplay is good, but the games world isnt as fleshed out as it could be. movement feels good, combat is solid. grindy as hell and you need a good clan to really get all the content. overall 7/10, you get what you pay for.",2
"the missions in this game include classics like do a frontflip and slide your sword into the rectal cavity of a beefy marine",2
"maps manage to feel empty despite being full of enemies everything depends on grind objectives get boring gunplay gets boring because everything feels the same everyone is an  because theyre constantly pulling mental gymnastics to try and justify their sunk costs/time and are frustrated that they cant admit theyre bored",1
"interesting, but very grindy and samey. artificially difficult, you need to have grinded enough to not be dead weight to your team. the weapons are horribly imbalanced even with the new damage system and while youre supposed to be stealthy ninjas, the best way through a level is to gun everything down with the heaviest weaponry or ignore enemies and alarms entirely. the developers seem to almost genuinely care about the community, but some of their ideas are half-baked and their quality assurance team appears to be nonexistent. ultimately, a casual run-and-gun with severe balance issues that still manages to be one of the better f2p games on the market.",8
"if you like space and ninjas then you have found the right game :d its a co-op game that have a party of 4 players :d it also has pvp ( players vs players ) but i have never tried it because i dont usually like pvp in co-op oriented games, but anyways thats just my opinion :d its also very repetitive :p and one more thing. it takes some time to build/craft gear and other random things in the game like weapons, pets, warframes ( other classes ) and other stuff. but thats because its a f2p ( free 2 play ) game :d the game gets a 11 out of 10 because they tell you to take a break :d",2
"this game has nice graphics and the gameplay is fun. however, theres a reason why this is still in beta. after playing for a week or two youll see that pretty much all the missions are quite similar. sure there are different ones like extermination and survival, but most of them end in getting the task done and then running back to extraction. also, this game is a complete grindfest. the devs put up ridiculous prices so you either have to buy the item or you have to grind for days in order to get it. however, if you do get your item, it usually takes days for it to be ready. a new warframe takes three days. three! and you need three components (which all take a day each to build) in order for you to move on to the main blueprint (takes 3 days to build). so this game emphasizes on you either having money or time. but yeah, not much content or backstory either. i seems interesting enough, but its so vague. i would just play this for a week and then get on with your life.",2
"grind + reskins + microtransactions + overbearing devs and pr = this game",2
"i am very new to this game but already i am enjoying it very much. great co-op game and lots of fun. one of the most entertaining ones out there when it gomes to free games! if you enjoy co-op shooter games a lot then i recommend you give this a try.",1
"for a free-to-play online shooter, this is as good as it gets. really great graphics, pretty interesting co-op gameplay. basically, youre getting left4dead + mass effect in this one. it gets a little repetitive after some time and monetization is forced sometimes, but hey -- its overall free and the game is pretty good by itself, even when youre not paying to get some stuff. id rate this game 8.5/10.",1
"without a doubt, one of the best free 2 play mmos ive ever played in my life. i would highly recommend this game if your pc is at least medium-spec, and youre into parkour shooters like gunz, s4 league, or any other games similar to them. its ing space ninjas, for christ sake. you cant go wrong with that! get this game! you will definitely not regret it!",4
"dont play this game, i mean, seriously, dont. ive wasted a lot of my time on this game, and i cant get out of my house because its too addicting. this is the reason why i have no life. please send help.",3
"for a game in its beta version it is actually quite impressive. this game is a 3rd person co-op shooter game featuring (the generic definition) mothering space ninjas with magic. there is a large variation of characters to fit anyones play style including various and very unique and powerful energy abilities and weapons. i have never seen a game with such advanced player movements including wall runs, sliding, jump kicks, and dodge rolling which really keeps the game feeling fast paced and exhilarating. the game excels in graphics, level design, and combat keeping the game very dynamic with the best experience making this one of the best free-to-play game in existence.",4
"warframes are like power suits each with their own special powers. you have to do missions in a futuristic space setting. the game is fun to play, solo or coop. you can get most things in game without buying platinum the premium currency. it has some bugs, but usually it doesnt take to long before they are resolved.",5
"artifical gameplay lengthening from farming items to unlock other items to craft the items you actually need, then waiting days of real time for them to craft (or pay money to have them right now) rinse and repeat.",1
"my friend got all the content ive been grinding for weeks in ten seconds. 7.8/10 too much water",3
"my friend got all the content ive been grinding for weeks in ten seconds. 7.8/10 too much water",3
"warframe is undeniably one of the most satisfying experiences ive had with a free to play title. it contains an ever expanding arsenal of weapons, mods, and warframes that can be mixed and matched for endless possible combinations. the game also features a highly satisfying clan system including the ability to build your own clan hall, which provides several bonuses besides the simple meeting area with cosmetics. and the great feature of warframe is that it always contains a challenge. from raiding the orokin towers, to hunting down the elusive stalker and harvester, something is there to put your mettle to the test. and in case it wasnt clear, you play as freakin space ninjas. whats not to love?",3
"this game started out fun enough, especially for a free to play game. unfortunately, every patch (and theres about 4/week) makes the game even worse. its been out for almost a year, and i dont think a single bug has ever been addressed, while every patch brings a whole host of new bugs; most minor, some major. the netcode is terrible. there are no dedicated servers, instead relying on one of the four players to host. it seeks out the absolute worst host imagineable for every game. when i play with friends its fine, but about 9/10 times you play with the public the lag is so bad as to render the game as unplayable. the game frequently refuses to accept certain inputs. its fairly common to just be plain unable to use your melee weapon, or be unable to crouch for several games. bosses occasionally become completely invincible. did i mention the lag? its bad. i dont just mean theres lots of snap back, and targets become impossible to hit; im talking extended intervals (i.e. double-digit minutes) where its so bad you have trouble leaving the room youre currently in. the variety of weapons started out as neat, unfortunately theyve increased the grind factor needed to get them every day. this is the rare case of a an early beta game being pretty fantastic, but absolutely every change theyve made since then has been for the worse. i would pay money for the warframe of 8 months ago. i wouldnt pay $0.01 for the warframe of today.",6
"it was good, but with every patch its getting more and more grindy. de appears to be incapable of bug testing, so all of our new content is riddled with them, and the dev teams lacks focus, hoping from one thing to the next never applying the final polish to anything they add. i wouldnt recommend any new players pick the game up.",6
"never have i been so happy to grind and farm in true mmo  fashion than i have been playing as a magic space ninja and getting my  pummelled by various cyborgs and cthulus.",7
"the life of a warframe player -gets game. -plays for 30 hours . -starts noticing the paywall. (dont you dare say there isnt. you need a catalyst/reactor to make your frame/ weapons do damage to anything over lvl 30. yes they drop in alerts but unless you want to wait a fortnight at a time at the chance of getting one you will end up putting money into it) -puts money into the game and it feels like a whole other game. -starts the farm for prime parts. -hits 600 hours and has all prime frames and weapons. -just sits there wondering why the  they just did all of that. ok for all of you saying there is no paywall they drop in alerts. you do realise they drop once a bloody fortnight. for a non casual player playing this that drop rate is too bloody small. you will gain more weapons in one week that you want to catalyst than the amount of catalysts drop in a whole damn year. next time read the damn review before you say they drop in alerts!",7
"i thought i was playing halo 5 when i realized it was actually warframe",1
"grinding. do not play this game unless you enjoy grinding. i wake up screaming at night because i have nightmares about things not dropping. the same map over and over and over again until that one little piece of gear drops. that is what this game is about. also shiny asses, but only on the men.",2
"great game.. boring at lower levels.. but gets really (and i mean really) addictive as you progress in levels and in the game. it has fast paced gameplay and immersive environment. overall a good pick for shooting game lovers. :d",6
"its very rare that a f2p game with a model like this keeps my interest for over a few minutes, but ive been playing warframe for 7 hours within the first day of downloading it. really surprisingly quality and well-polished combat as well as loads of different mods and abilities makes for a really entertaining game overall.",5
"a very well made free to play 3rd person shooter. uses a custom lanucher/updater. gameplay gameplay is quite repetitve in the long run. there are a bunch of planets available to you, each with sectors ( missions ) with different gamemods which you complete for rewards. the game uses tiles to randomly generate levels. some planets have unique tilesets, etc. has a bunch of different weapons and weapon types, each item has to be ranked up with xp. you can then mod your weapon/warframe/etc with a huge amount of mods to tweak each parameter to your liking. has a lore, but theres no campaign as such, just a few story quests. real money basically almost nothing is locked behind a paywall in this game. the only exceptions i found are some cosmetics ( character attachements, color pallettes, animations sets ) and inventory size ( for weapon and characters ). you can trade in-game currency bought for real money to other players at higher levels, which means that you can unlock pretty much everything for free, which enough time put into the game. not only that, but you can get a -75% discount on platinum ( currency bought for real money ) as a daily login reward, and for 5$ you can get enough of it to lift all restrictions on the inventory size and buy some cheap cosmetics. buying weapons/characters for platinum is pointless because you can simply craft, or acquire them otherwise. score if i had to give it a score, id say 7.5/10.",3
"well this game is just like the pringles chips........ once you pop, you cant stop",4
"way back then i have had a good look at firefall and warframe. both quite unpolished and in so much need of work. gave firefall the benefit of the doubt, and just loved it. i needed a change though and a good buddy of mine in firefall, was also playing warframe and so i asked how the game was these days. three months later, and i am all in on this game. with firefall having open space and more of an mmo feeling, warframe is level based, with a mission. a big change for me, but liking it lots. you get to know the mechanisms, the frames, mods etc etc and just get better at it. frames keep leveling, so are the mods. all these things give you a feeling of accomplisment in this game. the frames are quite distinctive, and all have their specific abilities that make you come back for more. de is adding more features, releases frames or updated/upgraded frames (prime) and hopefully in the near future id like to get more into the lore of the tenno. every week a live community stream and i believe every other week a dev stream as well. both with giveaways. all in all a great game that will let you have a great time with your buddies. ps. its certainly not p2w at all. almost everything you want, you can get it by playing certain levels etc etc. if you do pay, thats great. the game deserves all the support :)",3
"at least its better than call of duty. 17/10 would play again.",2
"becomes more grindier with each new patch, not fun anymore. quickly becoming like blacklight retribution with all the rng and grindwalls",9
"warframe is a refreshing take on the squad based 3rd person shooter, in its over all game play and especially its art design. while not every gamers taste, i find warframe to be a refreshing take on design. the characters and aliens are unique, very inspired and striking. my compliments to the art direction and the whole team. the gameplay is tight, responsive and franciticly exciting giving the player the experience of feeling like theyre a true space ninja. youll be parkouring over obstacles, climbing on walls, hacking apart enemies and sliding across floors while going all john woo on anyone that stands between your teams and your objective, ninja. ive found myself coming back to this game over and over again ever since a friend got me into it way back in june 13. as of today, ive already spend hundreds of hours in warframes. game sessions can be as pick up and play as a half hour or turn into longer survival and raids. its one of the most open to all ftps out there. paying players dont overwhelm the f2p players in the gameplay department. they just dont have to spend the time gathering and crafting those items. all of which can be easily found in the game and created with miniumal grind time compared to how many other f2ps work. digital extremes really did this game right, give it a try and you wont be disappointed.",9
"go go power tenno! go go power tenno! mighty force power tenno!",10
"well... if you like teamplay, crafting, gore, aliens, ninjas this game is for you. if you like to say noob, hacker, l2p, report teemo this game is not for you. no pay2win, really good gameplay, try it. 8/10",10
"while sometimes a bit repetitive and grindy, the game offers a fair free to play market based system, with just about everything not cosmetic on the market place obtainable in game with a little work. my only real complaint is actually just the community at times. if you arent used to the games parkour, speed tricks, and moving while fighting mechanics, some of the higher end players doing lower level missions will simply leave you in the dust and not look back, completing the mission themselves, leaving you sort of an empty experience with the mission. the most intimidating thing about the game is its parkour system though, being able to move at extreme speeds, wall running, climbing and vaulting just about anything, sliding while unleashing a torrent of melee attacks or gun fire, and using it all to your advantage. give it some time, after a couple of hours practicing it can start to become second nature, especially anyone used to combo based games. but in the end when you are feel confident about your ability to do it all, nothing feels more badass then executing a series of attacks while sliding and moving through waves of enemies quickly and efficiently, and being able to turn around when all is said and done to see some of their bodies still falling to the ground. and come on, whats better then being a freaking space ninja with guns.",3
"warframe is a retrofit, fast-paced, animated novel. youll encounter deep and thorough story elements along with deep and interesting game mechanics. youll find no grinding in this game so farmville lovers beware. this first person, tatical, real-time strategy, tower defense game is very hard to put down and will have you racing around the track for hours on end. i give this game a square enix out of an electronic arts.",2
"warframe is an enjoyable game. but heres the list of things you dont wanna do if you wish to play it for a looooong time. -rushing missions- warframe gets boring and hard to play if you play the missions just to get the loot, enjoy the game in whole. -playing every mission online- now, you might just laugh at this one but, its true! there are many trolls and whiners in this game since its free-to-play, many rushers too. -getting someone to get you all the things you want- this one is the biggest reason to become boring. i knew this guy, he played for a week, and already had 70 hours on record. he got all the things he wanted in one week. eventually game became boring and lame to him and he stopped playing. now the things that will make you play the game: really neat developers, will often respond to community questions and bugs constant dev-streams which spoil all the things you always wanted often patches often mini-updates which bring in new weapons and stuff no paywall. you can basicly get everything in game for free except the cosmetics which are here just for those who want them things that make not play this game: trolls and whiners hard to get materials elitistic s if you really like the game like i do, you will ignore all the things that make you quit the game.",7
"i love this game, you can make new weapons, you can make new warframes, many and many updates that will add more frames and weapons, its highly addictive, its fun to play with friends, i just ing love it !",5
"nothing to write home about. unless you just enjoy endless, mindless repetition and soulless characters dressed up in nonsensical art.",1
"the thing that immediately drew me in to this title was how apparent the use of zbrush was when creating the characters. seriously, as a character modeler myself, this is like all the stuff you want to make in zbrush but can never get into a real game because its too far away from mainstream design. the dev team is a bunch of hardworking people who outdo themselves with each update. i cannot begin to describe how happy i am with the growth of this game, it blows me away every time an update rolls out. the events are super fun, the weapons modding is full of tons and tons of options, there is an ever growing list of items and warframes, and there is just so much to bite into in this game. i am a person who enjoys deep detail and stats and customization, and this game speaks to that need very well, in addition to the utter beauty of the visuals. oh, by the way, its totally free. the only place i find a little lacking is lore. they have done a lot of worldbuilding and set up a great stage for their characters but have not embellished them or the history of the world very much. this grows with every update, of course, but i feel it is growing much more slowly than the game itself is. id love to even just be able to read more somewhere, if nothing else. however, there is enough there though to latch onto to make stuff up, and that can be fun. would love a bit more! ok go try it now.",9
"i hate this game. it steals all of my money because its so good. eugh.",7
"its an awesome concept, but the game gets stale after the first 30-40 hours of gameplay. you find yourself collecting the same things in the same levels against the same 3 basic enemy types. the only thing that changes as you level up is the variety of weaponry available and the number of enemies on-screen. imagine me3s co-op multiplayer mode turned into a giant standalone, minus the variety. thats warframe.",1
"i see this game going up to its 10 rating i think it deserves. at the moment its extremely linear design-wise. despite that, i play it religiously. at least every other day. also, it being a f2p you seriously dont need to buy anything with real money ever. i bought 8 dollars worth of platinum for a color pack, weapon slots, and character slots. its the only free to play i have ever bought anything from(excepting dota 2). i highly recommend getting this game.9.3/10",1
"this game is so awesome, you can do parkour stuff in it kinda, you can decapitate enemies, and you have an awesome looking character (which you can customize >:3), and well its so fun! i give it a rating of 10/10!",1
"the developers *digital extremes* has continually made this game a piece of crap. let me explain. to get the detron, a piece of gear that has been wanted by players to be added for a month, was finally added. how to get it? well, you do missions against the corpus *also known as boxhelmets and robots*, while siding with the cyborg armored guys. each mission gives a 5% chance or so, to have a harvester spawn at you in another game, which if you abort, will cancel the harvester coming at you. this harvester once killed can drop nothing, a detron blueprint, a detron chassis, or a detron barrel. when third party programs tried to find a way to properly make the harvester spawn easier, because of course, no confirmation of whether or not the harvester came randomly or you had to do missions vs corpus, digital extremes, the maker, took out the logs from view. long story short, beta is a tag, developers are money grubbers, game is going stale, and i havent seen a single good content addition since i joined. every boss that gets reworked gets turned into someone with an invulnerability stage that can be teabagged 99% of the fight. mixed with glitchy parkour, bad melee, unbalanced frames, and overpriced cash shop, id avoid this game like the plague. if only it wasnt for my clan, id be gone.",7
"im quite surprised at how far along this game has come along. the graphics have gotten better and the gameplay, while repetative, has also gotten better as the beta has gone on. if you enjoyed games like mass effect 3 multiplayer, gears of war horde mode or any other type of game where you and your crew of 4 take on endless waves of baddies in pure co-op awesomeness sprinkled with the loot grind of dungeon crawlers like diablo or torchlight, then you will have a blast with warframe. if had to say one thing in the negative about it, it would be the real world dollar cost on any of their items. luckily everything can be gained in game with some rng luck and time, as well as the in game won from missions currency. all in all a great game, definitely worth checking out. its free! what have you got to lose?",4
"suddenly, a very high quality f2p game. the co-op size, for 4 people, as has long been the actual start, you have to shoot the enemies of the crowd, whether robots or mutants. the game has a great variety of missions. there is a pumping system, with those experiences not only gets the character for whom you play and weapons that you fight. interesting system improvements. the visual part of the game is full of colors and effects. lots of explosions, lots of glowing stuff. all very nice. it should say that the game is not pvp, pve only, can in the future it will be in the game and, well, until .... the battle against hordes of mutants! ps i almost forgot, in the game at first do not understand what they want from you in a mission where to go and who to shoot but eventually everything falls into place. sorry for my english)    f2p .  , 4 ,    ,    ,    .      .  ,      ,         .   .  ,    . ,  .  . ,    , ,       ,,  ....    ! ..   ,     ,        ,             .",1

"initial thoughts: pfffffffffff warframe more like snoreframe oh look at all these things i can never have unless i give the devs $80 and my soul tch wait this game is actually really fun even with the buttlord starting weapons; mag is pimpmaster flex and loki is swagbro supreme beginning thoughts: omg i can electric ninja slide and climb everywhere and slashing makes it even faster i was not expecting to have a robot pal or another sweetass ninja body in the first few days of playing but here i am secondary thoughts: oh dang you can earn basically everything without spending real life monies if youre swag enough also the devs are awesome beardy canadians who do things to make their game awesome and cool last thoughts: [hype intensifies] (warning: above review was written while drunk.)",4
"this game is one of the few free to play games that you can enjoy without spending a single dollar !!",4
"you play as a space ninja who can slice people in half while running very fast. 12/10",1
"want to be a ninja? in space? with a sexy tight suit? then get this game, its free anyway.",1
"the only game were you can play as a magical hammerhead shark space samurai with machineguns who fights aliens and robots with lasers. really, the only things missing from this game are dinosaurs, pirates, and trains.",1
"space ninjas! space ninja weapons, space weapons, and even ninja weapons, lots of killing, parkour acrobatics, fluid controls, exciting and extensive gameplay and devs who know they rely on their players and listen and support them accordingly. most recent example players had been wanting a grappling hook kind of weapon they not only did it but they made a whole new space ninja to play that has that as an ability! and the best part, its still in beta and its already this good! did you click download yet? what are you waiting for? space ninjas!!!!",8
"ive been playing this game nonstop for the past few weeks. its a great game. although i feel that there isnt a lot of story or plot, there is, however, a nice backstory/lore and a unique setting. the game allows you to customize your character (to an extent) and has a large selection of weapons and warframes to suit ones playstyle. in the beginning, the game felt very pay2play; everything i wanted at that point costed platinum(premium currency) and wasnt available until i progressed further and it required (what i assumed to be) heavy grinding. but now, having progressed much further, ive found that most things could be acquired with just time and patience, and the only things that truly required platinum were cosmetics and bundles. and platinum is a tradable currency, so if you really want x that costs y platinum, you could make platinum by trading with other players. but is the game fun? yes, its loads of fun. the gameplay is relatively unique, progression freels rewarding, and it looks great. updates are pulled out quickly, fixes are adminstered hastily. overall, its a very refined game (especially one thats in beta)",6
"i dont really find this game as enjoyable, its extremely repetitive and it is pay-to-win. people just dump a ton of money in to this game just so they can look cool and act cool. its a really big waste of time in my opinion.",1
"absolutely horrible game compounded by horrible development team who has no clue what they are doing and dont need to be in charge of a game and horrible community managers who have no idea how to do their jobs. the fact that i spent money on this game is something i regret deeply.",3
"it was all fun and all when i first started playing this game. however after a couple of hours here and there, i feel like i have lost my passion to like this game. the only thing thats keeping me to play is the aesthetic look and the graphics. everything feels like a grind fest and its just seems so ridiculous you have to wait 12-24 hrs for an item you are building. the only way to get around this is if you use plats to speed up the process. :(",1
"played warframe with a few friends earlier today. we all agreed while its great for a free to play game containing some beautiful graphical work, some interesting game mechanics, and good controller support, it gets tedious very quickly and nothing really makes it stand apart from a failed third-person action game like too human unfortunately. its also quite a tough game to get a grip of as it contains lack of explaination about how certain aspects of upgrading and customising a character work. regardless, id recommend giving it a bash, its a good bit of fun at first but nothing i can see myself playing in the long term and spending money on! :)",1
"this game is a-m-a-z-i-n-g ! i love it ! it has so much customization and surprise ! its not pay 2 win ! really nice campaign and very cool co-op. i recommend this game especically playing with friends. its a must have !",1
"now when you want a action mmo thats intense ,beautiful ,and unique from a third person perspective this is your answer space ninja .......enough said ....xd",1
"warframe is a great game. its a pve where people actually use teamwork! its f2p and almoast all of the items that can be bought with real money can also be crafted by getting in-game resources and credits. the graphics are great, and so is the gameplay! its a really fun game! the devs are great, and actually listen to the players on their forums! if theres a bug, you report it and they fix it in the next update! in short, warframe is a great pve teamwork game. also dont forget: ninjas play free.",3
"pros: +excellent f2p model (the only things you are forced to buy with the premium currency, platium, are purely asethic; everything else can be crafted or traded for with enough patience) +addictive gameplay +good community +lots of weapon and character choices +involved dev team +very pretty graphics for a f2p, and character and enemy designs are quite nice +fun parkour system +balanced difficulty +highly customizable characters in terms of appearance and play-style +multiplayer is some of the best ive seen cons: -the same maps will show up again and again (though the devs are working to avert this) -not all mechanics are fully explained in-game (such as the channeling mechanic for melee weapons) -crafting can take days of actual time (ash warframe: 72 hours), though thankfully it will track time even when you are not logged in overall: one of the abosolute best f2p games on steam, if not one of the better games overall. the game is free, so i highly recommend at least trying it out and deciding for yourself. invite some friends while youre at it.",2
"one of the best free to play game on steam ever.",2
"hello, and welcome i guess to my new review of a game: warframe. okay so my earlier review got a really postive response so yes thank you! :d but now lets start with the warframe review itself. so yeah the game is amazing and it has a lot of things to do in it. missions are not boring but quite the opposite, they are really intresting and acually have sense, i acually played some games in which the missions have no sense with the game or the story. but warframe as i said is amazing and a really good game if youre a super-natural fan or something about ninjas this game is 100% for you :) so yeah that is a wrap of the that... i hope you will like this as you did my earlier review (it was batman a.c.). have a nice day of evening depends on the which part of the day youre reading this.",1
"spending that much time to play this game , did you see me i quit game yet ? third person space ninja, time to make it worth to play",8
"never tired of playing this game. amazing graphics, goog ai and maintenance which is very impressive for a f2p game. hope ive convinced you to at least give it a try, nothing to miss.",6
"ive been a part of this game since the closed beta. ive seen a ton of changes and dont let steam fool you. ive logged in more than 400 hours on this baby right here. you play as a tenno. a master of the warframe armor. the universe is set years and years after dark sector (de confirmed that hayden tenno was indeed the o.g. tenno.) where the tenno are at war with 2 factions: the corpus and the grineer. both of which are at war with each other and the result is an imbalance in the system which the tenno are tasked with balancing. there is a fourth faction, the sentient infected. the technocyte ravaged beings twisted into monsters after years of dividing and acquiring biomass, they pose a threat to everyone in the universe. the game itself has quite a learning curve but the community makes it so easy to learn. there are a ton of events and rare items as well as alert missions that allow you to take certain rare items or platinum items that you could buy in-game with microtransactions but the game allows you to get them for free. you dont need to spend unless you want to. prime frames are the same. (you grind for them to get em for free) i personally spent money into this game and am a founder and have not regretted spending money on this game. it has given me so much fun and joy and i just love being a space ninja. 10/10 easily one of the best games i have ever played.",7
"time played: 104 hours past week: 103 hours ... i vaguely remember that i had a life once....",2
"one of the best f2p games i have played. proud member of the design council.",10
"i castrated a man with a bow and arrow and chopped him into 4 peices with my glowing ninja sword. 10/10 would castrate again",4
"hey everyone! im new here and this is my first game to play. i like this game, i played it just now and i think its a very interesting game. the graphic looks cool, the design of it looks awesome, and i think its about somekind of alien? right? sorry if i get it wrong. since its the first time for me to play games at steam, i was really excited to find this game as my first game to play which is free and it has a cool graphic too. im worry about my computer though because its lagging like hell these days, i hope its nothing. anyway, this is real cool game, you really should try it, and also its free to play.. now im going to play some more :)",1
"this has hot female warframes that gives me raging boners. my favorite is saryn because she has the biggest boobs out of all of them. i really want to motorboat and tit them. oh yeah?",1
"more of a warfarm than a warframe. i have become quite addicted to this free to play game. most things are available in the game with out having to pay cash for it. just requires a bit of farming to get. only things that arent, are warframe slots, weapon slots, and vanity stuff like scarfs and colours. third person 4 player co-op shooter/hack and slash. but of course if you are too lazy to farm stuff up... you can always pay money for new frames and weapons too.",2
"warframe is a free to play game where you can play co-op up to four players or solo if you wish. really great games and a lot of customization for different play styles and it gets updated constantly which is always a good thing. you play as a space ninja wizard with guns, exploring different planets in the solar system, obtaining minerals, blue prints and mods to create your character build and craft new weapons and make new warframes. after playing for 68 hours im still having fun so thats saying something. i still have not explored all the planets yet. overall, i really enjoy the game and love that the game gets updated with new content so frequently.",1

"honestly, this is one of the best video games i have ever played. if you are a fan of mass effect than you will have a great time with this game. everything from the graphics to the market, to the battle mechanics of the game, are all well developed. at first glance, i saw that they provided a tutorial for this game which blew my mind away, usually i have to figure out controls on my own with games, but this game ensured that everyone will know the basic mechanics of the game and how to keep up with the players online.",1
"everything you once knew about this game has changed. back when all of us tried it in beta, this game was only ok. it did get repetitive, and eventually, my wife and i quit. recently, ive come back to what seems to be one of the most expansive changes ever. this game has me completely hooked in so many ways now. base building, pvp, void key missions, new frames, new weapons, etc... everything can be earned with enough patience. no money is needed to be spent. (though it does speed things up quite a bit.)",5
"space: the final frontier. these are the voyages of the starship turbo pecs. its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no tenno has gone before",4
"extremely fun game, good graphics, and a whole lot of things to do. pros +replayability +wide assortment of weapons +very good graphics +smooth controls cons -new weapons that come out are usually a tad overpowered -some very odd framerate issues -lots of bugs but these are usually closer to the bethesda hilarious bugs rather than bugs that ruin your experience yeah, try it out!",3
"very well done. a lot of fun this game provides, really makes you think youre a ninja.",1
"ratting: 8/10 graphix: good gameplay: awesome story: good multiplayer: good customization: amazing this game is really fun and its worth giving a try.this is my favorite free to play game so far. i recommend this game to people who like [3rd person] games.",2
"ive never been a fan of free to play games on steam, mostly because most are pay to win or pay to play (seriously what is going on with all this garbage on steam nowadays?). anywho, warframe is the exact opposite. to be honest, i wouldnt mind buying this game. it is worth it, mostly because of all the things you can do in this game. you can craft weapons, you can attach mods to your weapons, change color, buy weapons, buy warframes and all that with credits. in game items that buy things. developers take notes. the multiplayer is great as well, if a mission is too hard to accomplish call a friend over, it is more fun and easier for you as well. i rate this game a 9/10, if you dont fancy buying games, play this one, it is worth it.",2
"for a free to play game, i honestly didnt have much hope in this. yeah, it had the cliche flashy trailer with great special effects etc etc, but still, we all know how free to play games are. theyre almost always hooked up with that pay-to-win crap that everyone truthfully hates. i must say, after playing this game once with a few of my friends, i was immediately hooked, and still am to this moment enjoying the games graceful fluent and loose gameplay. the mixture of freerunning with combat, very unique weapons, and lovely little original touches, truthfully made the game quite graceful to me. it doesnt over-dramasize everything, but at the same time, it isnt exactly boring. everything is nice, balanced, and even the community is fun. i highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a nice free-to-play experience, and even recommend it to those willing to spend money. with or without putting real life currency into the game itself, doesnt change the joy of playing it in my honest opinion. i joyfully give this game a 9/10.",2
"warframes a game of grinding, grinding to get better weapons, frames and much more. but in the end, the games still in beta. the game is constantly evolving for the better, by adding new game modes, new frames, new weapons and new features. which are sure to keep you busy for a good while.",7
"in my opinion it is the best, i play the game most of the time and this shows space ninjas rule. the fact that the story is straight and forward (save the solar system from evil aliens) the tenno are called to do the job and fight of waves of grineer e.t.c and rescue other tenno to save our solar system. spoiler alert! play the game to find out more and other wounderful content it has like warframes(tenno), weapons, sentinals, pets, dojos (remember tenno are ninja), your very own ship, its insanely awsome. play the game and remember ninja play free.",2
"if you dont own a console to play destiny, then this is the game for you.",1
"best play to win game. you dont need to pay for this game to get any content and it makes a lot of fun",4
"this game has its moments. the graphics and combat are fluid and eye capturing. unfortunately, like many other f2p games it becomes a very tedious grind for anything you need, be it a frame, weapon, or etc. say if youre the lazy type also and you want to purchase platinum (in-game currency) it doesnt help that it is very expensive for how little in return you get. all in all like most other games it has good parts and bad parts. so anyone contemplating it should just give it a whirl and see for yourself.",3
"its like super cocaine, it doesnt kill you but after aweek, you wouldnt know the difference.",5
"at first, i really didnt like this game. i played it back in january of 2014 for a couple hours and felt utterly lost and confused on what was going on. fast forward to two days ago when a member of my clan started playing it out of the blue. once again i reinstalled it and started from where i left my mag warframe. again, i was confused, lost and irritated along with my clansmen. so, rather than give up i turned to the almighty tube and found a small 3 part series of videos that broke it all down really easily and quickly. i can honestly say im pretty hooked now. i really like it. for a free to play its very good for almost everything can be bought or better yet, built with patience, the forge and mats. of course, you could buy them. but im proud to say that i have a rhino warframe chassis currently being built and it will be completed early in the morning. (its like having a new toy in the morning waiting) so im excited, i found a new addiction and am enjoying myself. you might too, its free and ill link the very helpful videos below.",1
"warframe.... warframe you strange beast, youre repetitive, and obnoxious but damn i love you. i love you because the implications in your universe make me want to know how people live in that setting. combat is a bit choppy but well done, f2p is one of the better models (aside from a wait-to-progress gear and a few powerful frames being locked behind absurdly hard-to-unlock-bosses) updates have been both fleshing out the content and the universe, actual languages given to the inhabitants, unique bosses that are less reskins and more something that actually challenges- well, entertains at least. when i left in 2012, warframe was space-ninjas with unique powers fighting nebulous empires with bland-voiced stormtroopers. when i came back, i returned to a four-way galatic war, between a dogmatic corporate religion, a militarist legion of recursive clones, transhuman assassins struggling to retain their humanity, and an infestation so virulent that it makes the former three point their guns at it in unity. there needs to be some frickin books made about this game!",2
"playing this game is a must if you like third person shooters and parkour. its just perfect in everything; the developers are very nice people, the game is completely balanced as a f2p game with real currency(i.e. platinum which you can get for real money or during giveaways). graphics are stunning, gameplay is great, ofcourse there are some bugs. also, theres not a single thing such as if you want to kill everyone in a few seconds, buy this premium status and buy all the op guns that you can only get for real money! unlike in most of the other f2p mmo games. you can get every single weapon that is in the game just by playing! you can suggest things to be added into the game as well(you can do that on their forum). this game is in good hands, therefore it is good itself aswell. i have to tell, i barely ever make reviews, and if i do : its either a perfectly done game or a terrible one. this one was worth the time i spent typing this. :l",2

"i never thought i would be so satisfied with being a space ninja, but warframe brings excellent content, phenominal mechanics, a nice community, smooth graphics and extraordinary gameplay. although, it falls behind with the p2w mechanics and repetive aspect, it is worth the time to become immersed in the games crafting system to suit your needs to become an assassin, a manipulator, a crowd controller or even a class that slices and bursts through a mission. i find this game much more satisfying after playing for about 9 hours, when equipment, ablilities and gameplay clearly improves for your warframe. :d",1

"this game is just so amaizing, the graphics are more than for a f2p game and everything in this game is unlockable so you dont need monay to get everything and this game got combat and stealth styles so choose which one fits you!",9
"its a great game. whoever says its pay to win lies. you dont have to spend any cent on the game, and tbh you can get all the items without spending a single penny. i did and i can do any mission on the game without problems. only problem it has is that the end game might not be that great yet but it has plenty of updates and they care about players opinion and feedback. also the community is great. only drawback is the bugs, but hey is beta and most of the time (over 95% of the time) works fine. it has continous updates and events and also the alert system keeps you always busy. archwing (next patch) looks awesome. this game has great pontential and they wanna be sure to explore it. its an awesome game and its free... hope to meet you there!",7
"warframe was really fun for the first time, and it was pretty addicting for a while. however, once i started constantly grinding i began to lose interest for the game and end up not being interested in it anymore. from the short time ive played i ended up having 2 dreams and other stuff happening due to the tetris effect kicking in so quickly. its addicting as hell for a while, so i recommend it (so long as you dont mind reducing a few grades).",2
"ive spent far too much time and money on this game, so i can say that its one of the best free to play games out there. theyve managed to make it free to play without making it pay to win, so props to digital extremes for that. theres a huge variety of ways to play this game, and there is no single best playstyle. whether you like to stay unseen and pick off your enemies from a safe distance or you just want to get in your enemies faces, whether you like to play co-op or solo, you can do all of it, and all of it very well. its gameplay is an absolute blast. space ninjas are ing awesome. its a bit of a work in progress, and de periodically releases huge updates that greatly improve it. i have few complaints about this game, but it does have flaws. the first one is an almost absolute lack of story. it has a good introduction, but then it just kind of throws you out to a solar system filled with seemingly out-of-place boss battles, some of which just seem a too hastily thrown together. it also has numerous logical fallicies, such as how its always snowing on venus. my last complaint is that its pure grind. you spend the whole game farming resources and leveling up your stuff so you can get better stuff. if youre willing to overlook its flaws, and are willing to accept it as a work in progress, you will have a great time with this game.",4
"optimized for all computers , gamers one or cheaper ,its really good game where we can fight with our friends or alone ,different options for each missions ,stealth or not ,its the best sci-fi game ever . a lot of missions , planets (but some mission are using same maps with some modifications and it still fun ) ,a lot of heroes with specials abilities for each . 10/10 great job",1
"this game is phenominal. if you are looking for an intense online sci-fi third person shooter, youve found it right here! assume the role of a tenno warframe, busting out some ninja parkour moves to get around with a very smooth movement system, craft your own weapons, kill enemies, find mods, use mods to upgrade your weapons, and much much more. i highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an amazing online co-op shooter!",1
"at first i thought that this game would require me to use real money to make it worthwhile...but the more ive played,the more i realise that we dont need to spend any money at all to have fun in this game.i recommend this to everyne who wants to have fun without spending any money:)",5
"warframe is one of the few games out there that really impressed me. with its many places to go and many warframes to play as it definently has diversity with the amount of characters it has along with all the guns and other things you can have. the amount of things you will figure out in this game will amaze but you must realize that this is basically like borderlands or any other tough single player game. i would suggest having a few friends to play with because alone this game is nearly impossible with the massive amount of enemies it sends at you. it could use a little difficulty tweaking but all in all makes up for it by being one of the few games that lets you use parkour as most people call it otherwise known as being able to run on walls and other things like that. all in all an amazing diverse game that makes up for little story by having amazing gameplay mechanics.",5

"this game is here to stay. ive played quite alot of it and i cant wait to see whats comming. i will just start with the negatives - to get them out of the way. the main problem for me is the server situation, the games are user hosted and that creates problem (however a new recent patch promises at least some optimisation, we will see). another problem is the lack of rewards you get from pvping however pvp is yet problematic. few bugs here and there, some will argue its a rollercoster, but i like what i see from the developers, taking care of the game + its issues the best they can and keep adding tons of new things. having said that, warframe is a game like no other out there. the artwork is really inspired and the combinations of warframes, mods, weapons, archwings, gamemodes will keep you intrested for a long time, having thousands of things to do and collect. another huge advantage of this game is the free to play model it uses. you can practically buy/sell/make/trade almost anything, i love the fact that i can spend real money or dont pay a single dime and create what i want with relative ease. i hope warframe keeps heading to the direction it is, and we see more and more stuff in the future!",4

"when you play this game, you will realize that destiny is very similar to warframe.",1
"every enemy has a d1ck texture 11/10 would fap agian",2
"warframe is one of the few games out there that really impressed me. with its many places to go and many warframes to play as it definently has diversity with the amount of characters it has along with all the guns and other things you can have. the amount of things you will figure out in this game will amaze but you must realize that this is basically like borderlands or any other tough single player game. i would suggest having a few friends to play with because alone this game is nearly impossible with the massive amount of enemies it sends at you. it could use a little difficulty tweaking but all in all makes up for it by being one of the few games that lets you use parkour as most people call it otherwise known as being able to run on walls and other things like that. all in all an amazing diverse game that makes up for little story by having amazing gameplay mechanics.",5

"grindy to hell and back but fun if you can get past that check dem booty too",1
"warframe is a very fun game with space guns, space ninjas and space bad guys. oh, and space-badassery. once you start playing its hard to quit, having login rewards really keeps you going, the one drawback is when youre just starting. your weapons dont do much damage anymore, even though theyre maxed damage. but you can use all your hard work to buy blueprints of weapons and build them. the boltor is very good to start with too. this game is very fun with friends and a group of 4 people, with a wide range of game modes and modifications for your warframe and weapons. theres even lots of secrets and lots of hidden lore. i hope people enjoy the game like i have.",3
"this is any extremely addictive game at first itll be hard but once you get the hang of it it becomes a breeze and it becomes fun when a challenge is involved... need any help with this game? i can help you both in-game and out of the game but i prefer you play by yourself for a good amount of missions that way you build up your courage and skills",7
"i must say the game is excellent in almost every way if u enjoy sci-fi action but if u have time to waste as well it wuld be the perfect game for u, i may not have played as long as most but ive realised that this game is just a repetitive masterpiece. u spend hours trying to new equipment only to find that there is even stronger ones coming out later, which of cause u will and want and spend more hours farming to get it, so if u got nothing to do anymore and enjoy sci-fi action i would recommend because i have to admit this is a good game",2
"grind to wait, then wait to grind. thats all you do. apart from that its a great game and it has the best dev team of all time, but they seriously need to cut down on the grinding, its insane.",7
"an amazing game too good to be free to play, this game is too exciting, in a nutshell is more like: aliens - ninjas, sounds weird, but it is a great action game and a great shooter, if you want a unique experience of this kind of games, you have to have it. 10 / 10",1
"this game is phenominal. if you are looking for an intense online sci-fi third person shooter, youve found it right here! assume the role of a tenno warframe, busting out some ninja parkour moves to get around with a very smooth movement system, craft your own weapons, kill enemies, find mods, use mods to upgrade your weapons, and much much more. i highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an amazing online co-op shooter!",1
"at first i thought that this game would require me to use real money to make it worthwhile...but the more ive played,the more i realise that we dont need to spend any money at all to have fun in this game.i recommend this to everyne who wants to have fun without spending any money:)",5
"fun game, lots of stuff to do, but, if you cant handle grinding or working for any ammount of time on things this game is not for you. if you do however join in the fun!",2
"i once wrote a long a$$ review for this. but i dont think thats necessary.. +addicting power play +atmosphere is stunning. +intense gameplay. + (-) gameplay can be repetitive but constant new weapons and characters can change that. (-) instable servers but that might be a temporary issue. - not much cosmetical customisation if f2p - quite a lot of bugs - not many types of enemies",6

"ing leveling up is stupid  dick  piss, kill em with your rifle, *under breath and inaudible* ...but dont walk out to far... whoops now you failed cause you walked out past our invisible no pass line of bad boy youre not allowed, because it obviously has something to do with training your rifle to level up your warframe.  piss . fun game though 8/10 gonna keep playing.",1
"probably one of the best co-op experiences you may have with your friends by beating missions, bosses and kick aliens asses. this game is based on dark sector though in a far far future. new damage 2.0 damage, new warframes (characters), new weapons and missions makes this game much more entertaining with each update. it is still on beta but digital extremes keep making a lot of success with it. so far, personally, i love it.",8
"warframe is the type of game that you can keep coming back to. in the beginning, its grindy but its almost like a good kind of grindy. after playing for about 400 hours i started to get bored, so i took a break from the game for a couple of months. when i came back, so much had been added and improved, it was like a whole new game. digital extremes is an excelent developer and is known for listening to its customers feedback. with the upcoming x1 release, i imagine sinking even more time into this amazingly fun and beautiful looking game.",7
"brilliant game. from the first minute you launch the game you get straight into the in depth tutorial on how to control/use your warframe. its fantastic. the buttons used to do certain things with your warframe just seem so... relevant. in particular, i like the fact that there are multiple planets (ones we know, and ones we have never heard of because the seek extistance) and on each planet, the difficulty basically goes up. for example, you start on mercury which is the easiest and work your way up to.. earth. then there are the small implementations. trading system where you can trade mods for weaponry and also platinum which you can use to purcahse weaponry. i would recommend this to all my friends if i could be bothered. for sure pick it up, of course seeing its free!",4
"love it adictive! feel the ninja within! and enjoy all the looting you can ask for!!!!",3
"a fast paced shooter. lots of maps, weapons, warframes (the armor/body you use) and endless amounts of customization for all of them. high quality graphics, smart a.i. and a excellent cover system with tight target boxes (you must aim at the target to hit it not just near it). parkour around the environment, bounce off the walls dodging bullets to your hearts content, or charge the enemy with guns blazing; however the wall climbing is hard and does require a lot of practice. build everything by finding the blueprints and supplies or spend money and buy them, plus get rewards for improving skills and meeting goals. add mods to your character and equipment to improve their abilities, increasing damage, shields, speed and lots more. want to light the bad-guys on fire (?) or freeze them solid (?) you can. play warframe once and you wont regret it. remember, its free to play!!",8
"warframe, almost 800 playing. my first game since i used steam. played since the first version of the game. iv seeing it evolve to became a better and better game. all i can say is that this game is really fun to play, either solo or with friends (always better with frineds of course). maybe people can get bored if they play alot, but tis is one of this games that u will want to play later on. on my case i never get bored and collecting all weapons and warframes on the games is like a challenge to me that i have to complete. they keep adding new stuff, and biger and better everytime. i see a good future for this game. so i recommend this for the people that like this kind of fps game. and you can wallrun!!!",9
"truly one of a kinda game. really fun to play, especially with friends. love the futuristic design that its going for and the way they made the leveling system.",5
"i have found this game to be very well made...especially for a beta game. graphics are great too!!......when this game first came out it seemed repetative and the more and more updates come out it gets less and less repetative. downside to this game are its costs to buy platinum (real world currency to in game currency).",5
"game said i can get a dog. still doin the same mission over and over again to get the forking egg ;w; and my ship ki is making me mad with saying these eggs are rare .... q_q a lot of different weapons + nice atmosphere + enough randoms to play with + farming for ages >.< +-",1
"amazing game plus it is free making it even better! i highly recommend this game as it is fast paced and be played co-op or competitive. enjoy c:",2
"this game is what its worth. and guess what? its free. 10/10 would buy free games with ugly-ninjas again.",1
"its a succubus in video game form. did i spell that right?",1
"best game i have ever played. so much fun with friends and it is truly free to play. just cosmetic items in the store. everything else you can earn in game. also you can sell items you find for platinum. any fps fan should love this game. please just try it!",10
"boyfriend likes game therefore i am bugged to play game with boyfriend i now like game",2
"basically rips off mass effect 3 multiplayer. everything is a grindwall. lack of end game content lack of competent devs, the coding is so sleek youd think it was a from software game. lack of challenge, game is piss easy once you get a decent weapon. lack of diverse game modes, pretty much just kill everything or, defend lack of actual ninjas save one trandgender edgy teenager bait. why the hell does a beta have a functioning cash shop and premium system? 6/10 would sleek again.",10
"they banned the clan leader of the #1 clan and pretended it was a good idea",1
"warframe is a really beautiful game with interesting gameplay, but after time gets very repetitive. lots of grinding for the items/gear/frames you want, but can be truly rewarding. i love this game, but i wish there was more incentive to complete worlds. i also wish there was a larger variety in mission type, because its basically either assassinate a special dude, kill all the enemies, or defend a cryopod. variety would make this game 10/10. at this point i would still give it a 8/10. again, its ing gorgeous on highest graphic settings. would fap to.",1
"i love the game and it is very fun to play. good job.",5
"warframe is awesome and fun. classes are very cool and their abilities are very nice. if you like parkouring across the map, and killing enemies while in the air, warframe is your game.",3
"definitely worth checking! large variety of weapons and equipment...... i do no regret all the time put in this game.",8
"ran in to a green laser wall and was brutaly shot to death 11/10",2

"similar to dead space type. much awesome such graphics so addicted  wow",1
"i cant open it..i try to start the game but then they say: warframe cant be run on this version of windows; windows xp service pack or later is required . ..a friend of mine use windows 7 and it works on his pc but not on mine..",1
"great gun/blade fps game.. once you get used to it... you will be hooked.",3
"gameplay: pretty good but a little poopy. de sometimes changes the poopy things but not very fast. still enjoyable progression: very snappy compared to most mmos, you can get new things very easily. maxing stuff out in every possible way takes a long time but thats good because you need something to do if you do everything else graphics: very nice, pretty effects, etc. story: you are a space ninja robot man so 10/10 dumb : crafting important things like new warframes (characters) takes days irl, but you can still do other stuff in the mean time and you dont need to be logged in or anything. end game content is pretty poopy. some tilesets get used a bit too much (but they add new ones sometimes, and theyre still much better than going through the exact same dungeon constantly) sometimes the game bugs out but fortunately it wont ruin your session very often and if it does you can just kill yourself and let your team finish the mission for you.",2
"robot ninjas with swords and guns, with powers. whats not to like?",1
"i was expecting a game that was a pure pay to win game but latter found out that you can craft most items that are in the game. it also took me by suprise that you can choose how you wanted to play the game. weather is was to run and gun or to be persice and stealthy, or like me and start out stealthy but once im cought go for the run and gun tactic.",1
"this game is amazing and has alot of key elements which will want you coming back for more. although confusing at first, if you have a friend who knows the game and can help you learn about it, this game is a fantastic game for all who enjoy hash n slash shooters.",1
"i really wish there was a inbetween instead of just yes or no for recommendations. this game is pretty fun but its gated fun. like the game forces new players to grind an amount so large i simply cannot believe anyone can put up with said grind without the game strong arming them into throwing some dollars at it. it would be so much fun if it was more accessible.",1
"great game for friends to play together. its a bit of a grind to collect enough materials to build new weapons and warframes but its well worth the effort once you build them. overall all a great game to play.",2
"smooth shooter/action experience. its a good game for everyone who fond of farming. and actually, there is more farming than in farming simulator.",7
"this game is really a farm fest, but a damn fun one. something about this warframe keeps you coming back for more. highly recommend as it is free to play in the same sense league of legends is.",5
"its a great game for what it is worth... the idea of space ninjas seemed idiotic at the time.... until i started playing..... it is worth the time to play..... parkour, guns, rocket launchers.... who wouldnt love that.",2
"this game is definately a good reccomend for anyone who has the time and the paitience (or money) to progress in it. this game is being constantly updated with new content every week, some small, some game changing, but always progressing, chances are if you played this game earlier in its beta that it is a completely new beast from whatever you lasted tasted - everything has been up for change: the damage system, the melee system, the upgrade system, the ui, the hud, the parkour, individual warframe abilites have all been successful candidates for overhaul and have improved the game. the only major gripe is that the level of content and lack of support can currently make things daunting for newer players to learn. but again, this is something the devs are currently working on to improve. the only issue with how well youll do will depend on how quickly you join and the sooner the better. its a beta, youll run into glitches and hitches, its just how it works, youd be hard pressed to find even fully released titles that dont have bugs, but itd be harder to find a dev team more dedicated to pushing this game forward than the team behind warframe. this game is going places and you should definately consider joining the ride now while you have the chance to get the upper hand as soon as possible. to top it all off, its a game about space ninjas with superpowers, honestly i dont see what else you want.",9
"great developers who listen to the community and are not afraid to give us goodies. very fun combat and huge variety of weapons and frames, i enjoy every minute in warframe.",4
"ive been playing this game since beta about half a year ago and i cant begin to explain how aweosme this game is! its a challenge and a ton of fun. you have to choice to do so much. creating and customizing your warframe has to be the best part just waiting for it to be done is suspenseful. the game says you can be a ninja but in in my view your a god with awesome abliilties depeding on your warframe. each warframe has different abilities it on depends on which one you pick or any warframe bluepring you pick up. this game has changed a ton honestly so much to do you can upgrade your warframe to be more badass and your weapons too. you can even have this little sential that will follow you around kill, heal or hack for you. there really isnt much of story line that i can remember but its a ton of fun! its an online game you can switch the settings so you play with others or just rock out by yourself. no one can kill you but its a ton of fun at times to play with others whp actually know what their doing. this game is worth it all at the end short download and alot of detail and action! download it now you wont regret a thing once you try it and get use to it.",1
"perfect world entertainment buys digital extremes, the developer of warframe. perfect world entertainment. please do not kill warframe. warframe is an amazing game just the way it is. do not change it. do not do anything to it. let digital extremes stay in charge. do not do to warframe what youve done to countless other games. please pwe, i beg of you. let warframe live.",1
"not to reviewing just to says that steam suck balls that it",3
"epic game! love the co-op capanilities and customization options! the fact that you can create your own type of play style is epic!",10
"an awesome f2p game, there were so many bugs when i started playing this, but developers working on this game so hard. its not pay 2 play game like the other f2p games, nearly anything except colors (which u can get from events) can be obtained in game by playing. its combinated fps coop shooting game where you can do climbing, wallrunning, jumping, sliding and much more. there are so many weapons like swords, katanas, scythe, polearms, rifles, bows, crossbow, pistols, grenadelaunchers etc. i recommend to gather some friend and play together because its really nice game with very long gameplay. +gameplay +graphics +its free +great guidance +long gameplay +creativity +great community (not like blaming ppl in dota2, lol, hon etc.) -bugs (of course its still beta) -problems with connection to a friend",3
"this is a great shooting sci-fi game.really i think most players who love space games then this is 1 to play like anyother.",1
"jump, shoot, spells. a third person romp that is best enjoyed in short bursts, for the grind is insanity. a fairly refreshing adventure when it comes to killing vast quantities of things. i actually find the bizzare melty design of everything appealing, asthetic wise!",2
"deja vu simulator 2014. the amount of identical corridors gives a sense of mystery and the decision to keep playing or not. definitely recommended for mental patients of a kind as they can relate to the repetetive and intuitive design.",1
"truly acrobatic ninjas and leveling up system, amazing graphics with directx 11. warframe will truly bring you the atmosphere of gun and run or hack and slash games of all time. come my friends, you must join the war !",5

"its funny becuase ive been playing this since jan highly reccomend it #spaceninjasftw",2
"warframe is a game where youre a robot ninja and you go around with 3 other robot ninjas and prepare to curbstomp the entire enemy opposition because of all the characters unique abilities. this game can also be described as metal gear rising meets halo meets dead space meets borderlands. you got the fast paced robot ninja action ala metal gear, the characters looking like halo and dead space, the infested feel like halo flood and the dead space necromorph, and the 4 player drop in drop out co-op and grinding is like borderlands. of course, the devs where smart when they designed the grinding aspect, as the map has a unique thingy that allows each and every time to be different so you dont get bored of running through the same place a million times to go fight this boss, which is where borderlands failed. the microtransactions are kinda weird though, but nothing too major unless you like to waste money buying items when its easier and cheaper to go find the components, build it, and then rush the item. the action is very fast and flowing, where you could go from jumping in the air shooting at people to sliding into people and insta gibbing them with your melee weapon. its all very fun, and id recommend it for anyone who likes fast paced ninja robot action tl;dr: this game is good get it you as shole.",9
"first i time i heard about it i was like naahhh!! but after i tryed it helll yeah this game rocks xd",1
"this is by far one of the most fun and addicting games ive ever played. the mission layout is fantastic and the warframe seem to develop personalities even though they dont speak, warframe is very well maintained with its awesome staff team making the game fun for everyone. this isnt a pay to win free to play game at all its the opposite, everything you can buy can be crafted or found. i highly recomend this game to anyone wanting a fun free game to play with friends.",1
"its got awesome gameplay and its co-op add me on there my name is lithiumman14 xd",3
"an impressive f2p game that includes squad coop (left4dead, payday: the heist), a set of combat moves and wallrunning (fear, but better), a fun and not so grindy progression system (blueprints, materials, mod-cards - customisable builds), and once you get good enough its pure sex watching your team demolish a room full of enemies, all without even touching the ground :d",1
"just play it i guess... i played it, got stuck. what am i doing with my life? ._.",9
"so let me get this straight: you took ut2k4s invasion mode, added rpg elements, then set that simple, neat package arunnin in a completely frenetic assault mode, put it in the current ut engine... and then released it for free? wow.",1
"excellent game, excellent game play. loads of fun to play with friends or randoms. the huge amount of grinding in this game can get tedious, but the different weapons and frames are loads of fun to collect. the developers are very dedicated to the community and over the course of the game have made improvements of insaine scale. with new things coming out every few weeks, this game will always bring a fresh face to an awesome gameplay style.",6
"beatifully fluent game for those who love space cyborg ninjas.",6
"this isnt a very good representation of astronauts. you cant even go to the moon",1
"when it comes to discussing warframe, i can say a lot of stuff. i can mention a refined game system, which updates even further over time. i can praise the developers, who obviously love the game they create and are fast to bring us the new stuff. i can say that warframe is the first game that attracted me with its unique style. but the thing that i love the most is the setting lore - well, its scattered parts, which are brought with every new update. the lore is by far the most original thing in the game: how about a well mixed coctail made of space adventures, roman and japanese culture? dont forget the feeling of waking up in a cryocapsule and realising that there are very few left of your nation, if any, and everyone else in the universe hates you.",8
"this is the game of 2013 for me. cool action with distinctive weapons and swords, beautiful sets to destroy your foes. theres a dojo where you and your clan can battle in pvp mode, and you can test your own build warframe with others. there are monthly updates that bulk up the game time after time. if you dont play this yet, just download it for free and start pew pewing your way through the galaxy.",8
"its different from all basic games i like it when u play warframe dont forget the break:))",2
"by far the most fun you can have in co-op, with gorram space ninjas and crazy guns. endless fun, with a great community and ongoing updates that constantly expand the scope of the game. and if youre a tight- free2play type, digital extremes have the most fair monetization system ive seen in any f2p game.",8
"this game made me forsake the ease of use console style gaming and return to pc gaming. between the massive variety of things you can do, modify, and customize to suit your exact style of play de made happen. just about everything you could ever hope to get in a premium game, and its absolutely free.",3
"awesome game. nice graphics and a user friendly interface. highly recomended",1
"cool game space ninja wars ftp. like the box said :) make your your way trough the missions modes exterminate, sabotage, defense, capture, interception, excavation and planet boss fights all while building new frames/weapons. u get mod cards to power it along the way. build your self a sentinels robot to cover your back and join u on your quests as of update 14 we got kubrows (wolf bat cat dogs xd) as a battle pet as your companion option. most things (all if u trade items for platinum near end game) in the game are able to be obtained for free though it can be a lot of work. the platinum is priced kind of high but then again the devs need to make a living somehow so get it if u like to support the devs :) and u can always wait on a steam sale or login reward discount. war is a grind but im having a blast while doing it ^^",3
"this game is pretty cool, and its free! ok heres the run-down: you are known as tenno, which look like space ninjas, and your job is to save the galaxy, i believe, its multiplayer still in beta so dont get too angry with the game. but overall its fun and i will be playing it!",3
"farmville the space ninja edition... bring your rakes or bring your wallet.",1

"great visuals and combat especially good to play with some friends 10/10",1
"warframe is among one of the best free to play games you can get...if you can run it. even with my high end gaming laptop it still has lag issues. but besides that its really fun to play. new content and updates/fixes are administered quite frequently and it has gotten more content since i first tried it when it came out. there always seems to be an event going on which makes it more fun to jump in and play. a word of advice...do not go and buy the weapons and warframes. why? because its more fun to gather the ingredients to make them. you can basically make any of the items (weapons, warframes and sentinels) with blueprints...if they arent on the market youll eventually collect them. if you always wanted to know what it feels like to be a parkour ninja...this game is perfect. otherwise...its definitely worth a try anyway!",1
"main purpose of game is to trade,craft, and play basically. may be boring at times though.",2
"do you love shooting them sumbucks? do you love magical powers? do you love grinding your life of for rewards? then this game is perfect for you. warframe is without a doubt an awesome game, constant updates, a space themed fps with magical powers to melt the faces of your enemies, very fast paced action, its dynamic and you can parkour the entire level. youre never gonna be without a thing to do, but because of this we can talk about the only downside of the game, which for some others, like myself, arent that bad of a negative point, im talking about the overgrind to get stuff like specific mods to upgrade your weapons, weapon parts and warframe parts. this game isnt difficult at all, the early phase is just fine to play without a sweat, and much more fun with friends, but you might reconsider if youre not in the mood to grind when you reach that near mid-game, but it is worth when you two-shot that freaking boss who killed you a bunch of times when you get more levels and better gear.",6
"this game is amazing , i played this all the time ... it has fancy graphics and a lot of cool looking weapons",3
"1.) youre a ninja...in space. 2.) you have access to potential overkill weapons and abilities that you can upgrade any way you want. 3.) you basically become an unknown hero by saving the galaxy without a soul truly knowing. 4.) nothing is ever truly the same time, going though the same area multiple times will show different maps and enemy layouts, so each time in a mission you have to think on your toes. 5.) why are you still reading this and not in-game right now?",2
"badass 3rd person game. if u like crafting game/farming game u would like this.",3
"applause is in order for the developers for creating such a truly amazing game. it may be quite repetitive, but compared to a game like call of duty or counter strike, warframe is not that repettitive. the game may be a grindfest, but all shooters are in some way a grindfest, and most have minimal customization. call of duty is nowhere near the customizational level, and counter strike is static uncustomizable to the max. and who wouldnt want to be a freaking space ninja? however this game is highly... well... beta... glitchy... and all out hillarious or annoying when it does. im in love with this game. when you look in the platinum store and you see a weapon that is 150+ platinum, its simply the developers way of saying, here, be lazy if you want, but itll cost you buddy! there is no way that i can express the fun ive had on this game because the game itself is ever changing and ever updating, and best of all... forever free. this game without a doubt has my seal of approval. i the leader of boxes everywhere am proud to give this game a 10/10! (and a 50/10 in betaness)",10
"you are supposedly a space ninja but the fact that stealth is optional and using high explosives and wide area explding skills is a way of life you think the game might loose some points. guess again ! :d",10
"it is fun, but on the other hand it is confusing for me (personally)",1
"you sir! yes you! do you enjoy 3rd person games? do you enjoy shooting games? how about games with swords? and what about games with wall running, sliding, flipping, air kicks and all other ninja moves, you enjoy those aswell? do you like your games with a easy multiplayer setup and amazing clan function with a working meeting hall (dojo) and everything? well then, my good sir, this game is for you! there is, however, a heavy p2w factor involved that will have you easily spending a couple of bucks a few hours into the game if youre the kinda guy that doesnt like working for his stuff. there is a supreme lack in any story in this game but the devs seem to be trying to patch that up with many new quest releases. speaking of devs, here we have a development crew that are actually in touch with their community actually listen to them. which is refreshing in the modern society of false promises and poor delivery in gaming today. all in all, great game, i havent paid for a single thing yet and im having a blast so the p2w doesnt bother me that much. its got solid game play and is seriously pretty. did i mention they added moustaches?",2
"been playing this game for a long time (the hours in my steam didnt sync with my warframe account idk why), and its so much fun along with the community itself. well this game is a grinding game which forces you to play missions over and over and over again, but its so addictive. the most fun part is building your warframe/weapons until it overpowered (or op), putting the right mods and stuffs. theres so much memories in this game even i cant remember them all lol. game score? for a co-op f2p i give it 7 out of 10.",7
"applause is in order for the developers for creating such a truly amazing game. it may be quite repetitive, but compared to a game like call of duty or counter strike, warframe is not that repettitive. the game may be a grindfest, but all shooters are in some way a grindfest, and most have minimal customization. call of duty is nowhere near the customizational level, and counter strike is static uncustomizable to the max. and who wouldnt want to be a freaking space ninja? however this game is highly... well... beta... glitchy... and all out hillarious or annoying when it does. im in love with this game. when you look in the platinum store and you see a weapon that is 150+ platinum, its simply the developers way of saying, here, be lazy if you want, but itll cost you buddy! there is no way that i can express the fun ive had on this game because the game itself is ever changing and ever updating, and best of all... forever free. this game without a doubt has my seal of approval. i the leader of boxes everywhere am proud to give this game a 10/10! (and a 50/10 in betaness)",10
"you are supposedly a space ninja but the fact that stealth is optional and using high explosives and wide area explding skills is a way of life you think the game might loose some points. guess again ! :d",10
"it is fun, but on the other hand it is confusing for me (personally)",1
"great game with lots of variety :) defenitely cannot miss it!!!",4
"fun gameplay but absolutely stupid pricing. grinding is fun if you like that kind of thing and all gameplay-changing things are able to get free with ingame currency.",4
"easily best game f2p best game. nuff said. best game berst gaem.!!! ermagerhd",2
"do you love shooting them sumbucks? do you love magical powers? do you love grinding your life of for rewards? then this game is perfect for you. warframe is without a doubt an awesome game, constant updates, a space themed fps with magical powers to melt the faces of your enemies, very fast paced action, its dynamic and you can parkour the entire level. youre never gonna be without a thing to do, but because of this we can talk about the only downside of the game, which for some others, like myself, arent that bad of a negative point, im talking about the overgrind to get stuff like specific mods to upgrade your weapons, weapon parts and warframe parts. this game isnt difficult at all, the early phase is just fine to play without a sweat, and much more fun with friends, but you might reconsider if youre not in the mood to grind when you reach that near mid-game, but it is worth when you two-shot that freaking boss who killed you a bunch of times when you get more levels and better gear.",6
"this game is amazing , i played this all the time ... it has fancy graphics and a lot of cool looking weapons",3
"1.) youre a ninja...in space. 2.) you have access to potential overkill weapons and abilities that you can upgrade any way you want. 3.) you basically become an unknown hero by saving the galaxy without a soul truly knowing. 4.) nothing is ever truly the same time, going though the same area multiple times will show different maps and enemy layouts, so each time in a mission you have to think on your toes. 5.) why are you still reading this and not in-game right now?",2
"badass 3rd person game. if u like crafting game/farming game u would like this.",3
"its a great game for what it is worth... the idea of space ninjas seemed idiotic at the time.... until i started playing..... it is worth the time to play..... parkour, guns, rocket launchers.... who wouldnt love that.",2
"this game is definately a good reccomend for anyone who has the time and the paitience (or money) to progress in it. this game is being constantly updated with new content every week, some small, some game changing, but always progressing, chances are if you played this game earlier in its beta that it is a completely new beast from whatever you lasted tasted - everything has been up for change: the damage system, the melee system, the upgrade system, the ui, the hud, the parkour, individual warframe abilites have all been successful candidates for overhaul and have improved the game. the only major gripe is that the level of content and lack of support can currently make things daunting for newer players to learn. but again, this is something the devs are currently working on to improve. the only issue with how well youll do will depend on how quickly you join and the sooner the better. its a beta, youll run into glitches and hitches, its just how it works, youd be hard pressed to find even fully released titles that dont have bugs, but itd be harder to find a dev team more dedicated to pushing this game forward than the team behind warframe. this game is going places and you should definately consider joining the ride now while you have the chance to get the upper hand as soon as possible. to top it all off, its a game about space ninjas with superpowers, honestly i dont see what else you want.",9
"warframe is a really beautiful game with interesting gameplay, but after time gets very repetitive. lots of grinding for the items/gear/frames you want, but can be truly rewarding. i love this game, but i wish there was more incentive to complete worlds. i also wish there was a larger variety in mission type, because its basically either assassinate a special dude, kill all the enemies, or defend a cryopod. variety would make this game 10/10. at this point i would still give it a 8/10. again, its ing gorgeous on highest graphic settings. would fap to.",1
"similar to dead space type. much awesome such graphics so addicted  wow",1
"i cant open it..i try to start the game but then they say: warframe cant be run on this version of windows; windows xp service pack or later is required . ..a friend of mine use windows 7 and it works on his pc but not on mine..",1
"great gun/blade fps game.. once you get used to it... you will be hooked.",3
"gameplay: pretty good but a little poopy. de sometimes changes the poopy things but not very fast. still enjoyable progression: very snappy compared to most mmos, you can get new things very easily. maxing stuff out in every possible way takes a long time but thats good because you need something to do if you do everything else graphics: very nice, pretty effects, etc. story: you are a space ninja robot man so 10/10 dumb : crafting important things like new warframes (characters) takes days irl, but you can still do other stuff in the mean time and you dont need to be logged in or anything. end game content is pretty poopy. some tilesets get used a bit too much (but they add new ones sometimes, and theyre still much better than going through the exact same dungeon constantly) sometimes the game bugs out but fortunately it wont ruin your session very often and if it does you can just kill yourself and let your team finish the mission for you.",2
"deja vu simulator 2014. the amount of identical corridors gives a sense of mystery and the decision to keep playing or not. definitely recommended for mental patients of a kind as they can relate to the repetetive and intuitive design.",1
"recommend this game, new interesting stuff comes out every update, so you have that going. but the maps can get a bit repetitive sometimes, and if it does, go to a new planet!",3
"warframe was a very good surprise, i used to play on the earlier stages of the game and it was a very good concept with great graphics but there wasnt much content at that time, so i took a break from it, but when i return i found a great f2p game with a lot of content and replayablity. the graphics are awesome, the looting, the teaming up with your clan/friends, you will get hooked once you understand the basics and then you want more and better. the only negative is the connection problems related to the strict nat issue, but im sure they will fix that and add even more content to the game. 4,6/5.",1
"this game is all around fun. its not pay to win, just pay to sweag. everything thats in the store can be found and built in-game. you can either play solo or with friends. (playing with friends in this game doesnt slow you down, it actually speeds things up.) and best thing is, youre a space ninja with guns. fighting against eveeeiiillll. its a definite get. i mean if it wasnt, then why is is so popular and on ps4? get in this and fight for the lotus, tenno!",2

"it was okay, but it gets repetitive after just a few missions.",1
"a very cool game indeed. i did not want to play this game at first thinking that it would not be very fun because the game is a free-to-play game. however the gameplay is great and very action-packed. i really wish this game had more of a storyline, because there is allot that the creators of this game could do with a single player or co-op campaign. other than very little story line, if you like game with allot of action and killing hoards after hoards of monsters while you play as a tenno in the field to save the universe!",4
"ive been playing this game since beta about half a year ago and i cant begin to explain how aweosme this game is! its a challenge and a ton of fun. you have to choice to do so much. creating and customizing your warframe has to be the best part just waiting for it to be done is suspenseful. the game says you can be a ninja but in in my view your a god with awesome abliilties depeding on your warframe. each warframe has different abilities it on depends on which one you pick or any warframe bluepring you pick up. this game has changed a ton honestly so much to do you can upgrade your warframe to be more badass and your weapons too. you can even have this little sential that will follow you around kill, heal or hack for you. there really isnt much of story line that i can remember but its a ton of fun! its an online game you can switch the settings so you play with others or just rock out by yourself. no one can kill you but its a ton of fun at times to play with others whp actually know what their doing. this game is worth it all at the end short download and alot of detail and action! download it now you wont regret a thing once you try it and get use to it.",1
"this game is so impressive, especially for a free-to-play game. im so invested, ive spent hours just trying to get it to work. cant wait to get to the title screen, its been hyped so much!",1
"with smooth animation and semi-simple controls, warframe is on the right path. the graphics are pretty good, enough to run fluently. gameplay can be a little difficult, with no real levels to train. it pushes you right into the game, and does a good job of explaining the controls for the most part. some bugs may occur but its on its way. the sounds in the game are well done, an atmosphere that really pulls the player into the game. gameplay may be a little intense. all in all, warframe is a fairly good game, but it could use some improvements. 7/10",2
"warframe is a superb free to play game that you will be able to pump endless hours into. i downloaded it and instantly fell in love. this is by far the best free to play i have ever experienced.",3
"its fun. there have been a few changes that im not fond of, but adapt and overcome, and its really really really fun with a group of friends.",5
"a really good fremium game. have really enjoyed the space ninja style game play with differeing level difficultly and the ability to create new warframes from just playing rather than spending is a real positive. lagging is sometimes an issue with this game, but happy to take that as an issue in beta. would recommend to anyone.",4
"so much details put into this game with so many lvls and bosses. so much stuff you can build with resources you find in missions. this game sure is amazing :d 10/10",8

"amazing game da best 3rd person shooter out there..awesome blend of crysis 3 and uncharted 3 multiplied by a million times..i have never loved griding more than this 20/10",1
"first off, this game is free, so you should just check it out right now. okay, with that out of the way, i love this game so much. if you are here for some of the best 3rd person combat (shooting & melee), solid co-op multiplayer, a fantastic leveling/upgrading system that really allows for some personal custimaztion based on your playstyle, and very (very) pretty graphics in an engine that runs incredibly well, then you are here for the right reasons. my biggest issue with the game used to be the lack of variety in environments, but that is no longer a problem. from when i started playing the game in closed beta, there are now 3-4 times as many areas. with the different mods in each area (now twice as many modes) and the randomly generated maps (as in the style of diablo ii & iii), environments are very varied. of course, with it a f2p game, youre likely skeptical about whether or not it is pay2win or not. while it isnt as fair of a model as loadout or path of exile, it is probably the best model out there. i logged around 200 hours before ever spending money and i only used that money to buy weapon slots and visual upgrades seeing as how its so much fun to actually earn weapons and frames in this game. i would say this game is 1 part mass effect 3s multiplayer, 1 part left4dead, and 1 part prince of persia/mirrors edge. if that sounds like a great time to you (i hope it does), then start downloading. again, it is free and also the game is a pretty darn small file size. 5/5",9
"even though i dont understand this game fully yet, its super fun with a friend or two......but this game gets to me because you have to pay for these in-game currency silvers to get some of the weapons and stuff. i could be wrong, but ovoerall good game!",1
"been playin this game for a couple months now got into the closed beta and grabbed a masters founders package, probably the best co-op shooter/hack n slash ive played in years",10
"this game has eaten more hours of my time for a free to play than even team fortress 2. i could write volumes about the merrits of this game, but alas there isnt room enough in this window. all i can really say is that this game is expansive, immersive, and addicting. 10/10, i will keep playing this and would recommend this to even the most casual gamer.",3
"i figured i ought to review this dynasty space ninjas of hellgate london. its pretty good! for what you get at any rate. ive spent about twenty dollars into this game by now and i can honestly say i dont feel like its been wasted time! its a pretty grand game all things considered, its simple, easy to get into, and the controls dont usually make me feel like a blind man groping for spilled change. at any rate, its grindy, boring at times, but its worth the occasional jump into for a purely cooperative experience. dont you miss that? when games were purely co-op, or had a co-op focus? i miss that. what a shame.",3

"warframes concept, when presented to the normal person, would seem unusual or unappealing. this can be forgiven since the concept is space ninjas on a solar mission of fighting giant brutes and strange merchantmen whilst holding back the invading forces of a mysterious infestation. yet this game has proven to be hundreds of hours of fun for myself and my friends who would play it. the ability to go through a procedurally generated map while shooting grineer platoons in a defense or slashing apart an infested swarm in a survival mission has produced unlimited amounts of fun. the game gives the player an ultimate suit of armor which grants them unimaginable power as they run, jump, slide, kick, shoot, grapple, punch, stab, and slash at enemies who give the player an actual challenge. the content is even more extrordinary as it is updated very often and is largely influenced by the community. thus every player has a direct voice in what they want the developers to put in next. thus for a game overflowing with action, adventure, community, and a sheer uniqueness not commonly found in the typical selection of modern games, warframe should definitely be on the consumers list! did i also mention that it is free?",6

"if you and your mates want some fast paced co-op action, tons of loadout options, lots of character options, smooth gameplay, great visuals, customizations up the wazoo. here is your ticket for all that entertainment! this ever-expanding 3rd person shooter can provide countless hours of carnage, and a sick collection of characters and weapons that can be upgraded and modified to suit your gameplay styles. solo is good.. co-op is fantastic! id like to see more developers take a page from this book in regards to making co-op more exciting. the pvp in the game could use a little work and expansion (fort captures and capture the flag). the biggest critisisms i could offer are that this game could use more and bigger boss battles. and a little bit of ai improvements on various enemies. throw in a few more types of battle formats.. (like arena fights for instance) maybe a little vehicle warfare... (space ninjas on hoverbikes would be the bees knees).. the current maps that are playable in the game make for good instances but a more open world approach would help bring more gamers to the scene without question.",8
"played it a bit. somewhat enjoyable. only play on a good connection.",5
"very in depth f2p game. feels like a high speed version of mass effect 3 multiplayer with map exploration. the story is not very well developed however you have a general idea what the plot line is. what really shines is the game play, gun action, sword action, and character/player actions are all really nice. the graphics look very good, smooth framerate, and i havent spent a single dime to play this game. without spending a single dollar you have access to 10+ characters and well over 75+ different weapons, just need the components provided by missions to build them all. i would recommend everyone give it a few hours of your time, it is a fun and expansive game now and will only get better as more updates/content keep getting added.",6
"came because of katana stayed because of dark spaceships",1
"great game. many hours of fun are to be had. ranking is a bit of a chore for some things but the boosters which, in the market say 80 plat, can be purchasable for 40 plat for 3 days, which is actually -very- worth it. game can be a bit buggy sometimes, especially when a new numbered update comes out (14.0, 15.0 etc) but they get ironed out. plus, if youre an unreal tournament fan, digital extremes helped creating those games and put some easter eggs in the game, like the bio rifle (stug,) ripper (miter,) flak cannon (drakgoon)",3
"to kill time, 10/10 would play. its only fun if you play with friends you trust and know. but if youre tolerant to others, thats fine as well. solos also good but happiness would always be short-lived in this game. also a good game to screw around~",8
"this game brings many new ideas and exciting, co-op play extremely interesting,",5
"i find warframe very fun and even though you can buy weapons and tennos with the use of real cash, you can still play the game using default weapons but i hate the limit of colours for customizing your character. past that i do find the game very enjoyable and if your pc can handle high graphical settings then switch it to high its a beautiful looking game",1

"absolutely fantastic. the game plays smoothly, and the combat dynamics are flawless. the customisation options, which i should note are practically limitless, give you a really personal feel. your avatar is, well, you. this game is free, and though i dont really want any of the dlc im gonna get one anyway just to support the devs, simply because such a brilliant games deserves to have some coin thrown at it. this games a real hidden gem.",1

"warframe is a great co-operative game. with many gamemodes, difficulties, customization, warframes and weapons, it doesnt bore me at all. however, it is very grindy and repetitive, and so it may bore some players. *cough* casuals *cough*. overall the game looks great, runs smoothly and is a ton of fun. get it. its free!",7

"warframe a really great third person shooter game. developers are always providing with new content and regular updates. the community of this game can be said to be very large compared to other free to play games that are availabe through steam. can be enjpyed solo but of course playing with friends and messing around is always a lot of fun. this is not a pay to win kinda free to play game. purcahsable currency is an option, everything in the game is obtainable by all players with the in game currency. however, grinding would be a thing in the game. if you enjoy a hack and slash game this would be one of it.",4
"yes i do own warframe and i am ashamed to admit it!",1
"it may have repitive gameplay elements its still fun to play especially with friends. it may have pay to win elements, but you can still be the very best with out paying though it may take longer. overall its a game to give it a try if you got no other mmo shooter to play. another thing you are a ninja. 10/10",1
"wow that just a cool game :d i am recommned to all play that fun game play like aline and kill other alines cool and epic do mission upgrade your rank,trade,change warframe, duel whit firends and change spaceship skin :3 warframe had a good update so download it and play it whit your firneds its becomes to be more fun then the past. and what more i can to say just play on it xd",1

"there is one arguement that will be put up to this game; pay2win. i will say right now that it is not. while there are microntransactions, everything that contributes to actual gameplay can be acquired through playing the game. there is grind in this game. putting that out there now because there are people who absolutely despise it. i for one do not have a problem with it. to be perfectly honest, there is alot of grind. the good thing is that the gameplay is just so much fun that it is actually enjoyable to play missions and its not just dull shooting ground after dull shooting ground. looking at you call of duty. one kinda big problem i have with it is the inventory. to get more inventory slots you have to pay with platinum, the microtransaction currency. this causes problems with having weapons and warframes that you like and not having enough room to store them. the trading system slightly fixes that problem with being able to trade players for weapon parts, mods, and warframe parts, as well as platinum. if you are playing the game and find a really valuable mod, you can go to the trading tab and trade with players for it by putting up offers and looking if anyone wants something you might have. in summary this is a slightly flawed, but really enjoyable game if you dont mind grind and some waiting for things to happen. (to be honest what game isnt somewhat flawed?)",8
"amazing game. very addicting if you dont mind waiting a bit for good items.",8
"the best way to describe warframe, would be space-gun-fighting-ninjas with over 20+ playable chericters, hundreds of weapons, and countless coustomizatations for both. warframe is a perfect alternative to the standard gungame. not to mentation all the team baised play that takes place in the game.",8

"one of the greatest free to play shooter games grinding is a big part of the game but if it wasnt their would only be maybe 200-275 hours of gameplay and it would be over altho its not as bad as grinding in say planet side 2 where it takes months upon months of playing to get your first new weapon also you can get ever item that has an actual use ingame with just credits earned ingame plus if they didnt make people want to use real money to buy stuff they wouldnt make a profit to advance the game and keep making cool updates and you cant forget ur a freaking space ninja on the brink of extiction doesnt get much better than that",10

"too many times i have approached a game and found that the stress on pvp is over done and there is no way to play with the same feel and not have to worry about long term players or bots. warframe changed all this for me. a shooter game with more than one twist i fell in love almost immediately. the lore is limited (they are building on it as we speak, its in an exciting phase) and it does look pay to win... on the surface. it is not. the crafting is a secondary feature of this game. its a something to do with the parts and the materials you gain. ive lost count of the number of frames ive stumbled over the resources for and the amount of weapons ive crafted because they look like a bit of fun. if you think the focus of the game is to be completionist and own all the things... then youve missed the point. the point is to play, and play you can. warframe runs you through an ever increasing series of different mission types from the need to stealth missions to succeed, to defense, attack and outright destruction. they listen to their fanbase and the game grows through the love from the fans and the developers. winner of mmobombs mmo of the year (2014) something has to be going right here. for those that love the thrill of the fight, to fantasise on their own lore as the game develops and to watch an already fabulous beta blossom into greater things, this is the game for you. grab your rifle and your sword and get to killing things.",5
"this is awesome game for those player who want to play some space third person shooter by yourself or with friends. also it is really cool how game is constantly being updated. there are a lot of costumization and playability in warframe. recommended",6
"in the past, when i first tried this game, it was awful. each level was long, difficult and had very little variety. it was so mind-numbingly boring that warframe became difficult to play. each level was the same layout with a slightly different skin on it. one would play a level, and the next level would be the exact same thing but with ice! ohhh! exciting! except it wasnt at all... since then, warframe has improved a tremendous amount, and is legitimately rather fun to play. finding new areas and little hidden sections while exploring a map is fun, and often results in some (more or less) useful resources. the flow of the game is alot smoother, and enemies do not indefinitely respawn, which made the game much harder before. ive had some pretty great times with warframe and its much better than it once was. though the copy and paste level layouts are still the same, it doesnt feel as empty and dull as it did in the past. two comments that i must make however, is the amount of time it takes to gather resources needed to advance in strength and level; and playing with a controller. the controller layout is absolutely horrid, and you must redo it all and test with it before you can find something that works. the sensitivity is way too high, and the button layout is simply difficult and hard to understand. overall, i give this game a 7/10. its a good game, but players that dont like alot of grinding, and hate some repentition will quickly get bored of it.",1

"warframe. it is most definately one of the best -free- multiplayer third person shooters i have ever had the honor to play. i would honestly reccomend this game above many triple a titles. the game itself has a decisive and interesting backstory. many playable warframes with unique and interesting mechanics that give your specific choice meaning in a varity of mission settings. also perhaps one of the most important features. its a constantly evolving game, new missions and interesting additions are being added in -monthly- giving this amazing game a ever-changing face and the fact youll be supported by three additional tenno three other players all working towards the same goal, means the missions the people and the very game itself is ever changing depending on the people you join with! ... it also has some interesting end-game content that relies far more on teamwork and less on pure shooting and running off on your own this can make it it even more complex and interesting later game. so remember folks, gun or blade are not a tennos best friend, trust in your warframe. but even more. trust in your allies.. i am the lotus, i will guide you but we must hurry. vor is coming for you. i see the cryo-sleep has taken your memory, it doesnt matter. you are tenno. i will prepare you...",4

"often described as a pay to win game. i found that not to be the case. warframe is a third person shooter that is easy to pick up and rewards players who put time and effort into the game. the initial learning curve is set quite high, but can be made easier with help from the rather polite online community. missions can seem repetitive at times, but the constant addition of new content and game mechanics make warframe always feel fresh. being still only in beta, there are a few minor bugs that stop it from being one of the top free to play games around. these issues however, hardly detract from the game itself and are only noticible because the rest of the game feels so polished. overall, warframe is a genuinely good game that has a lot of things going for it. i look forward to the developers live release and whatever additional changes accompany it.",2
"very fun game. for a free 2 play game, it is my favourite there is. basically it is ninjas in space, but it is a good concept. no story, but it does have a rich lore. why yu no have warframe huh huh huh? got warframe. do it for the shibes doge translation: such wow, such space, so violent, very ninja, such fun.",1

"i recommend you guys to buy this game its just amazing full of violence nijas tps and powers",1
"all i can say about this one is that i am shocked that a game like this one is free to play actually; i can really see myself spending money on this game! however, like any free to play game, it is packed full of micro transactions, making it so you can buy the things you want. however, this game seems more generous in that aspect, you can either buy it with real money, or you can keep playing and earn credits in the game to aquire the same things that people would buy with their own cash. the graphics in this game are top notch as well as the overall gameplay. the game has been built so you can experience this game alone or with your friends and random people online who would wish to accompany you on your quests. this game is very much worth looking into if you are in anyway intrested in a futuristic cenario which takes place in space. the game on top of looking good also seems like it is willing to offer a lot of gameplay, both through many planets and objectives through the solar system as well as replayability to either find resources to rebuild your character or just replaying a map as a newly built character. it seems you can build your character to either be a spectre in the shadows, taking enemies out without anyone knowing you were even in the area; or a blood lusting banshee, screaming through and leaving death in your wake. however, if this was too long; one word to sum this game up really, space ninjas. go play it.",7

"so far i have really like this game. the game play and the customizabilty are awesome. as of right now, the only constructive critizism i have is that when you are in front of an enemy, plainly in thier line of site, they dont see you if you are outside of a 5 meter radius roughly. so the only thing i would change to make it more realistic would change that enemys will engage once you are in thier line of site within a reasonable distance.",2
"very fun and addicting.. you want to get the best items in the game. one down side is that you can pay for items.. so people with tons of money can easily get items some people will work hard for.",6
"absolutely brilliant! this game is amazing with awesome gameplay and great mechanics! also all the weapons and characters that you can buy for real money are also obtainable by gathering resources for the item and crafting it. this makes the the game far from pay to win which i absolutely love. the only real major problem i have with the game is that you can quite often get a very bad host and that makes the game unplayable. but leaving and rejoining that mission fixes it if you get a better host or host yourself. but all in all its a great game with a lot of potential and its growing quite fast! its absolutely worth a try because you get a really great game for no money! thats amazing!! :3",3

"how can i put this into words... if you took the multiplayer co-op from mass effect 3, then gave them three extra years to produce and tune it into a full-fledged multiplayer experience; then, you take that game and force feed it piles of amphetamine and hallucenogenic substances. in its drunken, ball-tripping state, you then force breed said game with ninja gaiden. the resulting spawn from this unholy union of games is: warframe. tripped-out, beautiful, intense, challenging, strategic, with incredibly well-developed depth, and... fun. really one of the greatest all-around co-op experiences ive found. cant recommend this one enough to anyone ive ever gamed with. if i had to balance this review with one caveat, it would be that the game is only marginally free-to-play. new players are going to be at a severe disadvantage if theyre unwilling to drop a bit of cash on it. this doesnt bother me in the least; im of the generation that doesnt mind paying someone for their efforts. especially when the final product is this great. let me put it this way: ive put a lot more money into much less deserving titles, with much less value to show for it. thats all for now. do yourselves a favor and check this one out. tl;dr download warfame",6

"as a veteran with 1100 hours of playing this game, i simply dont recommend this. this is nothing but a grindfest and the devs have repeatedly acknowledged about this but nothing has changed to lessen the grind. every time they say that they are working on reducing grind, they put in another grindwall which always bigger than the previous one. here is a quote from a veteran who had already quited the game just like me:",10
"i gotta say when i saw this game, at first i was hesitant. but now that i have tried it out, oh my god i was missing out. this game is really fun. but to me, its one of those games that is fun in short sessions. playing this too long will make this get boring really quick. but in short sessions with friends is alot of fun especially with thor :3 i am a noob at this game for now. but i will get better :3 10/10",1

"this game is basically about grinding for new cool stuff. there is not much motivation to make you complete missions other than to level up, and grind your gears. the events are pretty fun, since then there is stuff to do, like... a quest or a good mission. other than that, this game falls flat. not because of the bugs or glitches, but because of the lack of entertaintment, unless you liek grinding alot for stuff and look cool.",4

"this game is one of the largest wastes of time you could invest in. despite the fact that the sci-fi elements are intriguing, and promise a feeling of exploration and satisfaction, it satiates neither thirst. the game instead reduces the player to hacking and slashing, or firing guns blazing at hordes of faceless and uninspired 3d models, that dont deserve the title of enemy. they run and shoot towards you blindly, almost as blindly as you attack them, to an insignificant goal. your rewards are next to none, assuming you dont invest over 150 hours a week (in which case this game may satisfy your urge for bland weaponry). if you so desire either weapons or new warframe suits, then you must resort to dedicating your career to this abomination or you must purchase the over-priced platinum currency. for only $15 usd this single weapon could be yours! is a paraphrase of their stores radio jingle. if you desire a pitfall in your life, then by all means sacrifice your wife and childs well-being to grind for that new warframe suit, but if not, dont subject yourself to the boredom and microtransactions.",1

"ok, pros: fast paced shooting mechanics, decent sword mechanics. good mobility, customization not that good but workable. teamwork, can still play solo however. and a stealth and free-run mechanic. nvidia graphics and physics! cons: you will never get into pvp becuase of your inventory ### doesnt meet the requirements. unfair, if not almost cheating ai. cash store always dangled in front of your face. when the game adds a new playable warframe, it feels like you must pay. in order to play it. feels unrewarding. buggy beyond beleif, but thats because its an mmo. near impossible to join a guild/clan. notorius time waster. lotus voice. overall: i enjoyed this game for a few days, but between drm, lack of commmunication with other players, and cash store ads. i reached my pain; enjoyment thresh hold. it just seems like a time waster, and you never feel like you accomplish anything, unless you sink in $$$ of course. if you need to waste a few hours go ahead, but it just felt to as if there was no point to doing all of the same repeating missions over and over again. its up to you.",1
"this game is filled with ups and down but over all the gme is very good in all the aspects of the fight and firefights i verymuch enjoy this game and will being playing this game until my eyes bleed but i dont think i will let it get to that point althought i cant make any promises so if your thinking about playing/downloading this game do it is seriously awesome and i recommend it to everyone i know!!",3
"i would recommend this game to people who are used to the diablo style of grinding, as well as have a group of friends to play along with. this game can get very tiresome fast unless you form a clan or join one and do missions with your clan mates. pvp is also not were it should be, it has a lot of balancing to do but has a ton of potential.",1

"set in the far reaches of outer space during a new dark age, warframe introduces the tenno, a race on the brink of extinction after being enslaved by the grineer for centuries. players enter warframe on the cusp of the grineers victory over the tenno until they begin to arm themselves with warframes - an ancient exo-skeletal technology only they can operate. hidden within the orokin derelicts of a lost civilization, new warframes lie dormant and undiscovered. these artifacts are the tennos only hope for survival. with the lack of a pay to win system and easy engagement for new players, warframe offers some quality time. as a free-to-play game, warframe is a nice surprise that sets the base for a promising future. warframe isnt anything special. its not revolutionary, exceptional or timeless. still - every time i returned to the game, it kept playing for at least an hour (without regret). digital extremes has made an enjoyable, engrossing, spectacular game. especially, when you find yourself a team or - even better - invite some friends. if you need a new opportunity to slaughter aliens, you should try warframe.",1
"this is very cool game :))) i like the way the graphics are :)",1
"forget the review scores, i too thought this was a hopeless, lag-infected game back in the day.. but its come a long way. silky smooth, frantic gameplay, gorgeous environments and an edgy sci-fi storyline that echoes eye divine cybermancy but plays like mass effect. thrilling stuff, get around it!",1
"this game is awesome, i have no other words for something like this... except... maybe... nah, just awesome",1
"been playing it for few days. free game but with the usual you need to use real money to progress. however it was balanced. those who dont want to spend money can opt to grind which is not much of time consuming if done correctly. good game with need of improvement, particularly on the glitch and the usual complaint of failed to join session when opting to play with others.",1
"this game is fantastic. can hardly believe this is free to play. the controls are tight, accurate and the theme is overall badass.",1
"lets get one thing perfectly clear: the trailer for this game lies. it does not actually represent the gameplay accurately, and this is turning away many who would otherwise greatly enjoy it. heres what the game is actually about: you, and up to three of your companions, in high-grade military light power armor, insert into a space station or groundside base (that is procedurally generated!) with an objective. you are outnumbered. you are outgunned. you are in unfamiliar terrain. accomplish your objective by any means neccessary. good luck.",4

"an excellent little gem of an mmo, this free-to-play has no point that demands you to enter pvp or cough up for some premium currency, though, both are an option. this is only further complimented by the mix of platformer and third-person shooter thats balanced just right. the only reasons you could hate this game would be if you couldnt stand the lore, or simply dont like the games composition. there are sections that cater to every level of skill, and force nobody to stay within or go beyond them. get into warframe, but bring friends if you want a crew to work with you for more than one or two missions.",5

"its a bit hard to get the grasp of the foundry and modding system at first but its well worth the task once you figure that out its smooth sailing from there it has a good survivability and technically doesnt require you to spend one cent even though its easier.",2
"well uh, this game has good graphics. thats about it. :",1
"this is what happens when you marry the excitement of the mass effect trilogy to the gears of war franchise, you would have warframe. if you enjoy both those games, the visuals of mass effect, and all its sci-fi goodies, and just want hords of baddies coming at you. get this game.",1
"i really love warframe butthey need to add more wild on earth, hope that happends!!",1
"i went into warframe thinking itd just be another orion: dino horde. ...after about 6 hours of nonstop gameplay, a lack of a need to purchase in-game items with real money, jumping into bulletfest after bulletfest, and an utter addiction to being a proper freakin gun-and-sword-weilding space ninja, i said otherwise.",1
"this game is proof that the whole 30/60fps debacle is utter . this game is just one frame, a warframe, and it still looks really good. its obvious that fps is completely irrelevant to the smoothness of the visuals in a game. just one frame is enough to make a game look and run smoothly.",1
"it is awesome, lots of running, stabbing, shooting and space ninjas, i highly recommend it to anyone who likes 3rd person running and gunning.",4
"suprisingly fun for a free to play game. at least until you get tired of grinding constantly for new weapons. still, worth a try.",1
"get dis game, it is extremely fun and is the one game i have that always seems to pull me back, no matter what.",9
"ive been playing warframe for a year and a half now, and i can say it is the best mmofpsrpg game ever. the graphics are amazing, the customizability is exstensive, and the gameplay itself is addicting. this game is not for everyone, particularly in the sense that its not a normal mmo.",2
"its very hard to believe this is a free to play game. it takes many machanics from other games i enjoy and uses them in a way that makes you want to keep playing. you will lose hours.",5

"i downright love this game! its chaotic fast action with space ninjas! play however you want with a wide variety of weapons and abilities, which you can then further customise with mods (add-ons to your weaponry and warframes that add effects such as increased stamina or fire damage). honestly one of the best free-to-play games on steam, and its still in beta. however, i do recommend a decent computer.",2
"youre a space ninja with an obsession for grinding, you grind for more space ninjas and space ninja weapons so you can grind for better grinding weapons, the end game consists of trying to grind the hardest and surviving literal hours against waves of increasingly more difficult versions of enemies youve fought before, possibly over thousands of times before. ive lost control of my life/10",2
"great game with a unique aesthetic, frequent content updates, and fun combat. unfortunately, the lack of an overall story or objective tends to make it feel like an endless grinding simulator. if you can look past that, warframe will provide hours upon hours of free entertainment. its a good game to kill time and have stupid fun.",3
"the game is awesome and i reccomend it to people who like mmo pve and some pvp and clans.",6
"its free to play, so it wont cost you anything to try it out. that being said, i would recommend it. though after a while you will get bored of doing the same stuff over and over again. i would still be playing this game if there were more updates or more immersion in gameplay. though i still recommend this game, as i have played it over a 100 hours myself.",2
"nice graphics, fun so far and reminds me of a few games ive played in the past.",1

"ninja pirates in space. what else would you expect?",5
"this game has come such a long way since release. now i cant stop playing it. everything in the game can be unlocked as long as you put some time into it, so even if there are a lot of purchasable items and equipment, you can still be on par with those players. the combat is extremely fluid, physics are wonderful, graphics are fu**ing amazing, and the diversity in the frames and weapon builds make it fun to show off to your friends.",2
"a definite must have, just download and see, once you start playing you wont stop, ive been playing since ive downloaded it.",7
"very nice looking free to play game. very addictive. still a bit buggy, but theres a steady stream of updates and hotfixes. devs are really responsive to player input.",5
"with the newest update (update 14) changes have been made to make this game very new player friendly. this was a big issue with the game before- it just didnt accomodate new players well. so if you tried the game before and got frustrated with it, nows the time to come back and try again. trust me, you wont be disappointed.",10
"an extremely fun game to play, lots of jumping, lots of movement. about spot on if your looking for a game that suits your taste of simple pve dungeon running. the levels do tend to get grindy. but what good ol fashioned mmo isnt? get this game! its super fun!",1
"you have a space sword. you are an alien. you are a ninja. you are murdering the degenerate human race, starting at mercury and working your way out. it teaches you the basics but leaves room to learn. play it. join my cause. stand with me against the perjuries of the wicked!",2
"there is a voice inside me. somewhere deep down in the fossilising lobes of my brain resides an eager mouth that calls in from my past. it is a youthful me, filled with irrational exuberance. it looks at the art and sci-fi glamour-gloom of warframe and says: this is the stuff!",3

"a great game. i wasted my whole summerbreak with it.",2
"warframe is a co-op thirdperson action shooter. the player is given a nice variety of weapons they can work towards, though knew warframes will be what you spend most of your time working for. this is as this is a very heavily grind based game, and you will revisit the same missions over and over, depending on what you need to make your next item. the acrobatic mechanics add a very nice ascpect to the combat, allowing flips and wallruns. all of this is very nice, but in the games current state it lacks variety in enemy an missions, an the lore, which seems very nice, is given to you very lightly, leaving the best part of the game obfuscated. warframe -7/10 good! what is stalker?",1
"more fun than a fat girl and a tub of crisco. i recommend that anyone who loves fpss and mmos give this a try.",5
"one of the most interesting projects of 2013 that flowed into 2014 that ive seen. the game has all what a gamer needs. guns, fancy karate gimmicks, swords. two words: space ninjas. what is actually good that the game even tho is f2p but it does not follow a shadowy p2w path. you might be confused in the beggining, as getting the stuff, crafting, locations and controls. but when you get over it, you might as well like it. another aspect that drives the attention. constant new content updates from very friendly developers. i might add that devs do take in considiration players ideas and implement ideas and throughts into a real thing. almost all the stuff ingame can be aqquired just by playing the game, you just need to get over the beggining. but this game is still in beta. there could be bugs, there could be flaws. currently devs implement tons of content every two months (aprox). in general this is a game that you might totally like or just play for two minutes and uninstall. playing with friends is recomended.",7
"do you recommend this game? of course i will, because its damn good and fast action game. its about team work and you would not miss it because it is not like other games like pay to win. here, everything depends on your skills and reaction, about your accuracy and moving style. so go on and download it. you wont be disapointed.",1
"damn nice with light-detailed graphics,+ story line is amazing.highly ercommended!",1

"overall game is good , but it lack in tutorial of the game and helps section",1
"the game is great , one of the best free to play games ive ever played - only played 123 hours so far. the amount of grinding that needs to be done and missions to complete of different difficulties makes it so that the player can never say ive done everything without properly playing the game for hours upons hours. a good selection of warframes (different characters basically) to make and use. missions like survival make it fun to play with friends for a long period of time and with so much bosses and items to collect one can not be bored. ill give this a 8/10 due to the fact that i havent tried the pvp nor have i ventured deep enough in the game (i.e. the highiest missions) to give a full review. ill mostly give this a 9 after venturing further and maybe a 10 once i get in to the pvp and so fourth. also there are many glitches and beta issues that pop up from time to time, for example people getting disconnected as soon as a game starts / people getting kicked from the party at extraction and so fourth. but overall for a beta - this game is pretty awesome. so 8/10 for now and it can only get better in my opinion, try it out!",4
"you can have a sword,a pistol and a bow.and its in the long long future.why wouldnt you have plasma cannons and stuff??because  you,i can kill em with in bow!! 9/10 wanted a polearm too",1
"this game masters the feeling of freedom and pure ninja-esque abilities. wall running, stealth kills, slide attacks, and they all feel natural and flow easily. only thing that could make this better is bullet time. not to mention the game looks pretty as hell and if that wasnt enough, its god damn free. free! best damn free game since tf2.",10
"fun game, for people who like fps and jrpg grind style games. update: you get to to ramp up weapons and warframes and make your own satisfying op builds xd",3
"all you need to know is that this game is ing awesome .",1
"de drove this one home, great gameplay, awesome community interaction. perfectly seamless blend oftps/mmo/coop ive never had a taste for coop games, but warframe is an exception. the arsenal well more than makes up for the repetitiveness, and the combat system in my opinion is well designed. they continue to update warframe on a monthly basis (one major update a month), and they recently added player ships, kurbrows, which are basically our equal of dogs, a new warframe, dual machine pistols similar to the russian micro uzis, and last update they added katanas (nikanas). i cannot wait to see what de comes up with next. well done. -9.5/10",4
"a great fps game that focuses on both solo and group play. many players has given it the nickname grindframe as you have to grind for materials to build big and beter equipmnet; but it gets beter and more fun as you play. warfame has a great community of friendly and considerate players and the developers leave funny and silly comment in the game right before a major update. i highly recoment this game if you are a fan of fps games.",10
"warframe? the game full of awesomeness! give it a try , i sure u wont regret it =d",3
"are you worried about this game being a free to play? are you thinking that everybody who wasted money on it is going to have an advantage over you? dont worry about it; this game has one of the best crafting systems ive ever seen in a free to play and its completely possible to craft that weapon or warframe youre after simply by playing the game. that and the gameplays bloody amazing. give it a shot, you wont regret it.",9
"get this game you will not regret it. new things all the time and great support team too c:",7
"playing wf for 250+ hours with no steam makes me happy.",1
"this is one of the best shooters iv played, sure its slow at the start but this game has so much to offer. lots of weapons,check, epic bosses,check, loot,of course, ninja skills,defintly. and everything is acessable for free, just have to unlock them",5
"really good game, there are still some bugs. runs smooth, even on an older computer. optimized really great. sad there isnt any cross-platform.",1
"this game is amazing. so much content and a company that releases updates constantly, and its free! great story and background, team work is a must. the whole presentation is crisp and clear, i would almost consider it out of beta. must try this game, not pay to win at all, :d",1
"this game has changed a-lot (for the better) from when i last played it. it is now in my top 5 favorite games, instead of my top 5 worst games. 12/10 dolphins.",1
"what more is there to do than recommend this game? first of all, its free to play. this means you dont have to pay money to play it. it does not mean it will run like those flash-games that represented what was free to play just 5 years ago. (although free to play used in the manner as it is used in warframe it means you can play without paying, but paying could make the experience better. nonetheless, as a non-paying user, i think for myself that it plays just fine for free.) warframes looks are equal to or better than most aaa releases and the gameplay is likewise. it might take more than a few hours of playing it to understand how to work it properly, and it doesnt always tell you excactly how to pull off every move, but this also leaves a lot of room for experimentation, which i think is one of the points where this game shines rather brightly. if you like ninjas, sci-fi, shooters, stealth actions or slashers, warframe is likely to hit you in at least one good spot.",1
"i have no idea who and why am i killing all those things that are who and where but i totally enoyoj it... and u can upgrade ur .... definetly worth tryin... :d",1
"good game if you like free running and kicking the enemys  only bad thing about this game is the bugs and connection issues but then no one likes that stuff anyway",3
"this game might repeat it-self a bit. butt in the end of the day it is one of the most amazing f2p there is. with hours of playing, tons of guns, characters and missions to unlock and play, not to mention it is co-op. this game is not one of those pay to play crap, in this game if you pay you only rush stuff up, everything that costs can be crafted whitch gives even more play time. in other words....download it. nowww. *heavy voice*",4
"very good if you have a strong enough computer, awesome graphics and gameplay. well worth playing.",1
"now warframe is a special type of game: its about you and the so called teno. the teno is a high technological grupe thats like assassins and guardians. they are all master of parcur. the nice thing about this game is that nomatter what your into there is usually somthing you will like. fighting: there are plenty of maps to play and there is wave maps if you get board. builder: you can get a clan and if you have a clan you can get a clan dojo which is this giant space ship you can build rooms in. supporter: you can gather recorses to build on your dojo or make wepons and warframes. the downside is that when you have picked your first warframe(playermodle) you cant change it unless you buy a blueprint and make a new one or buy it for platinium. also the level decine is annoying becaus its the same goddame thing your running through the first 4-7 maps. but else then that the game is great and if you got friends you got a epic team.",2
"very good game.. dont worry about the other reviews... this game has been updated and is very good now... highly recomend... the graphics are amazing and who doesnt like a game that allows you to climb walls?! also its f*cking free.... get it",1
"its amazing people should totaly play this game is an amazing guns and melle ninja game ever ive never seen anything like this before i will never stop playing this game forever because there is alot to explore in this game this is something the whole world should play to enjoy because im sure enjoying this.p.s to the producers of this game-good job! i love you guys for this game long live the tenno!!",4
"hours of gameplay straight to you for no cost! weapons, frames, and missions golore! if you love dungeon crawlers and have a passion for third-person shooters.... you will spend your time investing into this game. i know i have after 800+ hours of non-stop grinding",7
"i was a little skeptical abou tthis game because i heard it was still in beta. but after i played for 20 hours on a friends computer i am now hooked! with the great graphics and controls, the game just feels really fluid. theres little to no glitches and all around just a great game. try it out for yourself and see!",1
"i was a bit cautious about playing this game because i was afraid it would be pay-to-win.. but is actually possible to get everything in the game through standard gameplay. weapon mods, parts, and blueprints can be sold to other players in exchange for platinum (the premium currency). the game is very fun to play, and there are guns and warframes (essentially characters) to accomodate just about any playstyle, whether you enjoy sniping from afar while cloaking yourself and sneaking around, running around shooting lightning from your ****ing hands, using magnetism to crush your enemies into oblivion, running in guns blazing and raising hell, getting up close and personal with your enemies and ripping them to pieces with one of the many, many melee weapons. weapons, warframes, and sentinels can be built, leveled up, and modded with special abilities and perks with a surprising amount of customizability. all in all this game is very, very fun and i would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing third-person shooters with online co-op. the community seems generally nice and willing to help out new players from what ive experienced.",6
"seriously: the only f2p title that ever kept my attention. first i thought: ugh, another pay to win title and worse, being kind of a mass effect ripoff. then: hey, whatever it is, its fun!!! it is tremendous fun. i like the fact that it is only pve and pvp doesnt factor in at all. most of the community is nice and fun, even if there are some di**s around, so even playing with random people is fun. playing with friends is the best.",2
"perfect nauesea simulator, good graphics 8/10 would get sick again",1
"as i near my near my 200th hour in warframe, i still consider this one of the best games i have sunken my time into. mmos are sort of my thing, i have played hundereds of hours in many diffrent games, and warframe is by far the best i have played. part of what makes it even more increadible is that they are still olny in beta. i have been around since alpha, roughly patch 9.0 and i have been impressed with every minute. i love the feel of the game, the weapon system, the seemless incooperation of melee weapons, and especially the movement system. i alos appreciate that as a free to play, they have a live pay market, but that they have managed to make it possible to earn or craft nearlly anything in the game, making it not pay to win. as it stands i consider this one of the best sci-fi games on the market, one of the best mmos, and by far the best f2p mmo. it is especially great if you enjoy small group multiplayer, friend olny squads, and resource based crafting. while it currently lakes in story, hopefully to be fixed soon, it makes up for it in shear quality of game mechanics. i rate this roughly an 8.75 to 9.5",2
"plays like most fps with smooth graphics and more coop missions. few real solo-only mission so ban open upmost any map to let others spawn into you game and work as assault teams. custom mods allow for a lot of variety (from weapon upgrades to cosmetics). like many other games this can quickly go pay-to-win, however it is not required if you want to go slower and enjoy the experience as free-to play. very pretty and fast graphics.",2
"awesome for a free game. lots of cool and different features.",1
"amazing game really worth time time to play, still seems abit unfinished but they add new content faster than even pay to play games its really impressive and cant wait too see them fullfill the potential this game has.",5
"this is the best 3rd person shooter ever i love it i would recommend it to anyone just have a good coputer i have a 200 dollar compaq presario with 3 gigs of memory and a nvida card and it can barley play it xd",3
"shocked that mt stock 3 year old pc can play this game. fun co-op",1
"there are already many, many, many lovingly written out paragraphs-long recommendations of this game, so ill avoid that. its about you in a variety of powersuits that make ironman wet his pants. and its free. try it.",4
"easily one of the best looking free to play games on the market which is also not pay to win. on the other hand, this game is nothing but grinding. it is literally a grinding simulator at this point where you grind for resources to build equipment to more efficiently get more resources. it has gotten better, however, with added features and interesting ways to grind added since i last played several months back, with even more, even sexier grinding machines (warframes) now. if you love grinding, this game is definitely for you. i personally like fun grinding. the game is supposedly in beta right now and i am quite interested to see what directions the developers are taking it.",4
"game looks just about good and as fun as the trailer and the screenshots.",1
"game about space ninjas, and ugly weridos, very fun",7
"one of the best looking ftp games. also, almost anything in the game (except some cosmetics) can be earned for free, so its not pay to win in the least",1
"warframe iz luv warframe iz lyf. if you have ever wanted to be a ninja space cowboy ninja, without the cowboy, then get this game... its free, looks amazing, runs smoothly, and can be played many different ways. such as if you want to be a true stealth ninja, or a raging tank of death, or that guy who plays support... like a boss",1
"sci-fi online shooter/slasher, oriented on cooperative gameplay. missions with varied difficulty, assasination/espionage missions, various abilities to improve your character and weaponry (as well as levelling system for both your character and each weapon you use). free-to-play, though you gonna pay some real money for some classy weaponry and characters, though its totally okay to level up your starter set of weapons and your first character to a state of a kickass killing machine without no money spent at all! not to mention crafting system - do missions on specified regions, collect resourses and make these weaponry and chars by yourself for free (and in-game funds). good luck, have fun!",1
"good game & great game developers. ive play this game since theres nothing fishy. and while i played this game for the main game, i see lots of updates! game dev team are so great, more of bugs fixed, many thing updates not only the weapons.",5
"such a good game recomend this to everyone. its just such a good game!!!!!!",1
"awsome game all i found was my firewall had blocked it so it wouldnt work",1
"out of all the games that i have played (probably about 208)this one is my most favourite",3
"i think warframe is a pretty cool guy. he fights aliens and doesnt afraid of anything",1
"pros: action packed fun cool graphics cons: there are micro-transactions so its nearly a pay-to-win scenario, or just play a ton of hours to win very (very) repetetive gameplay",1
"its free. you get to play as a cyborg ninja. get the friggin game.",1
"space ninjas with swords, guns, and blob guns. if you need anything more than space ninjas with an arsenal of weapons that make you the coolest dude in space ive got the kicker.... there is also robots. 11/10 would play again.",9
"for a free to play third person shooter i would recomend this game to you as its got a good story mode the combat system is very sharp and you can also jump in and out of online mode as you please",1
"amazing game with a lot of content that grabs your attention and challenges you to do more and try more. would smash 10/10",1
"awesomely good game for free to play, awesome active devs, lots of fixes and big updates allmost every month. beats many non-ftp games 10-0. play it.",8
"this game is a great blend of melee and fps with fun acrobatics and spells mixed in. i recommend spending enough time to create your own warframe after running through the tutorial to get a feel of all the customization available. this is one of my favorite games, with a great matchmaking system, good loading times and cinematics, as well as skins and colors available for purchase if you want to personalize your tenno even more.",8
"i love the unique aspect of a multiplayer campaign with multiple mission types. really makes it a fun and unique experience!",1
"this game is a ton of fun. and does a very good job in the free 2 play model. i level up more than fast enough, so i dont feel cynical about being driven toward some clowny xp booster. and-- all the good stuff in the game can be researched and built by you. the only thing you have to have real money for, is cosmetics, and extra hanger slots if you cant bear to sell back old weapons. tldr: its chinese space ninjas in space. flipping out, cutting peoples heads off, and being awesome.",3
"this is one of the most attractive games that i ever played. it is hard to get inside it, but once youve passed the firsts steps, this game becomes a place for ultimate enjoyment.",7
"i think warframe is fun and most peeople would enjoy",2
"warframe is like ze best 3rd person shooter i have ever played tried it :d",6
"i personally like this game a lot but i feel like not enough people play it. its a very creative and beautiful game that sets itself apart from from other games with its levels, but after a while it gets slightlyh repetetive in my opinion. i give this game 8.5/10",1
"i went into warframe thinking itd just be another orion: dino horde. ...after about 6 hours of nonstop gameplay, a lack of a need to purchase in-game items with real money, jumping into bulletfest after bulletfest, and an utter addiction to being a proper freakin gun-and-sword-weilding space ninja, i said otherwise.",1
"this game makes me want to tuck my  in whilst playing! 10/10",1
"warframe, an amazing third person game which would be pretty accurate to say is the epitome of robot ninjas, which in turn, makes this game extremely fun to play. besides the repetition of levels and the occasional glitches, this game has everything pretty much down pat, from awesome graphics to a solid fighting system which makes this game even better to play, and its all for free!! so i highly recommend adding this game to your library, and you will get quite a few hours of entertaining moments out of it.",2
"complicated, but once you get into it and understand how to play, it is one of the most fun games i have ever played. 10/10 would recommend.",1
"im enjoying warframe immensely. the cooperative atmosphere among the players is refreshing, and the gameplay is varied and fun. your loadout will become tuned to your playstyle in so many ways, its astounding. i have a good friend showing me the ropes and helping me get some of the items, but its just as playable with random strangers. youll quickly learn some things, and slowly learn others. a few bugs speckle every play session, but not enough to frustrate me out of playing. highly recommended.",4
"im hooked. warframe is so well done. one of the best 3rd person, action, free to play game i have ever played. keep up the good work digital extreme.",8
"just another pay to win games.... but i like it tho",1
"ive played this game for about 1000 hours total. ive made different accounts to start over and found that warframe got better at helping new players in the game learn faster by delivering interactions one step at a time instead of a overload of information all at once. over all the game is great and almost never ending!",1
"space ninjas! with guns!!! plus its free! download the game already!",10
"this game is just awesome. a frre to play tps, with lot of action and great combo system. you can customise your character with different color, armour, and skins, it is the same for weapons. i recommend this game to everyone, it totally worth it :d",1
"if you like to play third-person shooter with awesome rpg elements with 3 other people and in a sci-fi setting, this is for you. seriously give this game a try. its free.",9
"i can easily say this is the best f2p game ive ever played, discounting tf2. the gameplay is fun, its fast paced and tricky. your character moves in amazing ways with awesome parkour. combat can be a little dull at times due to just having lame guns for a while to start but the melee combat is excellent. all in all, its free, it looks great and it plays great. rally some friends and give it a shot if youre bored. oh and you can be like raiden.",1
"ninjas in space. ing rpg, nade launcher, rocket pistols, energy beams, mind control, and rocket powered hammers and explosions. damn this game is so good. best f2p i have ever played.",4
"dis game. started days after it went into open beta, was stable as if it were a final version commercial release. absolutely wonderful to play with friends, although the objective fun in it is in setting your sights on a new warframe and working towards it. with 13 frames, theres a lot of work ahead for you to keep you busy, and it doesnt require too much money to get you those 11 extra slots!",4
"i dont like the game but there is no reason you shouldnt like it",1
"an epic 3rd person shooter that envolves space ninjas i mean, come on, space ninjas! you have about 8 warframes to choose from each with a unique play style and abilities. i recommend this game to anyone who likes sci-fi adventures and anyone who likes ninjas...in space",1
"metacritic score does not represent how good this game is",3
"space samurai. do you really need any other reason to play this?",1
"though not user friendly, this game is a lot of fun after you learn its system.",6
"warframe...its unbelievably amazing. graphics are great, smooth gameplay, its very fun and addicting. im suprised its not #1 on free-to-play steam games.",2
"this game is alot of fun and quite addictive when you get into it. the game is constantly being butchered to death, balance wise, by its developer though. there are also a ton of bugs and really strange design choices that wonder if the people in charge are mentally handicapped or have actually ever played any video games before. great game overall though. just be prepared for bugs bugs and more bugs. be prepared for things being nerfed when they dont need to be and things that do need to be nerfed being left alone.",4
"most f2ps pressure you into becoming an upgarded member or buying special coins or some sh!t but in this, you can achieve your full goals without paying a single cent 8/8 m8 its gr8 dont h8",4
"i honestly cant critisize a free to play 3rd person shooter that has multi and single player modes when it comes to actual gameplay, however, i have to admit creating a new acount for the first time can sometimes be a real *****.",1
"a fun, 4 player, co-op game that is relatively easy to understand. been a favourite amongst my friends and i for a while now, would recommend! the gameplay is wonderful, bringing together elements from third-person-shooters, rpgs and mmos and combining them into something new. the graphical design is nothing short of beautiful, dazzling the players with a variety of levels and effects! the audio quality is great. there is nothing nicer than hearing the drums of war start to play rhythmically as you enter battle. finally, the community is large, diverse and friendly.",9
"love this game, been playin since befor i used steam and was using raptr. awesome gameplay, easy to use controller support, vived lush graphics, excellent voices, tons of content with new content added regularly, and fun co-op. super fun game to play for free. now for gripes (though very few), the story is very lacking, its not really in your face you have to be looking for it but there is one, also this game gets seriously repetitive and if your not playing with friends or a team that talks as you play... you get bored and last but not least.... this game is a epic grind. if you dont wanna spend money to get other warframes or speed up the process of leveling and crafting this game will eventually make you put it down because of repetitive grinding. that being said... this game is awesome and i recommend anyone give a shot... its free for goodness sake! and lets not comment on the epicness of playing this on a big 1080 tv with surround sound, and dualshock 4, and steams awesome big picture mode!",4
"this game is a very fun in-depth tps, unlike most it has a social system, decent melee, and lots if cool missions. 8/10",1
"ruined my life this last winter. excellent game. 10/10",5
"great game, love it a ton. free to play just makes it all the better. controls are easy to adapt to and the freerunning/parkour aspect is amazing, but slightly buggy. 9.5/10 would play.",1
"this is a great game for the die-hard ninjas that are out there slice and shoot em all",1
"this game is one of the best free to play games out there, especially with freinds :)",4
"its an overall good game, but the grinding in the game is just insane. its like gaben just gave up on the game. me: oh allmighty lord gaben, please give me a blessing gaben: what kind of blessing? me: i want that really cool sword gaben: oh okay, it will take u.. about 132 hours of intense grinding! me: but gaben... gaben: np, i know im to friendly, but u deserve it me: but... gaben: now go out and farm! me: ok... 132 hours later. me: were is my sword?",8
"warframe is love, warframe is life. i am addicted. halp.",6
"one of, if not, the best free to play games where the devs listen to the community and interact with them and cash shop is not game breaking. a game that gets constantly updated and improved. space ninjas play free",8
"had joy seizure while playing 10/10 would seizure again",1
"i would have loved this game if you didnt have to pay for so many things like more weapons or other characters. it would have been fine with some really great stuff that you have to pay for, but it seems like its everything. other than that it is a pretty great game. there is a story, co-op, choose which levels you do first. this game would have been my number 1 if it wasnt for all the money you had to pay to get stuff.",1
"this game is amazing there is little a time that i get on a game everyday and see something new going on not to mention the forge where have to work to assemble your gear",1
"this is a very enjoyable game, but you have to be carefull if your used to making small purchases in games like this. i went from telling myself that i would spend no more than 60 dollars on platinum, to having spent a few hundred dollars on this game over the course of the time ive been playing it.",6
"cool, cause ninjas, and space. now all we need is pirate- no we have those too",1
"update failed some content could not be dowloaded from our servers. please restart warframe to try again the update will restart shortly... whew thats what it is saying all day... =( plz fix this problem this game looks toooooo cool",1
"amazing movement and combat system unlike any before but does cost money eventually no matter what and will need to have its finishing quality added. the character leveling and custimization is great but once you realize theres not much more to do once you have a couple warframes and a good couple levels up you realize all of the work you put into making a badass godlike superhero ninja is only to continue puting more time and money into each character and there is never any sort of player to player recognition for your time invested in your character. games like world of warcraft have all of the intricate mini parts of the game, like warframe, but no matter what you get tangled up in you always know grand total the game is still alliance vs horde(primarily) and warframe and its creators. needs to finish with its own distinguished main reason to play the game. something that makes you take all the time you spend making your guy just as awsome as you want him and then actually lets you use him for a purpose other then more leveling or material farming. my vote is for hundreds of warframes to eventually meet in head on 360 degree warfare in online servers on the supposed new part of the game. control points, weapons and warframes would be great!",2
"the game is fun and has a bit of innovation. its free to play aspect gives players a free way to play and you really dont need to buy anything for it. is it worth paying? sure. you can get things you want like in any game. however, this isnt a mmo, many people i talked to say it is. its a coop game where people have the option of hop in hop out features. the things i dont like about the game is it is linear, you have minimal options on where you can roam. the game play is repeatitive and i know most games are like that but this game really has nothing but the same sword slashing and gun slinging as any other game i ever played. for a free to play it is fun, but even the levels lack creative imagination. they look like theyre basically the same level over and over again. players- well you get good and bad players for all games but the ones on here will leave in the middle of a session and leave you to fight hoardes of enemies by yourself, and they lack the consideration to revive you when you die. i give it a thumbs up for a free to play game... however if it was a pay to play game or even a game to purchase i wouldnt recommend it.",1
"this is a great 3rd person shooter game that is not to be missed out on, especially considering the creators are kind enough to hand out such an awesome game for free!",1
"ok, so you are looking for a new game to play? maybe you like league of legends, mass effect, hitman or halo? well, this one is not anything like one of these......it is all ! combine any 3rd person shooter, mmorpg with sci-fi magic  you can imagine this is what you get: +tons and tons of new weapons every patch +new warframe (character) in every second patch +new mission and rewards everyday +alert missions every hour ( missions with rare gear ) +tons of player ready to help newbies in-game +huge trade channels and web sites +and, the best free-to-play game there is........anywhere ! perslonaly, i played it more than 400h in last year, and since the start, it has changed alot. community has gone boooom over the internet and .... well just look at all the artwork ! so what are you waiting for?",4
"warframe is an amazing game. its a third person co-op sci-fi shooter space ninja extravaganza! its a little slow starting out (if you have the money, i recommend getting affinity and credit boosters), but once you get past the first planet or two, you really start to have some great fun. with a good team and communication, this game offers hours of never ending entertainment. each warframe (playable character) offers its own unique play and fighting style. with (currently) 16 warframes and 3 prime variants (the 4th, excalibur prime is no longer attainable), over 100 primary, secondary, and melee weapons, and 5 sentinels (robotic companions), this game has massive replayability. the very best part is, its free! so why not try it out? p.s. dont stop after the first couple missions, i promise youll find its an amazing game!",2
"a very enjoyable fast-paced shooter (when played with others). with the option of stealthy slow solo play as well. some repetitive maps and scenarios but still with enough variation to not feel grindy (until youre trying to get something specific to drop). can be played entirely free but a little cash injection certainly can boost the fun.",7
"it is a action game with a realistic engine(both graphically and combat-wise),with lots of hack-n-slash ,resembling devil-may-cry 4 with more space ninjas.it is perfect but for the lack of stealth,but hell,its perfect! edit:now with the new gui and the new stuff from the mad cephalon onwards the game is imho terrible.i just dont know what to do in it anymore.for veterans<--- dont come back for new players<----play it! you might understand something from it...",2
"all and all, great game. cant say its perfect, but it will keep you occupied for a long time. the combat is fun, fast paced (even if some of the enemy mechanics are often a bit cheap) and feels rather rewarding at most times. there is a light grind wall, but all the objects in the game (other than cosmetics) can be obtained without any real money, so with a good time investment anything can be obtained. even cash shop items. highly recommend it as the game is constantly improoving and more content is added. just a small advice, find someone else to play with as that will make the experience much better.",5
"swoosh, pew pew pew, boom! blaargh! this  be awesome, space ninjas forever!",1
"used ashs bladestorm. my victim died before i touched him. teleported inside a huge box and turned into a box of doom. 10/10 would run out of oxygen again",8
"its basically a farming simulator and i think thats pretty neat.",8
"sooooooooooooooooo much free fun and killing!!!! youre a freakin m.f.ing space ninja. whats not to freaking like.",6
"great game, plenty of content. definitely worth a try!",9
"very fun game if you enjoy me3 multiplayer, but can be a bit grindy at times",1
"great game for a free to play! lots of cool weapons and warframes (classes) with awesome abilities.",3
"this is basically a mix of third-person action, ninjas, parkour, advanced tech and awesomeness. highly recommended!",6
"this game has a bit of a grind, other than that its pretty good.",2
"cut a man with a mushroom-shaped head in half. 11/10",1
"good game. a little light on story for my taste, but thats personal opinion. fun to play, the fact that maps change every mission is neat, and customization is varied and interesting. overall; definitely worth playing.",1
"holy  dude. two words. space. ninjas. yeah dude, space ninjas. fast action, massive amounts of customization, its a good game. go get it and hit me up. ill boost the  out of you.",3
"warframe while not being the best f2p games i have played is defiantly one of the better ones. while it is true that you spend alot of time grinding, and that the silver(ingame currency paid with real money) is oddly expensive those do not take away the fun of the game.",1
"great f2p game, kinda like mass effect but free :)",1
"a perfect game for pve that you can play hours and hours with your firends or make new ones in the game",1
"fantastic but hard to pick up at first. helpful to play with experience friends",1
"where do i start with this game to hold your attention? warframe is a fast phased, action packed thrill ride with marvelous graphics in an ever expanding universe with its own level up system, upgrades, parkour, magic, spaceninjas, you name it. and the devs who brought this game are very talented people who do their best to daily bring new things to the table. however, this game does lack a proper endgame as of yet and suffers from repetition, but its the constant content which will keep you coming back for more, it really is a great experience with lots of potential for years to come.",6
"i havent played this a lot but for the time i have played i enjoyed it. i wanted different tenno though but thats really grindy and really hard to get if you dont have a good group with you. the controles may seem wonky but if you change them to your liking then theyre amazing. the only thing bad i can really say is the melee. its weak and everywhere, but if you know how to make your tenno, its strong and everywhere and sometimes the only freaking thing you use. the maps are practically all the same but different routes, the weapons are the same just different stats just like dust 514, and its easy to get out of control thinking youre a badass and getting yourself mauled. overall its a pretty good game, not something id play all day every day but still good enough to catch my attention, especially considering i dont like super fast paced anything or third-person games. oh also the lighting, the lighting is too extravegant, so if the flare bothers you turn off lighting effects, it helps speed up the game and its better on the eyes and makes it feel more natural.",1
"u can do wall run like in prince of persia... i think i dont need to tell u anything else",1
"this game is all about space pirate ninja robots. go to planet, pillage the place, and enjoy the spoils as you become an unstoppable force across the warframe universe.",8
"great game to play! i have already put hours into it and it gets better with every update.",4
"you can kill things so hard that they turn into a singularity. would play again.",4
"the game is really repetive after playing it for awhile but guessing thats the reason for players to continue to get different weapons in the arsenal.",2
"pretty fun game ill admit. its satisfying to get a kill once you get the hang of all the neat tricks you can do. the only con about this game are the microtransactions. the microtransactions are annoying and limit very much to your gameplay, they keep you from getting better, and cooler items. as a decent game, i give it 7/10, gotta make money somehow right?",1
"not a ninja so i cant play this free. cost me alot of money and keyboards that i have bashed in rage!",1
"this is the best corridoor simulator ever, i think in my 5hrs of playing i ran down the same corridor at least 1000times!",1
"class based combat+manufacturing+card collectingfusing character and weapon enhancement. many theaters to progress through for xp, materials and cards. collect credits to purchase most things. buy chits to get specialty warframes, weapons and other things to build your own. oh, its free.",6
"i really wish the community was larger for this game. it was such a joy and of course it can seem repetitive but, the community that did play was helpful and it never felt like a grind. i would definitely give this game at least an 8/10 if not higher. the graphics are amazing and the gameplay is smooth and enjoyable. there are exploits to movement and such which make it easy though there still is enough challenge for it to be a great time! i hope for this game to somehow grow once again",1
"great ninja style game, wont regret downloading it",6
"warframe is a fun free to play pve mmo that is truly addictive game download its free!!!",2
"if a game has ninjas like this one, then its legit.",2
"graphic can compare with other high graphic game such as call of duty,and its free to play,so if u wish to,try it out,no bad at all",1
"a cavalcade of co-op-tacular fun! roam space and kick some grinner butt as you collect and create new suits and weapons with ridiculous abilities, fail at any and all sections that require stealth, pull of crazy tricks with the awesome movemnent/parcour/wallrun mechanics, and shoot lazers that go pew pew, oh and its free!",1
"its diffrent from most games but its sooo fun. the only problem i had so far is how many warframes and weapon slots you can have. its annoying cause you have to spend money for more slots. but from that its one of my top games atm.",3
"various abhumans battle thru the heavens! cheap as free! shoot many things and collect much stuff in the pursuit of sweet nectarine power! your search is potentially endless, but enjoyable would suggest participating if you enjoy guns and space",1
"i have spent (unbeknownst to me) over 300 hours playing this game and i have nothing but positive things to say. despite the fact that many free-to-play games often require you to pay in order to progress, this isnt true with warframe. as ive learned from the very beginning you could play for hours-upon-hours without having to spend a single penny. it wasnt until i was nearing 100 hours that i realized how much i enjoyed this game. not only that, but i also thought that investing in (platinum for) the game would only help make my already-pleasant experience even better. warframe has evolved alot in the small amount of time that ive played it. through player purchases the developers have added new maps, new mods, a killer melee battling system, and outstanding and unique missions and modes that only add to the spontaneity of this game. just imagine a game that mixes ninja gaiden with call of duty with vanquish. from my own personal experience, its worth checking out - especially if youre a college student (like myself) and are strapped for spending money on the new games coming out every-so-often. give this game a shot and im sure you will come to find at least a few things that make warframe a fun, great, and unique experience. game on. - lenny",3
"rating: ++++ very fun game, however you do need to put some time in it and get into the game to get good gear and stuff like that. one very big plus of this game is that all gear can be crafter with resouces you gain troughout the game, so even if you dont have the money you can still have everything that somone who pays also has. with the exeption of a few decorational stuff wich does not affect gameplay.",3
"great action in a high paced mission based mmo. this clan based operation game truly ushers in the new era of online gaming.",1
"im going to start by saying if you dont have patience then you wont like this game, in other words it will leave your steam library within 5 hours. alright after that your here for the review my experience with the game is amazing other than that annoying so called crafting the game is great. melee 2.0 reveloutionized the games melee system giving it a whole new aspect, first heavy weapons actually have a purpose other than more damage, they have different attacks but still more damage. smaller weapons such as the glaive attack faster and deal less damage and is throwable. this pretty much wraps up the review one of the best prequels to a game ever not storyline wise but gameplay wise. 9.5 out of 10",2
"this game. i played it when i had no idea what i was doing, got frustrated, and left for a month or two. but then, i took some time to think about it, and ive played almost every day since that month or two ended. the controls are amazingly fluid; nothing is more satisfying than dashing through a room full of grineer and slicing them to shreds. not only that, but all the weapons, sentinels, and non-cosmetic gear is all free, and incredibly worthwhile to earn. i was the little level 12 loki staring in awe of the rhino prime with a shiny boltor prime and carrier sentinel sucking up all the useful items. im currently working on getting loki prime, and ive built a sentinel all on my own. the grind to get all the rare materials was worth it in the end. all in all, this is a game to keep an eye on (not even out of beta yet!) and play for a bit. who doesnt love space ninjas?",4
"pretty outrageous game but incase it very good to ply ninjas",2
"an absolutely amazing title that entertains for hours, definite recommendation.",1
"really solid f2p game. graphics are decent. the developers are constantly updating, rebalancing, and adding new contact.",1
"its a fun coop game that you can play with your friends and it makes time fly, this game is my favorite freeto play game.",3
"best free to play i have ever played. no need to spend money at all. major plus, the game acts and looks as if its worth at least $50. highely recommend.",4
"really well thought out game. not your standard fps mmo, this is like a hybrid of a mmorpg, an online first person shooter, and a collectable card game. really fun to play once you get used to what is going on. biggest downside is that the maps/enemies get a little repetitive. a solid 8/10",2
"hello people, this game is worth it. simply download and play. small learning curve with wild fun. join a clan for even more added benefits.",5
"this game is awesome! has quite the grind to it, definitly will keep you busy.... cant beat free to play",1
"3rd person shooting with the loot/grinding of an mmo. good stuff!",4
"as a power-armored space ninja with cowboy neon revolvers i punched a space marine to death while a companion cube of deth shot its friend. 10/10 if you think the shooty aspects are good enough to outweight the grindy aspects.",2
"its basically a farming simulator and i think thats pretty neat.",8
"sooooooooooooooooo much free fun and killing!!!! youre a freakin m.f.ing space ninja. whats not to freaking like.",6
"great game, plenty of content. definitely worth a try!",9
"very fun game if you enjoy me3 multiplayer, but can be a bit grindy at times",1
"hands down best, most balanced f2p i have every played. pve focused (currently) with no need to buy anything.",1
"a fast-paced action-packed third person shooter that will entice you within minutes. the range of available characters and weapons to unlock and build really add to the games possibilities of ways to play, fight and win. the only negative thing i have come to notice is that you cant really unlock other warframes to use until mid to late game (unless you spend real money), but even that just encourages more gameplay and more fun! but a word of caution: this game does not have a running storyline after the first missions, so if you are looking for a plot to get involved in, this is not the game. needless to say, overall, this game is a great action-filled tps that will have you hooked for life and the fun will go on without end.",3
"im not a huge fan of fps. so, having the melee attack & bow option is great. the graphics are amazing as well. i also like that anyone can be recruited into a squad or you can even select solo..as im more prone to soloing.",1
"this game is the !!! a/10 would rail again! grustrag three can suck my boltor :>",4
"amazing game love every moment about it space ninjas ftw",6
"fun free-to-play game that can be more fun with friends. you have to grind a lot for certain things, unless you want to just but them. plus space ninjas that should be enough of a reason to play this game.",5
"i dont like spreading my opinion too much but seriously, look how long i played this. i can almost asure you that you will enjoy this game! what isnt there to like about it? third person, ninjas, cool weapons, acrobatics, robots, modified humans, killer fractions and beautiful graphics! (like i said, this is my opinion and shouldnt be taken too seriously! just try the game first! its free after all!)",7
"tons of weapons, bunch of frames (classes) with unique skill sets, clans, alerts, events, rails. this is truly content rich game. you should try it and youll love it!",5
"a game that a fan of stealth or action can play. fun and always changing. definitely worth taking a look at.",3
"very great online/solo game. i recommend this game to anyone who loves playing with friends and parkouring at the same time.",2
"after playing for a year i can say that this game is amazing! but it still needs impovement so expect some things to happen.",9
"this is game is very good recomment it to players who look shooters.",3
"warframe is good-looking, smooth-working and lets you be a futuristic alien space ninja. why are you still reading this and not playing the game?",1
"amazing free to play game. a lot of things about the game are frustrating. but i cant stop playing it. if you want to play a game that makes you feel like a badass. this is it!",3
"very fun you getz to slice peoples up and you getz your own pad and stuffz xd its like a never ending andventure thingy",2
"fun game with friends, recommend for team play, not solo play!",6
"this game is awesome and everyone should at least give it a shot. it is free after all.",1
"this game is pretty awesome.but there is no end game so kind of gets to the point why am i playing? the game is still rolling out and it is alot of fun for new players. but after about 50 or so hours of game play it is like okay, whats next though 50 hours of game play is totally worht this game.",7
"love this game been playing it for a while and it just keeps getting better and better with each update cant wait to see what it becomes in the future",6
"this game is about friendship, you play as a man in a suit made from materials and use your void powers to fight mutated space bunnies, people from star trek, and the zerg swarm. 10/10 you can get a bow and pin people to stuff.",1
"the best free to play on steam get it play it : ))",1
"may seem like its a pay to win game at first but when you start to play you relize its not its very good game",3
"overall a great game. good character choice with plent of upgrades.",1
"ignore metacritic. this is a fun game if you dont mind a little bit of work to get into it.",3
"best free to play game in awhile. most free to pay are freemium; wear cash can make overly powered. but this not the case with warframe. there is in store cash only items ,but most weapons and warframes can be got with simply time and effort. combine with combat composed both mele and ranged it makes for a fairly enetetaining mmo",3
"good game a bit slow in the lower levels but stick with it . and for all the new players out there i got one word for you soma.",2
"freaking awsome game. 10/10 will lose my life to this game.",10
"really, this is one of the best games i have played in a while and its free. shooters are not normally my thing but this has so much more to do i dont care. they make updates all the time and there is always new content.",8
"this is probably the best space-ninja game you will ever play. if you want a quick recommendation, you have it. edit: once upon a time there was a very long page here. well many many updates later its safe to say that this game is still growing in surprising and exciting ways. its still a game that feels that you have to dump a couple bucks into every now and then, but it never feels forced: by the time you feel the urge for some platinum youve probably put a hundred more hours into playing, so why not? money you spend should be based on the fun youre having, and warframe is promising to keep entertaining for a long time.",8
"honestly an amazing game. once you get past the kinda crappy starter gear and into things you like more, it becomes really fun. the biggest pushfactor for most players is the crafting time. once you get over the fact that you cant always get what you want right away and learn to deal with it, it isnt an issue anymore. overall, a really fun, unique game. id reccomend it to anyone into any kind of action game.",6
"excellent game - worth downloading, playing, and becoming addicted to.",1
"i absolutely love this game. it is the definition of a amazing free to play experience, although you will need to spend some money to get the full experience. it is very much worth it in my opinion! also supporting indie devs gives you a nice feeling :) but the meat meat of the gameplay is the third person ninja shooter. being a space ninja ou are very agile and can pull off parkour with ease. the gunplay is satisfying and has a lot of impact with great sound assests make hearing and feeling the pop of a headshot! i cannot reccomend this game enough! but the gripes i have is that the entry level is massive with most of the weapons and frames being very daunting for new player, along with some grind. it could need patience.",6
"ive put over 110 hours into this game so far, i have paid nothing and gotten almost everything in game, worth getting just for space ninja killings.",8
"definitely a great game you should try out. even if you dont like shooters its still worth a spin since it is free.",4
"look, im not typically one to support f2p games, but if you enjoyed dark sector, this will be right up your alley. it is f2p so there are microtransactions (which can be on the expensive side!) but very few non-cosmetic items are purchase-only. essentially, you can play all of the content of this game without paying a cent. (minus some color choices and various conveniences like extra weapons or warframe inventories) its primarily a pve affair, though there is the ability to go to pvp conclaves. this game is solid, mindless, space ninja fun with a lot of variety on weapons and warframes.",1
"great time sink, multiple levels, farming simulator",4
"a lot of people have varrying views on this game. there have been bugs in the past which have annoyed some. my friends included. but i love this game. so many hours just spent playing it. theyre always updating and adding new stuff, whether it be different warframes or weapons and new areas. community missions are fun to try and rack up some points. the warframes themselves are unique and fun to play around with. my favorite being saryn. that poison op. just about anything you can get by just simply playing the game. which cant be said for most free to plays. run on walls, shoot, jump, slam and explode your way to victory xd",4
"greatest 3rd person shooter ever, it is just an all around good game.",3
"hack and slash and pew at its best. and robot wizards",1
"ninjas in space with guns, not a great game to go super in depth or spend tons of time on, but definitely cool/fun to play with friends as a change of pace or chill out game.",7
"fast pased action game. with good gun play and magnificent melee.",8
"this game is pretty awsome pretty fast paced and lost of different game senerios to play. with recent updates it has gotten even better",3
"dont get me wrong this game is a great f2p with friends and such. but if you are playing this game without microtransactions the game should be renamed grinding and paywalls: the videogame",1
"once you get this game, youll be playing it non-stop!",1
"not my fav but i would recommend to people that like stealth,tower defense,and action.",1
"i absolutley recommend this game - it has a great flow and the pace is extremely fast and exiting!",1
"a lot of fun albeit repetitive. if youre looking to purchase additional warframes for plat, dont. its far more economical to purchase plat during steam sales or when you get 75% off during a login reward then buy the items you want from other players. ...or grind your butt off! nearly everything is available for free however the catch is that you only have a certain number of slots to store your frames and weapons. you can save additional platinum by getting items from alert missions. d/ling the wf alerts app is highly recommended. also, loki is amazing. choose that frame after your tutorial. the wikia is your warframe bible. there is theorycrafting and optimal character building in this game and youll find this reference highly valuable. complete maps then do nightmare modes for rare dual-stat mods. some are much easier than others and you can abort and restart if you get things like no shields opon starting the mission. hit me up in-game!",6
"the depth in this game is surprising, it is very entertaining although the controls can be a little lacking.",1
"itll make your friends think you have a problem, and your parents will think youre just doing drugs in your room the whole time. 10/10",5
"this game is just amazing. content + space + ninjas + kickass weapons + zombies + aliens + robots = a ing brilliant game = warframe",3
"very good game i enjoy it .but i would like more sword swings like combos and stuff would be great.still this game is amazing try it because is epic",1
"ive been playing warframe for a while, and i have to say that it is a pretty good game. any bugs that are found in-game are almost instantly fixed by the next day in their very frequent bug fixes and updates. i feel that this shows a dedication to the consumers to provide a very enjoyable gaming experience. i feel that the gameplay is very invigorating and engaging, keeping you on your toes most of the time. its a multiplayer game, even though you do have the option of playing solo. you have a wide variety of customizations for your warframes cosmetically, and stat wise. overall, i think that this game is great, and that anyone who reads this should give it a try. its free to play, even though you can pay real money to make micro-trasnactions in-game for special items. i give warframe a 9/10",1
"really fun and enjoyable. you have to have patience while playing though. building anything can take quite a few hours.",1
"ive played this game so much that when i try playing a different game, i just find myself playing more warframe",8
"the game is really fun there may be some things that cost money but if u work hard u can get it without spending a penny",2
"this game is really fun and its free to play. a recent update allows people to build up a dojo which is a housing for your clan where you can perform research, build new rooms, etc etc. as you play, you upgrade your gear, install new mods onto them and upgrade your mods. you can also farm materials and craft equipment and other things from them. each warframe has a different set of skills and there are several warframes to play. join me in this awesome game and join my dojo!",2
"if you like fun fast games, get it. it has hundreds of customizationamabababls. youre like a ninja that kills ugly things , so you get to make the solar system just a bit less ugly. theres lots of warframes and weaps too so theres variety there. its not that fun when youre playing alone tho. so get a fwend and pleh.",5
"this game is a ton of fun; the art direction and visuals are stunning; and the overall controls are great fun to master--i recommend this game to any that want a fun third-person romp. well done, digital extremes.",3
"its a fun game after you learn how it all works. they are always adding new content and its free to play.",6
"its free, its awesome, its parkouring space shooting with melee weapons and abilities mixed in, get it.",1
"great game, time-eater but giving satisfaction from completing a quest or crafting a new frame.",4
"feels like a full-game, every time i play i forget its free-to-play.",4
"i have put in nearly 200 hours and still counting. i quite fancy this game. the different environments and classes of enemies bring some interesting variety to the table. all the maps are randomly generated so farming for those materials to build weapons or new frames isnt quite as tedious. equippable mods can make you that super serious player to kick some bum or that silly player that shoots exploding arrows which just might kill you too. this game is still in beta so things are constantly changing! whichever your play style, i believe that there is a little bit for most everyone to enjoy this game. not enjoying it? try playing with friends! :) 9/10",2
"this game is pretty fun... i did not enjoy it that much but if you have a gaming computer on high graphics? you will not bee dissapoint...",1
"space ninjas with delicious buns. 40/10, will play until the end of time.",4
"i know this may seem odd, and i love this game non the less. but it felt oddly like global agenda, it runs smoothly, overall i can say it is a great game, addicting, time consuming, and fun to play. whats to say thats bad about this game?",1
"very entertaining, fast-paced action. i love the style of combat as well as all of the customization and the feeling of being unique that back it up.",3
"warframe is truly a wonderful games that ticks all of my boxes. its god the best sci-fi feel, best action and of course the ninja feeling to it. you can choose what you want to do when it comes to missons, want to go in guns blazing? go ahead or if you prefer a more stealth approach to it then again, go ahead. the sound has improved dramatically over the years of warframe and is really been a milestone for the developers to be proud of. they always surprise us with every update whether it be small or big. the music is perfect, it really does add the best theme you can get to battles and of course the music varies from battle to battle. the design is just the key symbol of warframe, why you ask? see for yourself, its just perfect. every little detail digital extremes puts into the game always made the game more beautiful. the lighting is very dynamic, its not too bright and not too dark in missions while keeping the good mix of lights to create the desired atmosphere. gameplay in my opinion does need a bit of working, i just think warframe is really hard to get into when you start as it only gets good when you start getting a real challenge. digital extremes did a good job when it came to ninjas, i mean come on, you get to do parkour. you get to run on walls while shooting and perform attacks with your sword in mid air flight. thats all i can say really, well there is one more thing. get the game. youll wish you played this game a long time ago. 10/10.",7
"robots and ninjas. whats more to love? 11/10 would ninja again",1
"hands down among the top 5 free to play games currently available.",8
"this is essentially buggy mcgrindwall: the game. if youre into latex coated space ninjas then its certainly one of the best options out there and can be loads of fun, but beware as once you decided there is an item/weapon/etc that you want, you will be forced to grind countless missions to get the parts, credits, and resources for it. in the case of prime items, you need to grind for keys, and then grind the keys for the parts, and then grind certain bosses for resources (which can be up to 30+ runs in total for certain items provided you dont get the drop every time as usual). over all, this game can be extremely tedious, the stealth is half- and impractical, but has many other fun elements that make it worth it for the gameplay. provided of course your ui doesnt bug out and stop you from clicking anything 5 times in an hour.",6
"good game, a lot of missions and objectives , a lot of planets , realistic animations , good graphics , a lot of good things. 5 stars from 5",2
"pretty sweet game but i played this game for a week and got bored of it.",1
"extremely good game! and im only a few hours in lol",1
"this game is a very fast past game and it is full of adventure i highly recommened",1
"this game is so fun. if you enjoyed the mass effect franchise, do give this a go. plus, the art direction and graphics are beautiful.",1
"this game is amazing, great graphics, but a little laggy.",2
"great 3rd person shooter/fighter game with great co-op potential for up to 4 friends. good and incredibly friendly community both in-game and through support forums, this is by far one of my preferred games to play, when i dont want to feel the need to catch up to anyone or anything! plus.. space ninjas.. who doesnt friggin love space ninjas?! 8.5/10!",2
"i love it because i get to know what it looks like if im an alien. :d",1
"power armor...spells...killing stuff...what not to like?",1
"this is a very good game to play if you love action; and adds to the plate with a unqiue diveristy to other games.",1
"so i played warframe a lot during the beta. maybe a little to much to where i out did my self on the game and then it just got boring. it started to get boring though when shotguns came into play and anyone who had one could whipe the floor of any mission. later on i come back and see they changed everything. while some is nice i hate most all of the changes made. not to mention the gameplay is still boring however all co op style games are boring and are even more so if one person is able to do all of the work for you. kinda like boarderlands 2 its dull as hell. i havent yet beat it because after the first 30 mins its just straight up boring to me. warframe is fun playing it alone though as a single player or sometimes with one other person if they do not have something overpowered. i got this one guy in my clan into the game...he is addicted. he has over 3k almost 4k hours into it.",2
"this game is very promising. a beginners guide would help; after the initial training session i was taken to a big overview mapmenu with basically no information on how to navigate it/what to do.",1
"more fun than a fat girl and a tub of crisco. i recommend that anyone who loves fpss and mmos give this a try.",5
"one of the most interesting projects of 2013 that flowed into 2014 that ive seen. the game has all what a gamer needs. guns, fancy karate gimmicks, swords. two words: space ninjas. what is actually good that the game even tho is f2p but it does not follow a shadowy p2w path. you might be confused in the beggining, as getting the stuff, crafting, locations and controls. but when you get over it, you might as well like it. another aspect that drives the attention. constant new content updates from very friendly developers. i might add that devs do take in considiration players ideas and implement ideas and throughts into a real thing. almost all the stuff ingame can be aqquired just by playing the game, you just need to get over the beggining. but this game is still in beta. there could be bugs, there could be flaws. currently devs implement tons of content every two months (aprox). in general this is a game that you might totally like or just play for two minutes and uninstall. playing with friends is recomended.",7
"do you recommend this game? of course i will, because its damn good and fast action game. its about team work and you would not miss it because it is not like other games like pay to win. here, everything depends on your skills and reaction, about your accuracy and moving style. so go on and download it. you wont be disapointed.",1
"this game should not be free to play. it is that good.",8
"awesome games, good graphics, good gameplay, and many more. love this games :*",1
"fun and exciting game. thats like all i have to say.",7
"the pinacle of mmo adapted to fps. third person adds to the overall experiance, custimization is to die for, graphics are next gen. i would advise this game to anyone and find a single person who didnt enjoy.",4
"good game for cooperative players. fun misions. overall 7/10",1
"good game for free to play with fun and interesting combat and teamplay but it has several severe flaws which are that it has a bad payment model, things are overpriced and you are required to buy more slots for warframes and weapons i u want more then two. secondly the game becomes very repeatitive and there is not very much metagame. the last thing is that it is very difficult to get interested in this game starting off due to its repeativeness.",3
"warframe has a few quirks here and there but you should not just give this a glance. invest at least a good hour and youll form a new passion to the free-to-play lifestyle 8.5/10",6
"this game is an example of free to play done (mostly) right, which is very rare. you, a member of the tenno race, are equiped with suits known as warframes, each with unique stats and powers. it is your mission to aid in the war between the tenno, grineer, corpus, and infested. admitadly, the game plays like a standard third person shooter, where it really shines is all of the different weapons and mods just waiting to be discovered, like bows to assault rifles, health increases to abilities. its not without its problems, though. the game is littered with microtransactions, and while optional, grinding isnt fun unless you have friends. oh yeah, this game has a standard 4 player co-op system too, which it is usually designed around. overall, i would suggest getting this game with a very open mindset.",6
"despite my username and avatar, i dont go in much for fpss. i still love this game. its a lot like mass effect multiplayer, with the addition of martial arts flick acrobatics. good balance so far in the freemium aspects -- new equipment comes along fast enough (particularly when playing with friends) that i dont feel screwed by not paying money for it. looking forward to how this game develops over time.",2
"free to play, still in beta, but worth a try if you havent checked it out yet. great aesthetic, addictive and visceral gameplay that manages to be smooth and fluid. lots of variety in play. really worth a shot. and free. so what have you got to lose?",7
"so far this has been my favorite free to play title. the amount of time ive poured into this since i started is kind of insane...",1
"robot ninja wizards in space is probably a better title.",7
"new hud every month, blur, bloom, flashing lights.. expensive colors... expensive scarves.. expensive skins.. expensive robot parts..  network.. laggy servers.. ded community.. im still playing it since alpha so it must be good for something 10/10 would go blind again",2
"spent hundreds of hours on this game, this game is really fun when you play with your friends. warframes are unique and the majority are worth getting and trying out.",3
"after watching the legend of the drunken master starring jackie chan and every bruce lee and tony jaa movie known to man i was finally qualified to join the warframe community. after picking my first warframe (loki) i traveled across the stars slaying untold horrors. but my blade was sturdy and my spirit strong, infested, grineer, corpus i cut them all down. hordes of enemies like a flood would droun me if it werent for my amazing ninja abilities i would have been defeated. warframe is amazing, and its free! only other game on my steam library with over a few hundred played. it is well worth it. the graphics are just beautiful for such a game and they dont even put stress on your computer, the warframe varities, levels, modifiers, weapons and customization leave you satisfied. not to mention the many different game modes to choose from and massive amounts of planets to trek across. you are a badass ninja fighting through the galaxy with your amazing suit (warframe) abilities and destructive weapons that can all also be modified with mods you find. best free game i know of. i highly recomend it.",4
"warframe is the best free to play game so far and i recommend it to most people cause its fun to play co-op with people, and ninja-aliens in it so why not =d .",1
"its free, try it. game is fun with friends, good graphics, and plays nicely. problem for me was how repetitive it is.",1
"when there was aliens i went to doctor and bout a cheese bottle andi ate it for free. when i lept i saw aliens were dead and bick  in my hand. so i cooked it and made soup",1

"this is a game that is fast and a fun shooter. need i say more?",2
"this game is a masterpiece, there are some things here and there they could fix. bugs aside, its great game, and i highly reccomend (recomend? i cant even spell) it to anyone who loves shooters.",9
"lets see... how can i describe this game?  yeah third person space ninja assassin with a katana who goes around killing people, and saving the galaxy, and he can walk up walls and . get it. its fre, and it gives me an erection.",1
"got stuck in a wall as all of the enemies lost control of their limbs and flailed around, 10/10 would have a seizure again.",5

"started playing this game two days ago, and has been running smoothly so far. the co-op gameplay is really impressive and fun to play. theres always the option to get into a mission by yourself and hope that people are going to join you, but some missions arent well-balanced for solo play. the graphics of the game is okay and most critically, theres no lag or ping display anywhere. theres a good variety of guns to choose from, including really powerful bows that can pin enemies against the wall, i think the swordsman archetype was a little overplayed, the melee combat here is also satisfyingly weighty. charged attacks that can cut enemies clean in half are their own reward. one of warframes significant issues at the moment is its failure to display important information, especially in the mission-select interface, other than that the game was pretty well made and i will recommend this game to all who are looking for some fun in co-op gameplays.",1
"this game is a great mixture of third person shooter, sci-fi, and ninja all bundled up into one great free-to-play game. has great variation of enemies and is loads of fun with friends. i highly recommend this game to anyone especially if you like third-person shooters and the",6
"this game is amazing! i havent played it for long, but, i spent a good amount of time trying it out for the first time. may i say... bravo! jumping around in a space ninja suit is awesome... choose your playstyle! stealthy or plain rambo, this game allows either! smooth interface, incredible graphics, an immersive selection of mulitplayer and solo missions... and extremely satisfying mechanics! the only way you can be disappointed is if you dont have a good enough pc! this game is flat out amazing! the best part... all of this for free!",1
"wanna be a badass futuristic shooter ninja, runing on walls, sliding on the floor with a mix of magic ? dont even think twice, its free and awesome !",1
"its a pretty good game , but gets a bit repetitive and the level designs of the first two worlds seem to be quite similar. the ninja movement is quite fun to experiment with , as their isnt really any tutorial to tell you each individual jump. either way this is a good game to play with others or even on your own. i recommend this game to anyone whos into ninja mechanics and tps.",1
"warframe is a good 3rd person shooter and its free so cant complain.",1
"`warframe` is a very good game and slightly like prince of persia where you can sprint across walls, the reason why i think this game is good is because you can purchase weapons and most of all play and enjoy all of the missions.i would definately recommend this game to any sort of player.",1
"fast-paced, high octane space ninja action, what more could you want? i mean, come on, space ninjas.",9

"if you liked the me 3 multiplayer, youll love this. lovely little f2p game that has a lot of potential in the beta stages.",7
"an extremely fun, fast paced and challenging third person shooter. different warframes provide a wide variety of play experiences and the number of different mission types and environments stops the core gameplay getting boring. definitely worth a try.",5
"great game for a beta it has a few glitches here and there but thats what all betas have right?",1
"the best free-to-play from launch ive ever played. this game is fast, fun, stylish and very enjoyable. so much so that i paid for it after the first 40 hours! try it out and see if you like it; youve got nothing to lose but time.",5

"closed beta player here. warframe is an excellent action tps about, well, space ninjas. the gameplay is great and its aesthetics have improved a lot. with an unique art style and fun, fast paced gameplay, this f2p game is fantastic and you should try it out.

"pros: -good graphics -fun gameplay -lots of weapons to choose from cons: -expensive items in market -expensive in-game currency. but it a fun game you know. but im not sure why platinum is expensive, its still in open beta. would be better if there was credit to platinum exchange or be able to buy everything in the market with credits. i only reccomend this game for people who have lots of cash to spend on to support the devs or for people who want to experience a fun coop sci fi action game with friends or other people.",2
"quite fun to play online and alone, only thing that felt bad was limited inventory slots, that you have to buy with real money.",1
"fast-paced, pve, sci-fi with an incredible art direction. and its free! and its fun!",3
"got a ton of hours, lol and dota2 just not filling your daily grind, and like to jump around being tech ninja? then warframe is chances are for you. a game still rising up from a beta status, its pretty damn repetative for sure, but it at least offers you some goals to reach out towards. better gear, upgrading gear, upgrading cards to enhance gear, and the long grind to get just one more warframe suit to use. it will take you hours, inclduing after the recent updates, to see progress, but in a f2p enviroment, thats kinda given isnt? on that note, for the most part, it is pay to go faster, as ( anything outside of colors and extra slots ) can be earned without spending a cent onto the game...if you are pacent enough anyway...",2
"this game is fun and comes out with lots of new content it is simply awesome",2
"this game is too good to be free to play, become the space ninja you always wanted to be. slice your enemies and use your powers and abilities to eliminate your foes in the snap of your fingers. grab a couple of friends and save the system. (good game)",4
"the new standard in which all free-to-play games should strive for. digital extremes has raised the bar once again since they first created unreal tournament. warframe is simply pure bliss to play.",3
"well, this game is kinda out of my expection. not just a simple shooting and cuting game...this game has a very unique weapon and mods system, and you can also craft your own weapon and gear. (that means you dont need to waste your money in the online shop, unless you love showing off...) although it is almost impossible for low level players to solo most of the maps, it is a online game..so....why not make a team with other people. ( ps: the main reason why i love this game is because .....hint: metal gear )",3
"probably my favorite free game our there right now, others include path of exile, ghost recon online, league of legends, and loadout. this is a great example of how the business model in a f2p game should be. any item that you can buy for real money, you can easily get for free. anything that you cant get for free is purely cosmetic. graphics are great for a free game, and crafting a new gun or warfame just never seems to get boring. it is kind of a grindfest though, and after spending almost 200 hours into this, im starting to get burnt out... its still in beta and ive heard that the devs are gonna start to change things a bit, make it more interesting. as it stands now its a must play. its free, so theres nothing to lose :).",4
"ever played mass effect 3 multiplayer? this is very similar, except it most of the game modes are more akin to dungeon runs than static defense. that being said, shooty stabby space ninja super funtime is quite entertaining. very fast paced gameplay.",5
"its fun to pass the time and having patience will get you anything in the game.",7
"this game is epic, with amazing gameplay, amazing graphics, and it is just really fun to go around as these alien ninjas.... 1 tip though... dont forget to use your special moves that you learn before anything else.... epic game",1
"listen, ive been playin this bad boy since the get go and ive watched it grow and prosper so mark my words: when this game releases it will be the best 3rd person shooter ever. possible catch 22: this game has been in beta for 3 and a half years.",8
"its a rather addictive game, and i like playing with kubrow genetics. trying to get an interesting one :o",2
"this is one high graphiced game with a great story line love it",1
"great game! very good co-op if you wanted to play something with your friends. however the solo gameplay is just as good. even though you can buy things in the game with real money it is not a pay to win game, as long as you play regularly you will be able to get the best gear just like everyone else. highly recommend the game!",3
"im not reccomending this game because of its core dynamics (farm fo dayz) im reccomending it because it can be something better within the coming years/months. my only plea is that they make sure that the main story line is good for holding out for so long, and to decrease some mod drop rates and to decrease the time needed to create warframes/weapons. this game has a lot of potential and i enjoy watching it grow.",1
"warframe is a very nice looking game with pretty decent performance compared to the graphics, this game may take some time to get used to but in the end it will become very fun there are lots of items to craft and collect and lots of weapons and warframes to choose from. 8.5/10",1
"amazing co op f2p game that can be played for quite a long time without paying any money. not at all a pay to win.",1
"is the best shooter ive played, because it combines futuristic guns and melee attacks, also parkour.",1
"warframe has incredibly imursive gameplay, it is free to play and is not pay to win, sure you can unlock most things much quicker but everything in the game is accessible without paying except for skins which is really cool. the multiple experiance systems really brings a strong dynamic of replayablity and scaling to the game!",2
"this game is pretty fun but i would say its kinda easy. maybe make it a little less predictable.",1
"for a free to play game it is simply amazing. the amount of customization and changing gameplay beats many pay-to-play that i own. the best part is this title is not built around model where you are forced to pay $ to progress, everything can be created through collecting resources and money. put 20+ hours and still finding new types of missions and more features that i didnt know were in the game.",3

"warframe is a great sci-fi thirdperson shooter. the shooting feels great playing in the suits or warframes feels great. the abilities are fun to use. and it seems to run fine on my old laptop. the game is still being updated and there are events quite often. there is actually a story in the game, not the best, not the worst. the game uses a easy-to-use card-based modding system to up your abilities, weapons etc. plus: -great variety of weapons and warframes. -everything in the game can be get without purchasing, except warframe and weapons slots. -you get 70 platinum (in-game currency.) to use when starting. i recommend spending them on weapon and warframe slots. -clan system and customisable dojo. -big and easy-to-use card-based modding system to upgrade your gear. -lots of different planets and missions. -play with your friends using the in-game invitation system or play with random people via the in-game matchmaking. -randomly generated levels. cons: -the levels are randomly generated but they look the same a lot. -the prices in the shop are sometimes absurd. -a few bugs and glitches here and there but the game is in openbeta. -some of the mechanics are sometimes unexplained. like the parcour mechanic. -foundy crafting is really irritating. -joining a session via matchmaking is sometimes pretty irritating and sometimes just doesnt work. the game is still receiving updates and new weapons, warframes etc. i give this game a 8.5/10.",1

"its diffrent from most games but its sooo fun. the only problem i had so far is how many warframes and weapon slots you can have. its annoying cause you have to spend money for more slots. but from that its one of my top games atm.",3
"various abhumans battle thru the heavens! cheap as free! shoot many things and collect much stuff in the pursuit of sweet nectarine power! your search is potentially endless, but enjoyable would suggest participating if you enjoy guns and space",1
"i have spent (unbeknownst to me) over 300 hours playing this game and i have nothing but positive things to say. despite the fact that many free-to-play games often require you to pay in order to progress, this isnt true with warframe. as ive learned from the very beginning you could play for hours-upon-hours without having to spend a single penny. it wasnt until i was nearing 100 hours that i realized how much i enjoyed this game. not only that, but i also thought that investing in (platinum for) the game would only help make my already-pleasant experience even better. warframe has evolved alot in the small amount of time that ive played it. through player purchases the developers have added new maps, new mods, a killer melee battling system, and outstanding and unique missions and modes that only add to the spontaneity of this game. just imagine a game that mixes ninja gaiden with call of duty with vanquish. from my own personal experience, its worth checking out - especially if youre a college student (like myself) and are strapped for spending money on the new games coming out every-so-often. give this game a shot and im sure you will come to find at least a few things that make warframe a fun, great, and unique experience. game on. - lenny",3
"rating: ++++ very fun game, however you do need to put some time in it and get into the game to get good gear and stuff like that. one very big plus of this game is that all gear can be crafter with resouces you gain troughout the game, so even if you dont have the money you can still have everything that somone who pays also has. with the exeption of a few decorational stuff wich does not affect gameplay.",3
"mass effect gameplay with more creation and less plot based aspects",3

"awesome shooter game. recommend for all who like a good scifi action game.",2
"simply and stunningly amazing.i recommend it to all who play games",1
"a fun co-op fps with leveling elements. in addition to your characters, your account, weapons and minions gain levels as you progress. with higher levels, you can apply modules to your items, increasing various attributes in them. modules themselves are drops, and the module collecting and building your gear mechanics feel like deck building in a collectible card game. the game is peer-hosted, which probably helps keep the game free to play, but also means that you will sometimes end up playing on a server that is hosted on a connection that cant handle the bandwidth requirements of four players. this can be somewhat resolved with ping-filtering peers, especially if you have the connection and cpu power to host yourself. almost everything in the game can be obtained without paying real money (except character/weapon slots), but as usual, time is money, and helps you progress faster.",2
"amazing game. repetitive but addiciting and fun. once youve started getting far in the game u are bassicly forced to spend real currency to advance. if money isnt to much of a problem its an amazing game!",2

"cut a man with a mushroom-shaped head in half. 11/10",1

"warframe while not being the best f2p games i have played is defiantly one of the better ones. while it is true that you spend alot of time grinding, and that the silver(ingame currency paid with real money) is oddly expensive those do not take away the fun of the game.",1
"awesome game! pretty sure the most addictive ive played in a long time.",2

"warframe...its unbelievably amazing. graphics are great, smooth gameplay, its very fun and addicting. im suprised its not #1 on free-to-play steam games.",2
"this game is alot of fun and quite addictive when you get into it. the game is constantly being butchered to death, balance wise, by its developer though. there are also a ton of bugs and really strange design choices that wonder if the people in charge are mentally handicapped or have actually ever played any video games before. great game overall though. just be prepared for bugs bugs and more bugs. be prepared for things being nerfed when they dont need to be and things that do need to be nerfed being left alone.",4

"a fun, 4 player, co-op game that is relatively easy to understand. been a favourite amongst my friends and i for a while now, would recommend! the gameplay is wonderful, bringing together elements from third-person-shooters, rpgs and mmos and combining them into something new. the graphical design is nothing short of beautiful, dazzling the players with a variety of levels and effects! the audio quality is great. there is nothing nicer than hearing the drums of war start to play rhythmically as you enter battle. finally, the community is large, diverse and friendly.",9
"love this game, been playin since befor i used steam and was using raptr. awesome gameplay, easy to use controller support, vived lush graphics, excellent voices, tons of content with new content added regularly, and fun co-op. super fun game to play for free. now for gripes (though very few), the story is very lacking, its not really in your face you have to be looking for it but there is one, also this game gets seriously repetitive and if your not playing with friends or a team that talks as you play... you get bored and last but not least.... this game is a epic grind. if you dont wanna spend money to get other warframes or speed up the process of leveling and crafting this game will eventually make you put it down because of repetitive grinding. that being said... this game is awesome and i recommend anyone give a shot... its free for goodness sake! and lets not comment on the epicness of playing this on a big 1080 tv with surround sound, and dualshock 4, and steams awesome big picture mode!",4
"awesome game. lots of grinding but thats the fun of it all, meeting new players or having fun with a group of friends. f2p only charging for cosmetics as everything else is craftable(be patient, it can take up days to craft some items.) overall, an 8.9/10 in my book. solid gameplay, plenty of cool weapons and warframes to give a try. just dl it and play already! :)",1

"this is a fast paced 3rd person shooter. in the short time i have been playing this game, there have been 2 major updates. both have improved the game play and longevity of the game. i have enjoyed both of the live events i was able to participate in. generally this is a game where you are going to have to experiment with different warframes ( classes) and wepon combinations to find your happy place. once you learn the intricacies of useing and powering up the mods for your warframes and weapons you are sure to have some fun. this is a free to play game with a cash shop, but never fear you can find most everything, other than cosmetic items, through game play.",1

"become a badass ninja to be the best ninja in the uninverse or",1
"incredible for a free game, has alot of content most of which can be gained through the game itself, some things have to be bought using the premium currency but thats mostly just for looks, also its one of the only mmos ive seen with direct combat! very fun, very much recommended!",3
"well if you like killing things and i mean killing things this game does that..... endless kill with tha ability to craft new and power full wepons. there are wepons for evey playthrough stile from stealth to guns loaded tanking. this game can repeat its self but even then its still a good game. good enough for me to play over 150 hours",7

"pretty fun game but it can get monotonous and grindy if you play solo. overall you should give it a try!",1
"best free to play game in awhile. most free to pay are freemium; wear cash can make overly powered. but this not the case with warframe. there is in store cash only items ,but most weapons and warframes can be got with simply time and effort. combine with combat composed both mele and ranged it makes for a fairly enetetaining mmo",3
"good game a bit slow in the lower levels but stick with it . and for all the new players out there i got one word for you soma.",2
"freaking awsome game. 10/10 will lose my life to this game.",10

"this is by far one of the best free games i have ever played. the maps can get a little repetative but the missions are different which is a huge plus. you can play with friends and start a clan, and lots of options to upgrade, whether you want to pay or not. would totally recommend this game.",1

"this is a stellar f2p game. very fluid looks great, gets you hooked just like a well made game should thanks digital extremes this is a great game. my only quarrel is the market pricing seems a bit off, some things seem to expensive or too cheap for the effort involved in building vs. buying.",3
"warframe is a great way of playing some f2p 3rd person shooter action. warframe is still in beta, and it seems that the devs are happy to take on board advice from the fans, so hopefully a few of the details that could use polish still have a chance to be completed. with the price of entry a flat nothing, it would be a shame to miss out on quite a bit of fun to be had here.",3
"space robot magic ninja warriors fight potato people, evil robots and zombie plants. and its amazing as . you should totally buy it. except its free. you can buy wepons for irl  but its pve so  off. also game is grind-based (but i mean you kill  and its awesome so its not bad grind ok?) so if you buy  you want then why are you even playing.",2
"brilliant, great design and a must for anyone. also free :)",1
"good co-op 3rd person shooter. graphic is good enough for a free to play game. games mechanic is a bit hard to learn, but youll get the hang of it soon enough. the action during missions is often fast paced and some of them are a real challenge. i would eecommend this game to those who like dead space mixed with some mmorpg mechanics (farming loot, craft better equip, etc.) not recommended for those who dislike farming and crafting",1
"love this game so addicted probably put 60 bucks into it lol",2
"highly addictive with great gameplay, leveling system, and item crafting!",2
"warframe is essentially a grind-fest with fantastic gameplay and visuals. it borrows heavily from diablo-style loot drops, although none of this is explained in-game. i recommend using a wiki if you fall in love with this game, as it has a suprisingly deep character customization set, though dont expect to get much visual upgrades as most of the mods that drop function essentially like a mmo-talent tree. lots of fun, but bring friends if you plan on sticking around.",1
"amazing graphics. interesting plot. game of the year. 8/10",1

"despite of all in-game bugs that sometimes trouble me, i think, this game is a very well-made free to play game. i dont really like third person shooter. but this, this game is very challenging. it makes me want to play it again and again. it challenges your brain to really think, which step should you take while you proceed your mission. and i totally recommend this game for any people who likes tps. for a free to play game, this is a magnificent tps game.",2

"this game shows you what a free to play game is its free to play and if you want things faster you can pay money but it will only give you stuff faster but it will not make you better staying free only means you need to spend more time to get what you want and also its a really cool and fun game to play co-op with your friends warframe clan: gamefriendsunited join the fight now!!!",3
"didnt look all that great of a game from the video,but i decided to give it a try and it was well worth it. its like tmnt except you play as space ninjas with a lot of cool weapons and character upgrades and different versions to pick from depending on what type of role you want to play.",1
"it is the awesome game ever but it has some complications to it. you use chips to buy responds if you die in the game you respond back, but eventually you waste those chips and you have to use real money to buy more and i love the game but please who ever made it. get rid of the buy more chips it is super annoying",1
"there is a voice inside me. somewhere deep down in the fossilising lobes of my brain resides an eager mouth that calls in from my past. it is a youthful me, filled with irrational exuberance. it looks at the art and sci-fi glamour-gloom of warframe and says: this is the stuff!",3
"this game is amazing, good graphics, good gameplay, never get bored.",8
"the fact theres a 92,99 euro dlc for this game makes me think all sorts of stuff.",1
"a great game. i wasted my whole summerbreak with it.",2
"free to play, pretty interesting at the beginning... but requires a lot of grinding if you dont want to pay for it. i would recommend it - you can spend a couple of evening having fun, but dont expect staying there for too long.",1
"the game its self is a fine game, to me the combat system is good and it runs smoothly. the only thing that gets me is that you need platinum to get pretty much everything, from wepons to other characters",1
"try this game and stick with it for 1-2 weeks before deciding if you like the game. i really do like this game. the graphics are awesome. the gameplay fast, furious and wrapped in good artistic style (and the gore is.....jolly good). highly recommended if you like co-op game and or action game. the only gripe is platinums are a bit overpriced though redeemingly you do not need themt to craft anything in game except to buy slots for your weapons and warframes(armored suits).",1
"amazing game, tons of replay value, outstanding end game content. the game kinda lacks customization but the story makes up for it 100%",8
"well i wouldnt have 300+hrs on record if it wasnt good. beatifull game, good community, user friendly, no p2w, and a lot of fun when playing co-op with friends. 10/10",5
"i dont know why i like it but i find my self very attracted to this game",1
"they need to work on it atm i cant play will not let me get on to the game as if i put my password were it is incorret good and fun game i hope they can work on it",2
"this game is amazing i love all the weapons and the customization of your warframe and there is a lot to do in the game like going to all planes and you can builed weapons and you can get mods for your weapons and warframe there is a lot to do on it you will be up all night have fun and be the best ninja warframe you can be",5
"if you like grinding/farming - space ninja style, warframe is a game for you. if not, dont bother downloading at all.",3
"after you get out of the starter gear you really get into the game.",1
"this a great game and fun to play with friends. the powers, acrobatic, and gunplay and swordplay are amazing. but this game is money hungry, to get weapons and different classes youll have to to wait and pay alot of in-game currency and it tempts you to buy another in-game currency that you have to buy with real life money which allows to buy weapon and classes and not have to wait hours to make. if you can look past not having all the great weapons(not the best) at the begining or for a little while this game is for you.",1
"this game is really fun and very addictive. everything on the game is achievable! all have fun",3
"this is a great free game ive spent so much time playing this game that my real life problems just seemed to disapear. such as money, women, and activeness. this game is an amazing looking game that when i feel like going outside i just go on the earth map and stare at the sun but for not to long because i dont want to go blind. the relistic feeling about being outside is really amazing that it hurts less that i havent left my house in 3 years. but overall this game is amazing it would be awasome if i had people to play it with but everybody just isnt as cool as me.",5
"super ing awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"takes forever to get new equipment, but its an overall fun game. the developers are churning out a decent amount of new content on a regular basis, which is nice considering more f2p games dont get as much attention. once you get the blueprints needed for new gear, finding materials to craft it can be a bit of a bother. once you find the materials, you have to wait hours and sometimes days to craft the item you want. real time. that really kills the momentum of the game when youre forced to wait so long to continue playing with the items you want. of course, if you can afford the incredibly expensive platinum currency, waiting wont be an issue. they have to make money somehow, right? the only other negative i can think of is the melee combat. for a game based around it being known as mass effect online with swords, it doesnt have much going for the melee. attacks can sometimes be difficult to land in rapid succession, and the damage done doesnt warrant using anything besides jumping and charged attacks. everything besides that is great. graphics, sound, controls, everything is appealing and easy to pick up. definitely one of the best free-to-play games ive ever enjoyed.",1
"warframe is an action packed alien-ninja game that is combines a strange passion for weapons!",1
"extremely fun, particularly with friends. new tilesets are being added almost every update, and where once there were a handful of re-used levels, theyre moving rapidly towards one or several unique looks for every planetary sector. player customization, while unfortunately heavily cash-gated, is constantly growing. weapon variety is everything you could want, and again, is still growing. enemies and bosses are varied, and even with that variety, the devs have confirmed a fourth hostile faction to be added at a later date. in short: this game has quite a few strong points that grow stronger with every update. one caveat: be prepared to exercise either patience or your credit card. new stuff is either crafted very slowly or bought for an assload of dosh. i can forgive the bugs because its still open beta, and they do correct them fairly quickly. however, the frankly absurd exchange rate of platinum versus actual goods bought hurts it in my opinion, as that gating has turned almost a dozen of my friends off from joining. 8/10",8
"what can i say about warframe that hasnt already been said? space ninjas. grinding. awesome combat thanks to melee 2.0. (look it up, or better yet, play it!) i would recommend joining a clan though, the best gear is clan research. the grinding can be reduced by buying boosters or actually buying the items from the store. however, thats horrifically expensive and makes me think that the devs want you to grind and play the game. the shops there for the few impatient people who need everything and need it now. tl;dr, play it, its free.",2
"this is one of the best free to games that i have ever played. basically its about space ninjas and every ninja has its own powers and stats. you can also build your own weapons, which is really fun to do because you have to travel to all differant places to get the resources required to make the item you want. the game gives you a lot of things to do but it is a little rough to get into. totally deserves a better rating.",1
"its an awsum rpg game, i love the gameplay and its a very extensive game. amazing graphics and playthroughs. ive already logged in almost 50 hours in a weeks lol",1
"the game is a pretty cool the first few hours but over time the missions and gameplay becomes old.",1
"love this game there forever updating and creating new challanges, you can paint your warframe to what ever colours you wish to your taste, join a clan and help set up your dolo and weapons etc awesome, lots of fun when in a group, and evan if your not, it isnt hard to make friends and have fun.",6
"a third person, co op focused action game at its core  (warframe)",1
"pretty damn good. its great with friends, but it can be just about as good alone/with randoms. it has its issues, namely network issues, but overall itd certainly recommend it.",10
"really cool game and great concept. graphics are a plus. only downfall is it gets pretty repetative quick",1
"i like it! pretty cool !!! worth a try if you have not given it one!",7
"warframe is perfect if you are the type of person that enjoys team cooperation. you may not like it if you dont like having to work for your equipment and things like that. for a free 2 play game warframe is amazing. therefore i would give it a 9.5/10.",1
"free? free? what is this communist garbage. i didnt fight the vietcong in tunisia back in 86, only to see all this free junk poppin up. last thing i got for free was some shrapnel in my  after charlie tossed a grenade in my hooch. i didnt abandon my kids only for this game to remind me of the amount of money ive invested in their futures. i have half a mind to send a letter to the president, detailing such egregious transgressions. let ol president obama know about this little terrorism youve got going on. im no scientist, but you should expect drone strikes. signed, a concerned patriot.",1
"great for people who love sci-fi mmos, and great for people who enjoy third-person shooters.",1
"highly recommend it, definitely the best free to play game ive played so far. its hard to imagine them not charging people for this game. the co-op play is a bit lackluster compared to the single player experience though because the quality of gameplay depends on which user is hosting. so if the user has a very slow upload speed, you could be thrown out of the game or fail the mission because of that. game levels go by very quickly in co-op, but for a very scary and intense immersive experience, i highly recommend just changing the game mode to single player.",10
"its fun but i would recomend having a fast computer procesor",1
"warframe is a f2p game based on a story of a forgotten civilization who awaken,to stop the forces of the enemy that grew. this game is all about playing for fun,unlocking new content, having a clan , socialize with people and more fun. this game is a team-based game , with a co-op feature , a private feature and a solo feature.you begin as a poor tenno,then you will become a master of the old ways. you will find yourself with other people hunting for rare items or even going to kill the bosses that terrorized their army.this game if fun, i recommend it! if you want a help you can contact me in game /w ufcolonel and me and my clan will assist you! :d",4
"this game is soooooooooooo good but the one thing u need to do is put atleast 50 bucks into it for it to be funnny lasting",2
"probably the best online game released to date and ever expanding. constant new content being added weekly and plenty of fun to go around. it definetly will not disappoint you.",4
"great game, it has alot of customization (however it is not in cosmetical changes) and plenty of gameplay. you dont have to pay-to-play as most people think, it just takes awhile.",1
"so what can i say? its free to play. loads of fun whether its with random players, friends or just solo. graphics are pretty good and the missions are extremely fun! i would recommend you getting this game, why not? its f2p!!!!!",1
"a pretty fun, free to play third person shooter taking place in corridors of space stations and planetside colonies. each suit (warframe) has different abilities to mix and match, and theres a wide variety of guns and melee weapons to collect and level up. the movement is fun and the wall-running, rolling, dodging, sprinting all feel fun to pull off and look pretty cool to boot. there are fairly regular major updates, and the level layouts - although using a lot of the same assets - are somewhat randomly generated, as to keep the gameplay from getting too stale. however, to obtain the higher level gear takes ages collecting materials and crafting, or for you to pony up some cash to just buy them. its grindy as all hell if youre going for the end game experience and dont want to shell out for high level gear, but its still a fun time killer that you dont have to pay for if you dont want to.",1
"great game, especially for a f2p. you dont need spend money to enjoy or advance in this game, everythings pretty much available through plans to assemble items and mats are quite easily farmed in game. varied missions and goals, mobs, and boss fights. the addictive part is leveling your character and its weapons.",3
"a wonderful free to play game that doesnt shove microtransactions down your throat. what more can be asked?",1
"warframe is a very good f2p tps and has a wonderful community of gamers that are easy to get a long with. the game play is smooth and nice graphics but the only problem is there are a lot of maps that seem like you have seen before, meaning it seems like there are maps that they used before but just put a few new things in it. also you can drop a lot of money in the game if you get into it because of different customization for warframs and sentinels. you can also buy weapons with your plat but for the player that just wants have a fun game with not droping a dime there is goos news for you. almost everything you see in the store you can build in game with no real money charges it just takes longer to obtain that item. so i give warframe 8.5/10 and recommend you give it a try!",1
"crazy game.. gotta give thumbsup to the developers.",3
"i didnt think id like a 3rd person sooter at firest, but im thourougly hooked",2
"this game is one of the best fps co-opperation games i have played.from dense action to ninja like silence is the game filled with some bosses have a very unique design and a good back story and few information about their mechanism can turn the table. weapons have their own unique mechanism stats and complex design that every weapons i worth a try and mastering the style of use is a key the battle ground.neither good or evil the tenno stands never alone against his foes the warframe is the strongest weapon and deep story can hide behind the shell what is known is that they are hunting for us fellows tennos so be on the look out.to not get hunted down by the stalker.",4
"this game is bad  and its free. give me a reason you dont want to play it.",1
"warframe has cought me by strom i am not normaly in to games like this but this one has me locked down i hope to see great things to come i give this game currently a 8.5/10",8
"i will not forget this momment when im playin this in game 69/10 would play anytime after doto!",1
"great game, i like it a lot and it keeps on updating and constant evolving...keep up the good work ..to the developers. that aside this game is a good team play and solo too. while at start the control seems to way too hard now it seeems decent but way too convinent yet. and u can earn or get ur way though the game without buying and if buying it makes a great progress too but can be outrunned ..so not an pay to win game best part . the game is still in beta so the bugs keeps bothering u tho it is ok for the part of game and all is good ..so can excuse that.. u can play the way class u like mele or ranged or mixed combo ... its one of the great free to play games u can go and at beggning doin solo might trouble u ...try pubilc host that would help to get ur way out of it . overall a great game u will enjoy ..",5
"good tps. good variety of weapons although some become pretty useless later on in the game. fairly free to play but getting reactors might take awhile since they only come through alerts which you either get or miss out on. warframe alerts is good for that but its still a youre there or youre not.",2
"this game is absolutely beautiful, and criminally overlooked. the developers, though very new to the mmo scene, have been constantly and tirelessly listenning to community input and giving out tons of awesome things to the players that have been around forever, not tomention has somehow predicted almost everything i wanted out of a shooter gae back when i was in like 8th grade or something and to top it all off its 100% free to play, meanng there is no excuse to at leas try it yes its buggy, but its still in its beta test stage. digital extremes has put their all into making an extremely diverse, unimaginably expansive and all-encompassing gameplay that brings several core gameplay types together in a way that synergizes like no other game ive seen, and they manage to do it with a sense of dirty humour that lightens the mood before those pesky server updates that make people restart their games i whole-heartedly recommend warframe to anyone interested in a fun, albeit grindy, experience did i mention its on pc, ps3/4, and xbone? 9.999999999999999999/10 because the menu hub is really laggy for no reason on any computer ive used to play the game, but it doesnt interfere with the gameplay in any way",10
"one of the best game that i have played so far , it fun and never gets boring whit new stuf and missions to to .i only hate that it lags at the start of some missions but it can be tolerated.i give it a 9/10 .and recomend it to every one",2
"slicing and dicing your way through hordes of enemies never felt more satisfying. i highly recommend this for people who love hack and slash games or people who love strategy and planning, this games got plenty of both. i think one of the only cons are that if you have an average (not for gaming, or average laptop) computer, you might want to go to through the graphics settings and turn off all of the motion blur, flashy lights, and lens flares.",1
"this game is tons of fun. the devs obiously listen to their players, and the re-playablity is good, and it has to be considering its kind of a neccesity for the game. i mean we ask for trading, they give us the trading stand. you cant trade weapons or warframes, so not exactly what we wanted, but, hey, theyre trying. in fact, i actually had a friend who didnt like the game because there was no pvp, and that was the case for most people. they asked for it, and they received. the fact that the game devs actually try to please their players is what makes me recommend this game to anyone who is on the fence about playing. the only reason i can see people not liking this game or not playing it is because of the gore in it, and i would hardly call it gore. i mean, there is definatly worse out there. also, the gore is brought upon by the player, not by the game. if you dont want gore, then dont use a katana. so, for any parents reading this, i wouldnt be too worried about this game. for more information on what happens in the game itself, look",1
"such a wonderful game. its a little slow and repetative until you get your second frame.",1
"great game, with a lot of fun to be had. youll have much more fun if you choose to play as part of a group, however. this is not a solo game by any means (even if you reach the point where you can overpower all content outside of the void), and leveling is much faster as part of a team. the game needs more difficult content, though. a well coordinated squad with strong weapons and frames trivializes all content currently in the game.",5
"good game, quite boring in solo but really funny in multiplayers !",1
"fun little action-shooty-time waster with gorgeous graphics and awesome animation. entirely free to play, though with the quality of what the game offers i never felt ripped off buying slots for the killer badass weapons i was able to acquire. quite entertaining and worth the price of admission.",10
"honestly this is a really awesome game you could have a lots of fun with i defently recommend it and this is not just some shity old crap you gotta pay for getting good items no no they actully made crafting and blueprints for this amazing! 8.6/10",1
"warframe is really freaking fun. imagine a good 4-player co-op game like left 4 dead. now make it 3rd person, and add in a whole load more weapons, from magnums to assault rifles to boomerangs with spikes. and give those weapons a levelling option so you can add in extra traits like elemental damage, increased ammor or fire rate, or scenery penetration. then to finish off instead of redneck hicks or token female college students, make the player a magical cyberninja. in space. gameplay is fast and slick, and your warframe is very responsive. the core game is a huge amount of hacky-slashy fun, especially with friends. you can play solo and thats enjoyable enough now and then, but the game adds in more and tougher enemies the more players there are, much like diablo 2 did. you can choose one of three warframes at the beginning, but there are another ten to collect, which is mostly a matter of completing assassination missions that reward you with the requisite parts. you can spend real world money if you like, but its genuinely fun to run the same mission a couple of times because the action is pretty intense, and the levels are randomly generated, so surprises do happen. play warframe, its very enjoyable, and its free. what more could you want?",6
"10/10 but why is my thing loading so long for meta update?",1
"at many times will it be an absoulute grind-fest, but the community is far from toxic(i.e. very helpful and positive) and the gameplay is very fun. weapons range from bows to kunai to a giant greatsword.** 8/10**",1
"best pay to win ever made, it gets really envolving afther you learn about the lore and it actually gets preety adicting. one bad thing about it its that the multiplayer has way too much problems.... ing strict nat but, if you solve that problem, youre really good to go",2
"this is a great game and its free. the only negative thing is that it can get a little bit repetitive and a bit glitchy. the thing i love about this game aswell is that you dont need a good connection to play it in co-op which is great for me. i would recommend playing co-op after the first few mssions as it gets pretty hard after that.",1
"awesome game. i definitely recommend downloading it.",4
"warframe is a sci-fi based third-person shooter. it is a very fun game with replayable stealthy or action played levels. co-op mode is very fun and interactive apart from the fact people steal my kills >.<. other than that i like how i can change my armor, customize my weapons, and use different colors on my character and my trusty blade. me, personally i like to play it stealthy on all missions, but if youre not that type, thats your way of playing :) overall, i love this game with its parkour aspects where as i can run across walls to get to the other side of a pit of lava or acid and i can climd up on a box to straddle over a railing to find myself six feet from an enemy. very fun and lots of cool features i highly reccomend it to shooter fans. :)",1
"this game is quite awesome for being a free-to-play title. fast-paced action, a leveling/modification system with depth, and space-alien-ninjas. what else could you want?",6
"fun as hell, just be sure to bring your friends along for the ride.",2
"for being in an open beta stage, warframe is an amazing game to play. it is really fun, but sure, it takes some time and effort to get into it, that is if you craft or earn everything. in some aspects, people can view it as a pay-to-win kind of game, but people tend to craft more than buy (besides blueprints). you can craft every single item in the game too, and some of which you can craft, you cannot buy. but anyway, i am not about to go into a full depth description of the game. to make a long story short, warframe is awesome.",3
"amazing game... slow at first but quickly speeds up. highly recomended.",2
"really like it so far best free to play game ive tried on steam",1
"great game, great customization and replayability.",2
"game is difficult to start out with, but once you understand the flow of the game, it defines entertainment. do note that this game might become repetitive after so long. however, constantly getting new equipment will mostly remove the dull of repetition.",5
"when it come to free-to-play warframe really stands out. everything in the game (except for exclusive offers that do not make the game pay-to-win) can either be purchased with either time or money. if you want a character asap you can purchase them, or if youre more patient you can find all the parts and build them yourself. everything from the combat to the graphics have been done amazingly and are always being improved. ive watched this game develop over the past year and its almost unbelievable what this game has transformed into. i missed the chance to become a founder and everyday i regret it. theres a huge variety of weapons, warframes (characters), powers (each warframe has their own), power ups, maps, and game styles that make warframe addicting. they have recently added challenges that are loads of fun to play with others online that greatly pay off. they have also listened to their fans and have added pvp matches even when they said they did not see pvp in their vision of warframe. the developers know what theyre doing and their ears are open to their players. if you have not played warframe yet then i highly suggest that you get on it right now! this game is so much fun and can be even more fun if you play with your friends. if you have played warframe but its been a few months then you should give it another chance; there have been many updates and the game has been improved in every way.",1
"warframe is one of my favorite games, it has some of my favorite things. lots of guns swords and anything to fit your style tons of costomization play with frinds play alone very graphic free crafting rp hard",4
"awsome game! you should get this! i have the worst computer and it runs really well!",1
"this game is very fun, it was one of the first f2p i tried and honestly its one of my favorite. you play a a in space ninja, running on walls, awesome tile sets, fun clan system, fun to just mess around in the clan or the void. only dowsides is that some weapons are clan research, or some are only possible to get though the use of platinum which is real money. and that once you farm for dayz to get the needed resources you must wait for either 12 hours up to 72 hours or 3 days to get the item you farmed for dayz to get. but other than that i think it is an awsome game well worth the time you spend on it",9
"this is the best fps game i have ever played, 10/10",4
"this game is all about shooting, killing , and sneaking. and if your that type of person, you should get this game!",1
"good game, lighting isnt the best though and it could be improved a bit.",1
"the second best free to play game i have ever played. number one being team fortress 2. download both of them. nuff said.",2
"great game for customization, stunning graphics, and great co-op experience. i highly recommend this game!",1
"this game is very fun and easy to understand. the system requirements are a bit high but reasonable. the graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is addicting to some but not for everyone. i recommend this to anyone.",6
"best free game evvvvvvvvvvvaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh",1
"bloody addictive and fun co op game to play with friends. i just cant stop trying to unlock all the warframes i can and max out all my guns. but honestly the game is repetitive and there isnt really a story. however i like this game.",3
"fun coop, i grew kind of addicted to it, but it still have to get a lot better, for now its just to easy and too quick for to reach then endgame , and most the obstacles to it are kind of anoyng, still its fun to rush trogh the enemy hordes, to be a silent parkour swordplay space age ninja, or get pirate mode and to blow out everything with a rocket laucher, or do both!",5
"amazing!! barley any lag and great graphics to match the fantatic gameplay",5
"pure awesomeness, this is the most enjoyable game ive played because i always come back to it. i think it has to be the most beautiful freetoplay game at the moment and it probably will stll be so for a while...",3
"let me start off by saying this game is addicting!!!! it is not only an exemplary example of a third person action/shooter but of a game utilizing a f2p model!!! digital extremes has done a wonderful job, ensuring balance across the board, whether its between the credits/platinum or between the weapons and warframes themselves. in addition, they have written a narrative, that is dare i say it relatively fresh and original, while simultaneously tying in dark sector, for which this game is a spiritual successor to. i am genuinely excited to see where warframes story and digital extremes shall take fans of this game next!!!",2
"great graphics, awesome gameplay. a very enjoyable game which is easy to play.",1
"this game is very worth a play. not pay to win, which is a nice change for a free to play.",1
"its a great game so much detail and missions its just unbelievable its a free game. i just played 7 days without anygame and its still adictive like i just started the game",1
"heaps of fun. leans more towards the pay to win but you can play free and still get the same benefits. best played with friends",1
"fast paced gameplay sets warframe above the rest in terms of fun. co-op allows for fun tims with friends, and a good thing is, it isnt pay to win. 11/10 would frame again",4
"really fun game,would be great if they gave free platinum every few weeks",4
"imagine if a moba and a third person shooter had a child, now add space ninjas. its a free to play game and its great people. stop reading the review and download it already. its great, its not pay to win and if you think it is your probabley insane. just go download it.....like right now.......stop reading this....... what else do you want? there are ninjas, a great clan system, ninjas, a fun variety of powerful yet intresting weapons, ninjas, parkour and etc. at the time of writing this the game has a update every wensday (not counting hotfixes) adding new weapons and other various changes. everything is always fairly balanced and the characters all feel unique and different from one another. i could go on for a long time about how much i enjoy this game but to sum this review up, download it now what are you waiting for? if you already downloaded the game i have no clue why your still reading this review, the developers tend to be very active in the community and livestream on twitch every 2 weeks to talk about various things, feel free to watch that and learn about various things like sneak peeks about new weapons and stuff. its free to play so if you hate it the only thing you really wasted is your time and thats not really so bad now is it? and honestly if it is then you shouldnt of been playing a game to begin with dummy.",7
"space ninjas! this game is really good. it has a nice fast pace,interesting story,atmosphere and characters and awesome gameplay. the guns and swords feel so good to use and it provides a nice challange to those looking for one. there are some issues that bother me since i last played (was a while ago) but leveling up and getting money takes forever and i feel that with the third person camera there should be a cover system of sorts. not to mention the few bugs here and there but that arent gamebreaking 9/10 it was okay -ign",1
"easily the most addictive, visually unique and engaging free-to-play game i have played in a very long time.",1
"ninjas in space, they can fire, they can jump and do ninja stuff 11/10",1
"free to play and no pay to win, only pay to expidite time of building the weapons and or frames. game is great a must try for those that have pc and want gears of war/ mass effect action style gamplay",8
"ever wanted to be a space ninja? well then this is the game for you! its a third person shooter featuring co op and pvp in different sectors across several worlds.you get to wear a speacial suit that has its own abilities and playstyle. with a variety of primary, secondary and melee weapons, you can customize your playstyle to your hearts content pros - tons of parkour - variety of enemies - lots of customization cons - really no story - lots of micro transactions - hard to get into easily",1

"ninjas space explosions 123achievments free to play!",1
"the fact that you have to read this in order to understand the level of amazingness that comes from this game... may god have mercy on your soul... if you like completlely custom game play... with ablility to build every thing you can buy... all within a free game...each game mode (even while farming missions) is completely different.... great graphics (even when compared to a buyable game)... and a community of helpful people...and other stuffs... then this isnt your game... because your too busy reading what other people think about it.... have some faith my child...download it... add me on steam... i can personally tell you how awesome this game is! either way.... your lack of faith is disturbing....",1
"best free to play, ive ever played! after the update 14.0, it feels like i bought a game with in-game transactions, to speed things up and look even more badass. its a game about mother ing space ninjas with magic! also, it has swords, aliens and now huge killer puppies... yeah!!!!",9
"gunz, ninja, space, badass parkor. are you not entertained?",2
"omg this game is fun and adictive the game play is complex but not really hard to pick up and learn to play :)",5
"awsome game , love the new update , they really did great job optimizing the game i used to get 30 fps on 640*480 all of now i get 60 fps at the same options great job digital extreme :d",2
"very awesome game, although i play this pretty much on the ps4.",1
"the game is awesome and pretty much fun but just one recomendation; they give you 50 platinum (purchasable currency) to use in what you want. only use it on slots for your warframe or weapons. it is wasted on resources. edit okay i gotta edit this review for plenty of reason: 1) i have sunk way too many hours into this game, i am serious, over 300 hours! 2) this game has become something of a wonder, its mechanics are good, it looks good and the developers are we tied with the community. 3) the game is just incredible really, annoyingly grindy, bit of a platinum  and they give you way too little warframe slots for 20 plats but if you get beyond that the game just takes over and you both learn to love eachother.",5
"very fun game can get very addictive. kinda a pay to win but at the same time anything u can buy with plat you can earn through missions (except some mods ex. primed chamber)",3
"lots of alien nijas chopping arms and legs off, all for free and co-op too!",1
"it takes a bit to get used to (how to equip various mods, upgrading your armor/weps, etc.) but is absolutely worth it! the graphics are awesome, the levels are friggin amazing, and it can surely give a challenge to any kind of player! the frames (armor) for each class looks absolutely amazing, and each class has its personal skill (ultimate, basically) thats cool!",1
"way too addictive. cant stop playing. must sleep more..",9
"starts slow, but honestly, this is a diamond in the rough. a game that needs to be played to be understood. i never knew i what fun it was to play a space ninja, but after about 15 hours, its got a few hooks in me, and not bad for free. im in my mid twenties in rank with the starter gear and am pondering the grind for new equipment or simply cashing out and having $10 or $20 to ride on for a while. the missions of mercury are a bit dull, but once you get the venus, the missions open up a bit and become a bit more engaging. in terms of polish, it isnt the shiniest stone but it isnt the buggiest by far. i would put it on par with a payday 2 or tribes ascend sort of feel.",3
"its a really good game considering its free to play. i would definitly recommend it to people if they asked me, there is alot of action intense gameplay as you progress and lots of great characters to choose from. at first it seems a little slow and grindy but when you work hard for what your aiming for it really makes it seem worth while, where as some games just hand you the best stuff in a day. definitly a good time killer when you get bored, or you can always play it in between games.",2
"i love warframe, and while i dont play the pc version as much as i do the console, its fun regardless what platform you play it on!",1
"a pretty fun over-the-shoulder shooter/ninja-ing/parkour/sword-swingin kinda game, you play as a space cyber-ninja in a cruel space-future. also you can get an ugly lovable space bat-dog. honestly, a fun game if youre looking for a time-sink, as it is fairly grindy. all weapons need to be levelled up, as do suits, and you have to gather materials to improve stuff or make stuff better. like i said, grindy, but... still entertaining.",1
"warframe is truly a wonderful games that ticks all of my boxes. its god the best sci-fi feel, best action and of course the ninja feeling to it. you can choose what you want to do when it comes to missons, want to go in guns blazing? go ahead or if you prefer a more stealth approach to it then again, go ahead. the sound has improved dramatically over the years of warframe and is really been a milestone for the developers to be proud of. they always surprise us with every update whether it be small or big. the music is perfect, it really does add the best theme you can get to battles and of course the music varies from battle to battle. the design is just the key symbol of warframe, why you ask? see for yourself, its just perfect. every little detail digital extremes puts into the game always made the game more beautiful. the lighting is very dynamic, its not too bright and not too dark in missions while keeping the good mix of lights to create the desired atmosphere. gameplay in my opinion does need a bit of working, i just think warframe is really hard to get into when you start as it only gets good when you start getting a real challenge. digital extremes did a good job when it came to ninjas, i mean come on, you get to do parkour. you get to run on walls while shooting and perform attacks with your sword in mid air flight. thats all i can say really, well there is one more thing. get the game. youll wish you played this game a long time ago. 10/10.",7
"robots and ninjas. whats more to love? 11/10 would ninja again",1
"fun and exciting game. thats like all i have to say.",7
"the pinacle of mmo adapted to fps. third person adds to the overall experiance, custimization is to die for, graphics are next gen. i would advise this game to anyone and find a single person who didnt enjoy.",4
"good game for cooperative players. fun misions. overall 7/10",1
"good game for free to play with fun and interesting combat and teamplay but it has several severe flaws which are that it has a bad payment model, things are overpriced and you are required to buy more slots for warframes and weapons i u want more then two. secondly the game becomes very repeatitive and there is not very much metagame. the last thing is that it is very difficult to get interested in this game starting off due to its repeativeness.",3
"warframe has a few quirks here and there but you should not just give this a glance. invest at least a good hour and youll form a new passion to the free-to-play lifestyle 8.5/10",6
"this game is an example of free to play done (mostly) right, which is very rare. you, a member of the tenno race, are equiped with suits known as warframes, each with unique stats and powers. it is your mission to aid in the war between the tenno, grineer, corpus, and infested. admitadly, the game plays like a standard third person shooter, where it really shines is all of the different weapons and mods just waiting to be discovered, like bows to assault rifles, health increases to abilities. its not without its problems, though. the game is littered with microtransactions, and while optional, grinding isnt fun unless you have friends. oh yeah, this game has a standard 4 player co-op system too, which it is usually designed around. overall, i would suggest getting this game with a very open mindset.",6
"despite my username and avatar, i dont go in much for fpss. i still love this game. its a lot like mass effect multiplayer, with the addition of martial arts flick acrobatics. good balance so far in the freemium aspects -- new equipment comes along fast enough (particularly when playing with friends) that i dont feel screwed by not paying money for it. looking forward to how this game develops over time.",2
"the game is very fun and runs good on most computers in all i really enjoyed the game and you should too. the bugs you may find are never to serious and yet some of them are funnt.",3
"im not reccomending this game because of its core dynamics (farm fo dayz) im reccomending it because it can be something better within the coming years/months. my only plea is that they make sure that the main story line is good for holding out for so long, and to decrease some mod drop rates and to decrease the time needed to create warframes/weapons. this game has a lot of potential and i enjoy watching it grow.",1
"fast paced third person shooter, it is by far a rather interesting and fun game to play, playing basically as a ninja in space is truly something",2
"warfrmae is a game ive been following since alpha and like many other games i never loose intrest in playing it, yes this game isnt for those who just want it all now an not wait but i think that the grind and trial to obtain warframes without using real money makes the warframe that more rewardable, the game just amazes me every day, its one of the only games that actually feel like a living breathing world every weekend has a new global event where the developers have us go up against a grineer vs corpus rivalry or a sneaky corpus tradesmans escort. every warframe adds a new field to play with within the randomly generated levels and i love all the customization and loadouts that are avaliable you can play how you want to play; be a tanky rhino and destroy the fron lines or a nova who assists the whole team in a damage amplifier or be a sneaky assasin like loki or ash and stealth an entire mission. oh and dont get me started on u11, in the lastest update they have added more amazing rooms and decoration to the clan built dojos. alot of the content in warframe is not visble at first glance but if more people gave this game a chance i promise they would love it. plus its free!! ( btw i play warfame from the website and not through steam, i actually have 450+ hrs on the game not 19 hrs :/ )",1
"this game is seriously addicting. it has a ton of different elements from almost every game type there is, which is incredible. immense customization, innumerable combinations of weapons and mods. this game really has it all.",3
"you can play with the spaceship on the loading screen. 10/10",1
"once i had regained my password, warframe had still turned out to be a grind. you will spend ages rerunning levels and hoping for drops for specific pieces or patterns to unlock equipment. for those of you with fat wallets and little time to earn the gear legitimately, you can pay to unlock the weapons. its a bit of a shame none of the vanity items can be earned in game though. luckily, the game is still fun in a very visceral sense. gunning down grunts while they swarm at you on defensive missions is one of the best parts, though it does appear theyve rebalance a large portion of the game since i last played. the emergence of a story that does not require you to go browsing forums and creators notes is refreshing as well. 7/10 would be better if you didnt have to spend so damn long (or so damn much) to unlock some of the gear. seriously. stop charging so damn much.",5
"awesome game, fast paced and lots of missions and stuff to do",1
"great graphics, wonderful gameplay, and a caring community.",6
"i absolutely love this game. although im not the greatest player, i feel like it is a game that is easy to learn. the controls are easy and the gameplay is awesome. i love the graphics and the freedom you have when it comes to customization of your character and weapons.",1
"space, ninjas, space ninjas, ????!1/1/11?!!?????!111?? and a ton of grinding and also more grinding. 10/10",5
"if you like ninjas, space, and mass effect 3s mulitplayer this is the game for you warning highly addctive another warning you must pay for weapon and warframe slots but honestly you can make money in the trade channel to do that so not a big deal",2
"i give it an about 8/10, good visuals, very fun gameplay, 97% of the stuff you can get for free without paying, alot of grinding however, and there is no story as of yet (still in beta), and there isnt much end game content but however that is most likely to change in due time. note:will lag you to hell if you dont have a good computer.",9
"great game fun as to play all that choppin up and killing :d would pay $ for this game 10/10",2
"its scary and a little too high quality for my graphics chip but its an awesome game for ninjas",1
"this co-op shooter really gets to you unlike others. the storyline isnt that great, but who cares when you can have weapons and skills that can slaughter enemies by the hundreds. i put it many hours into this game and it is well worth the time and money if you are into the pay to get latest item first kind of people. if not, just normal play is very addictive. so, if you think shooting with style is your thing, then warframe is for you!",4
"this game is beyond fun. people say its a grind, and it is to some extent, but if this doesnt have the more unique, fun, entertaining combat. you wont regret playing this game at all.",3
"awesome game, full of alot of small glitches, but always getting better.",3
"a little repetitive, but the customization, teamwork, and overall fun factor completely make up for it.",1
"ok so lets be honest this game is probably one of the best looking free to play game there is out there with so much new content there is no reason not to download this game so remember ninjas play free lets do this",4
"set in the far reaches of outer space during a new dark age, warframe introduces the tenno, a race on the brink of extinction after being enslaved by the grineer for centuries. this game is very addicting, play as a space ninja running around throwing energy and running up walls. defend against a ton of different mobs, grind for hours and craft new weapons and frames. the community is awesome and the gameplay is amazing. i would highly recommend this and we havent even touched on the graphics. the only problem i can think off is that the dlc is overpriced, just my opinion. otherwise this game is 10/10!",1
"this game is fun. this game is cool. id reccommend it to anyone who wants to kill in style! please note if steam sees this message i am hating how it isnt in my libary... i spent money it isnt their. but anyway let the killing begin! and note if you strugle in the game, never fear to ask for help, its more immportaint around the time you are getting stalked by the stalker.",3
"free-to-play thats actually free... its awesome. 4 player co-op. constant developer updates and new content. wanna be a space ninja? this is the game for you! try it now!",7
"one of the best games iev ever played. on the other side.. it costs you a lots of time.",3
"this game is about cyber-ninja-pirates in space, sciencing with katanas, scoring headshots on guys in brick-shaped helmets, and most importantly, legs. legs with pistols attached on top of them.",9
"a surprisingly good sci-fi game that doesnt fail to impress. gorgeous graphics, gripping gamplay and massive multiplayer action make this game a great next-gen titile!",1
"awesome shooter game. recommend for all who like a good scifi action game.",2
"simply and stunningly amazing.i recommend it to all who play games",1
"a fun co-op fps with leveling elements. in addition to your characters, your account, weapons and minions gain levels as you progress. with higher levels, you can apply modules to your items, increasing various attributes in them. modules themselves are drops, and the module collecting and building your gear mechanics feel like deck building in a collectible card game. the game is peer-hosted, which probably helps keep the game free to play, but also means that you will sometimes end up playing on a server that is hosted on a connection that cant handle the bandwidth requirements of four players. this can be somewhat resolved with ping-filtering peers, especially if you have the connection and cpu power to host yourself. almost everything in the game can be obtained without paying real money (except character/weapon slots), but as usual, time is money, and helps you progress faster.",2
"before you play this game ask yourself these questions. *do i like jumping out of ceiling tiles? *do i like spending half my day looking for upgrades on pathetic weapons? *do i enjoy a broken economy where 50 bucks gets me a ratchet  katana? if you said yes to any of those, grab this game...immediately.",1
"great game with high potential, just that it must stay free to play",1
"ever wanted to be a space samurai with guns? no? well play it anyway because its a damn good game. smooth gameplay and graphics. some issues but hey, its in beta.",1
"cool game but this new update is verry buggy and i mean verry buggy , still the game is awesome if you dont have it you should! they will probly fix the buggy stuff soon so.",2
"this is game is almost awesome! almost cuz it needs less pay-to-win pls. you have the blueprints, but for guys that spend money on games thats nothing.",2
"free-to-play: +1 convoluted micro-transactions: -1 so much loot: +1 grinding is a chore: -1 story is nonexistant: -1 lore-heavy: +1 (for lore-lovers) lots of weapons and characters to chose from: +1 lastly, space-ninjas. +9,999 pretty good game. you should download if youre a big sci-fi fan.",1
"this game, is endless fun with friends :l so play it lol",5
"yeah a game where you play as an asian-like race fighting old dudes in hi-tech armor using a mixture of guns and martial arts yeah sounds like a game good enough to be addicting.",7
"yes, though there are many more games that could compare to this and out do it; this game is very good for it being free.",1
"an absolute must-play. anyone who considers themself a gamer should absolutely try this game at least once.",5
"one of the best free to play game i have ever played",1
"its a good game and very fun to pplay. love the slidey slidey thing. it does however get repetetive after a while.",1
"ive seen things you people wouldnt believe... attack ships on fire off the shoulder of orion. i watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the tannhauser gates.... all those... moments, will be lost... in time... like tears, in rain... time, to die...",1
"an excellent little gem of an mmo, this free-to-play has no point that demands you to enter pvp or cough up for some premium currency, though, both are an option. this is only further complimented by the mix of platformer and third-person shooter thats balanced just right. the only reasons you could hate this game would be if you couldnt stand the lore, or simply dont like the games composition. there are sections that cater to every level of skill, and force nobody to stay within or go beyond them. get into warframe, but bring friends if you want a crew to work with you for more than one or two missions.",5
"takes a while to get the hang of it but is very fun",3
"if this game was a bowl of ramen, then it would be a very good bowl of ramen.",1
"its good but the community is mostly idiots its impossible to co-op stealth because everyone else just charges in blasting everything and gettting you detected",1
"amazing game to play with your friends! very awesome and it takes true skill to be good!",1
"its a bit hard to get the grasp of the foundry and modding system at first but its well worth the task once you figure that out its smooth sailing from there it has a good survivability and technically doesnt require you to spend one cent even though its easier.",2
"this is one of the most attractive games that i ever played. it is hard to get inside it, but once youve passed the firsts steps, this game becomes a place for ultimate enjoyment.",7
"i think warframe is fun and most peeople would enjoy",2
"warframe is like ze best 3rd person shooter i have ever played tried it :d",6
"i personally like this game a lot but i feel like not enough people play it. its a very creative and beautiful game that sets itself apart from from other games with its levels, but after a while it gets slightlyh repetetive in my opinion. i give this game 8.5/10",1
"dis gam is so gud that i soiled myself upwards of tree tims.",1
"warfram is a pentacle for its. what ive been waiting for!",3
"great co-op shooter, a bit grindy but overall its worth checking out",3
"if you want to grind more than playing a tony hawk game and get stomped if you dont this game is for you.",1
"sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssspace *boom*",2
"this game is a really great sci-fi game! enjoying it a lot!!! just hoping if there was even a single way on earning platinum for free :(",2
"surprisingly good game with co-op. sort of like the mass effect 3 multiplayer, but good, and with free-running space ninjas. there is almost no pvp in this game, which is wonderful for all of us sick of wonderful pve games being ruined by devs focusing solely on pvp, but if youre too much of a  little gremlin to play cooperatively with other people youre not going to like it very much. as someone whos dumped a lot of time into this game already, i should point out two things going in: it takes about 10-20 hours before youll get the hang of all of the craziness (so read up on the wiki), and it *is* primarily designed to be a cooperative game (so find a group to play with, because itll go much faster and be more reliable than playing with players from matchmaking).",6
"i could write essays about this game but instead ill go ahead and recommend it, its actually one of my best f2p games on steam(86/100)",1
"so far i have to say this game is really fun. as you can see i enjoy this game very much. +a lot of content. +hours of fun. +interesting design. +space ninjas. +awesome/active devs. +no paywalls/everything can be acquired with 0$ (except some cosmetics). +tons of warframes (characters). +decent graphics. +cool soundtrack. -too easy endgame, and not much endgame content. [(i tried?)(i suck at reviews].",10
"damn nice with light-detailed graphics,+ story line is amazing.highly ercommended!",1
"great game and free content every month ! long time fun guarantees ! no pay2win !",4
"amazing guns blazing or stealth shooter for anyone who likes space and/ or ninjas :d",6
"perfect xbox controller support! best i seen yet! game is great! loveing every second of it!",1
"i dont even know where to start with this game. its just awesome!!",7
"warframe, where space ninjas do battle to ensure their very survival and uphold balance in the universe. this game, put simply, has been an interesting and amazing experience. there are people willing to help, there are constant updates to keep you interested, and has an immersing ui system. the endless possiblities of modding your weapons or frames, the amazing color packs (if you decided to get extras), and the actual visual gameplay. i am proud to say that de has made me hooked on this game. good job and congradulations to any awards you guys may win. i look forward to playong more of your creations. :)",2
"you are a space ninja. in spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace! in all seriousness, a lot of fun. i have sunk a lot of time into this one.",4
"i love this game, its space ninjas cutting up dudes with guns, using an assload of weaponry. it does have pay to win elements, but you need to work hard to be the very best. i recommend it gets my a/5",4
"an awesome cross between assassins creed and mdk. parkour meets hack and slash in a sci-fi world. wether you prefer a stealthy approach or in your face brawling, this game has it all!",6
"absolutely love this game, action packed, and the support you get for bug fixes is really good, always adding new things every week or so :)",4
"recomend. it was the  when i got it, now i just have to pay for everything i want to unlock,",3
"ive been playing warframe for a year and a half now, and i can say it is the best mmofpsrpg game ever. the graphics are amazing, the customizability is exstensive, and the gameplay itself is addicting. this game is not for everyone, particularly in the sense that its not a normal mmo.",2
"its very hard to believe this is a free to play game. it takes many machanics from other games i enjoy and uses them in a way that makes you want to keep playing. you will lose hours.",5
"a really cool game for heavy machines and even normal ones",4
"this game is pretty great, if you like space ninjas and eviscerating things, this game is the one for you.",2
"this is a very fun and adicting game with a fast pace and shooter aspect. fun for all types of gamers!",1
"awesome game. you must play this if you like fps games.",5
"warframe is a great game to play with friends, since it is very much a co-op game and teamwork is essential for success. on top of everyting, its free! also, this is not a pay to win game, since all in-game items can be crafted or won in in-game events without spenidng a dime. the graphics are great, and sometimes i just play because of them! though there is no actual story, there are planets, items, guns, clans, and anything needed to make this a great sci-fi game thatll give you hourse of fun! just beware, if your computer is very slow, lag may affect gameplay.",2
"this game is simply awesome. though the maps may appear to be repititive, but playing this with friends is a loving experience. and the game mechanics are simple and easy, if in doubt just check the in-game tutorials. amazing weapons, cool warframes, upgrading and modifying weapons, and the best of all.........................................its free!!!!!!",3
"before you play this game ask yourself these questions. *do i like jumping out of ceiling tiles? *do i like spending half my day looking for upgrades on pathetic weapons? *do i enjoy a broken economy where 50 bucks gets me a ratchet  katana? if you said yes to any of those, grab this game...immediately.",1

"its free to play, so it wont cost you anything to try it out. that being said, i would recommend it. though after a while you will get bored of doing the same stuff over and over again. i would still be playing this game if there were more updates or more immersion in gameplay. though i still recommend this game, as i have played it over a 100 hours myself.",2
"nice graphics, fun so far and reminds me of a few games ive played in the past.",1
"this game is great. but i wouldnt play it if you want to spend at least 50 buck to at least past neptune though",1
"pretty awesome for a free game i would recommend to anyone that likes third person shooters.",4
"i concur with previous statements, this game will indeed cook your bacon and end all ea representatives lives rather quickly, its advised anyone with a phobia to photocopiers is to avoid playing this game unless wearing a hat made from horse hair.",5
"ninja pirates in space. what else would you expect?",5
"this game has come such a long way since release. now i cant stop playing it. everything in the game can be unlocked as long as you put some time into it, so even if there are a lot of purchasable items and equipment, you can still be on par with those players. the combat is extremely fluid, physics are wonderful, graphics are fu**ing amazing, and the diversity in the frames and weapon builds make it fun to show off to your friends.",2
"a definite must have, just download and see, once you start playing you wont stop, ive been playing since ive downloaded it.",7
"the game is pretty good but on some levels u get lost and cant finish it",1
"warframe: space ninjas. with parkour and grinding abound, this game does many thing for my inner space ninja. that aside, the story line seems to be a bit lacking. however, i still find the game rather entertaining with good friends.",2
"extremly fun & addicting. especially fighting the massive ammounts of grineer.",1
"awesome game, huge selections of warframes to choose from, each with unique playstyle and skills. hundreds of mods to customize your build and weapons. everything other than weapon and frame slots can be obtained by playing, well, a lot of time, or get it with real money",3
"okay the question that humanity has been asking itself over and over again(you aready know what it is off-course) is... wait for it... what happens if you mix 3rd person shooting and space ninjas. well you get warframe. its got over hundred randomly generated space station dungeons making every game different you have awesome ninja skills like wall running and kicking enemies in the face. and on top of everything, this...game...is...bloddy...free!!. now, to the seriuos review. the game is currently in beta, that means there will be bugs and glitches, i have never found any game breaking bugs though. there currently is 17 classes (warframes) to chose from. this includes healers, tank and mind controllers and all that fun stuff. you will find 3 factions to shoot in the face (sort of 5 but that doesnt matter) the controls feel pretty good to me. overall this game (in my opinion) is a very, very and yet another very good game",5
"its quite fun...... but mostly the *clears throat* you know what i mean right? if you are one who likes to grind things with friends (and piss them off like me) then this game is for you. if you enjoy the excitement of crafting things then this game is for you. that is why i, myself, renamed this game something inappropriate c:",8
"9/10 this game is just fun to play, also a bit addictive since you cant stop getting more gear and customizing your warframe (in-game character), i give it a 9 because at the beggining its a bit overwhelming for new players, so many features and options, not to mention things to do. anyways i played in an old account after dropping this game some time ago, and may be thats why it was so overwhelming. its free, fun and the community is great. give it a try!",2
"this is my first time playing a 3-rd person shooter and i like it very much. the game flow was pretty good but to achieve this i had to tweak video settings to low... my cpu has only 2ghz. this one of those games that really requires time, to play and most important to evolve. co-op fans will find this pretty interesing, this is the game to play after some l4d or l4d2 madness :)",1
"warframe was fast paced, run through, chop them up and shoot them up.",1
"nice and addictive game it take 60 hours of my life weekly i recommend it",4
"sick game for sure great graphics great gameplay epic fights nothing more to say you like to fight here is your game in 3d baby",1
"awesome awesome awesome not too to pay to win just a bunch of farming. but its worth it coz while u r farming u r still having fun :d however, it does get repetitive and predictible at times, so i recommend dont play too much a day unless u r farming for forma or potatos",1
"gomenasai, my name is vogue-sama im a 22 year old american otaku (anime fan for you gaijins). i draw anime and manga on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior japanese games. (warframe, world of warcraft, persona series) i train with my dual ether every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other weapon in the solar system. i earned my sword license two weeks ago, and i have been gaining affinity every day. i speak japanese fluently, both jupiter and the saturn dialect, and i write fluently as well. i know everything about japanese history and their no-guns code, which i follow 100% when i get my jupiter visa, i am moving to neo tokyo to attend a prestigious high school to learn more about their magnificent culture. i hope i can become an animator for studio ghibli or a game designer! i own several warframes, which i wear around town. i want to get used to wearing zephyr before i move to japan, so i can fit in easier. i bow to my elders and seniors and speak japanese as often as i can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.",1
"i.... my . its swollen with blood. i cannot think very clearly. you will do one of two things : a) play for 2-5 hours and think eh... i dont get it, and stop. b) press on when you have a feeling like you arent getting anywhere. than 100 hours will disappear like a dry fart that you overlook while in an intense game of lag of legends. i am b. b for ..? b for...balls... my testicles are so swollen from sitting for so many hours.. ninjutsu spaceru help me, senpai",2
"ok, pros: fast paced shooting mechanics, decent sword mechanics. good mobility, customization not that good but workable. teamwork, can still play solo however. and a stealth and free-run mechanic. nvidia graphics and physics! cons: you will never get into pvp becuase of your inventory ### doesnt meet the requirements. unfair, if not almost cheating ai. cash store always dangled in front of your face. when the game adds a new playable warframe, it feels like you must pay. in order to play it. feels unrewarding. buggy beyond beleif, but thats because its an mmo. near impossible to join a guild/clan. notorius time waster. lotus voice. overall: i enjoyed this game for a few days, but between drm, lack of commmunication with other players, and cash store ads. i reached my pain; enjoyment thresh hold. it just seems like a time waster, and you never feel like you accomplish anything, unless you sink in $$$ of course. if you need to waste a few hours go ahead, but it just felt to as if there was no point to doing all of the same repeating missions over and over again. its up to you.",1
"this game is filled with ups and down but over all the gme is very good in all the aspects of the fight and firefights i verymuch enjoy this game and will being playing this game until my eyes bleed but i dont think i will let it get to that point althought i cant make any promises so if your thinking about playing/downloading this game do it is seriously awesome and i recommend it to everyone i know!!",3
"i would recommend this game to people who are used to the diablo style of grinding, as well as have a group of friends to play along with. this game can get very tiresome fast unless you form a clan or join one and do missions with your clan mates. pvp is also not were it should be, it has a lot of balancing to do but has a ton of potential.",1
"damned fun game. takes some time to get into, but its great for a f2p.",1
"really good. better than the average bear. you should play it",1
"set in the far reaches of outer space during a new dark age, warframe introduces the tenno, a race on the brink of extinction after being enslaved by the grineer for centuries. players enter warframe on the cusp of the grineers victory over the tenno until they begin to arm themselves with warframes - an ancient exo-skeletal technology only they can operate. hidden within the orokin derelicts of a lost civilization, new warframes lie dormant and undiscovered. these artifacts are the tennos only hope for survival. with the lack of a pay to win system and easy engagement for new players, warframe offers some quality time. as a free-to-play game, warframe is a nice surprise that sets the base for a promising future. warframe isnt anything special. its not revolutionary, exceptional or timeless. still - every time i returned to the game, it kept playing for at least an hour (without regret). digital extremes has made an enjoyable, engrossing, spectacular game. especially, when you find yourself a team or - even better - invite some friends. if you need a new opportunity to slaughter aliens, you should try warframe.",1
"i really love warframe butthey need to add more wild on earth, hope that happends!!",1
"this is one high graphiced game with a great story line love it",1
"great game! very good co-op if you wanted to play something with your friends. however the solo gameplay is just as good. even though you can buy things in the game with real money it is not a pay to win game, as long as you play regularly you will be able to get the best gear just like everyone else. highly recommend the game!",3
"one really enjoyable game, especially with friends. also you can play it for free without needing to buy anything! also, space ninjas are cool.",8
"if you got the time and effort. this game is fun and easy. paying makes the game boring and short lasting appeal. i mean. yeah, colors are cool to buy. but the items that you can buy for free? not cool, bro. i find it funny this games a beta and if you have friends or strangers and the good guns. you can have some extreme fun, or just hangout in your clan dojo. or shoot a random army down. and i played this game 2 months after beta release. so i know what im doing. this game is phenonmal. i cant imagine whats in the full version. lost out.",3
"recommended for third person view style lover nothing more to say to this awesomeness wish i played this 1 year earlier :(",7
"this game is one of the first games i got when i got steam. i love this game. this is an amazing game. its almost hard to believe its free! love it!",1
"pros + good customisation. + good combat. + sound quality is excellent. cons - no clear story, your just thrown into the battle with no real reason to kill the enemies apart from your told to and that theyre shooting at you. - repetetive environments (jungle, factory, maybe if your lucky..... a bright factory). - odd weapon unlock system. overall i would reccomend this game for the combat and customisation alone however if you look for fun and story telling in a game then this isnt the game for you, the gore may give you some giggles for the first few times you make an enemies torso fly into space team rocket style but once youve seen one decapateted enemy sliced and diced like mince meat, youve seen them all.",1
"all those of you who like hardcore coop shooters like warframe will be delighted with its content although its reliability of you spending real world money on a free game is kind of unfair",2
"this space ninja farming simulator has ruined my life. 10/10.",3
"this game is really fun i recommend it to other people that havent got this already, if you do get it you will enjoy it a lot.",1
"an awesome futuristic game, based on the competing factions of the tenno, grineer, corpus and the infested. you can acheive new warframes and modify them to their full extent. honestly a really fun game when you get good stuff. 7.5/10",2
"i am growing a bat-dog on my space ship (did i mention i am a space ninja?)",10
"hooked. game play is crazy. pulls you in and keeps you there",1
"really great game. it has large updates that are put out each month. it keeps getting better. very polished gameplay. one of the best free to play games ive played. i would highly recommend experiencing it with your friends as it was meant to be played cooperatively and its a far more fun than when played solo.",1
"amazing! upgrade, craft, and buy your way to victory! addicting, really fun with bows and sword to slice and launch your enemies... deffinately recommeded to everyone.",2
"the good except for in game purchases and how much the platium is",3
"wow. such frames. very ninja. much graphics. rating: wow / 10 must play game",4
"this is the best game there is if you are looking for a good co op experience. 10/10 recommended .",9
"i spend most of my time hitting random storage containers with a sword. good way to waste time. 10/10",1
"cybernetic ninjas/events and constant updates...the developers are keeping this alive, and i am pretty damn happy about how far they have come with all the content that has been added to the game itself",2
"this game is just awesome. you can choose from just a few weapons when you start, but then you have the chance to craft your own weapons (and there are like, alot). the graphics are awesome too, about how it looks and how efficient they are. you can easily get +40 fps with a fairly old computer. the detail i personally like is that its not p2w (atleast not completely, if you get kia, you can spend a revive, wich is bought from the market; or you can be revived by a teammate in coop). the only things i dont like about it are the unstability of the game servers and just a few bugs in the connection system and in the steam launcher.",4
"one of the best-if not the best-f2p games ive played. to get this out of the way, this game is not pay 2 win. in fact, the best gear is only obtained through playing; cannot be bought. warframe strongly encourages working in a team, though that doesnt mean that you cant go solo (theres a whole option dedicated to that). and with a large list of weapons and warframes to choose from, therell always be something to do. the only bad thing i could say is that if youre looking for a story or indepth game, this is definitely not for you. the missions will get tedious for those that dont like killing things over and over again. still, it is a very well developed game that delivers several hours of ninja fun.",10
"this game is great, plus its free. the game is fast paced and hard.",3
"its a game you dont always have to play to advance in, but it has to build stuff like clash of clans, if you do play warframe (which you should) join my clan!",4
"a very good games. it has a lot of potential but it is ruied by a none fluid gameplay and of course a pay to win systeme 6/10",1
"hey you have to try this game out pretty standard and easy plus online play is fun",1
"holy crap. this is as good as f2p gets. there are 3 basic weapon types, melee, primary and secondary, each unique. i give this game a 10/10. i run a good 60 fps, and the graphics are outstanding for free to play.",1
"this game is perfect to play with your friends and still fun to play with yourself or with others online. 100% free for all the needed parts but pay to get an advantage. try it out and youll enjoy it.",5
"this game is one of the best fps co-opperation games i have played.from dense action to ninja like silence is the game filled with some bosses have a very unique design and a good back story and few information about their mechanism can turn the table. weapons have their own unique mechanism stats and complex design that every weapons i worth a try and mastering the style of use is a key the battle ground.neither good or evil the tenno stands never alone against his foes the warframe is the strongest weapon and deep story can hide behind the shell what is known is that they are hunting for us fellows tennos so be on the look out.to not get hunted down by the stalker.",4
"this game is bad  and its free. give me a reason you dont want to play it.",1
"get framed for war crimes in this thrilling third person shooter",1
"this is an awesome game. has fast game play, and will keep you on your feet, especialy with all the work the developers are puting into it. it is still a game in progress though, so expect the bugs to be here and there. the ui has been a big issue. they been working on it a ton, to make it not only look better but run better as well. it does have that feeling of a pay to play sometimes, but you can get 95% of everything through grinding and playing. money just gets it faster. great multiplayer as well. only complaint would be that some classes dont even have a slight apeal because thet are not balanced, or not worth the grind to get them. otherwise this is a great game. if you like shooters and intence action with fun co-op this is the game for you! 9/10",2
"fun third-person co op shooter with ninjas....in space",2
"one of the most stable and enjoyable betas ive ever seen. fast, frantic action, which is a beauty to watch and play, and will, without a doubt, make you feel like an absolute badass. its accessable, making it easy to play, but still requiring some skill to pull off those really cool attacks and manuevers. a very nice balance, and hopefully the game will only improve.",1
"i cannot recommend this game enough, it is the only game i have been willing to spend over 100$ on, i didnt need to spend any of that on anything besides the colors, the game is not pay to win at all, sure you can get a lot of gear just by paying for it, but thats just because you are allowed to trade blueprints with other players, so you can buy them from others (which you still need to build) and any weapon you buy in the store you can get with just a bit of effort without paying for it (weapons are around 300 plat), the gameplay is great, the new update made the new player experience amazing, and now you can get freaking puppies, puppies!",3
"burning players with the specific alert reward which everyone wanted ever since the beginning~ will burn again! 10/10~",5
"pretty exciting and offers many ways to get even the strongest gear. while purchasing platinum is a much faster way to obtain things, almost everything is obtainable without purchasing anything. the frustrating thing about this game is definitely the net code and the irritating amount of customization options that are totally locked unless you purchase them with platinum ( on that note freebies are given away at random holidays ie. christmas and valentines day. )",2
"youve always wanted to be a badass space ninja. warframe puts you there. controls are tight, progression is multifaceted, and theres always improvements being made. graphically symphonic. its free, what the frack are you waiting for?",3
"this game is by far one of the best games i have played i dont normally care for shooter games i like racing games and open world games that pretty much have cars in them like nfs games and gta granted gta is considered shooter game but basically warframe is most deffenitly an exception the graphics are great and the animations good and its also addictive and its free to play. their is only one thing that seems to be a problem though and that is not only can you play with other people you can also play solo which is great but when your not connected to the internet and you want to play warfame in solo you cant apparently you have to have the internet in order to play at all which is basically my only complaint but even at that i most deffenitly recommend this game",7
"epic game! amazing with friends and its one of the few free to plays that is not pay to win! you can do every weapon, frame and items without paying a penny! great for ppl that love sci-fi! be aware that the game is always in development but the devs are realy supporting ;d. i give it 9/10 gg pps",1
"this game is absoulutly amazing! one of the best f2p game ever! also great to play with friends, but it is even still a great game with strangers!",1
"incoming security force detected - its the grineer.",5
"an amazing game.....the fact that its in 3rd person view, it makes it easier (for me at least) to see approaching enemies",1
"warframe is.... its kinda..... you know, i honestly cant describe this game and its uniqueness, or, atleast, what uniqueness it has, which is a lot. all in all, this game has everything, it has tight controls, a variety of map structures, for example, if you played first mission once, it will be a different map set-up each and every time, with the exception of the objective room, that will always look the same, however, the layout is always different. theres a large variety of weapons, and warframes. warframes, the games name. warframes are...odd, i honestly have no idea what they are, they could be robots, or, remotly controlled, or even a person in a suit, no one really seems to know. as for controls, you can do many different combat manuvers, heres a few of my favorites: backflips. wall run.(up and side) front flips. flying kicks. and so much more! not to mention, this is the most well polished free to play game, with the best model of it, you can get everything for the paid currency, or, you can craft it, for free. simply put: i freakin love this game to peices. 9.5/10 the crafting takes 12 hours on normal things(weapons, components) and 3 days on warframes.",1
"this game impressed me so much that i nearly fell of my chair. the first time i saw warframe i thought to my self,how great can this game be. then i played it,man did i injoy it <-------did?,what am i talking about i still love this game. the graphics is good (by that i mean insane)the gameplay is surprisingly awesome and it has a nice touch of team work. if you die your freind can still help you from getting back into that insane battelfeild. of course you can play offline but thats.....how do i put this,cinda hard(yep allot).this game is very fun aswell from shocking a corpus to cutting greneer in half. this game is all about going mad (insane if thats what you whant to call it). so hack and slash your whay through warframe. give it a try",6
"this game has taken away my soul and all my emotions, leaving me a shell of the man i once was. 10/10",6
"this is by far one of the best free2play games i have ever played. my windows computer isnt that great. i have to run almost lowest settings. the good thing is i get no lag! the graphics are amazing and the missions are great. the only bad thing is that platinum(in game curremcy) is a little overprices for how much you could buy. over all i would recommend this game to everyone!",1
"by now i have hundreds of hours in warframe and i can confidently say that it is a great game... if you dont mind grind. oh my god the grind. it isnt new spiral knights level grind, but it is not uncommon to run missions for hours for a single rare mod that drops from one type of enemy. but the gameplay is pretty solid, the game looks great, and the devs are more than willing to listen to the community about things that need changing or fixing. content is regularly being added and de does its best to keep the community involved and in the loop (including letting the fans compete to design weapons). overall, 8/10 because it just keeps pulling me back in.",9
"i do recommend this game to anyone who doesnt have a crappy computer. its free to play, so lets keep this in mind as we go along on this wonderful journey. warframe, in my opinion, has beautiful graphics and scenery. it does lack in the story department just a tad. however, it makes up for it in its fun style of game play, and etc.. etc. overall if you spend more than 3+ hours on your computer... this is a game to get~ one thing i might mention though is the new player experience, be cautious... ^-^ have fun tenno~ (p.s. this is probably a crappy review seeing as how it is my first game review. it may also be extremely crappy because im bored. enjoy deciphering it!)",2
"its a great multi player free game with a choice of weapons quests pets and money i love the game because its fun to play with your mates and i recommend it",2
"this game is cool, like a coop hack and slash sci-fi game + tps shooter, awesome.",1
"i feel like this is a game im gonna be playing for a while... pros: - ninja space swords shotguns - co-op elements - awesome introduction - multiple guns and a awesome arsenal - also some rpg elements added cons: - kinda lags on lowest settings - i prefer first person - some p2w elements, but at least they dont scream money at you i recommend this game for the awesome shooting n stuff, and cool storyline.",1
"this is one of the best third person shooter i have ever played wwith good graphics and a nice soundtrack with energetic and fast pace gameplay makes the game very enjoyable and also the choice of stealth or aggressive gameplay and also the choice of support roles if you dont like to lead in games, the main problem with the game is that it is a freemium so you can play it for free and be just as good as premium players it just takes a lot more effort and grinding to obtain the really good items but for me personally i dont mind but i can tell some people dont like stuff like that.",1
"this game is epic, with amazing gameplay, amazing graphics, and it is just really fun to go around as these alien ninjas.... 1 tip though... dont forget to use your special moves that you learn before anything else.... epic game",1
"listen, ive been playin this bad boy since the get go and ive watched it grow and prosper so mark my words: when this game releases it will be the best 3rd person shooter ever. possible catch 22: this game has been in beta for 3 and a half years.",8
"its a rather addictive game, and i like playing with kubrow genetics. trying to get an interesting one :o",2
"+i can play this free? yeah. +ive spent about 40-50 bucks and i feel ready to play my way! -im grinding again, a few more dollars will get me what i want but my video game budget is down. (yeah, i love gaming and they love my $) +metal gear rising with good controls and muti-player and.... -bare-boned story (gamers like to fill in the blanks, but common!!!!) +++i didnt buy this, but spent my money the way i wanted to. gamers are skeptical about micro-transactions, but i never bought the game in the first place...so i think we all came ahead on wf. (lets hope the devs keep that in mind and not milk our wallets!)",1
"this game is nice if you have a lot of free time on your hands and this is not a pay to win game. everything can be made if you have time to do so.",3
"fun and fast gameplay with interesting features. would recommend to play it with friend, or it can get a bit boring after some time. also a bit grindy , but in all id recommend it.",1
"think of castlevania hd on the xbox. its the type of game that you would not enjoy if you are playing it solo. however, add a couple of friends in the mix, and you got yourself a rootin tootin time. the game lacks a true story mode or a single player experiance, but makes up for it in the sheer amount of content. various types of mission have you and your friends going through shooting baddies and collecting material to build your next mass murdering machine. the game even has boss battles that put your warframes and gear to the limit. although the game free to play (f2p), most content can be obtained with a little effort on your part. you can even go as far as selling that hard to find mod (modification cards to increase the stats of warframes or weapons) or insanely difficult blueprint (used to craft new material) and obtain money from a willing buyer in the community that can be used to obtain weapon slots to add more weapons to your arsenal or buy some cosmetic items to make your warframe a fashionable kililng machine. theres nothing to lose when playing this game, so it wont hurt to give it a try. like said before, this game would be geared towards someone who is looking for that new multiplayer experiance with friends.",5
"i have put near 500 hours in to this if that says any thing about it, a masterful game with strong game play and with a high skill cap, plenty of gear and levels to play war frame is best played with buddys, and id recommend dropping five or ten bucks on it and forgetting the free to play. you can earn any thing in the game by playing, events offer any thing from new guns to cosmetic items but buy plat will make getting started a lot more easy, the only draw back to warframe is the truly insane crafting times to build new frames a and clan gear, but that is vastly out matched by its meany other achievements. at its base warframe was made by people (and scott) who love ninjas and space and robots and zombies and pirates, and made the perfect combination hack and slash and shot and space magic with rouge-like elements and rpg to bring you warframe a game about having fun!",5
"so much to to in a free to play game is amazing!! 10/10",1
"space ninjas. with magic space swords/hammers/scythes/... cutting nazi zombi cyborgs in half/quarters/... best thing ever.",5
"this is a pretty great game, as long as you dont mind alot of waiting and grinding. its updated pretty frequently with new content which is pretty great. its a good game but you have to be willing to invest some time into it in order to get any good.",2
"great game, fun to play, overall one of my personal favourites",1
"this game is like a combination of star wars, star trek, halo, mass effect and everything that is sci-fi and awesome all in one, while still having a wide arrange of originality. its an amazing game! the graphics are stunning, the gameplay is fluid and original, the customization is infinite, and best of all, its free! get this game! 10,000/10",1
"one of the most correct f2p shooter. every one have to try it!",5
"sci-fi online shooter/slasher, oriented on cooperative gameplay. missions with varied difficulty, assasination/espionage missions, various abilities to improve your character and weaponry (as well as levelling system for both your character and each weapon you use). free-to-play, though you gonna pay some real money for some classy weaponry and characters, though its totally okay to level up your starter set of weapons and your first character to a state of a kickass killing machine without no money spent at all! not to mention crafting system - do missions on specified regions, collect resourses and make these weaponry and chars by yourself for free (and in-game funds). good luck, have fun!",1
"good game & great game developers. ive play this game since theres nothing fishy. and while i played this game for the main game, i see lots of updates! game dev team are so great, more of bugs fixed, many thing updates not only the weapons.",5
"such a good game recomend this to everyone. its just such a good game!!!!!!",1
"awsome game all i found was my firewall had blocked it so it wouldnt work",1
"out of all the games that i have played (probably about 208)this one is my most favourite",3
"i think warframe is a pretty cool guy. he fights aliens and doesnt afraid of anything",1
"damn new ships! new stuff! new playstyle! if you love crazy motherf**** space ninjas,well this is your game! theres even new graphichs and better brightness,quests,sentinal hunters,dogs! play this game! its free and awesome.",7
"are you a space ninja? do you want te be a space ninja? have you ever had a weird fantasy involving space, ninjas and maybe a couple of digestive biscuits? if so, look no further than halo rea.. i mean warframe. with advanced sliding phisics, over 2 melee weapons and hundreds of bullets at your disposal, this game is really a revolution in dungeon crawling. i would highly recommend this game, to all players of literally any type of game, because if you dont like space ninjas, you probably dont like life.",5
"yes this game is a really example of what can be done with time and dedictaion to your craft, this game is great for its co-op and single player aspects and the fact that its free is amazing if you compare this to some like payday 2 were you have to pay for it and it makes payday look like it was made by a 10 year old",8
"really fun with a group of friends on voice coms, the co-op is great and synergistic between personal choices once you reach more advanced levels of play.",8
"free, addictive, ecxelent co-op, and it even has options for rvery play style. 110% reccomended.",4
"this game is unique there isnt any other game like this. if you dont beilive your welcome try to find another game like this.good luck, but even that wont help you",4
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played!",1
"solid game and really fun. the only problem i have with this game is that it keeps crashing on me which gets frustrating but never the less its still really fun ^-^",2
"this game is an amazing game. i honestly cant believe its free. the potential this game has is absolutely astonishing. yes there are some issues with it. i cant play with my friend from romania and it gives me this udp port error message that i have no idea how to fix, but all that aside i still very much enjoy this game and wish i could help in its development.",1
"this game is a great oppertunity to burn a few hours and have tons of fun doing it. for a game in beta it is fantasticlly built, they have a great community and is in a very fast paced setting. and its free to play! when the developers release an update they pack so full of fixes and additions to the game youd think that they were adding a mod. (but then again a update is basiclly a mod) i enjoy playing this game for two main reasons: 1. the fact that it is very fast paced and requires lots of thinking in the now, because the ai is very sophisticted and reactes accordingly but could get some improvements. 2. the amount of fun that i have just grinding away to get a cool item. i personally spent 40+ hours grinding away to get two really cool items in the game and i really enjoyed grinding that. when i dont know what to do in the game i go and play with my freind the first few missions. im now going to write about some minor issues in the game :d when i played the tutorial it was preety laggy the first time, so you might want to take that time and change settings ive only chrashed twice for no appernt issues but on review of those logs my pc stopped two important files from working. but i recommend this game greatlly and i cant wait to see where this game goes.",7
"one of my top games at the moment. it is currently in open beta (it has been in open beta for a while). pros: -there are very few bugs i have noticed -a massive variety of classes, weapons, and sentinals (basically pets that attack) -accompanies many play styles -many ways to travel around, freerun, stealth, charge, what ever you like -a insane amount of mods!!!! cons: -you can only have 2 warframe slots (a warframe is basically your class) unless you pay more -also a limited number of weapon slots -annoying to play without using any money on the game -other than the in game lore tab you can read there is no story running hand in hand with the game.",4
"bloody addictive and fun co op game to play with friends. i just cant stop trying to unlock all the warframes i can and max out all my guns. but honestly the game is repetitive and there isnt really a story. however i like this game.",3
"fun coop, i grew kind of addicted to it, but it still have to get a lot better, for now its just to easy and too quick for to reach then endgame , and most the obstacles to it are kind of anoyng, still its fun to rush trogh the enemy hordes, to be a silent parkour swordplay space age ninja, or get pirate mode and to blow out everything with a rocket laucher, or do both!",5
"amazing!! barley any lag and great graphics to match the fantatic gameplay",5
"pure awesomeness, this is the most enjoyable game ive played because i always come back to it. i think it has to be the most beautiful freetoplay game at the moment and it probably will stll be so for a while...",3
"let me start off by saying this game is addicting!!!! it is not only an exemplary example of a third person action/shooter but of a game utilizing a f2p model!!! digital extremes has done a wonderful job, ensuring balance across the board, whether its between the credits/platinum or between the weapons and warframes themselves. in addition, they have written a narrative, that is dare i say it relatively fresh and original, while simultaneously tying in dark sector, for which this game is a spiritual successor to. i am genuinely excited to see where warframes story and digital extremes shall take fans of this game next!!!",2
"great graphics, awesome gameplay. a very enjoyable game which is easy to play.",1
"mass effect gameplay with more creation and less plot based aspects",3
"warframe is a free to play 3rd person shooter and basicly u play as a ninja in the future, so you are a tenno and the tenno are specail because they can use the specail suits called warfames and every warframe is diffrent so its good to try a couple to see which maches your play style, and as you play your warframe and wepons gain xp and level up and this is where a important mechanic of the game comes in becase when a wepon or warframe levels up you get a point for your mods and some mods cost more than others baseline so go level some more to make yourself and yor wepons stronger because you shape your tools in this game!! then you can fuse mods and the selected mod will get better but will cost more points, so you have to find a balance between survival and damage stamina or energy (energy is used for your warframes ablilitys) so you shape your tools and i find this mechanic fun and entertaining in games (btw you can parkor you know wallruns valting and other ninja things :d)",4
"recommended for: group players. grinders. stealthers. i paid into this game very early on and i was glad to see it find its way to steam. the exciting dynamic of this game is, imo, its main draw. it is exciting and fun to play this game. the number of tactical variances is staggering. aside from the brute force approach, in my experience, most maps can be stealthed (by that i mean goals approached w/ minimal enemy threat drawn). incremental advance seems the most useful but ymmv. a good group of tennos can go very far and i think this a good weekly game for clans/friends/groups. if not daily. also i like the item affinity progression. this game meets my requirements for a viable free-to-play game.",1
"amazing game! after hard working and spending hours the game is really cool and fun! i recommend for all people who has patience and love space ninjas :d!",5
"quite the grindfest, but still enjoyable nonetheless. has a lot of different abilities and items to collect and level, making customization another strong part of the game. the game can be played without spending any money. however, the largest roadblock is the limited number of slots for storing weapons and warfarmes (classes). one needs to spend real money to unlock these slots. however, the slots are reasonably priced, and i am happy to support the developer. the game is continually changing and having new content added. it is still in beta, so we dont know if the developer will put forth the same effort once the game is released. overall, ive had a lot of fun with warframe, even though it does get repetitive.",1
"is awsome but beware the bright lights of explosions and death",1
"alongside of being addicting and fast paced (alongside of a stealth aspect being possible), the game introduces a challenging and in-depth grinding system that makes it a non pay-to-win game. essentially a third-person destiny, only free. no complaints here.",1
"a fun game, especially with friends. its a bit boring at first since you have little gear, but once you start leveling and collecting more, it becomes hard to stop. the game picks up at higher levels where enemies are more difficult. overall a good game, definitely worth playing.",4
"2 years of non-stop love for warframe, ive been here since closed beta and have no plan on leaving unless pwe ruins it like they do to everything they touch, i dislike you perfect world, no one likes cash cows",9
"somewhere between halo and assasins creed, and its free! you should play it.",4
"pros:+alot of customization for your weapons and chraracter +good graphics +constant updates +free to play(obviously) +great control cons:-microtransactions are a little overpriced -repetitive gameplay -bugs(obviously) -terrible connection in co-op overall: 6.1/10 its an action-packed third person shooter with hack and slash mechanics.even tho it is still in beta,it has some variety in it.although i had some problems with bugs,its still a fun game and with constant updates and patches.",5
"this game is so fun. if you enjoyed the mass effect franchise, do give this a go. plus, the art direction and graphics are beautiful.",1
"this game is amazing, great graphics, but a little laggy.",2
"great 3rd person shooter/fighter game with great co-op potential for up to 4 friends. good and incredibly friendly community both in-game and through support forums, this is by far one of my preferred games to play, when i dont want to feel the need to catch up to anyone or anything! plus.. space ninjas.. who doesnt friggin love space ninjas?! 8.5/10!",2
"i love it because i get to know what it looks like if im an alien. :d",1
"power armor...spells...killing stuff...what not to like?",1
"this is a very good game to play if you love action; and adds to the plate with a unqiue diveristy to other games.",1
"so i played warframe a lot during the beta. maybe a little to much to where i out did my self on the game and then it just got boring. it started to get boring though when shotguns came into play and anyone who had one could whipe the floor of any mission. later on i come back and see they changed everything. while some is nice i hate most all of the changes made. not to mention the gameplay is still boring however all co op style games are boring and are even more so if one person is able to do all of the work for you. kinda like boarderlands 2 its dull as hell. i havent yet beat it because after the first 30 mins its just straight up boring to me. warframe is fun playing it alone though as a single player or sometimes with one other person if they do not have something overpowered. i got this one guy in my clan into the game...he is addicted. he has over 3k almost 4k hours into it.",2
"i like it! pretty cool !!! worth a try if you have not given it one!",7
"warframe is perfect if you are the type of person that enjoys team cooperation. you may not like it if you dont like having to work for your equipment and things like that. for a free 2 play game warframe is amazing. therefore i would give it a 9.5/10.",1
"free? free? what is this communist garbage. i didnt fight the vietcong in tunisia back in 86, only to see all this free junk poppin up. last thing i got for free was some shrapnel in my  after charlie tossed a grenade in my hooch. i didnt abandon my kids only for this game to remind me of the amount of money ive invested in their futures. i have half a mind to send a letter to the president, detailing such egregious transgressions. let ol president obama know about this little terrorism youve got going on. im no scientist, but you should expect drone strikes. signed, a concerned patriot.",1
"great for people who love sci-fi mmos, and great for people who enjoy third-person shooters.",1
"definitely a great game you should try out. even if you dont like shooters its still worth a spin since it is free.",4
"its a grind, but fun enough i dont mind. the currency system is outlandish, but you can build or earn most weapons and equipment without buying them. though, it may take you years to do so.",7
"yeah its an well-made game...definitely recommeded if you have a good pc",1
"fun little action-shooty-time waster with gorgeous graphics and awesome animation. entirely free to play, though with the quality of what the game offers i never felt ripped off buying slots for the killer badass weapons i was able to acquire. quite entertaining and worth the price of admission.",10
"initially looked at warframe because i had nothing really to do until dark souls ii released. though after playing for a while i found that the game is very enjoyable albeit micro transactions if you want extreme customization (i.e skins more color options or heads) the game does start you off with 50 or so platinum which is enough to buy an acessory or color set which is cool. there are very few things you cant get unless you pay for, you can pay to unlock weapons without needing to grind for parts which is good in all some weapons might require you to be a certain rank to be able to even buy the blueprint for (in game currency of course) or alternativly you can buy them with irl cash. getting new characters can sometimes be taxing but in the long run its worth the time it taxes to construct the new character ( 12 hours for each of the 3 pieces then 72 for the actual character). daily rewards are very nice as well you can get anything from 50% of your next platinum purchase to weapon blueprints or even exp/affinity/credit boosters. all in all warframe is a very fun game to play.....crap now that i think about it i didnt even mention the gameplay o.o",1
"amazing graphics and controls. easy to understand and friendly environment. highly recommend.",1
"great game but later the cool weapons arent good and you just grind a lot",1
"basically? you run around as an epic wall-running gun-toting space ninja, defeating hoards of enemies and collecting new and awesome gear along the way. it is a good f2p model, where you can get almost anything without paying (with the exception of some cosmetics). definately an overall great game, pick it up.",6
"i am disappointed that this game is so underrated, i mean what can be more awesome than robots, zombies and ninjas in spaaaaaaaaaaaaaace!",6
"fun game to play with your friends.it has elements of 3rd person shooter combined with rpg.it has a big variety of weapons that will make you wanna level them all up,and a fair number of warframes that you can build and each of them has different abilities that are very interesting and unique.i would recommend you to try it out,i guarantee a lot of fun.",2
"awesome game. i definitely recommend downloading it.",4
"warframe is a sci-fi based third-person shooter. it is a very fun game with replayable stealthy or action played levels. co-op mode is very fun and interactive apart from the fact people steal my kills >.<. other than that i like how i can change my armor, customize my weapons, and use different colors on my character and my trusty blade. me, personally i like to play it stealthy on all missions, but if youre not that type, thats your way of playing :) overall, i love this game with its parkour aspects where as i can run across walls to get to the other side of a pit of lava or acid and i can climd up on a box to straddle over a railing to find myself six feet from an enemy. very fun and lots of cool features i highly reccomend it to shooter fans. :)",1
"this game is quite awesome for being a free-to-play title. fast-paced action, a leveling/modification system with depth, and space-alien-ninjas. what else could you want?",6
"oh..youre about to get that loki prime systems bp after wave 20? *the host has lost connection* oh look, a bo prime handle! *the host has lost connection* look! your friends are on, and want to do some tiv exterminate! *session failed* trying to squad up to catch that event before it ends? *squads up with 5-6 people* aw, it looks like you missed it..you have too many people in your squad, silly. if youre going to play warframe, dont play it through steam.",2
"the game is riddled with what seems to be an endless and tiresome grind that can only be alleviated by purchasing shortcuts through overpriced micro-transactions. however, if you can ignore that, and dont mind the grind, there is much fun to be had in this game. these types of games are always fairly addictive, as you are rewarded for everything, and always feel a sense of progression to almost force you to keep playing.",1
"as a space ninja you will kill zombies, aliens, and robots all while looking tottaly badass. reminds me of vindictus, diablo-ish style loot system, instanced missions, and cutting people in half. i was in the beta and had alot of fun and will return now that its on steam. not pay2win in anyway really since the game is all pve. you can unlock all the frames by doing missions and crafting them.",3
"you ing run around, shoot , if youre taking to much damage run away, run around some more, shoot more , well done you have completed the level. you want new items? sorry youll have to buy them with irl money or play the same missions and run around, shoot , if youre taking to much damage run away, run around some more, shoot more  about 60 times in order to even ing do anything worthwhile in this shitfest. nevermind the fact that you have to literally wait days to craft items, they are ing expensive as  too which just adds even more to the ing grinding. the ui is clunky and unintuitive, id rather ing play silkroad online and get scammed by ing turks purposely in order to try to purge the memory of ing playing this boring ing game from my ing brain. play if youre an autist.",1
"this a fun far future game im soo iliterate this is for da comunety bafge",1
"if you find mindlessly playing through the same levels over and over just to get weapons or armor to all that over again, then this masterful piece of videogame is for you!",1
"you need to really get into grinding for this game to be fun, and it can be highly p2w.",1
"i have two accounts with 400+ hours on both of them. fairly solid game. gets incredibly repetative. some community members make runs a pain due to lack of experience. just run ahead of them and kill all of the things and make them feel slow. once you get the wall run/jump thing down, you will be flying through levels.",5
"love this game. although my router wont let me forward ports, its still a great game to go solo aswell. i enjoy the aspect of gathering materials to build weapons and researching parts. i like the aspect of different frames with different abilities and modding capabilities. overall great game.",3
"warframe is an entirely new asthetic, instead of taking cover to dodge bullets you make cover, stealth around, or even dodge bullets (and lasers) with your mad ninja skillz. warframe is a thrid person shooter, with emphasis on grinding, and on teamwork. if you seek to play this (amazing) game, id recommend a team of four (you and three of your ninjaest friends) with some form of vocal interaction such as teamspeak or razer comms as ive not gotten the vocal settings figured out in game yet. if you enjoy the grind like in monster hunter, or phantasy star, youll love warframe, and remember: space ninjas play free",1
"this game is fun the updates takes to long and ii dont know why they would add a box after you press play cus sometimes the box freezes but gameplay looks awesome",1
"best free game evvvvvvvvvvvaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh",1
"surprisingly good game with co-op. sort of like the mass effect 3 multiplayer, but good, and with free-running space ninjas. there is almost no pvp in this game, which is wonderful for all of us sick of wonderful pve games being ruined by devs focusing solely on pvp, but if youre too much of a  little gremlin to play cooperatively with other people youre not going to like it very much. as someone whos dumped a lot of time into this game already, i should point out two things going in: it takes about 10-20 hours before youll get the hang of all of the craziness (so read up on the wiki), and it *is* primarily designed to be a cooperative game (so find a group to play with, because itll go much faster and be more reliable than playing with players from matchmaking).",6
"i could write essays about this game but instead ill go ahead and recommend it, its actually one of my best f2p games on steam(86/100)",1
"good graphics, different playmodes, cool interfase and free to play =d",4
"this is the best free game on steam ive ever seen :d...",1
"i love this game, its well made. good graphics and fighting mechanics, all bugs are dealt with quickly, so they arent much of a problem. a wide range of missions, well suited for leveling up, as it doesnt rise too fast, nor too slow. a massive selection of weapons, with challenges to get the materials to craft them adds even more fun to the game. i really do recommend this game to my friends and the public, especially since it is a great game for being free. get it now! youre missing out on all the ninja fun!",5
"tl;dr: really good space-ninja game. 11/10 in this game youre this alien thing in a suit called a warframe, and you do cool stuff like murder alien robots. this game is almost 100% free, with most of the in-game purchases being optional. you can even craft most of the premium items for free. 8/8- ign 11/10- me",1
"i just ordered a steelseries gamepad specifically for this game. with that being said, time to get back on the grind.",1
"hi everyone played warframe before. this is my first time play it,after i spenting much of time viewing it.the conclusion can be made as nice graphic such as enenmy ,ruined place and much more many ,yet i will recommends to you all",1
"when i played it at my freinds house, it was a great game. but every time i try to run it on my computer it pops up with a message saying update of directx failed and wont let me play.",1
"this game has come a long way since its release. wow. so much content! i am a bit overwhelmed but i love it!",1
"basically ninja-mech simulator, lots of warframes, lots of missions, lots of weapons, and lots of ways to get yourself stuck outside of the map. one of my favorite shotter games ever!",2
"yes i would recommeded this to friends. go and try it! pros: fun and awesome game. play with friend and kill some bad guys. upgrade your warframe characters and weapons. long and lots of missions. cons: lots of grinding to get ranks up but still fun and part of the game. when i first play it, i had no clue what to do or where to go. but eventually you will get there once you look around and figure out. rate: 8/10 recommend: yes",1
"got bored downloaded this game got 5 people to join the game in 1 day realized theres a recruit-a-friend function as we were all playing in skype together 10/10 would cry in a corner again.",1
"very fun and addicting, however, repetitive gameplay makes the game dull off after a month or two of constant play. however, the developers constantly release new updates and features that brings in gamers old and new.",2
"amazing game, and loads of fun to play with friends. be prepared that this is a progression type of game and there is a lot of grinding to be done before you are powerful enough to enjoy the whole game. be prepared to work for things you want over time , if you are not wanting to spend too much money. easily one of the best f2p games ever.",1
"incredible for a free game, has alot of content most of which can be gained through the game itself, some things have to be bought using the premium currency but thats mostly just for looks, also its one of the only mmos ive seen with direct combat! very fun, very much recommended!",3
"well if you like killing things and i mean killing things this game does that..... endless kill with tha ability to craft new and power full wepons. there are wepons for evey playthrough stile from stealth to guns loaded tanking. this game can repeat its self but even then its still a good game. good enough for me to play over 150 hours",7
"good game. looks great for a free to play, and is very addictive. its worth getting.",1
"warframe has that inevitable mmo feature of draining all your time away. but its awesome.",2
"really good game but it gets repetitive a little to fast. +good graphic +good control +good gameplay -the community is a little too small for the game - gets repetitive fast",2
"do you like to grind? if yes, then this game is the best game ever! 10/10 would grind again",1
"currently one of the best f2p (free to play) games available right now. warframe has top of the line graphics, controls, content, dev team quality, sound and even unusual lore. this game has got everything going for it right now and no downside what so ever which is almost unheard of. suffice it to say its doing right what 99% of the current gaming market is doing wrong. its also in beta but for a beta product its more complete than most high end titles in the past 5 years or so. also, while the game does sell weapons and equipment in the cash shop it is usually far easier to obtain in game than the cash shop price which actually puts cash shop users at a near disadvantage. how uncommon! if all of this wasnt enough the rate at which updates are cranked out in nearly over polished form is quite amazing. warframes cranked out more content, updates, changes, balances, new items, armors, maps and ai types than many high end mmos do in a year and they do it with a much smaller team too. this game is a shinning example of what should be. suffice it to say warframes cutting its own bloody path to true fame and glory among both f2p and p2p games alike. this one is a definite must try for any scifi, hack&slash or shooter fan. easy 10/10.",2
"an interesting game i shall say , crafting system, co-op play and many more fun details!!!!!!",1
"good for burmese players since its a free-to-play game with nice co-op shooting gameplay, the drawback is the gameplays repetitive and you have to pay to reduce wasting your time grinding more warframes, items and weapons. other than that you can get almost all items. :) edit: gonna play on ps4, still bad that i cant import my character from pc to ps4 :/",1
"awesome game. lots of grinding but thats the fun of it all, meeting new players or having fun with a group of friends. f2p only charging for cosmetics as everything else is craftable(be patient, it can take up days to craft some items.) overall, an 8.9/10 in my book. solid gameplay, plenty of cool weapons and warframes to give a try. just dl it and play already! :)",1
"outstanding level of fun and awesomeness on a f2p game (nothing such as p2w exists for this one), what else could you ask for?",7
"basically, you are a homicidal semi-mercenary parkour space ninja, and you murder your way across the solar system. it is also free-to-play. for these reasons it is almost certainly worth some of your time.",1
"this is the only free to play game i will ever play! but the recent updates have been giving me bad frame rate ):",1
"this game stoled my life, addicted 200%, 1000 hours in 3 months sush a great game 12/10, learn to play and be addicted, free to play ninja, recommended :d",8
"its all fun and games at the beginning. sorta like an adventure there. then mid game becomes a long long long grind for top tier stuff while trying to look like you are, whitlist complaining about how long it will take. all in all, if ou dont mind grinding alot, its pretty good.",4
"this is one of the best on line games i have ever played. the physics are spot on and the environments eye popping not to mention engrossing. having a very aggressive opponent is very crucial to any combat oriented arena. coupling that with mazes and puzzles that i and my friends can get immersed in... pops!",3
"overall this game is just awesome, with a fair buisness model and a great engine it has everything you would want. even though some of the levels (very few) are repetitive you can enjoy the game alone or with a friend. i highly recomend this game so check it out maybe youll have a new favorite game to play.",1
"a game where you spent 80% of it grinding to get the good stuff, only to realize later, that there was better stuff and after you grind for that stuff, you realize an update came out, with new and better stuff, so you grind for that stuff until you realize that others have better stuff than you. i call that a win-win. maybe also contain some rage inducing orokin cells.",2
"really fun, a bit grindy, but the grinding can be pretty fun.",1
"dragon frame>>>> they have a fxxking drangon frame!!!!! which alternately look kinda like a seahorse.... dragon and seahorse!!! 11/10 best ftp game ever (along with ghost rec phontom, that game is pretty gd too)",3
"warframe is unique, in many good ways and in many bad too. the premise of the game itself is brilliant, space ninja-samurai that fight robot-men and plauge beasts, its radical and filled with flashy effects that youd expect from a third person shooter mixed with a spectacle fighter, with an interesting and in-depth lore to boot its hard to fault warframe for what it offers and the price it offers it for, free. there is however something to note, warframe features a cash shop that allows you buy anything within the game for platinum, your platinum account is charged by real world money and doing so gives you a huge boost within the game, i want to stress though that everything, every single item can be gained in game without the use of platinum. to do so though, makes the game a massive grind. starting solo and venturing into the game for the first time, my personal experience was that this game truly comes close to forcing you to have to pay for some item to break up the norm of running the same mission over and over again in order to gain new weapon upgrades, before spending any money on the game i was on my way to gaining my prime warframe, but purchasing a pack of platinum surpassed all build times, item requirments and even allowed me to double my modification slots. a great, free game that becomes grounded by a borderline questionable payment methods, if you can deal with the occasional grind, its well worth it. and i can totally deal with the grind.",4
"the only downside to this game is that there is no open world or even sandbox type environment to expand immersion within the world. in virtually every other aspect, the game is a dream-like playground for fans of games like mass effect, unreal tournament, or in some ways even prince of persia and ninja gaiden. there is wall running handled in a well executed manner, there is melee combat complete with actual combos and timing as well as blocking, there is evil space creatures and factions to kill and hate, and there is a huge array of both weapons and warframes to choose from and collect in order to diversify your experience. even recently a new system of flight combat was added straight out of a space shooter sim hybrid. while it is true the game is very light on story line or explanation, and can become quite grindy after a deep binge of obsessive exposure, the core systems of the game are bieng constantly improved and there is no pay 2 win mechanic because anything you can acquire through the shop except for a very few cosmetics are all obtainable in game. pvp players be warned however, this game is not about pvp, at all, and the pvp aspect of the game is not very well realized or implemented at this point. while pvp is playable, it is certainly not for everyone and is not what the game is focused around at all.",7
"at least a year and a half ago, i saw this game for the first time. i still remember what i was thinking while watching the trailer: my god, this game looks too complicated, you must have to mash combo after combo of keys to do that flippy thing after this and some thought, i figured i would think about it and wait to see if a friend recommends it. i regret not signing up right away. a week or so later, a friend i had met on left 4 dead 2 starts playing the game, and i ask him, is it good? is it worth making the account for? he said, hell yeah, this game is crazy... i still dont really get the game, but it is pretty cool. so, i set up my account and started playing. for the first few days, i played a little here and there, still pretty clueless and felt planetside 2 needed my attention more. but one saturaday morning, i had a sudden realization that i could get more weapons and even warframes than just my good old excaliber and mk-1 braton. i started playing much more after that, and i still remember my very first crafted weapon: my beautiful orthos. next came the furis, and finally the boltor. i was all set up, and at that point completely hooked. this was all a year and a half ago, too. that game has come so very far from that point, and i am still playing today like i did before. the gameplay was and still is loads of fun and extremely fast pased. if you are looking for a good game to play, i recommend clicking download",9
"the most engaging mmo i have played to date. every new weapon, warframe, and update changes things up enough to keep me hooked. the devs are amazing, and pay attention to the community better than any other company ive ever seen. best of all, you dont have to pay a cent. between alerts, drops, and blueprints, you are not required to spend any money. one of my favorite games ever.",2
"this is a good game for the first couple of hours but it gets a bit repetitive after that. the combat is satisfying and enemies explode into glorious showers of blood but there are a lot of repeated assets and enemies, making this a game that you should get if you feel like something fun to play for a couple of hours, and its for the wonderful price of nilch, so you should probably pick it up.",3
"this game is so fun, i cant get enough of it, all of it is fun. so much things to do in the game, this is one of the best 3rd person games yet! give it a try, you will like it.",4
"awesome game to be honest. i dont play it much because i find it confusing (especially the menu) the buttons are everywhere. but i guess thats only personal experience. all in all, this is a 9/10",3
"the most artistic and extreme scifi action game of all and best of all its freeeeeeeeeee the controls are very easy and every level is big and beutiful.",1
"i love this game, it has got to be one the best f2p games ever i loved every miniute of playing it, even griding is fun if you have one or two people to do it with.",3
"pros: + good graphics + cool variety of different weapons + combat system + fast bugfixes + many variety of different characters to play with + different types of bosses and enemies + space ninjas cons: - grinding (seriously if you dont like grinding you will not enjoy this game) - not noob friendly - end game dont exist yet (only survival and defense mission that can last for 40-60 min) - repeated map tileset - confusing maps - pray to rng god a whole lot, you never get what you want - a bit of event to win (so dont miss events) be prepared to sink tons of hours like i have if you want to experience everything that warframe has to offer. this game is not friendly to new players cause all weapons and warframes takes many resources to build, so expect many reruns. despite all of its flawes its still a fun game with loads of contents for newer player, so if you have time to play many hours i can recommend this game for you.",5
"a great ftp game which will make you feel happy shooting things and going pew pew. you do fun jumps and dive everywhere and shoot these robot guys and do missions and advance forward. co-op is great in this game aswell get it now.",1
"easily one of my favourite free-to-plays, due to the nature of the in-game purchases and how much fun it is to grind levels/gear. i actually cant think of another ftp game that is fun to grind. runescape was probably only the other fun game going back to its classic days, but even that has basically become pay-to-play, disregarding the fact that they still advertise it as a ftp game. you can aquire anything in the game without real world money, and it isnt ludicriously hard like it is in competitor games. furthermore, your far better to spend your money on additional warframe (characters/suits) and weapon slots as initially you are pretty strapped for space. however by the time you reach these limits you will know if your money is worth it. keep it mind however that the slots are incredibly cheap aswell, for 2 weapon slots sell at at 12p (p is platinum, the ingame premium currency), and 1 warframe slot a tad more expensive at 20p. definately give this game a try if you havent already, it wont cost you a cent - literally!",3
"for a free to play, this is very good. it is good that they offer the ability to make a warframe instead of purchasing it. it makes you appreciate what you have in a game. 11/10",3
"i quit playing this game back in early beta, it got very grindy. they have changed all of this. fun game again, super easy to get into with friends, but deep and complicated towards the end, so you have something to work for and not get bored. really fun co-op shooter and tons of stuff to keep you entertained and busy! :)",7
"you play as a space ninja fighting genetically engineered power armoured warriors, robots and bioweapons in the grim, distant future. warhammer 40k meets hack and slash ninjas. so much yes.",10
"brilliant game to play with your mates, or in solo! would reccommend this game to anyone who likes futuristic sword and gun games with a hint of puzzle solving! 10/10!",1
"one of the most free to play games with no real p2w, while u can buy every piece of equipment for real money, u can also find and craft them that doesnt take that long. game play smooth as butter as long as u have a good host or play solo , the weapons are varied and characters are mostly well balanced, there is no real pvp(there are duels in dojos and 2v2s in conclaves that have a gearscore range but no rewards). while the game has a few bugs here and there its pretty damn polished for a beta. and it has bows. bows are great! 9/10 needs more bows.",2
"if you like space+ shooting x melee % killing allot = a really good game...i know that wasnt that great for recommending this game but you should at least try it.",5
"this is the best free to play game ive ever played. it has huge updates almost every month and endless content to keep you entertained. it has great graphics, great gameplay, and great multiplayer it also runs good on any computer. i would buy this game if it where to cost money",1
"overall for a new player this is a very good game, and i recommend getting it. in fact id recommend everyone at least tries it once, because it truly is different to any other game out today. now i did greatly enjoy this game, ive donated quite alot of money during my time playing. however this game suffers what many games still do; once you have everything you want, or are just satisfied with what you have, the only reason you play the game is to try look better than your peers. [can also be explained in the endless cycle formula- grind to get better weapons, to grind with those better weapons, to grind with those better weapons to get more weapons to grind with, to grind to get better weapons (loop here) = insanity] it basically becomes a great big pissing contest between the pros, including endless hours of grinding for weapons that the other players dont have yet the weapon is most likely not even worth the grind. yes i admit this game is still in developement, however i am just pre-warning, this game is yet to offer a great amount for the good/old players. as for actuall gameplay, id give it a 9/10. fun factor, 9/10, but decreases overtime. unless you dont mind grinding. as an added bonus id like to praise the technical support team, they are the nicest and most helpful support ive ever encountered. <3 you warframe, even if you annoy me.",5
"i want this game to bear my children. its very loving, gives me stuff for free and supplies me with happiness. oh, and blood. and ninja cyborg assassins. and does what i tell it to. what more could you want from a wif- i mean game? did i mention it contains ninja cyborg assassins? because it does, and theyre awesome. this game is easily a tenno of ten.",1
"haaving played this game for hundreds of hours...give it a in try, its free.",7
"ok ben playing i want some more friends to play join me so we can all work on geting better",1
"this game gets more awesome with every update it releases dont mention the graphics which will blow your mind. of course there are a things that disappoint me, but pros covers the cons here ninjas play free ! :)",2
"hands down best, most balanced f2p i have every played. pve focused (currently) with no need to buy anything.",1
"a fast-paced action-packed third person shooter that will entice you within minutes. the range of available characters and weapons to unlock and build really add to the games possibilities of ways to play, fight and win. the only negative thing i have come to notice is that you cant really unlock other warframes to use until mid to late game (unless you spend real money), but even that just encourages more gameplay and more fun! but a word of caution: this game does not have a running storyline after the first missions, so if you are looking for a plot to get involved in, this is not the game. needless to say, overall, this game is a great action-filled tps that will have you hooked for life and the fun will go on without end.",3
"im not a huge fan of fps. so, having the melee attack & bow option is great. the graphics are amazing as well. i also like that anyone can be recruited into a squad or you can even select solo..as im more prone to soloing.",1
"this game is the !!! a/10 would rail again! grustrag three can suck my boltor :>",4
"amazing game love every moment about it space ninjas ftw",6
"for me, great game. many shooting and sword fighting or special skills. many weapons and missions, really cool.",1
"well i like this game, its a game meant for people that like to adventure, play with friends, fight, you can do all sorts of stuff! you get to duel with members, do missions, get pets, make weapons, make your weapons better, and enjoy the game :)",5
"to do list: 1. install this game. 2. play this game. 3. look out a window and scream spaaaaaaaaaaaaaceeee! 4. enjoy the game. 5. realise you have to grind a lot of areas and rage. 6. you dont care about how you feel and grind dem items for cool guns/warframes. 7. wasted all dem hours. 8. worth it. 9. only play it because of 3.",1
"pretty fun game, especially if you are into sci-fi stuff. it becomes even better if you are playing with frinds as squad. the main defect is that it can be boring if you want to craft weapon/frame and you need to get materials- it takes long time and you have to play on same maps again and again.",1
"l -absolutely- recommend this game. incredible fun. co-op too, so pay to win is almost out of the question. go solo or go with friends, even go online and youll have a good time. ;) choose a weapon that suits your playstyle, and choose a frame to go along with it. the game is amazingly free to play - however you want. all in all the game is great. l cant explain much with this text alone, and if a picture is worth a thousand words then that must mean actual gameplay is worth 100,000. go try it out now, youll be glad you did. its only 30 minutes to download, and 36,000 of fun. ;)",2

"if i could spam the utter living hell out of the thumbs up button, i seriously would. i never thought id like a game like this, but its absolutely amazing! the graphics, the gameplay, the mechanics of the game, the stories (missions, really0 are pretty cool, the variety. its basically the father to destiny, but better. i love destiny, do not get me wrong, i really do, but all the exotic things destiny promised are actually here in warframe. the weapons have deeper variety and the cutomization is pretty freaking awesome. theyre still adding new things to the game (like the hounds they added to the game not too long ago called kubrows) as it keeps going and its all incredibly awesome! and there is so much to do, i hardly have enough time in my day to do it all. if you like destiny and the mass effect series, youll love warframe!",3
"its a bunch of space ninjas flying around grinding for items. not bad.",1
"let me make this clear. i love warframe. i started playing it a few years ago, way before the whole archwing, doggeh companions and ordis. all this stuff added to the game has made it even better. my only problem? i cannot launch it from steam. something has screwed warframe up for my steam, or the computer im on, and ive tried everything to get it to work. i can only get the game to launch fully by going into the games folder and running the launcher outside of steam. now if only i didnt have damn lag, then id be content. so if your computer is better than mine, which it probably is, and if you love games that you can feel epic and badass in with only an option to spend actual cash, download warframe now and become a space ninja. the grind for items and stuff is still there, but all games have item grinding so, why complain about that unless you enjoy being a negative little whiner. you know who you are, you whiners.",2
"this game is fantastic, the devs are extremely active in the community, there is a massive variation in weapons and warframes (characters). the levels are randomly generated with premade tile sets, so levels are hardly ever the same. the only thing i have against the game is the fact that it is a grinding game. although honestly its not to much of an issue. the gameplay is smooth and satisfying. the best part is that this game is still in beta, so it can only get better. warframe doesnt deserve a 67/100 from metascore.",3
"this game just keeps getting better. sometimes you need to farm for resources but even farming is fun! so many classes and weapons i dont know what to do with myself. i totally reccomend this game and cant say enough good about it. its better then pizza (and pizza is amazing). this game has so many hours worth of gameplay to it and yet its free. my life is so simple and happy now that i have warframe. :d",6
"its a really good game to play with friends. as well with strangers but there lacks a lot of fun. only downside of the game is that it kinda feels repeatable in way your mission dont really change that much its straight up go in kill/collect/protect that and thats it.",1
"fun, co-op game with a nice novelty to keep you comming back (crafting, build times, updates, etc.). unfortunately the novelty wears off and the game becomes pretty cut and dry.",1
"motherlovin space ninjas. if you turn this game off, for even 10 minutes, you will miss rare cards, updates, new frames, potatoes, and megans gigglebox. i apologize for my low playtime, but my gf threatened to kill me if i got to 600 hours. would play 600 hours again!",6

"one of the best games ive played in awhile. very immersive, fast paced sci fi action and kubrows! lots of weapons to choose from, ive looged almost 400 hours into this game and it nevers gets boring. a must play for anyone who likes sci fi shooters mixed with parkour and a large universe to explore.",7
"all the revenue hooks and addiction lures are super obvious but the core gameplay is rather fun. the game is under active development (open beta, technically) and the official forums see plenty of fan submitted content or suggestions reach some stage of in game implementation, which is nice.",3

"amazing cyber ninja game just what i needed for a game to play on steam bored of other games that are fps or sandbox for now",1
"this game combines amazing graphics and fun, fast gameplay into a amazing package. the division between different warframes and modifications available make this game unique. the best part is that there is no pay to play. yes to get things it gets alittle grindy but its worth it. well made game with more coming up for it hopefully",1

"you can look at my game time and ive only had this game for about 3 weeks now. i only played a couple of hours the first week then got addicted to this game. its a very fun, sci-fi based, robot alien killing, fast paced, co-op game. it does have some features that make it seem like you need to pay but you dont. heres the run down: you can spam/farm void missions to get in game currency e.g. selling prime parts(from void missions) for platnium anywhere from 4p to 250p+. this game is either wait to get it or pay to get it instantly.",1
"i love this game so much but i swear to yall i am scared to play by myself. i love the fun with me bow. the most important thing i would have to say is that know your warframes before you play the game. it was kinda difficult when i picked my warframe (hint:i picked volt). it was kinda hard to understand the controls because i have not played a game amazing as this on a pc. i strongly recommend this fun thrill ride of a game.",1
"+ extremely good visual + extremely fun gameplay + active community(join a clan) + not pay to win, but pay to look awesome + free to play ? extremely time consuming - bugs, not so bad though",4
"warframe is a great game. playing it by myself for a while made it seem horrible, but then i started playing with friends from school. it became one of the most played games in my library. its a perfect game to nerd out with. this needs more than an hour to get used to and to start having a lot of fun (unless youre lucky and someone gives you a ton of gear. it is a definitely a game you have to play over a long period. it may take a while getting used to the odd playstyle.(i just wish there was a bit more lore in the game!). this game is absolutely not pay to win, but it is pay to look good. nearly every weapon that can be bought with platinum has a blueprint version that can be bought with credits. i myself enjoy collecting resources and building the blueprints more anyway. again, great game 9/10",3
"great f2p game with high quality realisation on most aspects. it can get you hooked to it for hours and youll find new things to do for a good while. one of the few game where grinding here and there isnt a drag. also (and maybe i should have started with that) its a game about space ninja wizards with guns. and you play the space ninja wizards.",4
"17 hours in and i am not even level 2. the grind is hella real in this game but idk, some people like that or maybe i just suck. anyways, this game is such a cluster . you got some robot  looking protagonists fighting a bunch of stuff and you get a samurai jack blade and the parkour skills of a 13 year old british boy, and you are suppose to just go out it. i also got butt  over and over when i tried to go to the harder levels. i like it a ton ;)) 10/13",1
"qualifications for epic game: space? check. ninjas? check. ninjas in space? check.",3

"warframe is a lot of fun whether you like to play solo or co-op. its a freemium game, so if you dont want to drop some dough on cold, hard platinum (paid currency) you will be grinding like crazy. everything functional can be researched/built/found/won/etc. whereas aesthetics are all plat-purchased. game looks great, plays great and is constantly receiving updates and new events happen regularly. get it, play it. what do you have to lose aside from some time you would have otherwise wasted anyways?",6
"the gameplay would be better if it wasnt so good. as for the story? hah! gaaaaaaaaaaaay! you know what would make this game better? the possibility of playing it while sleeping. at least we can have dreams...",6
"robot ninjas in space. what more could you want? 9/10",1
"an awesome game! you can do many  to kill those scrubs. play with friends to make a  squad and go solo when you are a badass.",2
"warframe is the most badass game ever invented by mankind, it features cybernetic robot ninjas with epic weapons. in warframe you are a rare species called the tenno who have been in cryosleep for a long period of time, and during this time new factions have been built and are fighting conquests all over the galaxy. as a teeno you must go through each planet node and do each objective to weaken the enemy factions. the combo system is amazing and it only gets better once you find the warframe that suits you the most. the graphics will most likely give you epilepsy and you wont be able to see due to the lights and motion blur distorting your vision. the free-to-play model used in this game gives no player advantage however this does not really matter due to the lacking pvp in the game itself. overall warframe is a good game however you may experience alot of grinding and replaying mission 7/10",4

"i can not believe that this game is for free and its in beta stage it has so much to offer i can not wait till it is fully finished",1
"fun, fast, free. great for playing half an hour per day. one-of-a-kind, beautiful character and level design.",4
"after playing this game for a few hours now, i highly recommend you play it, hours of gameplay which im still farming for things, its not p2w but in some aspects it is only having 2 warframe slots out of the 30. but still 10/10 from me.",4
"played this in closed beta, thinking of coming back. the time i spend with this game was a good time, a really good time. then the inventory system changed alot and i just couldnt understand it so i left. the combat is alot of fun and most of the time pretty easy. the best thing however are the ninja skills/parkour tricks you can pull of, like wall-running and at the same time shoot someones head off. pure awesomeness. i also like the small cinematic scenes at the beginning and the end of a mission :3",1
"free to play, pretty interesting at the beginning... but requires a lot of grinding if you dont want to pay for it. i would recommend it - you can spend a couple of evening having fun, but dont expect staying there for too long.",1
"the game its self is a fine game, to me the combat system is good and it runs smoothly. the only thing that gets me is that you need platinum to get pretty much everything, from wepons to other characters",1
"try this game and stick with it for 1-2 weeks before deciding if you like the game. i really do like this game. the graphics are awesome. the gameplay fast, furious and wrapped in good artistic style (and the gore is.....jolly good). highly recommended if you like co-op game and or action game. the only gripe is platinums are a bit overpriced though redeemingly you do not need themt to craft anything in game except to buy slots for your weapons and warframes(armored suits).",1
"amazing game, tons of replay value, outstanding end game content. the game kinda lacks customization but the story makes up for it 100%",8

"really good game it reminds me of mass effect but warframe is on steriods hahahahahaha",1
"been playing this since beta days and discovered it from polycount forums when theyd announce their project and immediately download and play. if you like fast paced, scifi, ninja then this is for you and i recommended it. warning: you will get addicted to it and its a grindfest but not that too much grind like korean mmos, newbies can easily pick the gameplay and it has a new tutorial for newbies. they keep updating the game and add new warframe, maps, game modes and weapons. so youll never be bored.",1
"at many times will it be an absoulute grind-fest, but the community is far from toxic(i.e. very helpful and positive) and the gameplay is very fun. weapons range from bows to kunai to a giant greatsword.** 8/10**",1
"best pay to win ever made, it gets really envolving afther you learn about the lore and it actually gets preety adicting. one bad thing about it its that the multiplayer has way too much problems.... ing strict nat but, if you solve that problem, youre really good to go",2
"this is a great game and its free. the only negative thing is that it can get a little bit repetitive and a bit glitchy. the thing i love about this game aswell is that you dont need a good connection to play it in co-op which is great for me. i would recommend playing co-op after the first few mssions as it gets pretty hard after that.",1
"great game! lots of customization and mods to make your weapons and warframes stronger, lots of weapons and warframs to choose from, fun acrobatic/ninja-type stuff you can do (wall running, stealth kills, etc.) and amazing graphics, even if you turn them down to the lowest settings. still, have really good internet and a powerful computer, or else youre in for a really laggy time. 9/10",1
"flippin ninjas with pistols and machine guns. what else can you ask for? this game brings me back to the days of gunz online but its so much better and has less hackers. this game will make you lose track of time and wonder where the sun went. if anyone still had doubts that free to play games could be good this game sure clears those doubts. people just need to give it a chance. i only have one issue with it. i dont know how they setup ports in the game, but having to change you router configuration is not fun.",1
"i like how everything and everyone is a raiden clone. raiden/grey fox change yo loife.",2
"this is ing awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wait till update 14 and start playing. i demand!",6
"i love this game, its a blast to play coop with some friends or even random people. the only problem i have is it is not mac compatable. i used to have a laptop that ran windows but it broke unfortunetly and i now have a mac which i recieved as a gift (not my choice really). i know you can run windows on a mac but i have heard you can run into many problems including running out of memory (only have 4 gigs in my mac and you cant change it out on mine). i would love if this game became mac compatable and would gladly drop a few more $ on it as i have in the past. but with the time i had with the game, it was a blast!",2

"this game is ruining my life and my wallet. 10/10 would play again.",4
"this is probably the best space-ninja game you will ever play. if you want a quick recommendation, you have it. edit: once upon a time there was a very long page here. well many many updates later its safe to say that this game is still growing in surprising and exciting ways. its still a game that feels that you have to dump a couple bucks into every now and then, but it never feels forced: by the time you feel the urge for some platinum youve probably put a hundred more hours into playing, so why not? money you spend should be based on the fun youre having, and warframe is promising to keep entertaining for a long time.",8
"honestly an amazing game. once you get past the kinda crappy starter gear and into things you like more, it becomes really fun. the biggest pushfactor for most players is the crafting time. once you get over the fact that you cant always get what you want right away and learn to deal with it, it isnt an issue anymore. overall, a really fun, unique game. id reccomend it to anyone into any kind of action game.",6
"excellent game - worth downloading, playing, and becoming addicted to.",1
"i absolutely love this game. it is the definition of a amazing free to play experience, although you will need to spend some money to get the full experience. it is very much worth it in my opinion! also supporting indie devs gives you a nice feeling :) but the meat meat of the gameplay is the third person ninja shooter. being a space ninja ou are very agile and can pull off parkour with ease. the gunplay is satisfying and has a lot of impact with great sound assests make hearing and feeling the pop of a headshot! i cannot reccomend this game enough! but the gripes i have is that the entry level is massive with most of the weapons and frames being very daunting for new player, along with some grind. it could need patience.",6
"ive put over 110 hours into this game so far, i have paid nothing and gotten almost everything in game, worth getting just for space ninja killings.",8
"for me the game is slow so i recommend it to others with fast computers",2
"this game is so much better since update 14, most people have tryed this game along time ago but give it a 2nd chance because update 14 clears up all of the clutter and confusing interface. it is a great game and you should at least try it",2

"space ninjas. a goofy story. beautiful graphics. devs who care-regular updates/patches/expansions. and now you can fly in outerspace! 9/10. if nothing else, youll at least get your moneys worth so its worth a try. :)",5
"awesome character designs, fun missions, cool combat mechanics, and as if that wasnt enough, its free to play, and everything that isnt cosmetic can be aquired from playing the game at no cost.",1
"ive never been that much of a fan for coop fast intense games, but this one is fantastic! it runs with a smooth pace at high qualities and has nice players on!",1
"warframe a fresh new take on the third person shooter series of games. with futuristic weaponry and characters, i instantly got hooked on the game. instead of being a pvp oriented game, warframe focuses on co-op missions. you can team up with up to 3 players, forming a 4 man squad, to eliminate nodes on the map and receive rewards and experience. there is not much else i can say other than you should definitely try this out. youll have to experience this game for yourself to realize how awesome it is.",1
"ever wanted to play as a space ninja? ever wanted to take on hordes of alien enemies across the solar system? ever wanted to feel like a compleate badass? well then warframe is for you! it still in open beta so there are some bugs but its gameplay mechanics overrule them by a long shot! and its free. get it!",1
"awesome space ninja hack and slash game. topped off by the fact that it has an awesome f2p model",8
"this seems like a good game. i havent played for very long, but i beat the first couple levels with a friend of mine. all i can say is that its a fun game, especially with an xbox controller.",1
"this game is probably one of the best mmos out there. its very amazing to play with friends, and just as fun when you solo as well. the gameplay is quite addicting, to the very point that itll constantly draw you back into the mix if this appeals to you in any way. the beginning, like most games, is quite the grind fest, but once you get past that point, it only gets better. while melee is not the best in this game, they offer quite a wide variety of weapons and warframes, which signify the classes. the game can get quite tedious, but try to look past that and youll be addicted just as easily as i am. my only complaint about this game is that there are so many weapons and warframes that i cant have them all because you need platinum to buy slots, which they generously give you 50 to start out with for extra warframe or weapons slots. if you enjoy playing with friends, this is the game to download. teamwork needs to be handled very carefully or you can end up failing a mission that you could have easily won. while the game doesnt have the best soundtrack, it makes up for it with the ambiance. id recommend you to try this game at least once if you are curious about it.",9
"overall a very very good game! great graphics, epic and intense combat, and well...space ninjas! aside from some bugs here and there my only complaint is the levels get repetative, but its not a game breaker for me. highly recomend this game, its a lot more fun then it looks, and it already looks really fun!",7
"its an amazing looking game with great mechanics. i love the feeling of being a space ninja in the middle of a solar system war. i rate this game a 9/10 smackaroos. unfortunately even on the lowest settings i still get the occasional lag spikes when my computer cant handle the graphics.",2
"youre like a ninja in space and  and you can have dual wielding pistols or you can have cyber swords and  and when the guys shoot at you theyre like pew pew pew and when you got yer sword out you block it like a ing jedi and youre like  yeah merica and then you run super fast and jump kick em in the face or do a running-splip-n-slide whirlind sword thing and chop their in kneecaps off and when youre all sorrounded and  you just press 4 and then everything around you dies and youre like  yeah merica pros: + ninjas + in space + dual wielding pistols + running slip-n-slide sword whirlind + psychic ninja powers cons: - actually made by canadians 1/0",1
"warframe is an excellent game, with a lot of variety and great graphics. i think it could use some more mods, like one to increase clip size, and a few of the enemies could use a nerf, but all in all warframe is a lot of fun to play, either alone or with friends.",8
"me and my best friend stumbled upon this game when it was in beta, and it has yet to stop amazing us with enjoyable content and an amazing story. the action is fast paced and will keep you returning kill after kill.",2
"just go and download the game. its good for an open beta.",3
"this game has more bugs than the whole fallout franchise.",5
"even though some people may complain about this game for its excessive grind or the need to pay money, at its core its a fun, space ninja shooter. instead of having the take cover against the enemies, they have to take cover against you. my only complaint about this game would be the excessive grind in some areas, and the seemingly neverending cycle of patch, introduce more bugs, patch again. 7.5/10",3
"i just kinda like that this game lets you kill everything.",2
"this game is insanely fun. i recommend this game to anybody who likes sc-fi and cyber ninjas. this game is cool saying that you aquire the moves, mobility, and weapons of ninjas. this game is a good third person shooter and it is good for those who are hardcore ninjas. overall, good game and i recommend this.",2
"what is more fun than being a space ninja and killing those pesky little infested with your over-powered dragon nikana?",1
"this game is pretty kubrow. seriously though. every kind of weapon you can think of from the past or future. an amazing variety of characters (frames) to suit any play style and each one can be customized to suit you even further. the style is very unique and i love it. go thousands of years in the future, and place ancient samurai-like warriors on a backdrop of chaos, genocide, and a very mysterious history. sure, it can get repetitive and is somewhat centered around grinding and farming, but if youre a fan of shooting, slashing, and appreciating art, this is the game for you. plus the community is great. i dont know if ive wasted too many hours of my life in the ferocious battleground of pvp forums and region channels, or if warframes pve atmosphere is just special, but it is extremely refreshing to consistently run across players that want to help and work together. the dev team, too, is excellent at pushing new content and listening in on feedback from the players. oh, its free. theres no reason not to grab some friends and give it a shot.",7
"the base gameplay of shoot mans is pretty damn solid and the devs are incredibly quick at releasing new content. since the game was in closed beta it has become much, much better and very different. the devs even have some more massive gameplay changes coming that sound badass. the only problem id say this game has is that they dont balance some things very well (which isnt too big of a deal since its a co-op game and not competative) and the catalyst/reactor upgrade system (also not too big of a deal, but can be annoying). in short, the base gameplay is a blast and the devs are incredible at keeping it updated and fresh.",5
"do you like ninjas? play this game. do you like varying weapons? play this game. do you like intense faction-based assaults? do you like dealing out damage inside of an agile robotic suit? do you like having friends watching your back? no? then youre gay. get this game scrubs. edit; 2/16/15 do you like tact bosses? do you like several suits, several abilities, several ways to play? do you like zapping a trooper and having your friend lift him into the air, slam him into the ground, and wreck him? do you like color customization? do you like lasers? do you like a decent damage strength-weakness system? do you like community events? if you dont, delete system 32. if you do, get this game.",7

"its a really fun free-to-play type game where you can unlock everything for free if you have the time and patience to do so or you can support the game by buying it now. (not a big fan of pay 2 win games but i dont really mind). if you have some time off i recommend this game to play with a friend or three and do some missions and/or some defense missions to level up fast(er). also remember to press g to mark moudels and stuff like that :)",1

"warframe is a fast pace multiplayer first person shooter combining rpg and utilizing a parkour system that gets your heart pumping even faster. jump, wallrun, shoot, fly, slash, and climb your way to victory. their are only 2 downsides in this game in my opinion. weapon slots and crafting. for crafting, it takes 12 hours to craft a single weapon. the problem with weapon slots is that you cant buy them unless youre buying the weapon itself instead of craft them. leaving collectors with a limited amount of space. other then those, this is legitimately the most awesome game ill ever played.",8
"a wonderful free to play game that doesnt shove microtransactions down your throat. what more can be asked?",1
"warframe is a very good f2p tps and has a wonderful community of gamers that are easy to get a long with. the game play is smooth and nice graphics but the only problem is there are a lot of maps that seem like you have seen before, meaning it seems like there are maps that they used before but just put a few new things in it. also you can drop a lot of money in the game if you get into it because of different customization for warframs and sentinels. you can also buy weapons with your plat but for the player that just wants have a fun game with not droping a dime there is goos news for you. almost everything you see in the store you can build in game with no real money charges it just takes longer to obtain that item. so i give warframe 8.5/10 and recommend you give it a try!",1
"crazy game.. gotta give thumbsup to the developers.",3
"gotta say really great game, been playing it since its beta phase and its only managed to get better and better. 10/10 would reccomend.",3
"not my fav but i would recommend to people that like stealth,tower defense,and action.",1
"i absolutley recommend this game - it has a great flow and the pace is extremely fast and exiting!",1
"a lot of fun albeit repetitive. if youre looking to purchase additional warframes for plat, dont. its far more economical to purchase plat during steam sales or when you get 75% off during a login reward then buy the items you want from other players. ...or grind your butt off! nearly everything is available for free however the catch is that you only have a certain number of slots to store your frames and weapons. you can save additional platinum by getting items from alert missions. d/ling the wf alerts app is highly recommended. also, loki is amazing. choose that frame after your tutorial. the wikia is your warframe bible. there is theorycrafting and optimal character building in this game and youll find this reference highly valuable. complete maps then do nightmare modes for rare dual-stat mods. some are much easier than others and you can abort and restart if you get things like no shields opon starting the mission. hit me up in-game!",6
"the depth in this game is surprising, it is very entertaining although the controls can be a little lacking.",1
"itll make your friends think you have a problem, and your parents will think youre just doing drugs in your room the whole time. 10/10",5
"great game, time-eater but giving satisfaction from completing a quest or crafting a new frame.",4
"feels like a full-game, every time i play i forget its free-to-play.",4
"i have put in nearly 200 hours and still counting. i quite fancy this game. the different environments and classes of enemies bring some interesting variety to the table. all the maps are randomly generated so farming for those materials to build weapons or new frames isnt quite as tedious. equippable mods can make you that super serious player to kick some bum or that silly player that shoots exploding arrows which just might kill you too. this game is still in beta so things are constantly changing! whichever your play style, i believe that there is a little bit for most everyone to enjoy this game. not enjoying it? try playing with friends! :) 9/10",2
"this game is pretty fun... i did not enjoy it that much but if you have a gaming computer on high graphics? you will not bee dissapoint...",1
"space ninjas with delicious buns. 40/10, will play until the end of time.",4
"i know this may seem odd, and i love this game non the less. but it felt oddly like global agenda, it runs smoothly, overall i can say it is a great game, addicting, time consuming, and fun to play. whats to say thats bad about this game?",1
"very entertaining, fast-paced action. i love the style of combat as well as all of the customization and the feeling of being unique that back it up.",3
"really fun and a good way to be introduced to an mmo",3
"this game is a great oppertunity to burn a few hours and have tons of fun doing it. for a game in beta it is fantasticlly built, they have a great community and is in a very fast paced setting. and its free to play! when the developers release an update they pack so full of fixes and additions to the game youd think that they were adding a mod. (but then again a update is basiclly a mod) i enjoy playing this game for two main reasons: 1. the fact that it is very fast paced and requires lots of thinking in the now, because the ai is very sophisticted and reactes accordingly but could get some improvements. 2. the amount of fun that i have just grinding away to get a cool item. i personally spent 40+ hours grinding away to get two really cool items in the game and i really enjoyed grinding that. when i dont know what to do in the game i go and play with my freind the first few missions. im now going to write about some minor issues in the game :d when i played the tutorial it was preety laggy the first time, so you might want to take that time and change settings ive only chrashed twice for no appernt issues but on review of those logs my pc stopped two important files from working. but i recommend this game greatlly and i cant wait to see where this game goes.",7
"ninjas. space ninjas! what more do you expect me to say?!",1
"scavenging, shiny robots, fast paced universal combat, itll get you hooked! i have friends who play this endlessly, and after joining all the hype, i dont regret it. if youve ever played the borderlands series youd get a slight feel for it when you notice all of the mods, ammo packs, etc flooding the ground. this game really immerses you into several atmospheres. for those who like to take it slow can go for stealth approaches in levels, adding a booming level of intensity. patience is key, so be careful not to get caught! then there is the tanking aspect, if you want to get a mission done quick, ring in your fastest and heaviest fire power, because youll have hordes of enemies on you! starting out though, try not to get too intimidated, i recommend tuning into the the storyline, as it can help a whole lot. bring an experienced friend a long to help! getting confused and put off is easy, as a lot of the game aspects fly right by you pretty quick. overall this game is great, you have a long way to go before you end up getting bored because the variety will take you on so many experiences. 8/10",1
"amazing game, addicting, is definitely not p2w. i love it!",1
"this is honestly one of the best games ive ever played. ever. it has a very good play style, upgrades that fit every style of player, and graphics that can make many good gaming computers gasp. it is still in development, which means there will be changes and improvements, but that just makes me more excited since it means the game should only get better! ive put in quite a bit of time with this game, and ive been playing since the beta release. i fully recommend it. it is a ftp that is better than most games ive bought. it supports single players, but is so much fun with a group of friends! the best part is there is no catch with the free part, it really is all free. the only thing in-game you would ever need to spend money on are aesthetics. there is no content that you would ever need that you have to spend money on. the developers are pretty on the spot when it comes to fixing problems and updates come regularly. they also do frequent livestreams to keep players up to date on upcoming fixes and content. if you are even just a little curious about this game, give it a try! i dont think youll regret it!",8
"i give warframe a 9/10. this is what a real free-to-play shooter should be like. ive only found very minor glitches. the graphics are amazing, better than some aaa titles. i recomend this game to everyone.",1
"a very fun rpg with enough incentives to keep you going. there are some issues with grinding, but for a free game i cant complain much about it. overall, very good.",2
"epic gameplay, massive updates, who doesnt want to play this game?? the first time i played it, it does feel a little bit dull, but now, it is awesome, like, really awesome!! those who likes to play 3rd shooter better try this game.. it will definitely, blow you to space! :)",1
"this game is awesome. anyone who enjoys sifi shooters. all i can say is get it",3
"why not play this game when you can work under cube-senpai.",1
"best f2p game i have ever played even though there are quite a number of bugs. (still in closed beta) what are you waiting for? be a space ninja now, grab a blade and cut enemies into half, wall run and more! :d",4
"it is a cool game i say like you can kill guys and cool tricks like slide and shoot thats cool.",1
"you should play it. its free and you are a mothering ninja",6
"i love everything about this game it is wonderful and addicting and fun",1
"i love the fact that warframe is a social game. unless youre kind of crazy, most of the missions require a group to complete properly, and random grouping is easy and friendly. lots of people in the chat are willing to help out newbies, and the community seems overall very friendly. the game is beautiful, with a sleek and clean space-age aesthetic that is a lot of eye candy. there really is a warframe for everyone, with a variety of looks, feels, builds and abilities that are as fun as they are variable. theres still a lot of small glitches here and there (not being able to see the color of another players ship is a current one) but nothing that impacts real gameplay, so that is truly a nit-pick more then a criticism. overall, if you love a fun flash and bash space ninja game, this is really the one for you.",1
"mechanically enhanced space ninjas with guns.... sounds weird but, works out perfectly.",8
"pay to admire that warframe bootey, warframe is a ok and yet repeitive game that involves you grinding for almost hours, also grinding dat  for hours on end.",2
"warframe is a fun, yet somewhat laggy free to play co-op game. the quality is amazing and the visual design kicks , gameplay is fairly simple (sort of like mass effects combat, but without the cover system and rpg elements) but fun and its probably the first f2p game that doesnt feel like a rip-off its good!",1
"its a pretty fun and cool game, for most of the game youre wildly stronger then any of the enemies and its nice and relaxing. the only downside is that you have to pay real money for almost anything- sure you can skirt by without dropping a penny into the game, but there is still a lot of money grabbing attempts.",4
"best space ninja warrior/mercenary game ever. a must play game. :d",10
"this game is purely amazing.i have found myself spending countless hours playing and never being bored.i would recommend this game to anyone.",7
"hey this game is great. good graphics, fun and addicting gameplay, and its free. boom. perfect.",2
"with the fate of your race in the balance, it is up to you and the few remaining tenno to push the enemy out of the solar system. 8/10 a lot of fun with friends, gets difficult if you try to take on higher levels alone. the use of schematics to acquire weapons and warframes makes the feeling of getting new equipment all the more satisfying. although, if you are not a patient person the ability to purchase the equipment directly through the use of platinum (which is purchased with real money) can help you get the quick advantage over the enemy.",1
"this game is just amazing! it gets new updates and hotfixes weekly, adding more content for you to play and explore with friends.",2
"i flayed this game 4 1 year and i lost my virginity when i stoped playing",1
"if you are debating wether or not you want to download warframe, download it! many of my friends tell me its to complicated or its boring i will admit i felt a little overwhelmed at the beginnig but i got over it as everything became understandable along with the awesome people you can meet online. i promise you that you will have at least a small bit of fun. do i recommend this game? yes.",1
"now this game for free is totaly awesome! not sure id spend the hudreds that you could to be invinceable, but, you can progress and rank up with a litttle help from other warframes, the maps and missions are endless! you could probly spend an unimaginable amount of hours on this game alone, i recomend it to anyone who loves the fast pace, shoot em up, coop and deathmatch type of alien crazy i mean forever mods weapons, and customizability type of game, how it got a 68 is beyond me! free is 50 and a game that works good is atleast another 25 in my book, with the anount of updates, i mean like everyday, these dudes got there #$%^& together, i love it for a free game.",1
"warframe has cought me by strom i am not normaly in to games like this but this one has me locked down i hope to see great things to come i give this game currently a 8.5/10",8
"i will not forget this momment when im playin this in game 69/10 would play anytime after doto!",1
"great game, i like it a lot and it keeps on updating and constant evolving...keep up the good work ..to the developers. that aside this game is a good team play and solo too. while at start the control seems to way too hard now it seeems decent but way too convinent yet. and u can earn or get ur way though the game without buying and if buying it makes a great progress too but can be outrunned ..so not an pay to win game best part . the game is still in beta so the bugs keeps bothering u tho it is ok for the part of game and all is good ..so can excuse that.. u can play the way class u like mele or ranged or mixed combo ... its one of the great free to play games u can go and at beggning doin solo might trouble u ...try pubilc host that would help to get ur way out of it . overall a great game u will enjoy ..",5
"good tps. good variety of weapons although some become pretty useless later on in the game. fairly free to play but getting reactors might take awhile since they only come through alerts which you either get or miss out on. warframe alerts is good for that but its still a youre there or youre not.",2
"great game, unfortunately once your are a top tier (i am level 16, i am not sure with everything fully leveled you can even get to 17 yet), the game loses a lot of zest. the devs have nerfed the unique role based frames into warsame.. the loadout matters, thats it.. if you have good mods and are a reasonable player, you only need a handfull of guns and melee weapons.. even amongst the prime weapons they are not all end game weapons.. many of them are just meh (i have a braton prime that has been formaed 7 times, its still  comapred to the soma, or bolter prime). grinding orokin runs in the void the rng is complete , running a mission 40 times to get a lex prime part and still not getting is is rediculous.. according to devs working as intended.. i guess if they want me to spend money and time elsewhere, then yeah its working as intended.. i could go on and on.. its a good game, but they need to make some reasonable changes, like a loot selector after so many runs, a real functional difference (think old frost, or ember, in theory trinity), frames should matter more than guns, but fact is they just done.. its a good game.. needs some love.. welcome to warsame.",1
"this game has so many timers i can use it as a clock. 10/10",1
"first off i would like to say that this game is super adictive and fun. secondly if you do play this game or want to start playing the game id suggest you look at a few tips and tricks to increase your productivity ten fold. for starters i suggest you get excalibur, because its the most balanced and easiest warframe to learn how to play. top tip: you just have to get rhino, that warframe just wrecks everything in the way. overall i do enjoy the game and i would highly recommend it to anyone that likes 3rd person shoot and kill everything in you way with 3 other friends yeah.",7
"look, ill be honest - at the start i had some doubt about this game. oh dude, a 3rd person shooter where you grind for stuff! but hey, it was free, i had time. never even looked back. digital extremes has crafted one of the best games ive ever played, and everything is free! can you imagine, a f2p game that isnt p2w? hard to, yes, but warframe does it perfectly. not only that, de keeps on improving and supporting their game with help from player input. oh, and did i mention the space ninjas? no? well, go play warframe and see em for yourself!",3
"this game is awesome and truly free to play. the only thing you pay for is cosmetic items and thats about it. developers continually listen to the community and add content on a frequent basis. totally worth the hours you are able to put into it!",6
"i love this it is one of my favorites at the moment",4
"nothing like warframe in the market. its the best shooter for me. the co-op nature of the game keeps the community friendly and stress free. keeps me coming back for more.",10
"i really enjoy this game, especially when its played with friends. there is one thing i dont really enjoy, and thats the thousands of hours grinding for materials for a weaponwarframe. most of the weapons are single blueprints and take about 12 hours to make, but each part of the warframe blueprint has a seperate blueprint. for eg.: rhino consists of rhino helmet, rhino systems and rhino chassis. every single part is a different blueprint and takes another 12 hours to make. if you cant afford to buy platinum, it usually takes about 10-15 days of grinding for the materials for every different blueprint. doing the math, its 240 hours + 36 hours + the extra 72 hours to complete the warframe, it takes simply 348 hours (14 and a half days) to make a single warframe. but i still recommend the game, but if you dont spend a little money on buying platinum, you wont get very far very fast.",3
"its a pretty fun game apart from the grinding, everything is makeable with credits, and trading mods for plat is always a way to make some plat. i would rate it 8/10 l0l ya nan",3
"ok, so you are looking for a new game to play? maybe you like league of legends, mass effect, hitman or halo? well, this one is not anything like one of these......it is all ! combine any 3rd person shooter, mmorpg with sci-fi magic  you can imagine this is what you get: +tons and tons of new weapons every patch +new warframe (character) in every second patch +new mission and rewards everyday +alert missions every hour ( missions with rare gear ) +tons of player ready to help newbies in-game +huge trade channels and web sites +and, the best free-to-play game there is........anywhere ! perslonaly, i played it more than 400h in last year, and since the start, it has changed alot. community has gone boooom over the internet and .... well just look at all the artwork ! so what are you waiting for?",4
"warframe is an amazing game. its a third person co-op sci-fi shooter space ninja extravaganza! its a little slow starting out (if you have the money, i recommend getting affinity and credit boosters), but once you get past the first planet or two, you really start to have some great fun. with a good team and communication, this game offers hours of never ending entertainment. each warframe (playable character) offers its own unique play and fighting style. with (currently) 16 warframes and 3 prime variants (the 4th, excalibur prime is no longer attainable), over 100 primary, secondary, and melee weapons, and 5 sentinels (robotic companions), this game has massive replayability. the very best part is, its free! so why not try it out? p.s. dont stop after the first couple missions, i promise youll find its an amazing game!",2
"a very enjoyable fast-paced shooter (when played with others). with the option of stealthy slow solo play as well. some repetitive maps and scenarios but still with enough variation to not feel grindy (until youre trying to get something specific to drop). can be played entirely free but a little cash injection certainly can boost the fun.",7
"its fun to play. so many possibilities to play the game. lots of epic weapons and warframes. no pay 2 win. ninjas in space! need i say more?",4
"one of the best free to play games out there! nicely done and tons of fun to play co-op!",1
"i went to slide slash someone and they were cut in half vertically instead pf horizontally- 15/10",3
"its free, its fun, its available for ps4, its a bit of a grind though. but despite it being in full release its still in a beta state. not in a buggy way but in the way that they add more and more content every month.",5
"every time i play this game:  chop chop motherf**ker!!!!!! ",1
"warframe is possibly the best free to play game out there. this game offers a monotonous experience for those who love the grind, that will leave you amazed at how replayable it is. i find myself coming back to it month after month as they continue to add more content. its free. what do you have to lose?",3
"very polished game. pretty much borderlands meets metal gear rising. class selection is phenominal. weapons are great. the 4 player co-op is exeptionally smooth and is very fun.",1
"this game is a very very very muthain exiting and thrilling game leaving you on the edge of your goddam seat and the graphics/visual effects are equivalent that of in sex. these visuals so good, make you wanna slap yo momma *whack* (samuel l. jackson approves this review)",2
"warframe is a game, a game with farming, adventuring , and endless runs in the void. this game will eat up your hours with its clash of clans like building system, i mean holy  forma.",2
"this is probs one of my fav games in my library. cyborg ninja? check! sneak? check! guns blazing? check! spaaaaaaaace! check!",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. there is also so many thing youll be playing it a while. awesome!!",6
"simply put, one of the best free to play games out there in more than one genre, not only the vast ammount of content and missions fully available for you even if you didnt spend a bloody dime on the game make up for hundreds of hours of gameplay, the vast and colorful variety of weapons that let you obliterate, decimate (looks into a dictionary) tear apart... eww, more stuff like that! plus the wide cast of characters that are also completely free (given you play missions, gather materials blah blah blah rpg elements) this game puts everything at your reach, you only have to play it! oh yeah one downside... get geforce or gtfo (jk but you ll probably lag during the massive skirmishes)",6
"beautiful game with tons of fun co-op gameplay. pick it up, its free.",1
"for a free game, its pretty good with its gameplay and graphics. kind of similar to the destiny game. beside its heavy micro-transaction based nature, everything else is awesome. most of the cash item can be forge with a little more hunting. of course there are cash item that cannot be forge or purchase with in-game currency. conclusion: good game for people that like grinding. bad game for people that have short attention span.",2
"review time: so this is a pretty good game, problem is it doesent really explain what to do, as a newb to this game 1.5 years ago i was lost. if you find that you are in this situation then i guarentee that you will hate this game, it has no direction and the mindless killing doesent really have much replay for the first frame/weapon and starter planets, but with time and persistance and a little bit of spending creddits for better gear then i guarentee that you will enjoy the massive ammount of weapons to choose from couppled with warframe abilities. warframes are easy to aquire and weapons are really cheep for the most part, farming for monney is easy to do as long as you have someone in trade chat carry you to a high level mision for easy monney. finally for a last opinion, i would despite all i have said get in a guild and play with people, this game is not meant for solo and playing with a squad of 4 is much more fun than sticking it out by yourself.",5
"this is a game that takes a bit of getting used to, but once youre in youll love it. rushing around doing parkour and shooting bad guys feels good, and the abilities of each warframe can feel awesome when used right. take the time to learn the game and youll find yourself immersed in one of the best free to play experiences on the pc right now, and its only getting better.",4
"this is a great game for the die-hard ninjas that are out there slice and shoot em all",1

"grind so much i thought this game was ur mum 420/69 ign 7.8 too much space",3
"great game, just started to get into it! so far its been a very good experience for a free to play game.....",3
"its quite repetitive, however the amount of work being done to the game constantly is what makes it so refreshing. since i started i have seen overhauls and great work being done to gameplay and mechanics. its a great game, but it is slightly grindy. also, if you get a dog and arent able to log in for some time, the dog dies.",2
"do you play action games? do you like science fiction? do you like shooting things? do you like collecting loot? are you broke? if you answered yes or no to any of these questions, you should be playing warframe. it is the epitome of a successful f2p game. the devs are dedicated, inventive, and care about the game in ways that show theyre invested in it, and the game universe and lore itself. its the pinnacle of cooperative pve. its probably the most enjoyable mmo ive played. there is no reason you should not be playing this too.",9
"it is one of the bast free to play game i have played!!!!!! so get it!!!!!! no harm of you do not like it because it free. (: i hape you will like it baceuse it a great game and it has space ninja!!! as i said get it. :)",1

"very fun game as soon as you get the hang of the multifaceted interface options.",2
"the game without the bells and whistles is just one hell of a grindfest. but dammit its a good one. new tutorial, constant expansion of the game, and evolving storyline makes this a great game to add to your library. the game does start very slow however and takes some time to get moving. but when it does, itll take a while before you stop. did anyone forget to mention it was still in beta? best free-to-play game ive ever played.",9
"real solid mmo shooter with great battle mechanics and fluid movement.",1
"love this game, dont understand the official critics low scores, i would recomend this to anyone!",1
"surprisingly good for a co-op shooter. everything that global agenda shouldve been, in actuality. bring three friends, blast it up. bear in mind that everything within the game can be obtained just by playing - spending money is only a shortcut, if anything.",5
"450 hours on this game it is epic honestly get it and dont dismiss it at the start get a braton with a decent serration you will love it (add me ign sonicv6)",4
"if you havent played this game you are seriously missing out, guns techno-ish ninja robots, various kinds of missions weapons enemys and loot and it keeps growing, even better its free to play - you can get pretty much everything in the game without buying in game currency. this game is going to be huge so get in on the action now",9
"great game, fun to play, fast grapicly impressive, not like anyother game that i have played and wanted to put so much time into.",5
"love the grinding/unique gameplay this game has. would recommend it to anyone who doesnt mind earning their things the long way.",4
"for anyone looking to play a fun, rewarding game that is free, id recommend warframe. hours of gameplay, going through different planets, doing alerts to get nice things. and its also really fun to play with friends. so yes i would recommend this game to anyone looking for a cure to boredom. so have fun.",4
"warframe is a game where you play as a space ninja. you get to kill stuff and hang out with friends. basically it plays like gears of war and ninja gaiden. pros: -controls are solid, gameplay is very addicting and entertaining -not pay to win, but pay to advance. -loooots of customization options -friendly and helpful community -active dev team who listens to the community cons: -lots of grinding -feels repetitive over time i strongly recommend you grab some of your irl friends and play locally with them.",1

"its becoming more and more p2w. but. the gameplay. is ing rad as hell.",1
"this game is just amazing. the graphics are amazing and the game mechanics are superb. i have been playing for a year and im still hungry for what this game has left to put out.",8
"this is an amazing game if you just want to sit back and have a good time slaughtering everything in your path! beginer players might have trouble at first figuring out the market and modding system, but there are in game tutorials and internet tutorials to help with that. warframe is constintly puting out new content about every week, and usually on wednesdays so veteran players like me keep getting new content to keep us working at it. i currently have over 400 hours logged into the game and im still very much enjoying it! overall once you figure out how to do most of the beginer stuff it is a very relaxing game. if you want you can sit back and do easy missions, but if you in the mood for more of a challenge you can face off against players around your skill level. some of you might say that all free games are pay to win, however i havnt spent a dime on this game and i still get the items that people pay for. you see there is a big trading system that players trade items for the currency that cost real money. it works out very well. if you read this whole thing i sugest you start downloading this game right now and have days upon days of fun!",8
"this game is free... so hell yea, play it. tons of planets to explore, so many missions to do, and its difficult to do solo, youll definitely need help for many of the missions. a crap ton of upgrades so you can fully customize your build and loadout for any one of the warframes, which there are also a ton of. a handful of pets and sentinels to help you out, cmon what more do you need? its free! this game is lightyears ahead of a game like destiny in terms of customization, gameplay, and multiplayer. however, even the barely there story in destiny is better than this game, and the pvp in destiny beats the pants off warframe. the only thing these guys could have done better is create pvp servers that didnt lag out completely and attempt a story line, but you cant win em all, and these guys certainly have nailed most of the categories. graphics 10/10 gameplay 10/10 weapons 10/10 customizability 10/10 social aspect 8/10 multiplayer 8/10 story 4/10 pvp 2/10 also, if you can afford it, kick some cash towards the devs and buy some platinum, this game is too awesome to not pay something for it. but, if you do buy platinum, wait til you get the 50% off coupon from your login rewards.",1
"do you want to feel like a space ninja? then this is the game for you 5 stars",1

"this game is space ninja themed tps, it has parkour moves, guns and fun abilities. it has nice visuals even on a low end pc, and even the visual design is good. it is a little bit grindy and repetative, but if you like the theme you wont mind it. its not pay to win, its only pay to spare your time (but then you get left out of the fun). the only drawback for this game is the bugs. when old bugs get patched new ones appear, so if you havent played a buggy game for a long time, this one is not for you. but most players can live with the games bugs, bec they are usually not annoying.",9

"oh! yeah this game is a a aswome! there tons of level a lot or friends fun and the feeling is amazing look you need to build stuff to make some weapons that you can buy only in cash there are some weapens for cash to but the point here every body should play it if there was a lot of player it will be ton of fun except that warframe have clans(that you can create rare suits and weapons with it) they want you to play with friends so go now dawnload it and have fun",5

"you know that weird girl in the corner of the class? your friend told you that she likes you, but everytime you look at her she smiles and look away. then when you got the chance, you approach her and start talking to her at the school out and you think: wow shes really nice, didnt expected that! after sometime you look at your watch and realise that 7 hours flew away with you spending time with her. and when its time to goodbye, she says: i really like you, if you want to spend another time with me, just call ;)  and then, without warning, she kisses your lips and walkaway. day after day you ask yourself if it was real or just an hallucination, and you keep thinking of her all the time just trying to see another opportunity to see her again. well... this game is this girl :d",1
"the amount of time you can spend playing this game is impressive. it is a very well made game and i dont regret the time i put into it.",5

"probbley one of the only free to play game i like. a bit of grinding but it makes up for that with really good gameplay",1

"amazing!! gameplay is awesome, graphics amazing definelty a game i love. 10/10",2
"warframe is by far one of my favorite free to play games. the art style and combat is very unique as well as the general gameplay mechanics.there are over 10 warframes the space ninjas you play as and has over 50 different types of unique wepons. although they are already many wepons and frames new updates keep coming making the game endless fun. the community is quites funny and interesting as well as helpful. the makers of warframe (digital extremes) listen to the players feed back and keep adding new thigns as well as fixing bugs. however, with all these pros in place there are some things that take away from this gaming experience. the fact that the maps are repetitive and many of the mission require you to do are the same, some may leave this game for a while. but after while and you return it will be filled with new goods. i would give it a 8.0-8.5/10. and way not try is. its free!",6
"one of the best f2p mmotps games ive ever played. most other online fps i tried dont come close to as good as this game. became addicted to it and play it regularly now. try it you will be hooked!",3
"hands down the greatest f2p 3rd person shooter/dungeon crawler with energetic gameplay and loads of content. digital extremes live up to their heritage with this unique, eerie and vibrant world, which they diligently develop at a pace that should be envied by most f2p developers. try it. if its your thing, youll love it and stay for a long time. see you there, tenno. ;)",9
"if u are into heavy grind yes,the more this game is around the grind is getting crazier,graphic is nice,combat system is nice too,this was originally pve oriented game and since changes implemented by pvp happen it kinda started loosing its soul for me atleast....if u have excessive time to grind stuff obsessively this is a game for u.",5
"i liked the game while it was still fresh. but challenge, it ran out. all fights felt flat, no enemies posed any threat, the whole gameplay is turned into generic mass destruction with no need to use any brains. but what killed it for me is constant updates, which featured nothing but weapons and frames - new ways to kill old, helpless enemies. uncool, bro, uncool. still, i recommend this game to those who havent tried it yet, just mind that if youre not into mindless repetitive grind - you wont be here for long.",3
"amazing detail, story and gfx. but i feel like im never happy with my : weapons, suit etc. i am constantly grinding to get better stuff only to get better stuff to grind further to get better stuff. the story line is great and the universe too, details and gfx are insane, but yea: when will i be content and have some fun just not trying to get better stuff. so my point is this game looks and is amazing but you will never stop and just enjoy you will always be trying to get better stuffs.",2
"why!? why have i wasted this many hours of my life!!!!",5
"warframe is a fun, yet somewhat laggy free to play co-op game. the quality is amazing and the visual design kicks , gameplay is fairly simple (sort of like mass effects combat, but without the cover system and rpg elements) but fun and its probably the first f2p game that doesnt feel like a rip-off its good!",1
"its a pretty fun and cool game, for most of the game youre wildly stronger then any of the enemies and its nice and relaxing. the only downside is that you have to pay real money for almost anything- sure you can skirt by without dropping a penny into the game, but there is still a lot of money grabbing attempts.",4

"mixed opinion on this, the gameplay is great, with the wall running the brilliant animations and the series of characters you can play with that all have their own abilities. however, the developers have used a tile system so after a while the maps get repetitive and they all look the same, that said the enemies are also reused and the only change is their lvl scaling, this game is mostly for those who have nothing theyd rather be doing and just want to stab things with a sharp discus and shoot an arrow into something with a helmet 5 times bigger than the actual head(seriously knock off the grinners head & helmet and the head is actually a regular sized head.",5

"rng simulator 10/10 will continue to farm for one specific item for 1000+ hours",5
"the game itself is good, but its got a few annoying aspects unless you pay, such as only having 2 slots for warframes, meaning you have to sell others to make room. i hear the in-game market is good for getting the platinum (paid currency), but you would need something people would want to buy to have any chance at getting the platinum. it costs 20 platinum to buy a warframe slot, and i would suggest you never buy the warframes straight out. depending on the warframe, it can get quite pricey, even if you take into account the other things it comes with. real money - paid currency rate $5 gets you 75 platinum, and only 1 warframe i believe is this cheap. some warframes cost near $25 or more to buy straight out.",1
"theres something in this grindy game that is so addicting, i cant stop playing. the graphics are great, the music good enough, the gameplay is amazingly fluid, i cant believe its a free to play game.",1
"its like all 3 game at once mass effect, ninja gaden3, and mirrors edge",3

"best not only free to play, but better than a lot of games that actually cost money.",1
"i started playing this game way back when it first hit steam and let me tell you, there wasnt much to be had there. it was a great concept and didnt seem like anything more than a coop thing. come into the last year or so and this game has made amazing progress and the fact that practically this game is 100% free given the fact you can trade items for platinum (game credits) to which you can use to speed up timers, buy those aesthetic items or bluerints. you dont have to actually spend money for this game; but i can almost guarantee you will want to at some point. warframe login rewards will occasionally reward you with a 50% off coupon + free plat on platinum purchases to help regulate plat flow in the markets, and give you a taste of what platinum can do. again platinum is not needed for everything, as most things can be either farmed or bought with in-game money. but some things will require plat either excluseively or to help expedite things. the core gameplay is somewhat grindy, as youll be running missions for dailies, clearing planets to uncover new ones, gathering materials to craft new gear or items, or even gathering gear itself. recently, updates have changed how melee works and have also introduced clans and pvp. future updates are told to bring actual space play involving jetpacks. tl;dr try the game. its free. you could spend money if you wanted, but its not needed. for a current gen game that has online play, free, goals and objectives, why not try it?",2

"dog breeding aliens that jump 10/10 would purchase again",10
"this game is really great mainly because everything can be obtained without giving a penny to the developers. id also like to mention that this game etches the word grind into your brain like a fatboys crack addiction. i dont have a problem with the grind because im used to grinding away on games and im also sure that lots of other people wont mind either. going onto the topic of the games virtual currency, platinum, which can be bought and then either be used to buy stuff from the market or the player auction. dont expect to get very far in the player market unless you have platinum to spend or have some damn good mods for your gear. the only downside to the trading aspect is that weapons and a few other things arent tradable (although i can kind of see why with mastery rank limitations, ect) recently digital extremes made a new beginners walkthrough so dont miss out on that great tutorial which teaches you some good things to know. the developers keep up with the games development and if something isnt working, it usually gets fixed in about a few days. overall this is a damn good game and would recommend anyone looking for a grind. edit: id also like to say that this game is way out of beta and should have been released in update 10. 11/10 ~zeroeh",1
"this game is awesome ( to me ) lots of guns, lots of missions, tons of stuff to do, can feal like a grind some times if you really want something graphicly its amazing plus nearly any computer can run this with no effort",5
"grind to get items to grind with, to grind some more",1
"its a great game with an nvidia card and friends, ive played since early beta and always end up coming back again and again! lots of content and fresh ideas keep the repetitive gameplay from becoming stale, sad to hear most review critics gave this a harsh review without getting into the high teir content =( . the developers listen to the community and i recommend it greatly, if you dont enjoy co op games then its best to just go play cod and other generic rubbish. (thanks for reading add me if you like and ill help you out) p.s any dark sector fans will recognise a few tenno and wepons too!!",6
"if you like the idea of mass effects combat as an online open-ended co-op shooter with a massive amount of maneuverability and free movement control and customizability, youll love warframe.",1
"warframe is a really fun co-op game. there are many weapons as well as several different warframes to fit your play-style (stealth, offensive, defensive, support, etc.) weapons can be easily obtained if you really put your mind to it, people who say that the game is all about grinding are probably wrong. yes, it takes time to build weapons. yes, you need to obtain certain materials to craft something. but in the end, the game gets easier to obtain weapons and other items. ive gotten most of my stuff from just crafting them, theres really no need to waste money unless youre just not in the mood to craft or grind. overall, the game is great. the mechanics are really cool, gameplay is responsive and smooth, graphics are great, and the developers really put alot of effort into the game with many updates and events. the game keeps getting better and better. id recommend this game for people who like fast paced third-person shooters and dont mind taking their time crafting weapons, warframes, or making research projects for your clan.",6

"this in my opinion is a great game with lots of content, but to get good at it takes a lot of time patients and dedication, but when you start its quite hard to stop. it takes up quite a bit of space as well, so i ended up uninstalling it because i dont play it as much.... warning: if you play this with friends prepare to lose them or bash this game like your life depends on it p.s this will consume your life ;3 have fun",2
"warframe is a parkour/ ninja type game (hence the ninjas play free) where you play as a race called the tenno. tennos are equiped with special suits called warframes that allow players to use powers to help conquere the battlefield. enough with the intro stuff. warframe is a great game in my opinion. although it may be a slight buggy at times... basically its an awesome game with a space ninja twist. all in all, play it. all i gotta say. :d (though it took me alot of sentences to say it)",10

"amazing game, it isnt as full of p2w like lets say payday 2 at times, because of the weapon adding dlcs. this game includes stealth with action, like metal gear solid, and has alot of customization. i would recommend this game to anyone that likes ninjas, swords, bows, and guns. 1337/10 would ninja again.",1
"i left the game nearly 2 years ago when the founders pack was being sold. came back at the end of december and to this very day i find myself playing this non-stop. part of me regrets not buying that founders pack because this game is pretty fun. it improvised a lot and it keeps getting better everyday.",7

(not a big fan of pay 2 win games but i dont really mind). if you have some time off i recommend this game to play with a friend or three and do some missions and/or some defense missions to level up fast(er). also remember to press g to mark moudels and stuff like that :)",1

"i could get into this game if the melee attacks was not so stiff....sheesh.....i have to spin the view around 4 times before i can kill something. lack of a lock on feature in a fast paced game is also a dissapointment.",1
"this game has more bugs than the whole fallout franchise.",5
"even though some people may complain about this game for its excessive grind or the need to pay money, at its core its a fun, space ninja shooter. instead of having the take cover against the enemies, they have to take cover against you. my only complaint about this game would be the excessive grind in some areas, and the seemingly neverending cycle of patch, introduce more bugs, patch again. 7.5/10",3

"what can i say? this space-ninja based game caught my eye and life. playing with friends hasnt been more fun, running through different instances such as spaceships, devastated debris fields, ancient ruins, all with one purpose: cutting off infested zombie-like creatures, robotic grineers or energy wielding humans. and blowing everything up with each different warframe unique and epic ability. with a huge arsenal of weapon variety, different mods to customize your playstyle accordingly for each frame, makes the posibilities endless. although it sometimes can get repetitive, like power leveling, farming, and non stop killing, theres this thing that keeps warframe so good over the years: the constant and non-stop updates and events from the developers, de. fun with friends, get three teammates and have a great laugh killing everything on sight. if you like mayhem: you got it!",7

"fantastic game, a real blend of shooting, ninja, parkour and action. great variety of locations locations and maps for missions, furthermore the weapon range is enormous!!!!! with a lot of customisation for each and every weapon. huge community with lots of clans to join and run missions with other people or create a clan with your friends. this is a fantastic game to play with friends. i would highly recommend this game!!!",5

"i really didnt expect to enjoy this game as much as i did.the combat is fast paced and once you play into the game the difficulty definitly increases in a good way.the rpg elements have been implemented very well and the mod system seems very interesting. the only thing about the game i didnt enjoy is that for a new player i found it pretty difficult to figure out how to do certain things there are small tutorial hints in-game but i didnt find them as helpful as they could have been. overall i think everybody interested in an action/rpg/shooter hybrid should give warframe a try, and since its free to play that makes checking it out even easier. rating 8/10",6

"bring time, break with your girlfirend and play warframe dude. i totally recommend this game. and it really deserves to call itself f2p! yes you can invest real money, but if you finally discover how to trade, you dont need to! (you will do it anyway!). if you like coop-based games, stand your ground with your friends against endless waves of very well designed enemies. every warframe (those things you play here) and every weapon is unique. you dont believe me? play it and you will see, im so fukin right! its so much fun to level your frames and weapons, sentinels (flying machines equipped with weapons to automatically shoot enemies) and your kubrows (you can breed dog-like monsters, but they are much coller than boring, small dogs!!!). you want to hunt for rare stuff, prime parts, mods... the community is awesome and helpful all the time. dont mind to ask something if youre new! a lot of f2p games like war thunder or world of tanks are very frustrating sometims. warframe never frustrated me. sometimes you have enough of playing warframe, but suddenly, after 3 day of abstinence, you cant stop play anymore, because you fond another great warframe to build, a weapon to research.... im addicted",5

"this game is really enjoyable and has a nice community. i have made a few friends on it already. it is very self explanitory so you can just get down to the fun stuff.",1
"great everlasting game! 9 out of 10 full of multiple factions, characters, powers, you name it. enough to keep one active for a long while but some can get reptitive. but with constant updates changing the game and adding content i personally am expecting the repetition to deteriorate over time. also the fact that the community is really friendly and informing that the devs pay attention and take suggestions from too.",9
"this game is a wonderful time consuming game with great fighting. i recommend this game because it is fun and there is lots of jolly co-operation. its also free!!!!",3
"cant believe i uninstalled this...this game is awesome 11/10 darude - sandstorm",1
"fun shooter version of diablo, digital extremes is good about updates and listens to the community. 8/10 though the game is still in beta. written as of update 12",4
"the game is great but..........................i dont know what to say more...xd",1
"its got a lot of grinding from where i stand, but grinding isnt so bad when youre being a space ninja, slashing and gunning down enemies and soaring through space like a one-man army of death. addictive could very well be an understatement about this game.",1
"if you like futuristic games then this game is for you! its awsome!",4
"warframe is addicting in that its space ninjas who cut and shoot stuff. at the same time, its a bit grindy unless youve spent some money for platinum. try the game, see if you like it, then come back for more.",2
"warfarm and bugframe. yet cool to play. warning: only play this game if you willing to devote your whole life to grinding and farming in this game!",9
"this game is pretty addictive and the graphics are amazing, only downside is the micro-transactions but thats expected in a free-to-play game.",1
"warfame = 3rd person, space samurai ninja, warlock magic, shooter. freakin awesome.",1
"this game really goooooood. one of the best f2p game i ever play. but damned steam will delete your entire warframe folder if you ever want to make a backup of it. please fix it!!!!!!!!",5
"i thought this game was cool back when i first played it in closed beta forever ago. just started playing it in earnest this week and i have to say its alot of fun. more so when i played it originally. it takes some work to get into and figure everything out but the tutorials are pretty helpful for modding and such",1
"a great game became better with a newly introduced story line and quests. its a difficult grind to get the better gear if you dont spend cash for platinum or purchase packs, but its still possible to get all high-end gear in-game without spending money. a great time sink, the game gets better and better as you put more and more time into it.",1
"best game ever , there are space ninjas in it 11/10",4
"you. are. a. space. ninja. thats right... space ninja!> do i even need to explain anything else? space ninja.",6
"although the bugs may be a turn off, i absolutely love this game. constant updates large and small keep the game more varied and interesting. the game alone may not seem to interesting but playing with friends is really fun. the warframes vary well having different support, offensive, and defensive abilities. also this is probably the best looking free to play around right now. overall if you have the room to download, give it a chance and play with friends and you will end up putting some hours into it.",2
"my favourite sci-fi game so far. 10/10 for me. the graphics are beautiful, the choice of weapons, warframes(characters) and mods(to upgrade all these) are just huge. the game is mostly a co-op game, with a maximum of four players per mission. your mission goals vary, the environment varies, everything is perfect. only one thing i dont like: the updates. when a major update comes out(like new mission type, new event, etc.) there are so many bugs and glitches and sometimes a lots of game crashes, that it makes almost impossible to play peacefully for one or two days. they should focus on looking for these problems and repair them a.s.a.p. in brief this is a beautiful game, interesting, always gives you something new to reach. i have 350+ game hours and im still enjoying it.",4
"great game. amazing fast pace combat more skill then grinding for gear. expansive with many aspects including crafting and clan hall building. great to play with friends.",7
"as you can see, ive played this game quite a bit. i really enjoyed (most) of the time i played, but there were some bugs and stupid stuff here and there. be advised; you will have to farm for everything you want to get. even though the game is kinda buggy and really unbalanced, it is a lot of fun (especially with friends!) and i would recommend at least trying this out, cause its free!",3
"who can go wrong with magic ninjas in power suits vs marines, zombies, and robots? you can have multiple suits (each with their own powers) / guns / melee weapons going at the same time, somewhat supportive community, still growing... great if you want to try a different f2p game, but it does get repetetive quite quickly, if you dont have friends to play with",2
"this is an absolutely beautiful game! amazing graphics, good weapon system, unique crafting system, and an option to buy items, but nothing that is exclusively pay-to win. i would absolutely recommend this game to you if you enjoy co-operative rampages, co-operative stealth, or solo on either of those; this game has an opportunity for all those gameplay styles. if you dont enjoy mission style gameplay (someone repetitive at times), this probrably isnt the game for you, but i would still recommend you try it and definitely get on the forums on the games site and take a look at it and contribute.",3
"really cool game. amazing co-op third person shooter with exellent story and performance in general. you should totally check it out, its one of the best games ive played in a while :d",1
"this game is amazing for those people that like hack and slash and shootouts. its the epiphany of what futuristic space combat should be. down.load.it!!!!!",1
"well your a person in a suits called warframes each warframe has its own set of abilities i go with loki it can go invisible to get past security and can switch places with the enemy so the enemy is confused as you could probally tell from the warframe picture it has guns and what every person needs to spill blood a sword which can be upgraded and you can get different melee weps mostly swords but there are power gloves that can be purchased which allow you to pack a punch(get it gloves and punching huh huh anybody?) any way download it its free",1
"nice and adictive gameplay but repetitive, weak background story, nice setting",2
"ninjas?swords?guns?space?thatoneanoyingenemythatallwayskillsyoudespitebeingconsideredweak? worry not, we got you covered. this game is awesome, whether you like a solid third person shooter with a whole variety of guns to choose from (having in mind the fact that you need to spend the time to forge them or lvl up to the needed rank), or if you just want to go melee nuts hack and slash style. bad this is once you get you character/weapon slots full, either you keep selling the things you have to make space for new ones, or you get slots by refering a looooot of friends, otherwise youre gonna dump some cash on this free game. ive been with warframe from the beginning and it had major improvements since it was on beta till now, was it a new hud, new tilesets and enemies, the game keeps getting better :)",9
"isnt entirely pay2win, except for the accessories, which dont do .",3
"9.7/10. ( -.03 for it sometimes being warfarm :3) amazing gameplay, graphics, mechanics etc. the movements are very smooth and can chain into some incredibly creative (and awesome) combos, and combine that with your warframes special moves, then you get a beast! the game is a fast-paced third person shooter (yet suprisingly the only one im good at :3) where you can be a slower, beefier tank, (rhino, frost etc.) a high-mobility glass cannon (nova, ember etc.) a manipulative ability user (mag, loki etc.) or an all-round one if you dont like those three extremes.",1
"i was pleasently surprised by warframe. the best way i can describe it is a mashup between destiny and pso.",1
"this is a pretty nice free game. glad i played it.",5
"the game that created the betapocolipse! a must try for all 3rd person shooter fans with rpg elements.",7
"this game is in the beta stages, and is one of the best games i have ever played. im a very experienced gamer. cant give it up. ive been playing it for years. now, if only someone could develop a sandbox mmorpg with this type of combat...",2
"very fun game that will keep my coming back as dlc and updates continue",2
"recommended for all people who wish to play a free to play game which can play both shooting and close combat style. the game is free so you dont need to purchase any $ to get all the weapons or warframes in game (only some unlimited items if you wish to purchase - the rest you can farm meterials to craft). overall: i love this game, i know it is not perfect and can get bored when you get all stuffs from the game but it is the good game you can play with your friends or solo and make friend in group of region.",5
"awsome game and free to play and not at all a pay to win",7
"warframe is a fun game. it has some mystery to it at soem points and also your a ninja. ninjas are always fun to play as.",4
"tenno.... wake up.... you will fight for your life, in this amazing tps (third person shooter) epic game.... but where you fight? actually... in space with a gun, pistols, melle weapons and everything! so build your arsenal, choose your character and dont stop fighting until the end!",4
"this game is something special. it is actually a real free to play game. everything can be earned by playing. if you want to buy something off of the store with plat, that you can only get by plat, all you gotta do is play the game, and sell the mods to other players for actual plat. the game just all around feels good, looks good, and plays good. there is a lot to do, a great community, and cmon, lets be real here: graphics do sometime make a difference. in warframe, the graphics are stunning, and if you have physx then you will love it. i recommend this game to anyone. shooter/rpg fan or not, you need to try it.",1
"review time: so this is a pretty good game, problem is it doesent really explain what to do, as a newb to this game 1.5 years ago i was lost. if you find that you are in this situation then i guarentee that you will hate this game, it has no direction and the mindless killing doesent really have much replay for the first frame/weapon and starter planets, but with time and persistance and a little bit of spending creddits for better gear then i guarentee that you will enjoy the massive ammount of weapons to choose from couppled with warframe abilities. warframes are easy to aquire and weapons are really cheep for the most part, farming for monney is easy to do as long as you have someone in trade chat carry you to a high level mision for easy monney. finally for a last opinion, i would despite all i have said get in a guild and play with people, this game is not meant for solo and playing with a squad of 4 is much more fun than sticking it out by yourself.",5
"this is a game that takes a bit of getting used to, but once youre in youll love it. rushing around doing parkour and shooting bad guys feels good, and the abilities of each warframe can feel awesome when used right. take the time to learn the game and youll find yourself immersed in one of the best free to play experiences on the pc right now, and its only getting better.",4
"amazing game, even managed to play this on intel pentium!",3
"first week i thought this game was pay to win because thats exactly how its set up to look, turns out its not. you can trade players items for premium currency. pictures and videos do this game no justice at all. i woulda hated this game unless i played it which thankfully i did. no regrets so far. also the price tag is pretty nice too, cant argue with free.. sometimes waiting for gear to finish being crafted can be a bit brutal but if you dont mind being paitent then you are good.",2
"have played this game for a while, and i must say i enjoyed it. one could say it just becomes a grindfest, but sure, after a while it does. after a while every game does! its a great game nevertheless as long as you have the time for it, and havep lenty of unique assetts as well.",1
"good game gets alot of updates to keep things interesting",7
"space robot ninjas doing space robot things 10/10 its my favourite anime",1
"warframe is an awesome game, which combines great gameplay with a neat storyline. i recommend this game to anyone who loves sci-fi and shooter games",6
"if you like to grind then this game is just for you ^^",2
"a decievingly fun cohesive multiplayer game with endless combinations of weapons and warframes. from the bow and kunai stealth approach, to the hack-and-slash gib-lord sword and shotgun combo. with the heavy-hitting ranged weapons, i find myself struggling to use the melee weapons effectively. i try, i honestly do. the parkour system in this game is so unnatural that i find myself avioding it because it feels chunky and uncontrollable-- it almost feels uncomplete. the ability to infinitely mod your weapons and make them more deadly is astounding, however. and the game actually making you have to work to level up is great. the seemingly endless universe for you and your friends to explore is amazing, and i always find something new to explore. i love how the maps are randomly generated evvery time you play the game, even if its a dozen times in a row. the enemies and loot changes every time. also, its free to play, and its not(completely) pay-to-win!! ive got to admit that i havent played a game this fun in a long time, and im torn between it and mountain!",1
"first of all this game somehow doesnt feel like a grind you can get most of the weapons/frames pretty quick,the community are awesome mostly in the north american/eu servers, like help newbies etc. the stealth is just to simple and weak.gunplay is fun with many ways to take out your enemies,from your oridnary guns to lazors beams to enegry weapons etc. each frame looks and funtions uniquely.there are so many ways to kill your enemies,will you slash dash your way through your enemies? will you zap them into oblivion? and many more.also you can earn real life currency (platnium) though trading rare stuffs (prime parts)/mods/stuff :p. arcwing is awesome as you fly around space and blast your way though victory, but there not much really to play arcwing as there are very little weapons/mods for it.there are syndicates you can fight for that gives you rewards of doing missions got them,though a little more lore can be added to why and how they were created so at least i could give a damn about why im helping the syndicates rather than focusing on the rewards.overall this game is fun, but it is very repetitive though they have many game modes.they are feel the same at times",9
"space ninjas. space baddies. space farming. best farming simulator 2016. 11/10 would farm again. in all seriousness though. warframe is a third person co-op shooter. you play as the tenno, who seek the protect the balance. as i got into this game, it was confusing. unless you check the wiki 24/7, which i did because im a nerd that way, you wont understand anything. however, once you get the hold of the mechanics, the game is really fun. however, the grinding and the cruel rng does make this game feel repetitive time after time. when you do get burned out, just do something else. come back in a few months and even weeks and i garuntee you that something new has been added/changed. pros: -beautiful graphics -fluid motion -f2p completely. everything is unlockable except for event items (which could have been done for free) and cosmetics -a dev (digital extremes) that actively updates and cares about this game -just fun cons: -repetitive at times -confusing to the new player -and yes, de is human, so they do make mistakes. these mistakes are usually temporary and will be fixed almost immediately. overall, this game is fun and just pure awesome. like any game, it does have its cons but the pros heavily cover them up. i recommend you pick it up and give it a go. remember, check the wiki. :3",7
"i have played this game since the day it has came out, and personally i think its an amazing co-op game. if you get the chance, download it and play with me!",1
"now that over a thousand hours of my life have gone into this game as well as a good chunk of cash i can really give this a better review. in short, its fun but doesnt feel like its going in the direction it should(or that i would like). i dont really know how to describe my feelings for it. after u.i. 2.0 it just wasnt as much fun. i was rank 16(highest you could be at the time) and had every weapon i could obtain except for 3 and then new ones came, and then more, and more. sure this is how warframe has been but for some reason it just wasnt as fun. some of the new weapons now look fun but during that time i couldnt get back into it. i will say that if you come across this review and havent played yet, get the game. its amazing when you fist start out as you have so many weapons and warframes to choose from. and of course its a grindfest so if youre into that then you will be fine. i hope you enjoy this game and maybe youll see it finally get released.:corpus::grineer:",9
"i ran up a wall, backflipped, and took down 20 people with nothing but my dual axes and pistols while sliding. this game makes you jesus. im pretty sure jesus did that.",3
"my life means nothing anymore after spending an entire week on this game.",2
"its a real shame this game doesnt receive more attention. its a hidden gem on all platforms. remember unreal tournament? these guys made it. warframe is 4-player co-op, guns and swords, on speed. or on coffee. drink some coffee and play warframe!",8
"swift and smooth this game will work in almost any computer (exceptions applied), is totaly worth buying some dlcs, the best is that you only have to pay if you want, no payment needed to win anything. 10/10",3
"ok so this game will be repetitive at the start just a bit.but when you start doing void missions and start getting prime parts the game will open up more. also i suggest installing a warframe alert app on your smartphone just beacuse you can miss a lot of good stuf just by not knowing about it. i suggest to everybody to try this game and give it a shot",2
"one of the only shooters i like, because the rpg elements are reasonably compelling. some menu items are mouse only, but otherwise you can play with a gamepad. just pray to the gods of rng with warframe. it can take a lot of grinding to get what you want, since its typically not a steady stream of predictable rewards, but rather a completely random chance of getting a reward based on the roll of the dice. cash shop isnt too intrusive. you can play without paying easily, though if you dont want to look ugly or have barely any inventory space, youll want to cough up 5 or 10 usd for some color palletes and inventory spaces.",3
"3rd person action space ninja dungeon crawler 11/10",2
"iv gotta say, i`m not usually hooked to games, but this game just draws me in. it`s like a perfect mix of explosive combat mixed with unique play styles and weapon/warframe choices/combinations. free to play, easy to find online play, cant complain.",4
"awsome game but im hoping they will fix some of the lag and bugs that are occasionally seen",1
"it never ever lags, its completely free, it will keep getting better as you play it, there is so much more than just the trailers and pictures. what can i say, get it! its awesome!",2
"this game is a great free to play, i really insist you get it. this game is very different. for a free to play game, it actaully doesnt look like a lower resolution game. this game offers stunning graphics and glorious lighting. and after you get over the lovely graphics, you can head straight to the high impact fighting. this game has a level system and you can set your character to however your play style is. if you enjoy staffs and swords. use the mods and make a melee build, or if you prefer automatics. use some mods and make a rifle build. just incase you get annoyed with your character, you can always get a new class a warframe to be exact. this game has a high replay value and i enjoy playing it. one downside to this game is that its pay to win, but that doesnt even matter to be honest. 10/10 - best space game ever.",1
"although it is quite repetitive, what with the grinding for materials to upgrade your weapons, the graphics are amazing and the game is constantly updated with great new content. also, the hard work you put in to upgrade your weapons is truly worth it as you will notice the before and after difference in all of your weapons power.",8
"haha! what a splendid game of dungeons and dr- wait. this isnt dnd? well it certainly is a brilliant game to say the least! played for a total of 300+ hours (not all at once, mind you) and i can say for certain that this game is a very in-depth one. the story may need a bit of work, the gameplay may tend to be a tiny bit repetitive, but overall this game is one that im sure youll enjoy! its absolutely packed with content and its array of features is slowly accumulating so expect to see something new everytime you come back from a break. download this game, if you already have then get back to work tenno! :d",4
"great game i love it but it can get repetative sometimes but if you got a great group of friends to play with it can be a really awesome game and i see the people all like  but its pay to win thats it just pay to win and yes i will say there are some aspects that show the pay to win but as playing this game i have found that even people who pay real world money on warframes and weapons are really just as good as you myself ive been running an excalibur the very 1st starter warframe for 2 weeks and i can keep up with all the others in high risk mission ive actually been better then a lot of frost, loki, rhino, and mag primes its just how you play if you run and gun or if you play it smart from a distance 9 / 10 if you have the time play it. warframes a great game to play just make sure you got the time cause the mission can be really time consuming",4
"8/10 the game can be pretty aggressive on purchasing platinum since it is a free-to-play and it requires a lot of grinding at first but it is well worth it. very fun game with tons of options and challenges with a good steam account sync.",5
"this game is a great grind. its grind are 10/10 i went ahead of my frind because i was bored of playing aneeded to grind if u liked destiny you will love this but i will hate u casue destiny is  and can go burn this could be destiny its destiny.",1
"holy crap did i poop my pants when i realized this game was out. were talking like a clean dookey.",1
"i cant get enough of this game. they are always updating and adding content. 2 thumbs up! fight like a space ninja!",4

"i need to go see a therapist about my addiction to this game, but ill be late because ill be completing an alert for a vauban part. -11/10",4
"at last! what a game!!!!!!!!! fealing like im not going to play any other than warframe lol awsome graphics and visuall efects!!",1
"extremely amazing game. as well as the fact it is somewhat a sequal to the game dark sector which i love so much. edit: if your really willing to donate the time, you dont absolutely have to spend money. grind, grind, grind some moar, then get that shiny new excal prime you always wanted....oh wait.",4
"best free ninja game ever .. i played closed beta (in 2013 and i like it) now i started agin .",1
"finally feeling like a ninja with the melee overhaul. pros + good graphics (some low res textures here and there though) + lots of customization (even without $$$ as you can trade parts for premium money) + huge playerbase + lots of updates + quick loading times + melee is a real combat option! (feels like a different game) neutral * archwing is nice but needs more mixing with normal gameplay like in the first aw-mission. cons - only a few quests - unbalanced weapons and powers - still a huge grindfest - rng item farming warframe has lured me back with the new updates and i guess its a nice timesink. score: 70/100 improved a lot over the years.",2
"a ninja style free-to-play game. whats not to like? they dont have none of this play-to-win rubbish, either. everything in the game, apart from cosmetics can be obtained with a bit elbow grease and love. the con? as soon as they catch wind of powerful warframes, weapons or augment mods, they nerf them back a considerable amount. even with the nerfing, i can safely say i got addicted to the damned game. good job, digital extremes.",4
"a fine co-op-stravaganza for those who like being space ninjas with guns.",2
"i have had the most fun with this game in the short amount of time ive had to play it, i cant play it right now since my laptop no longer has the horse-power needed to run it, and since its online i made a few good friends in the prosses that im pretty sure i probably wouldnt even know if i never played this game, this is the kind of game thats allot more fun with friends and even then this game is really fun alone, and it can spark new and sometimes life long friendships if your lucky like i was, so for anyone on the fence about downloading this game i highly recommend this game, its free it has really fun gameplay and like i said before if your lucky you will meet some cool people that you can have fun with.",2
"for a free to play game,this game has so much detail and lore within it and you can totally play it free.its great",2
"great game, should get it and try it out after all it is free and a great game",2
"you can lower the elevator on your teammate and make him stuck the whole mission. 10/10",1
"me and my friend downloaded this game like seems like fun, lets give it a try! and then we spent 5 hours on it. very fun game. :)",1
"very good game. it is often updated, and when it is, there is lots of new stuff. the graphics are great, especially for a free game. anything that other people pay real money for, you can earn yourself. even if it takes a little bit longer, you can be out killing things while you wait! i would rate 9/10",1
"ok take cods gameplay and halo aleins and technology  and make them have sex ya get this except ther ninjas!",1
"this is what destiny should have been like. if you were ever thinking of getting destiny dont, just get this, its 10x better and actually has content. will definitely be supporting the devs as much as possible. great game.",1
"great third person, futuristic, assasins creed kind of game",1
"i lost 6 of my respawns in less then 2 minutes 11/10 would do it again",1
"i highly recommend this game to all players that like 3rd person shooters. this game isnt very laggy if you crank the settings down and its overall a great game. try it out!!",1
"man these robots r so sexy i dream about a big rhino with me at nite",1
"cyborg ninja third person shooter thats as succinct a description as i can think of. you play as a variant (over 20 kinds) of grey fox from mgs1, or raiden, whatever you prefer, in a far future solar system filled with humanoids, robots and infested flood (from halo) like aliens that you shoot and slash and stab and stealthy stab and energy stab and jump stab and do other things i havent unlocked yet. its got crafting and a grind to match for the specific items you want, but i dont mind that since i find the core gameplay of shooting and running and jumping and somersaulting really really fun. so yeah, play this game. its free and the vast majority of content is completely free. only cosmetics are forced to buy with money dollars.",1
"they call this game warframe because ur at war with ur wallet because everything is so damn expensive lol why play the game when i can play my moms credit card",1
"after playing warframe for 1000 hours ill say it definetely was a blast and still is. it never ceases to fail me that it always made me and my friends feel like were badasses. one shotting things and wiping rooms in mere seconds made me feel like a god almost. when ever it came to the hard stuff it was a bunch a teamwork and skill to output such great results whether it be survival or defense missions. although this game is not perfect with its few glitches and grindfests (freaking rng >_<), i feel it has come along way and from its beta till now. this game is about the journey not the quest (sometimes :3).",9
"im willing to sacrifice the rest of my life for this.",1
"fantastic game! lots of gamemodes and large variety of weapons. not those type of mmos that is not paid to win where everything is that is exclusive is possible to get if you take the time and hours to farm for it.",2
"theres really not much to say when you can cleave five people in half at once",1
"well. 371.2hrs on this game isnt much for those warframe pros. i recommend this game who loves to play farming games. farm farm exp farm every single thing to get those that looks really cool. but after so much time spent. waiting for foundries... i decided to stop... just... cant... stand it anymore. lots of new warframe shells are coming. and there are only 2 slots given by the game. need to buy with real money or sell stuff...well...uh... yeah. pretty much it. recommended... i have no life after playing this game",3
"great game. worth putting the time and effort into. the game gives a different atmosphere of gameplay, something that you will want more and more of. theres alot of stuff to do ingame. you have dojos (clans) which u can customise fully however you like. you also have a handfull of great weapons to choose from and customize at will. theres a great community backing the game too. also the developers at warframe are very good, they are very helpful for whenever you need them e.g. technical issues and wateva else. they bring great content to the game every so month or season like xmas, easter and so on. while on a certain mission, its great just to take your time and look around the map, the way they design the map and have all different secret areas for you to xplore and discover is just awsome. only down side i have had with the game would be just the lagg, some games i join might have cr*ppy internet, so it pretty much makes the mission impossible to do cause, sometimes you will not see the enemies around you or doors will not open for you but for others it will. but those are just minor things. everything else... is just awesome! plus.. you become a space ninja what more could you ask for!? :d",9
"a fantastic game that would be universes better with far far far more variety in its environments and objectives.",1
"one of the best free to play mmorpgs ive ever played. the game is not pay to win, all warframes and weapons can be crafted except excalibur prime as this is for founders only. even if you dont play for a while you can still go back to the game and play with friends who may be a different level. the game requires alot of time and effort (grind). regardless this doesnt really matter as it is very fun with friends and solo, solo just providing more of a challenge!",1
"plays for two years. gets banned for no reason for 20 years. 8/8 would get banned again.",2
"best game to those crazy nights with friends. this game gets updated everytime and it keeps getting better and better!",1
"this game is one of the best free to play games out there, you will find yourself playing late into the night building new warframes, upgrading weapons and playing with friends! plus, its free, so its always worth a try:)",1
"why is this game free? someone, tell me. its better then alot of games that cost 60$. is it mabey because of the little amount of in-game purchases? (which can be avoided) ac unity had tons of those, and it was a 60$ game. someone tell me, why is it free? edit: its because these developers care about making a good game, not about making money. thankyou, may your company live long, and prosper. (dangit spock)",2
"im not one who easily gets hooked into your typical shooter. to a certain degree, warframe is quite unique as a third person shooter game. each individual warframe (character you play as creatively named after the title) has their own unique sort of play style which can help your team either very little, or you could be a banshee where you point out weak spots, or loki who disarms every enemy within range to make the fight easier for you. for those who arent after a shooter thats similar to the call of duty scene (which is getting increasingly bland with every new release), id give this game a try. sure the missions get repetitive at times, but this game should have enough content to more or less keep you coming back for more.",1
"love this game. nothing better then a bunch of op space ninjas hacking up the univers. be prepared though for a hard learning curve and a bit of grinding to level and collect what you need. but still worth it for a game that already is so polished for a beta",2
"i havent played it much, but its alright. gets a little repetitive though.",7
"this game is ing awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! space ninjas killing space aliens who are killing clones and they are killing machines. i cant stop playing!! i think my caps lock is broken.....",6
"rage quit after grinding too long . hour later, returned to grind and qq for something merely impossible to obtain. 10/10 would qq again.",7
"i had fun playing it but eventually you will get bored of it when you realize there is no more objectives.",1
"before you mod weapons, look online and see good builds. i learned this the hard way...",2
"a very fun and addicting game with a fair and mostly balanced f2p microtransaction model. you can play this game entirely for free and experience all of its content for free. the only exception being that the only worthwhile things to obain using ereal money are slot for weapons and warframes.",6
"its good but im stuck on the menu ship and cant get off",2
"an intensely fun, free to play, third person shooter. tons of fun, but if you dont want to pay for premium currency, prepare to spend lots of hours grinding. not a ton of stuff at end of game, but lots to do for newer player.",6
"edited works fine now and plays great patched fixed it yay =) gameplay is fun recommended",1
"well i see now who bungie ripped off to make destiny. warframe is awesome with so much to do. ive had a blast playing and wish a few of my friends would play so i can get some co-op action going.",1
"im a fan of the muliplayer fps, mmo and rpg scenes. i love the idea of an fps in a diablo suit, but i was worried it would be too repetitive. would the replayability be there? the answer: a circumstantial yes. i would highly reccomend that you play this game with friends. if you are solo the game can quickly become tedious. however, with friends time flies by! something else that is not readily apparent - there is a somewhat steep learning curve to this game. understanding how mods interact with polarity slots, how damage is calculated, various weaknesses and strengths, and learning all the warframes (really what style of play suits you) can be a daunting task. new players will find the first system of missions easy enough, but will soon find enemies that prove a real challenge. the correct application of mods on your warframe and weapons will be essential. all in all digital extremes is putting in a great deal of work into making this game an amazing experience. updates are constant. its free to play with an ingame store for both normal currency and paid currency. everything that can be bought with real money can also be obtained without real money (except extra inventory space and a few cosmetics) and without too much difficulty. try it out - what have you got to lose?",3
"simply put, one of the best free to play games out there in more than one genre, not only the vast ammount of content and missions fully available for you even if you didnt spend a bloody dime on the game make up for hundreds of hours of gameplay, the vast and colorful variety of weapons that let you obliterate, decimate (looks into a dictionary) tear apart... eww, more stuff like that! plus the wide cast of characters that are also completely free (given you play missions, gather materials blah blah blah rpg elements) this game puts everything at your reach, you only have to play it! oh yeah one downside... get geforce or gtfo (jk but you ll probably lag during the massive skirmishes)",6
"beautiful game with tons of fun co-op gameplay. pick it up, its free.",1
"for a free game, its pretty good with its gameplay and graphics. kind of similar to the destiny game. beside its heavy micro-transaction based nature, everything else is awesome. most of the cash item can be forge with a little more hunting. of course there are cash item that cannot be forge or purchase with in-game currency. conclusion: good game for people that like grinding. bad game for people that have short attention span.",2
"i would recomend this game for people who enjoy playing grindier games its quite the time sinker if you like it to be, always thinking about what is the next step, what weapons you should be leveling up and modding as you get more into it, you will expand and build you own kind of gameplay with you own set of favourit warframe , and there are quite a lot to choose from , i would recomend also to be a few people playing it as a team as it enhance the experience and makes it easier to achive goals that contributes to you own agenda",2
"the game is centred around a group of space ninjas or tenno who aim to maintain some form of balance in the galaxy. they are lead by a mysterious being known only as the lotus in their task. each tenno is able to equip a warframe or battle suit to use in their fight, they each have their own abilities, strengths and weaknesses. the game has a slow start but does get better with the aquisition of new weapons and warframes,most of the game is based around improving your gear and weapons and there is pvp if you want to compare with friends. the story is still unfolding in the game so it may seem very subtle but the actions you perform do have an impact, even if it is just a minor one. + good gameplay + varied weapons and warframes(abilities) + varied maps and enviroments - slow to start - can feel grind heavy for free to play players 8/10 would play for hours.",4
"its space ninjas and parkour, what could be better?",1
"the game is a great mix of third person shooter with space ninjas and elements of rpg games like wow and guild wars(in terms od weapon and character customization). overall i will sugest this game to everyone who want to have a lot of fun with over the top shooter and doesnt want to pay a lot of money(you will need to spend some time if u dont want to spend money at all) 9/10",5
"similar to global agenda, lots of fun & something different.",8

"i thought this game was cool back when i first played it in closed beta forever ago. just started playing it in earnest this week and i have to say its alot of fun. more so when i played it originally. it takes some work to get into and figure everything out but the tutorials are pretty helpful for modding and such",1
"a great game became better with a newly introduced story line and quests. its a difficult grind to get the better gear if you dont spend cash for platinum or purchase packs, but its still possible to get all high-end gear in-game without spending money. a great time sink, the game gets better and better as you put more and more time into it.",1
"best game ever , there are space ninjas in it 11/10",4
"you. are. a. space. ninja. thats right... space ninja!> do i even need to explain anything else? space ninja.",6
"although the bugs may be a turn off, i absolutely love this game. constant updates large and small keep the game more varied and interesting. the game alone may not seem to interesting but playing with friends is really fun. the warframes vary well having different support, offensive, and defensive abilities. also this is probably the best looking free to play around right now. overall if you have the room to download, give it a chance and play with friends and you will end up putting some hours into it.",2
"my favourite sci-fi game so far. 10/10 for me. the graphics are beautiful, the choice of weapons, warframes(characters) and mods(to upgrade all these) are just huge. the game is mostly a co-op game, with a maximum of four players per mission. your mission goals vary, the environment varies, everything is perfect. only one thing i dont like: the updates. when a major update comes out(like new mission type, new event, etc.) there are so many bugs and glitches and sometimes a lots of game crashes, that it makes almost impossible to play peacefully for one or two days. they should focus on looking for these problems and repair them a.s.a.p. in brief this is a beautiful game, interesting, always gives you something new to reach. i have 350+ game hours and im still enjoying it.",4
"great game. amazing fast pace combat more skill then grinding for gear. expansive with many aspects including crafting and clan hall building. great to play with friends.",7
"as you can see, ive played this game quite a bit. i really enjoyed (most) of the time i played, but there were some bugs and stupid stuff here and there. be advised; you will have to farm for everything you want to get. even though the game is kinda buggy and really unbalanced, it is a lot of fun (especially with friends!) and i would recommend at least trying this out, cause its free!",3
"who can go wrong with magic ninjas in power suits vs marines, zombies, and robots? you can have multiple suits (each with their own powers) / guns / melee weapons going at the same time, somewhat supportive community, still growing... great if you want to try a different f2p game, but it does get repetetive quite quickly, if you dont have friends to play with",2
"fly around as a space ninja and   up. everything else in life is pointless now. 5/5",1
"this is my review: (this is ma short version: quite cool and awesome, love the different movement aspect and warframes, 9/10, keep the updates coming guys!) 1. saw game thought...ninja play free? its free, that means i am a ninja! 2. waited for 2 hours and lost 10g to play the game 3. started, thought hmmmmmm space ninjas with space swords and space guns 4. finished starter campaign, realised damn it, i didnt want excalibur! i wanted mag 5. started grinding, on walls and on missions 6. went ah stuff this ill spend like 20 bucks on it 7. got nyx, a sentinel and some flaming cape made of light 8. went :o controlling peoples minds 9. realised no one plays with me :( 10. bribed friends to come play with money! 11. still havin the time of my life 12. wait your still reading? whats wrong with you? in short i give it 100000 vors out of 10nos",1

"this is probably one of the best f2p games i have ever played. great graphics for a f2p game and not a realy demanding game for the pc. gameplay is awsome and combat system is great. swords and guns always mix well and cybernetic ninja ftw!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. there are some slight problems with it, the level design is lacking, there needs to be more creative mission types, and going solo in this game is never the best way to play. i would give a 9 out 10, it truly an awsome game. so download it now and play it. (did i mention its free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)",2

"well. 371.2hrs on this game isnt much for those warframe pros. i recommend this game who loves to play farming games. farm farm exp farm every single thing to get those that looks really cool. but after so much time spent. waiting for foundries... i decided to stop... just... cant... stand it anymore. lots of new warframe shells are coming. and there are only 2 slots given by the game. need to buy with real money or sell stuff...well...uh... yeah. pretty much it. recommended... i have no life after playing this game",3
"great game. worth putting the time and effort into. the game gives a different atmosphere of gameplay, something that you will want more and more of. theres alot of stuff to do ingame. you have dojos (clans) which u can customise fully however you like. you also have a handfull of great weapons to choose from and customize at will. theres a great community backing the game too. also the developers at warframe are very good, they are very helpful for whenever you need them e.g. technical issues and wateva else. they bring great content to the game every so month or season like xmas, easter and so on. while on a certain mission, its great just to take your time and look around the map, the way they design the map and have all different secret areas for you to xplore and discover is just awsome. only down side i have had with the game would be just the lagg, some games i join might have cr*ppy internet, so it pretty much makes the mission impossible to do cause, sometimes you will not see the enemies around you or doors will not open for you but for others it will. but those are just minor things. everything else... is just awesome! plus.. you become a space ninja what more could you ask for!? :d",9
"a fantastic game that would be universes better with far far far more variety in its environments and objectives.",1
"one of the best free to play mmorpgs ive ever played. the game is not pay to win, all warframes and weapons can be crafted except excalibur prime as this is for founders only. even if you dont play for a while you can still go back to the game and play with friends who may be a different level. the game requires alot of time and effort (grind). regardless this doesnt really matter as it is very fun with friends and solo, solo just providing more of a challenge!",1

"one of the only shooters i like, because the rpg elements are reasonably compelling. some menu items are mouse only, but otherwise you can play with a gamepad. just pray to the gods of rng with warframe. it can take a lot of grinding to get what you want, since its typically not a steady stream of predictable rewards, but rather a completely random chance of getting a reward based on the roll of the dice. cash shop isnt too intrusive. you can play without paying easily, though if you dont want to look ugly or have barely any inventory space, youll want to cough up 5 or 10 usd for some color palletes and inventory spaces.",3

"i have played longer and im in master lvl 10 but my steam profile says that i have only played like 81 hours. i recommend warframe but it has two problems, 1. breaking the noob barier, meaning that the first 4 mastery lvls are the hardest and kinda the most boring ones, however once youre through that and have some good stuff itll be a blast. 2. paying users and non-paying users: if you pay nothing your warframe and stuff will never look that good and itll ruin the expirence for you, meanwhile your teammates (paying users) will have special armour and well coustumized colours and skins. with the armours, colours and skins and stuff youll enjoy playing the game much more. but overall its a good game and you can get stuff at events and more and you can also sell stuff on trading and meaby buy some stuff for the money you make there. :) im very sorry if i made any spelling mistakes.",1

"there is a saying it saves time and money. well, this game doesnt save your money or your time! warframe might be a free game with a stunning graphics and huge potentials, but the problem is the game wants you to either pay for everything from warframe to speed up process and that causes an arm and a leg (through in-app-purchases) or you could simply wait from an average waiting time (1 day) and the slot idea that sacrifices most of the things youve gathered if you dont pay for the extra slot you loss the loot. the game crashes most of the time if not all the time. the community are annoying and the game sometime force you to play with other players you dont want to play with them. on the other hand, the game is very enjoyable from stealth missions to tower defense. the mods are a great idea! where you gather and combine your loots. its a very sophisticated intelligent game, but with greedy publishers. they have the right to put the price for their products and we have the right to buy the product or not. from my opinion, i dont recommend this game, due to the latter reasons.",2
"the general gameplay and experience was fun... while it lasted. the whole game gets tedious and players can easily buy their way to success, but that takes most of the challenge away. ive lost interest in this game, and so have many of the people that i personally know who played this game. my clan is dead and many more have gone quiet. generally, warframe now has a lackluster feel for me. i got used to the grinding, but de just added more, and then buffed the grinding with little annoying paywalls  that honestly generate more challenge. unfortunately, they nerfed across the board, so it became more difficult for non-paying players to effectively play. i cant imagine this game having any longevity. im serious. i used to love the  out of this game, but now its just complete crap. as little money as i did spend on it (after 300+ hours of play) i feel cheated. longtime players, founders, and vets alike have been leaving and/or disapproving of the games recent turn of events. discontent is all over the forums. de has become heedlessly distant from their fan base and gamming community. i implore you to seriously consider not downloading this game.",5

"this free to play game is a very nice and well done game that has a nice story and clear cut gameplay with the diffeent ways to play the game i am finding it a very enjoyable experience. the only problem i find is the importance of microtransactions to get the best weapons and warframe but the game is very enjoyable non the less. i would recommend this game to anyone who likes any shooters because this has almost everything a diverse shooter needs.",1

"i entered the world of warframe with a lot of confusion. the menu was full of options and customizations for me to choose from and i honestly had some trouble figuing out where to start. eventually i got a few missions under my belt and found the color customization screen and from that moment on i was hooked. this game is repetitive and grindy but if you let yourself get sucked in you will find yourself playing countless hours on it. the one gripe i had is that it seems to lack an overall objevive. however, it really hit home for me after my fourth mission that this really is all about the spectacle and enjoying it. you beat missions to acquire better weapons and power ups only to use them to repeat the process. but when you eventually find yourself flying sideways down a hallway scoring headshots with a weapon you have built and colored yourself while impaling other enemies on an equally personalize sword you have no choice but to stop for a second and say: yes. this is why i enjoy playing this game.",9
"the best game . great graphic,great gameplay, great people. didnt you play it? go for it!!!",1
"ninjas. shooting aliens and robots. with tech and . 11/10 proper review, pardon my english : this game is fully free to play with slow and steady pace towards full geared. with many different ninjas that you could get for free by grinding bosses. mostly content for premium users is costumes and , but wait, you could half of those by some random event in-game and premium users items is just for a quick good game. therefore i conclude this game is fully free to play by an exception, you couldnt get all of those cool looking ninjas and weapons in your inventory because you could only add slots with microtransaction. the community is great i think, dev is supportive too, i got a quick responses for wanting to change my e-mail id. so i have been enjoyed for about 300+ hours of fun smacking the enemies with so many interesting abilities. the missions could be repetitive and boring but random generated map negates it a bit. therefore anyone who enjoyed tps-games should give this a try, nothing to lose.",3
"a fun co-op shooter that doesnt feel like its solely out to gouge its players wallets. solid third person shooter mechanics and some fun swashbuckling. co-op works well with four invested players, and an interesting upgrade system. play with your friends to enjoy the game to the max cuz theres no fun playing this game on your own. i would give it 9/10 because its really enjoyable when you play with friends.",1
"i really enjoy this game. graphicly, its way above your average f2p. also, paying real money for things doesnt mean much since you dont typically fight each other; this is a co-op based game. there is an option that you can duel with others but it has to be an accept action, no one will just jump out of nowhere an kill you mid-mission. there is a little bit of a learning curve getting used to the controls, and an even greater one for a controller, in my opinion. when bad guys drop stuff, everyone shares the loot. you only see the stuff on your screen but everyone gets the same thing. this game has kind of an mmo feel with some of the grinding involved but its done in an entertaining way. as far as using your real money equivilant platinum you start with, i recommend buying an extra slot for a suit and slots for weapons. they are contantly updating this game which makes it continually enjoyable. the improvements that are done for updates can sometimes change the whole dynamics of how you play your character. fortunately enough, i havent seen an update yet that has frustrated me into not playing anymore but instead curious about how to utilize the new system.",2
"this game is very underrated, it deserves a higher meta score than it has, a lot of the negative reviews were back when the game was much older and offered less, they dont represent the game now. excellent co-op, mostly bug-free, smooth controls, outstanding graphics, tons of weapons, upgrades and customization, get pretty much anything you can buy with the store credit in game also (except warframe and weapon slots i think). oh and replayablity. i have been playing this game for a long time. they are always adding new modes that refresh the expereince. i cant recommend it enough. 8.5/10",4

"super sweet 3rd-person shooter! controls and systems take time to get used to. the damage system has got a big learning curve, but once you do get it youre basically a god. almost everything in-game you can build, but there are some things that are exclusively pay to get. plus they give you some in-game premium cash when you start up- so all good (its dirt cheap if you want to buy some more). online interactions are pretty o.k. you get a squad most of the time, but you never truly stick with them cause of connection issues. without a good internet connections, your ethier lagging from your connection or someonelses. note: you actually need to join a clan to do crap in this game 0.0. probably cause some weapons are exclusive to clans. the gameplay gets repetitve after a while, due to the tidous farming and the same mission types over and over again. though there are a few random events that keep it fresh. the shooting mechanics are....well...... generic shooting mechanincs, nothing really special. unless of course, you count the warframe abilites. overall score: with its fun and social gameplay, and a few minor bugs and problems i give warframe a 9/10.",2
"very fun online co-op, very difficult for singleplayer. its alot more fun when youre playing with friends as opposed to strangers though. concept-wise/story-wise, its pretty unique and fascinating, as alot of the backstory is left for the player to interpret. gameplay wise, its a very cool third person shooter and thirdperson melee experience, with special abilities for each individual warframe. although it uses microtransactions, these are non-essential, and more or less just allow easier/faster access to items you could get through gameplay otherwise. ive been playing since closed beta, and ive watched the game grow and change but have yet to see a change i cannot stand. they seem to update frequently and patch as needed, and have yet to come up with a solid reason to be disappointed by the game or anything in it.",4

"hundreds of action packed four player co-op missions without having to spend a penny. generated stages with 10 different mission types, all of which play very differently from one another. character upgrading and weapon crafting is done through drops during levels, which is nowhere near as grindy as people make it out to be. there is a big character and weapon roster allowing play styles of every kind as long as they include a good bit of mindless shooting. updates are plenty, well optimised while still looking good and the warframes just look too cool to turn down.",1
"warframe changed the way i thought of [free to play games] (well sort of), having friends who play together using team speak is really fun & funny! have to buy blueprint to build your items might take up to days but its worth it!

"thouroughly enjoyable from start to finish (although there isnt really a finish), warframe offers the kind of addicting gameplay where you know what to expect, and are still enthralled by it at the same time. the game is constantly updated with new content and fixes for some of the games glitches and gameplay issues. the staff are very responsive to the wants and needs of the community, and they do a great job with it. overall 8/10",7

"love this game. it looks gorgeous if you have a decent pc (otherwise you can play it on a ps4). it has its flaws with the amount of grinding you will have to do and is missing a proper endgame however the way the parkour is done, the way the weapons handle... the gameplay melts away the tediousness of the grind. i would say that overall, this game is a great game.",3

"one of the most addicting and beautiful free-to-play games out there i highly recomend it. its kind of like a tps-mmo because of the powers you get on each warframe. the wepons are ok some of them are terrible,but on the bright side you can get great a huge longsword (galatine) and bladed boomarang (glave) sadly you can only get a glave by using platinum (real life money) and login rewards.so all in all i totaly recomended it",4
"this game has some amazing graphics for a free-to-play. game mechanics are nice, too. although its an open beta, there is very little content in the game though, and its definitely not worth spending any irl money on, and after a while there isnt much to this game that brings you back to it: the missions, despite the levels being somewhat randomly generated every time you play a mission, get extremely repetitive after a while. 7/10",1

"fun, action-packed game. really nice graphics. if you like ninjas in space and shooters, this is the game for you. fast paced game play, dungeon crawler co-op game with many weapons to choose from. it could do with more strategy as most games with a full team of 4 wind up being a huge zerg and the final kill count seems to be related to the person who run the fastest. game can get grindy and repetitive, and the store items can be a little pricy, but if you want to just have a blast and shoot anything in sight for a while, this will get you hooked.",2

"its a great game. along with co-op you have get to have neat player abilities, which if paired up with other warframes you and your friends can be devastating against your enemies. its free, the gameplay is fun, and for a free-to-play its very pretty. so space-ninjas... need i say more? 8.5/10 (8.5 because its takes so long to get new weapons and other warframes! >.< but hey, all the more reason to shoot stuff right?)",4
"great game, ive logged loads and loads of hours on it, for quite awhile you can solo it too but on most bosses and defence missions youll need a helping hand. its a good blend of melee and shooter, filling the enemy full of lead (or tiny metal darts) then hacking them to bit with your melee weapon of choice, collecting and building new items can be a grind at a start but after a while it soon eases. plus its free, give it a try",2
"since i last played this game in closed beta and left it due to it lagging on my computer along with choppy movement, the amount of updates that the developers have put forth is amazing! warframes premise for the game is unique and is continuously being built upon. theres a learning curve to the game, but once you learn it, it is a lot more enjoyable. also, playing with friends and making new ones is always good! :d",2
"one of the best free2plays i have ever tried out. you can practically get everything or every weapon, warframe in the game just by playing the game. graphics wise, its a gorgeous game. music is a heat pumping rhythm, that will make you just want to kill everything at sight. sometimes the lobbies tend to mess up, like joining someones game tells me the objective is done... but its not. it kinda feels like mass effect 3s multiplayer mode. having these alert missions is good and rewarding. plus an active community, gonna love an active community. there were a lot of big changes from closed beta to open beta, but overall this is an amazing game. oh i forgot about the story, it has a story and bosses to beat :d amazing game, play now tenno!",8
"this is a great game away from the normal things i play. graphics are great only complaint is how there arent many differences in the maps. all in all though its a awesome game to get with friends co-op it up and kill stuff!",1
"absolutely amazing game all around. i love it. no life it almost every day :)",8
"this game is unbelievable. when i first heard about it, i thought it was just going to be another generic fps game, but oh was i wrong. it got me hooked only after a few minutes of playing, the characters, the enemies, the world, all aspects of the game are awesome. if i had to rate this game, i would give a 10/10",1
"suuuper addicting great game for free. comes with strings tho. time equals money in this game. 12-24-72 hour craft times. and you can tell who spends money and who does not. but its optional. you can do just fine without spending a dime. ive spend bout ten bucks and am happy where i ended up. so yeah next gen kinda game for free. duh download the  outa this",2
"absolute gameplay, great graphic, and its free to play!",10
"really really good combat mechanics. not a lot else, but that alone is worth a number of hours of fun.",2
"warframe is a fun and exciting third-person shooter. leveling your warframe and playing through its missions is super fun when you first start out. although end game can be a bit grindy, there is always something to do and work towards. there is online mode as well as private, so you can play by yourself or with other people. but its definatelly more fun with friends. if youre looking for an interesting action oriented game with some challange, pick up warframe and give it a try.",4
"space ninjas in space with space guns. thats basically what i say the game is to people that have no clue about it. and i love this game. sure it has its fault, suich as f2p meaning nothing, you still need to spend at least $20 on it eventually. but other than that, the devs are nice, the community is good. and its all in a ll fun to play. the gamer itself is really neat, even though its a beta, its still a very decent game. a lot of fun killing times, granted its not very heavy on the lore, but its still a good game. its sort of like minecraft, you dont understand it, but you still get addicted to it at some point or another. the weapons are cool, and the fact that you put on a different suit and it gives you these awesome abilities, makes it fun. you can customize the play style to however you want it to be. stealthy, bum rush, magic. its all there. so check it out. it wont cost you anything to start, but if you get into it, a little investment to help out these awesome devs is totally worth it.",4
"this is a solid beta. it provides great fast paced action. expansive leveling and customization. you can play solo or in groups so you arent strong armed into one or the other. i will say it again though, it is a beta so there are bugs but the flip side to that is a continual stream of updates. i am taking place in the first big operation and it is a lot of fun. basically it has everything i could want in an action shooter; big levels, different types of missions, many environments, lots of guns, lots of leveling of gear etc... just a great game for 20mins or 20hrs.",2
"four words... space ninjas in space!!! warframe is awesome the unique style and fast pace gameplay really make for a good time. its f2p and you really do not need to put any money in to the game to enjoy it to the fullest. you can buy the warframes and weapons but they are are easy enough to obtain given a little time.",2
"its ok. not great but ok. ive really tried to like this game but i just havent been able to get there, yet, and i find myself going back to mass effect 3 (its a shame bioware has pretty much blown off its multiplayer support). i really dislike the fact that you cant earn platinum by just playing the game. instead youre either required to shell out money or need to grind for ridiculous lengths of time to unlock new stuff. regardless, for what its worth, its pretty good, especially considering its free-to-play. if they were to change the purchasing systems and leveling system in the future, id most likely donate cash toward its development. addendum (2013/12/13): its actually a lot of fun. ive been playing the crap out of it the past couple of weeks and, now that ive picked up on the resource farming and have a better idea on the forging, i think its pretty entertaining. i still like the overall feel of mass effect better but me has become pretty stagnant compared to the continuous evolution of warframe. i will continue to dislike the purchasing system and the inability to get new equipment in an acceptable amount of time without paying for it. i also find it appalling that de put in the option to pay platinum for credits. all-in-all, fun",2
"this game is possibly the best game i have ever played. mixing creativity, building, fighting, magic, abilities, and all sorts of fun, this game is just stunningly amazing. i would recommend this game to absolutely everyone, and would like to ask them to give it a chance, considering it is free anyway. overall worth the download, and fun as hell. definitely get it.",3
"i cant stop... playing this game... help me. for a more substatnive review, a lot has already been covered in other reviews that i can echo; the gameplay is fun, its got some grinding aspects but you never feel a lack of what to do, the co-op aspects are spectacular, and abilities start to synergize with each other as you start to work together... the reason i got so wholy sucked into it, though, is that it feels like an amalgamation of a lot of my favorite aspects of gaming; a compelling leveling system, great customization options for gameplay style, reasonable grinding for new equipment and warframes so that each acquisition feels like an exciting accomplishment... the sum of the parts makes the whole incredible. its clear that the game is still beta, thats certain, but if its already at this point in its beta stage and still getting updates, it has a lot of potential. highly reccommended.",2
"surely everyone has already very familiar with the topic of outer space ninja ninja but the only competition in this game - warframe, 3rd combination of rpg and shooting will give players the feeling rambo extremely , besides being able to build dojo (for members of the clan) improve interoperability between players with each other... however game modes in the game are few and the environment in a few short game species and terrain changes automatically every time you play on the games special uproot game engine. found a thousand words, or experience the feeling of watching one ninja in space is like, and if you still is one lone warrior in this macrocosm, or join my clan wfo -ign: bogialat123",8

"350+ hours so far. if you like ninjas, and you like space then you will love warframe. best of all its free.",3
"amazing free to play. they have done a really good job avoiding the pay to win and allowing anyone to get any weapons or warframe in game with time alone. paying in this game just helps make up for time. well worth putting money towards though.",6
"amazing gameplay, 10/10 graphics, stunning action. jam packed fun.",1
"i just love warframe everything fromguns and swords and plasma weapons",1
"awesome easy to play game without the excessive grind! the bad part to that though is its easy to get tired of quickly and its maps and missions are a bit repetitve, but the developers are always dishing out updates which make up for that con.",9
"outstanding game. this game is just so open it allows so many ways to play the game. not the mention the modding system and the variety of warframes you can play as. these developers (digital extremes) deserve a thumbs up and some support because the more u help them the more u get content!",4
"on a scale of 1-10 this game is a jesus. ive been playing this game since closed beta. its come such a long way and with update 12 this game looks polished and official. awesome work for a smaller studio. you can tell they love the game, and the constant push of new content is awesome",4
"warframe is practically the computer version of clash of clans, figuratively. it will addict you with hours of gameplay that keep you coming back with the just one more level feeling. the graphics are amazing. i play on low graphics settings, for qualitys sake, and the game looks comparable to halo 4 on the xbox 360 in terms of detail. your eyeballs are in for a treat. the levels are all the same structure, you move from room to room murdering everything in your path with guns to bow and arrows to shurikens, etc. there are different level types, exterminate, spy, assassinate, defense, survival, sabotage, and mobile defense. each of these levels has a different objective that i am not going in depth of(mainly because the title says it all), but they last 10-15 minutes usually. the length of the mission really depends on how far you are willing to push yourself. are you going to murder an entire army, or just the standing garisson? the choice is yours. this game has full clan support, trading, friends, text chat, and even a pvp multiplayer duel mode where up to 4 people can duke it out to see whose ninja skills are superior. all in all, its a great game for being free, and even though repetitiveness sinks in quickly, the tutorial doesnt give a lot of info, and the storyline is non-existent, its fun. and thats all games are supposed to be. for the few gigabytes its worth, i give warframe a 8/10.",1

"at first i downloaded this game because katanas in spess, and i thought i would just bust some money on it. so i go to the free2play store, to buy the katana (named nikana in game). but, to my great sadness, the nikana is xp locked. thats a nice free to play. doesnt just allow you to buy all the good stuff. i ended up saving the majority money and got some samurai shoulder pads, and the ash ninja frame. lazor shurikens. great free2play, great gameplay, great co-op, great balancing. i heart it.",1

"absolutely an amazing free to play game. have over 200 hours into it alone, and its always evolving. while there can be a good amount of downtime between updates every once in a while, the amount of weapons, warframes(guys you play as), things to collect, dojo to build or clans to join, and friendly community, theres no reason not to play. ive only once put about twenty bucks into this game for some early warframe slots and weapon slots. since then, ive made all i ever needed by selling items in-game. great market, just gotta keep up with prices.",6

"this free to play game is a very nice and well done game that has a nice story and clear cut gameplay with the diffeent ways to play the game i am finding it a very enjoyable experience. the only problem i find is the importance of microtransactions to get the best weapons and warframe but the game is very enjoyable non the less. i would recommend this game to anyone who likes any shooters because this has almost everything a diverse shooter needs.",1
"the game is alright for people who like pve. you can play in a squad of no more than 4 people. there is a fair variety of missions large ammount of guns and customization options everything than can be purchased on the market with real money can be found and crafted in the game with hardwork and luck. there is even some things money cant buy. pvp lacks something fierce. there is literally no point to it. the pvp in this game lacks the feeling of just completely obliterating your oponent. there is no real strategy and it just feels like a cheap cod arena. if youre looking for a pvp game. turn around this is not it.",8

"i highly recommend this game... if your looking for a stratergy game with teamwork or a 3rd person shooter with a difference. this is it! in my opinion this is the best f2p mmorpg out there. with beautiful graphics (even on lowest settings) and little to no lag you will be able to wall jump over fire and headshot grineer in the face while idk its raining and theres a huge background with an endless horizen... if your looking for weapon customization then theres plenty. from cosmetics to upgrades you can change the dps the accuracy and other weapony stats with mods you pick up from the environment. while you can buy weapons with in game special currency you can build your weapons with blueprints which require materials. this game is not p2w as it requires stratergy, guile and teamwork (unless your lone wolfing it) to complete any level, not just the biggest gun. for some though they may find stealth dull, so you can enter a room guns blazing! with a multitude of different playstyles accompanied by warframes wich is you as a character. there are a few (20ish) and each one different in size background and abilities! i recommend this game and would give it 21/20, 11/10, 70/69 topmarks!",1

"super sweet 3rd-person shooter! controls and systems take time to get used to. the damage system has got a big learning curve, but once you do get it youre basically a god. almost everything in-game you can build, but there are some things that are exclusively pay to get. plus they give you some in-game premium cash when you start up- so all good (its dirt cheap if you want to buy some more). online interactions are pretty o.k. you get a squad most of the time, but you never truly stick with them cause of connection issues. without a good internet connections, your ethier lagging from your connection or someonelses. note: you actually need to join a clan to do crap in this game 0.0. probably cause some weapons are exclusive to clans. the gameplay gets repetitve after a while, due to the tidous farming and the same mission types over and over again. though there are a few random events that keep it fresh. the shooting mechanics are....well...... generic shooting mechanincs, nothing really special. unless of course, you count the warframe abilites. overall score: with its fun and social gameplay, and a few minor bugs and problems i give warframe a 9/10.",2
"very fun online co-op, very difficult for singleplayer. its alot more fun when youre playing with friends as opposed to strangers though. concept-wise/story-wise, its pretty unique and fascinating, as alot of the backstory is left for the player to interpret. gameplay wise, its a very cool third person shooter and thirdperson melee experience, with special abilities for each individual warframe. although it uses microtransactions, these are non-essential, and more or less just allow easier/faster access to items you could get through gameplay otherwise. ive been playing since closed beta, and ive watched the game grow and change but have yet to see a change i cannot stand. they seem to update frequently and patch as needed, and have yet to come up with a solid reason to be disappointed by the game or anything in it.",4
"warframe changed the way i thought of [free to play games] (well sort of), having friends who play together using team speak is really fun & funny! have to buy blueprint to build your items might take up to days but its worth it!

"progressing through the game by doing same  over and over again, expecting youll get some rare mod. when you get that rare mode, you do the same  over and over again to get more rare mods. it sounds linear and boring but its not. they update the game pretty ofter, and when they update you can do same   over and over again expecting youll get that new rare mod. 10/10 would do over and over again.",3

"its just a grindfest with repetitive missions. they have literally the worst experience for new players, you literally have no idea of what to do, but yes, they explain controls because thats what the people never gets  . also the devs are no longer doing the things right, every update gets people to rage and stop playing the game. dont be fooled by the reputation the game got in the past, its pay2play since you need loads of slots to properly play the game. if you try to grid your way up youll need at least 60 h of gameplay to already start playing the things that are worth farming. the game its repetitive with only like 6 types of missions, and it gets worse later on (void). the frames can be fun sometimes but there are only 5 types: useless trash, fast ones (volt), mages (ember, nova), tanks (trinity-godmode, rhino) and nekros (also called the loot bot because you live to spam 3). so yeah, repetitive gameplay. conclussion: play this if you cant afford to buy a game and you are really bored. otherwise skip.",2

"fun game, but the downside is that you have to put in a lot of hours, and the repetitiveness of the levels would eventually dull ones senses. yes, there is a pvp game mode, but rarely are people logged in there, plus, you dont get to use all your abilities and items obtained from grinding in there. you play with a skeleton warframe. defeats the purpose of getting abilities and items in the first place. there should be more of a storyline too. one of the perks is that the community is friendly and players are always willing to help one another progress through the game.",9

"warframe has great graphics, good controls for doing lots of parkour, heaps of levels and tons of  to find. these things make it one of the best free to play games ive ever played. although.... it trys to prromote teamwork,but finding a group is can be a nightmare sometimes and then once you do there is hardly any co-ordination, communication or teamwork involved. it seems that you just go with other players to finish harder levels because their really hard solo. there is also an extreme variety of warframes each with its own play style and powers and lots of weapons with different stats. however almot all of these require premium credits which can almost never be found in the actual game, which makes it all seem pay2win and then buying the blueprints requires you to spend hours searching planets for all the parts and then extra time to actually craft the item.",1
"theres some [known] issue with the launcher, where it can not or will not connect to the content servers to inniate a download of updated content, which renders the game completely unplayable. ive downloaded the game twice and have been unable to even get past the broken launch frame. unfortunate. at least i didnt pay for this game.",1
"after the general fun of the combat wore off, i started dedicating a lot of time to min/maxing my warframe and sentinel with mods - however, the developers repeatedly changed the game mechanics (stamina change, frames and sentinels sharing mods change) in ways that screwed me over or left me far behind in progress from where i was right before the game update. now that the game is a stable release, this may not be a problem anymore, but it left a strong sour taste in my mouth. even with this fact aside, it takes an extraordinary amount of time and luck to get better gear/items. in many games, you get small stat increases at relatively frequent intervals, or relatively frequent gear drops. although i think the weapons are supposed to be sidegrades, the expensive and high-rank weapons are much better, albeit somewhat more situational, than the defaults. it takes a lot of materials to build weapons, and a lot of luck to get certain blueprint parts to drop from missions. these add up to a very grindy game with very slow progression.",1
"ok, so let me start off by saying, no this is not apay to play game you can get almost all the items in the game for free in the sense of federal funds. ill decide to start with the bad news oabout this game. bad things~ 1.map systems are terrible -half the time you wont even know where the exit is on an infestation level . 2.wait time for the ridiculous amount of timeit takes to make practically anything. -basicly explains itself but its cheap way how they get money [get ready to empty your wallet to speed up things] 3.its a glitchfest -you will run into at least 10 glitches in one week of playing i would let this pass since its f2p and th illt constantly update it to fix them but they are countless and its going a while till they perfect everything. good things~ 1.beautiful graphics (given youve got a good enough pc) -the graphics and colour variations are great epeacially with colour correction on. 2.gameplay -this is definatly a given since you probably know by now a game with space ninjas and guns each with various powers and customizable looks to boost morale and overall expirience is very good. 3.constant updates -this game recives tons of updates so many that you should never really grow bored with the game (given you arent still starter and dont know what to do like i was i reccomend looking at mogamu and some of the guides very helpful)",2

"this game is awesome, the developers are very user-friendly (even if you play as f2p you can get everything except skins (it does not include prime warframes which are elite version of character, the real-money platinum is very cheap and there are sometimes events where you can get it w/o much effort)). however this game is little recursive, you can feel bored sometimes, but if you like the concept of galaxy wars this game should never make you bored. grinding in this game is like other dimension of grind-based games; still - you are looking for resources to build you weapon, but you will know how much time it will take, you will find awesome graphic effects (check frost). i remember when i was playing volt warframe, defense mission as my team were dying as hell and i had only time for using my speed skill to be everywhere everytime to revive them (volt is not support, but with his abilities it can really save the ). team composition changes everything in this game",4

"s actually kind of good, play it but with friends since alone its kind of .",2
"space ninjas play for free. free to play defines this game extremely well. the fact that most ftp games are pay to win, this game is the exact opposite. this game is play to win. sure you can spend money and buy things, but you can literally unlock everything (except for colors, slots, and aesthetic features) in game. there are items in game that you have to play to unlock, you cant buy everything. the play style of warframe is amazing, its pve with groups of four. sure you can run solo, but its a lot more fun to play with groups. the beginning is somewhat slow, but once you hit around the third planet and you figure everything out, this game is simply amazing. the graphics are breath-taking, i could go very in-depth about this game, but ill let you decide if you enjoy it or not. just think about this one phrase, space-ninjas.",4

"warframe review this game can be very fun, i personally give it an 8/10, and i believe its pretty damn good advantages - has great graphics, better than alot of games out there - has interesting factions and interesting weapons, and grineerish is just pure awesome - most of the game can be accessed for free, by crafting or as login rewards - the whole solar system is free and can be done with any warframe - every warframe and weapon have advanteges and disadvantages, this makes them fairly well ballanced - the game is free to play disadvantages - some items cannot be aquired for free, they must be bought for platinum - the game has microtransactions which is never a good sign, but they dont give any overpowered items - colors are not free, palletes cost 75 platinum each, along with most cosmetic items - platinum is very hard to get without paying money - ridiculous crafting times starting at 12 hours to 72 hours overall i think this game is worth a shot, i have been playing for almost a year now (since the early beta) if you are willing to pay real world money for platinum, i recommend waiting until you get a discount as a login reward, i also highly recommend doing research on the wiki before craftin/buying items happy hunting tenno! - crazy",2
"i have spent so much time in this game, it is so much fun and really feels rewarding.",6
"in this game you play as space ninjas in a future where mankind has evolved beyond the need for stealth. as you stealthily cut a path of destruction through the hordes of enemies with your loud unsilenced weapons be sure to remember the ninja spirit animal, the rhino. use a rhino warframe and become a walking tank, the ultimate form in stealth for a ninja.",3

"warframe is a co-operative, free-to-play, sci-fi shooter game developed by digital extremes (de) for the pc and playstation 4. it is set in a distant future where the solar system is torn between a hyper-militarist clone empire, profit-driven technological merchants, and infested mutants/zombies. the player takes the role of a tenno, a member of a fourth faction with a blurry past and roots in ninja themes, and is guided by an entity called the lotus through missions including timed survival, prisoner rescue, sabotage, and many more. the players is always pitted against enemies in superior numbers. to this end, players have at their disposal a varied arsenal of weapons both archaic and fantastic, and, most notably, a special suit of armor called the warframe, each of which has a particular set of abilities. despite being primarily a shooter game, the gameplay has a definite focus on the agility of the warframes, featuring some parkour elements, and the way each warframes abilities allow for creativity in combat. to sum it up this is a very good game.",2
"warframe, the ultimate free to play game. this game has brought me and my friends much fun from just defeating a unlimited amount of hordes that consist aliens known as either the corpus or grineer. while playing this game, i wondered why this game is for free? it has desired gameplay, good graphics, and incrediable looking weapons. as well while knowing that you can spend cash on items; its best not to, since you can already unlock after completeing certain objectives if your patient. for the designing company who made this, thank you, for my laptop is just lucky enough to play this apple of eden. an the only negatives i can see this game are that the game can get boring if your not fond of having to repeat the same goals - though ive come to understand that most games are, therefore i enjoy this game. 8.7/10",1
"the story is terrible, the graphics are good but not anything special, the gameplay is repetetive and requires a lot of grinding to get anywhere. however for some reason its my favourite game and i find it completely addictive, it might be the space ninja robots, it might the super fun movement system or vast array of weapons and characters, im not sure but i love it. 9/10!",5
"this game is really good, and not good good, but so good, it will explode your brain *dont take it too literally tho* its about you, a tenno, which will stand up, and kill everyone.. well, not everyone, but most of the enemies, including the grineer, so this game, is just a freerun run&gun magic game, interesting boss-fights, and new-player friendly, which is always good. it gives you the freedom of crafting your own gun, hence you got the blueprint and the required materials, which are sometimes hard to find, but sometimes as simple of killing everyone and farming the crap out of it :d the gameplay is hard to master in my opinion, as in the beginning, even if its new-player friendly, the running and shooting mechanics can be hard to master, but if you just put some time in it (sadly, i dont really have that much time for it because of real life stuff) it will get easier. its beautiful, with great graphich, and even a low-end pc can run it on low settings. overall, a great game, still some room for improvement on some parts of it, but, for the most of it, its an amazing game, worth the shot to play :)",1
"refreshing game. great third person shooter with customizable characters. not a p2w game, and this makes it a plus.",1
"this games has one of the best graphics in the f2p market other then that the game revolves around the tenno which are these samurai aliens which are sent to missions to sabotage,assassinate,hacking etc. the game is fun with people but alone its more challanging,depending on what you like. the game is ment for people who just want to kill stuff and complete the objective while upgradeing their character. i found it extremely annoying to get matirials for warframes,guns and melee weapons other then that,this game deserves alot of credit and sometimes it feels pay to play becuase of the customaztions options like the sydanas which are cool looking scarfs but cost platinum(real money) or a skin. if you dont care about time consuming or the looks of your character and just want to have fun this game is ment for you :d",2
"this is one of those games that clearly should not be a free2play. it simply doesnt fit. what could have been an awesome futuristic dungeon lootn shoot for the co-operative gamer is in a fact an endless grind designed to put you in a world where you are constantly shown products like guns n toons that you could have now if you pull out your credit card, go on, go on buy it! why wait years its right here! ok you go and be back packed another round see how you feel after that. as i said it could have been a nice game with a nice reward system but instead, playing this game makes me like im being deliberately incovenienced into paying and paying and paying. to that i say thanks but no thanks",1
"one of the best free2play games out there, hands down.",1
"warframe is a brilliant style, and in its unusualness, it creates nice and smooth gameplay. it is always bieng updated so it always feels new. the only propblem is sometimes when you go in a random group, people will refuse to help, but this does not happen to much once you reach the later levels.",1
"robot ninjas in space killing the clones of clones, why else do i need to recommned this game?",1
"fun game, best with friends. graphics are nice for a free game. no reason u shouldnt download and try it out",1
"incredibly fun, like a mix space, and ninjas. dare i say, space ninjas. you are the tenno, a race of organisms that have been in cryosleep for a long time. when the factions of the grinneer, the corpus, and the infested start to overtake the solar system and its outlying planets the tenno have been awakened by the lotus, the mainframe for tenno communication and status, to stop them in their tracks. for a free to play game, unlike many that have tons of microtransactions, this game has 0% of pay to win. all items in this game can be acquired through effort and playtime, and yes, some grinding. it has a fun playstyle and its playerbase is incredibly helpful and supportive of new players. its environment gets slightly boring in a short time, but you get a small respite in certain planets, like earth. along with void missions, derelict missions, nightmare mode, and invasions/alerts. this game definitely has replayability. if you are a player who loves getting achievements and 100% a game then this game will not be for you unless you have the apt amount of time to give it. it does take a long time to get certain things, and some of the items you get are completely random to the point where you will need other player help, but based on the solo difficulty the game was obviously never meant to be played 100% solo.",2
"this is one of the best games ever!!! the best part is..... its free!!!",1
"bery pun and addicting!if you like having pun and playing as space ninjas, then this is the game for you!and its free, (except the platinum, guns, melee weapons and such... but dont worry, the weapons are..umm.... very cheap! you may even be loki enough to get half off platinum as login rewards. but its an exciting and an adventurous game.. just dont be annoying to others play nice and have fun,,, by pressing switch teleport constantly.... thats the best way to just do it! or nike.that too! warframe can be a little squishy at first but after a bit of practice and ranking, it will get easier! i reccomend being loki using mk1 bratton for gun!!! its the best to weapon to go for! ecspeciall when you add ammo drum to it! you will be invisible! remember, say no to drugs kids! and whatever you do.......press  alt f4  during your game when your hosting. its a cheat that turns you into rage mode :)",2
"a very good game, after you get levels up with one of the three starting frames you can work on getting other war frames and weapons to help enhance your arsenal and increase the amount of fun you get each mission. want a weapon that punctures through enemies and sticks em to a wall when you kill em? you can get that. want to cut enemies in half and listen to thier dying screams as you tear apart thier ship in an effort to complete your goal? you can do that. want to be a pirate/space ninja that can wall run? you can do that to. all in all, i really enjoy this game and if you can find a friend or two, or more and set up a clan/guild youre garunteed to have a blast.",2
"for a 3rd person, innovated and well designed. worth a try.",5
"this is a sexy 3rd person future ninja type of shooter. it is fast paced and requires skill and teamwork. the multiplayer workes well. a system of constant upgrades, weapons and abilitiess along with steam rewards make it worthwile and keeps you wanting more. not the smoothest platform, but i think they will continue to work out the kinks. definetly a killer free game. highly recommended. _desperado",2

"the concept of the game is cool, graphics are nice, playing with friends is good and all... but! it gets tiring quickly due to its lack of variety in stages, enemies, modes etc etc. if you are looking for a game to stick with, this is not for you. however, the game is free so its fun to just jump in and play with friends once in a while!",1
"ive been playing this game since beta firstly came out as f2p, and game was good then but really boring, no trading, few warframes, a lot of bugs and i still got till 30th lvl before ive decided to stop. few days ago few mates and me saw it on steam and install it again, i found my old acc and started playing again. game is awesome now. the amount of bugs they cleared, stuff in stores, game mods, lvls, optimtizations and basicly gave mostly what people asked for, they are active on forums, answering q&a and very helpfull. love their blogs in which they love to tease and give people news about stuff they are working on etc. get it, great game, much fun, if you have few friends, start a clan and fight.",1

"so here is the deal. warframe is aweful. honestly 0/10 would not play. maybe... maybe 2/10 cuz swords. other than that this game is lame. you force yourself to play a few hours, however, becuase it has gotten higher ratings than some of your favorite games. so youre in around ten hours, and you get to your first level 30 weapon. you have since then purchased and/or found other weapon parts and intended to build a superior weapon to the weapon you currently have. you give it a shot and holy dear lord is it good. and it felt pretty satisfying coming out of the 12 or 24 hour oven (foundry). so you play with that for a while and have a decent amount of fun. so okay, games not great, maybe a 5/10. at least its free. but, becuase this new weapon is pretty good, you want to see what else is on the horizon. rinse and repeat until about 40 hours when you realize that youve covered most of the starchart and have a few good weapons. rinse and repeat until you can take down anything in the starchart very fast. rinse and repeat until you can take out the stalkler in one hit with a meelee weapon. rinse and repeat until you can last to 45 mins + on t4 survival. etc., etc., ,etc. 10/10 god tier game. would recommend (even dropping cash on teh game) tl;dr graph of y = x where x is how much you play and y is your desire to play",3
"i have a positive opinion of warframe. you can have access to missions thanks to higher level players, an there is a huge range of customizations for your avatar/warframe. i also want to point out that u can have multiple warframes in order to experiment which is the best for your kind of playing style. its really good and i strongly recommend it!",7
"completely rehauled game, and to top it up, its optimised too! love the graphics, the gameplay and fighting experience too. recommened for ones with sci-fi fighter feel.",1

"if you want to be a freaking space ninja with guns, and have stealth elements this is the game for you",1
"its a amazing and wonderful game, full of action, adventure, and that splash of violence that just makes it great. though in the first few days or months (depending how much you play) it is difficult, mainly in money and resources, but that will soon end, and best of all, you dont have to worry that much about upgrading, since all warframes have unique abilities and traits to decide on! so i would definitly recomend this game, but for people who dont like 3rd-person view, space travel guns, lazers, swords, bows, robots, and ninjas!!!, turn your head and find a different game.",1

"- story - they were called tenno. warriors of blade and gun: masters of the warframe armor. those that survived the old war were left drifting among the ruins. now they are needed once more. the grineer, with their vast armies, are spreading throughout the solar system. a call echoes across the stars summoning the tenno to an ancient place. they summon you. allow the lotus to guide you. she has rescued you from your cryostasis chamber and given you a chance to survive. the grineer will find you; you must be prepared. the lotus will teach you the ways of the warframes and the secrets to unlocking their powers. come tenno, you must join the war. i think in my opinion is one of the best f2p games i ever played.it has: weapons, space ninjas, archwing, character costumization, santinels, your very own pet (called kubrow) and more. the best advice i can give you is: take your time and dont buy everything you see on market.almost everything you see there can be created/optained through hard wark and patience. i definitely recommend this game to anyone that is looking for this kind of games...thats it, now excusie me, i need to get back and save the humanity.",6
"want destiny? play this instead, save yourself $60",1
"most graphicaly detailed mmo ive ever seen. love the game play. having a sword and bow in space is a fun new spin. i found that the mouse sensitivety is more sensetive than a menstrating teenage girl who was just dumped on prom night, even after i turned it down almost to zero. this gives the illision of extreme lag which can piss you off. everything is also shaped weird, as in enemies and such. like there armor is plated over bursting tummours which have serverly deformed them, but this keeps the game interestin and fresh. runs pretty smoothly.",1
"i heard this game was repetetive and even early on i can see how people say that, but it looks like theres a lot of depth to it and its interesting enough im gonna keep playing for a while.",1
"this game..is awesome. everything can be crafted in game without using real money, it will just take a lot of farming, but hey, that adds to the longevity of the game. plus it gives you a chance to level up your warframe and gear. i find it alot of fun. at first i thought this game sucked cause i didnt understand it. give is a try and look up on thi excelent community wiki if you ever have questions. i hope to see you in game :)",2

"very exiting game, very fun and it plays very nicely. 10/10.",1

"warframe is a brilliant game, many alternative fighting styles, and so many mods and items. try not to put money into this game, get in good with high level characters and forge your playing style, and the prices of platinum are a rip-off. warning: do not play this game because of the current update since it stops all game use for windows 8 and up users.",4
"game is very addicting, downloaded it on a whim from a friend who played the game occasionally. was slow to start, but now i have spent over 90 hours and counting in it. there is a lot of grinding in it unless you want to drop some dough. however, the grinding is enjoyable and there is almost always someone to play with. the enjoyable gameplay along with the constant updates and additions make this one of my favorite f2p games of all time and i dont feel pressured to drop a lot of money on it, even though i will occasionally make a purchase here or there. 9/10",2
"nice addictive fast pve fps (with some pvp sites) with tons of possibilities by using an upgradeable cards system for your extra skills in warframe or your weapons. including a crafting system and some customization to make yourself unique.",1

"roughtly, this game is metroid meets team fortress 2. but actually in a deeper sense, or actually in my disturbed mind, the tennos are the metaphor for the perfect society, the grineers are the metaphor of the communists, the corpus are the metaphor of the capitalists, the infected are the metaphor of the anarchists and the corrupted are probably some revoluting people that join force from everywhere across the world. twisted logic.",2
"awesome but should tell you more information and needs more story",3
"warframe is one of the best 3rd person shooters ive ever played. it gets updates almost every week. its free. is massively multiplayer or you can by your self. theres warframes unlike any others. endless modding possiblities. overalll i give this game a 10/10 :d",1
"this is a fun co-op game that you can play with your friends",10
"really fun game. you can get almost every thing in game by farming. not pay to play like a lot of other games. the lore is still in the works so you cant expect too much but its still pretty good. farming and levelling up weapons and warframes is really fun too and at times, challenging. 7.8/10",7
"i really, really enjoy warframe. combat wise, if youve ever played the multiplayer maps in mass effect 3 it is very similar. if you enjoy being able to customize your characters look and abilties, youll very much enjoy this game. the developers are also constantly pushing out new updates that have a fair amount of content/improvements to the game. now the game is still technically in open beta, and while most professional reviewers have pointed that out, their reviews are also from fairly early public builds of the game. a lot has changed in the past 5 updates or so, i really think the game needs to be revisited. the game can be challenging, or you can stride through battle slaughtering countless foes as easily as chewing gum. the choice is up to you, various game modes and varying difficulties can all be chosen by the player. while the game is free to play, and you can earn in game credits to buy and build new and more powerful gear, throwing the developers som cash can help speed the process a bit. plus, i think the devs deserve just a bit for producing something that has given me so many hours of enjoyment, easily taking hours away from my beloved wife... ...sorry honey! so give this game a go, if youre looking for beautiful graphics, fun fast paced combat, and an ever evolving game, you wont be disappointed! suit up tenno, war is calling!",2
"the decision to play this game is to give up on reality. bugs, glitches, horrible pubbies and the nosiest lady in the world will be the order of the day. that does not automatically mean that this game is bad, because it absolutely isnt for a f2p game this is the one i had the most fun with. all the weapons and warframes can be bought in the ingame store, but can also be found while playing the only things that can not be found ingame are vanity items. every update is a new adventure, what will break next? will the ui break again or will the loot table be topsy turvy again. who knows? try it out, play untill you atleast get a different warframe other than the starter ones and you will be alright.",4
"havent played in a while but, i can say this much; even before all the newer updates it was a wonderfully fast paced action game in which the missions were sensably logical and well thought out in design, now even though i havent played in so long i would still most definitely recommend this game. i bet all the money in my wallet that more than half of the people that read this will enjoy warframe especially since all the new updates. thanks for taking the time to read this short little blurb and im serious, enjoy this game or i will find you and i will make you play it and i will make you enjoy it whether you like it or not. jk (for those of you that thought i was serious :p)",1
"this game is amazing! it has a super long campaign and tons of customization options. the only downside is having to use real money for stuff but you can unlock it through cards yet it takes a lot of farming.",1
"this is one of the best games ive played. take an hour and play it. you never know what you expect and youre tempted to go further and further, and so you realize that the game is so addictive that you are not to go to work: p",1
"words can not describe how amazing this game is download and start playing today it is amazing",1
"this game haz guns and swords and people shooting and swording so i think its a pretty good game if you like swording people in half/3 pieces. i like 3 pieces of chicken but not always. i like it spicy. also this game has robots but you kill them and they are hard. they have guns. robots are cool.",1
"this game, my god, this game. its the best free game ive ever played. its just absolutely amazing.",1
"awesome game with friends, graphics amazing, special affects make it seem its coming out of a science fiction movie",8
"a lot of fun with friends. good payment system. 160 hours, and i only spent $20 with plat to spare. it can be repetitive, but its fun. its one of the few games where ive enjoyed the grind. it kept me interested and i was happy to work towards new warframes and weapons. once i got all the weapons and warframes i wanted though, i did stop playing. there wasnt anything end game to keep me going. but if you got friends to play with, its a good time.",2
"honestly one of the best, free to play games out there. sure you can pay to win... but! you dont have to! which is great.",4
"very interesting for a free2play game! nice short history plot even if its still in development! really fun to play and you have a huge variation of character and you can build the one is suitable for your game style. even if it still has a few bugs and problems, i love the game! 9/10",10
"its fun and all. can get a little repetitive when you have to grind insanely for something, but its need for grinding is what makes it fun. you have to spend time into this game. you cant just leap into the highest level in a short time. everything has build timers and as i said, the grinding can be insane. i recommend this game if you have alot of time to spend or if you simply want to have some fun with friends. granted, the game has its occaisional glitch and internet connectivity issues. but its still a fun game to play.",1
"this is the best game. love it. just keep your wallet locked up and youll be fine.",7
"quite a fun game from the start i highly recomend that you get this free to play game right now trust me its the best!!!!",1
"in the grim future of the 41st millenium there is only grind! this aside its quite a fun game, beautiful and stable, and the devs regularly add new things. i liked it.",1

"good game but lacks a very needed campaign and story.",10
"you just have to play this game, its pretty addictive, and have space ninjas, what else do you want? well there is more, infinite farming maps plenty of bosses, plant of customization options, if you like ninjas and stuff, you just have to play it :)",2
"highly addicting game! everything can be earned in game without spending money! this is a true free to play game and i recommend this game to everyone! come and become a tenno!",8
"well, here is my recommendation i guess.... this game is amazing, it ... unlike most games ive recommended , actually deserves its game title.its so much fututistic war rather than a moder warfare type dealio. so theres my recommendation to this here awsum game!!! :d enjoy it!!!!!",1
"warframe is a great game. for some people. i am one of those people. this game is very innovative, because of the way it takes mmo, and mashs it with a single-player game. the controls are nice and accessible, and are also easy to learn. i myself, use a xbox controller for many games. the xbox controls for this game is also nice and feels good. the special effects is phenomenel. it looks amazing if you have a good computer. i love the wayu you can slide while shooting, use a sword to decapitate and how eye-popping it looks on my monitor. so yes, i would extremely recommend this game to another.",1
"an interesting game so far.its based on teamwork,which is crucial in this game.you cant simply go rambo on enemies like call of duty,cause you would get gangraped.you also need tactics,such as sneaking and covering behind objects.i reccomend it and wait more people to come play with me.",1
"this game is really awesome. like mass effect 3 multiplayer without the redundency and the headaches. i dont want to say too much or all about the game because that ruins the fun. the plastyle is basicly a co-op shooter grinding fest. so go grab a few buddies and kill some .",2
"warframe is a fun and busy game. never a dull moment once you are in a mission. one of my favorite things about warframe is the foundry. the foundry is where you can make warframes and gear with the materials you have found throughout the game. makes you feel like you have accopmplished something and you get to show off what you made.",1
"the only game in earth to suggest tentacle-porno-hentai with hydroid (warframe). if you want to spend all of your sadness and madness of your daily routine which must be really , play this game and you will become even worse than before. btw of the p2p aspect of the game, just play with some gays who are hl and they should help you surpass all of your dificulties in your life. 1/20",7
"this games has swords... swords are cool and stuff so yeah get this game. if you want to, i really dont care either way.",1
"it has swords! nothing else to say about this have other than that its awesome. although it is a free to play game its not pay to win, the vast majority of items in game you can get without spending a cent or a penny in real life. it just takes a little time and determination. exceptions are ofcourse items that make your warframe look better and colors (if you play it youll see). it is worth at least a try and if you get hooked on it dont blame me :d its certainly not a game for all, but for those that like melee weapons, this game is for you.",1
"my favorite free to play game. third person run and coop and shooty stuff. excellent controls, lots of free form wall running and ledge climbing built right in seamlessly.",2
"i honestly love the game to bits. if i were able to give it a star rating, id give it a 5/5. although im very impatient and i dont like the 2 day wait to build warframes, i still love the game. give it a go if you havent played it! its really fun!",3
"grind! grind! grind! thats what you might think. but honestly, it only takes a few hours of life leech to get another warframe. otherwise? enjoy the randomly generated levels and repetitive gameplay. its not very bad, but if you cant find a purpose within all the hours of gameplay, it might not be for you. oh, and despite the graphics, it runs quite smoothly.",1
"the best free2play game today. 3rd person shooter with amazing graphics and gameplay. it is not pay2win unless you have money to buy things instantly but you can still have the full experience without paying. you must try this game out if you dont have it or never tried it. i would rate this game 9/10, because the only thing i dont like about the game, is that its all about grinding and sometimes feels repetitve. if you play with friends, its more enjoyable. you dont even need a gaming computer for this, my laptop with intell 4000 graphic card can handle this game on low settings. dont look at the metascore, it doesnt deserve below 70/100.",5
"this is an awesome game, but the gore gets in the way of the screen alot.",2
"good game but takes a bit of getting use too but fun",1
"this is a greate game wen u are bored and want to shoot somthing",5
"a good game, but you have to grind for alot of stuff.",2
"very nice awesome gameplay and its very entertaining when playing with friends!",1
"great game. lots and lots of fun with your friends. only negative side i found about this game is the repetitive missions. you are going to be doing same things over and over again, just on another place. but still, they change something, and game is still pretty new, so take that in mind. updates are going to come out, so be sure to check this game out.",1
"great fun, slick and smooth. really comes into its own after a few hours play as you can get into customising your warframe(s) and weapons. (and by then youll have some idea how to go about setting up your frame and weapon modifications.) metacritic scores dont do this game justice - they were all given out by reviews made when the game was in early beta. it was pretty good then, its better now. top quality alien shooter action. the criticism i hear levelled at this game time and again is that its not completely free to play. you do need to put a little bit of money into it for slots for new weapons and warframes and probably for items called orokin reactors which increase how many modifications you can load into your setup. in addition to this, while it is possible to get pretty much anything in the game through playing it, you have to repeat the same mission ad nauseum if you want to get all of the components for one warframe or item right away. i think a number of people who are giving it the highest praise are the people willing to drop some real dollar into the game to purchase items from time to time. in this way, and if youre a collector, you could easily spend a great deal of cash. nevertheless, the core gameplay is slick, itll cost you nothing to play it perfectly adequately for a few days and it has throat-singing in its soundtrack. try it, its free.",3
"space ninjas? yes please, and not as grindy as other free-to-plays.",6
"id say this is a good game of wwii for you fans of military stuff!",1
"i really like warframe like really, i love being loki and i love sprinting around at the speed of sound heres where warframe sucks: theres nothing to do at least there used to be, now theres conclave where you can pvp 2v2 i havent tried it yet apparantly it might be fun??????? but really theres not much to spend credits on, unless you like grinding for other warframes?????? (but what if you already like the warframe you have? what do i sink creds into then, consumables?????? [yea rite]) warframe suffers from being a free to play forevergame it needs a campaign with a plotline that you can follow and play along with, not just complete the solar system + do alarts",2
"warframe is very pretty, and extremely enjoyable, but only for the first hour. it requires a lot of grinding to get hardly anywhere.",1
"nice game its had a lot of good updates it has been improved greatly if you played it when it first came out and didnt like it try it again. you might find you like it so much more stuff.",3

"lets see warframe its a sci-fi game with exosuits (space-ninjas) fighting the ugly bad guys. well you can basiclly buy almost anything in the cash shop, including cosmetics. this game is immensly fun with friends, and trying out the amazing weapons, there are katanas, whips, laser guns, shotguns, freeze rays, and many more. now the maps are the same, and can feel repetitve, because it is, although some of the levels look really cool... well compared to the other maps. now the gameplay could range to really boring to really fun, that depends on what weapons you using and how you use them. now the warframes are the exosuits the players can wear, it gives them special powers, like jumping high, iron skin, healing, and mind control. getting warframes can be very difficult, and that brings me to my next point, the learning curv is very steep so you need to watch youtube videos on how to play properly, thes game is also very difficult so if you like that then good. so in the end, do i recommend this game? well if you like what youve seen here then go play this, if this turnes you off, then you can try it i guess. so i personally enjoyed this game immensly, but i didnt let that get in the way of the recommendation of this game. this review is just my opinion.",8
"(review may be subject to changes as the games still in beta) + no paywalls. a very important thing in a f2p game. + the games fun. + fluid combat and movement. + good graphics. + lots of weapons to choose from. - the entire game is a grindfest. the only goal in this game is to increase your mastery rank and get more weapons to grind with. amazing. - no dedicated servers with high bandwidth and pc performance requirements for hosting. this turns most public games into unenjoyable lagfests. - ridiculous cash shop prices on warframes and weaponry. - major balance issues with all equipment in the game, especially with new weapon releases. which essentially is power creep. - no variety. - no real difficulty. most of it is just artificial difficulty with stat increases. - community lacks brain cells. - terrible pvp. yes, pvp is just a thing that was added because everyone asked for it and its definitely not the focus of the game, but that doesnt mean i cant criticize it. - nonexistent ai. - no endgame content. warframe has had a lot of potential which it showed back in early open beta. however, the game has taken a turn for the worse with more and more grinding and power creep put into it. its a fun game to play at first, but as you progress and increase your mastery rank, you will notice that the only thing youre doing is grinding your  off. 75/100",1
"theres a part in the game where you need to get a kubrow pet ( dog kinda things) and you need to kill them, destroy their home, take their egg, and then hatch that egg until that kubrow becomes youre sex slave. 10/10 best game ever",1
"warframe is a cooperative online third person free to play action game presenting wonderful gameplay, graphics quality and action involving space ninja-bots.this game is currently in beta but it is generally a ps4 game.it is becoming more wonderful game on steam with every updates and it is an addictive game..so, i will recommend this game to every player on steam.. :)",2
"proof that metascores dont matter. like roger eberts opinion on movies. you can choose to play the game and enjoy it, or like the critics you can give it a 67 without even recording 1 hour of playing time.",3
"this game has a great potential, not the best game out there but a very good one! 7.5/10",1
"this game is amazing for a free to play and the only bug that i have found is that once in excavation the scanner stayed at 100% power and the drill wouldnt spawn, but apart from that and a few clan dojo glitches the game runs really well 10/10.",2
"warframe is an amazing game for emphasizing your playstyle, each weapon is suited to a specific playstyle, or adaptive to make it fit your playstyle, this also can be said about the warframes themselves. mods further enhance playstyle to the very elements you want to fire out of your gun! while it is a grind, after that first loadout is bought and you have a new melee, primary, and secondary weapon, it becomes a game of using awesome mods and unique effects for each gun to mow down hundreds of enemies in different ways, using abilities lets you master the flow of combat. another thing great about this game is the animations, while they are triggered by player use on some, which can be a bit sudden, all animations look so smooth, and each weapon even has unique combos, stealth kills, finishers, and so on. i would highly recommend this game to anyone, and its ftp, but not necessarily ptw, the developers themselves said that everything in the game (besides color packs and excalibur prime, the donator frame) is obtainable for free. grinding to get a new weapon can be fun with friends, and the combat is so satisfying most of the time.",5
"the game is a lot of fun but repetitive so it can get boring fast. its a lot more fun if you play with friends so that its less boring. at a certain point progressing does require you to pay for more weapon or frame slots. if you dont then you will have to trash , remake and lvl up what you already have to continue progressing your rank. lucky the slots arent expensive.",6
"while fun, the game has three free classes to pick in the begining. the other classes are avalible with by use real world money to buy in game points to obtain the other classes; with the most expensive ones being about 20$. wareframe plays exceptionaly well, and is just plain fun; especially with other players/your friends. however, because wareframe is free the majority of the gameplay is essentially pay-to-win due to the better items and other classes being available through the use of real world money. thats not to say that wareframe is a bad game, because its not, but this one aspect is enough to be a huge turn-off for some people.",1
"this game is amazing by visuels graphics everything about it is awesome, a must get now!",1
"super fun game. but its quite an odd concept. ever wondered how weird baseball is to someone whos never played it? that idea is a lot like this. cool game though.",1
"would you happen to be a fan of ninja? maybe a fan of space? perhaps you are one of the refined few that have a developed taste for space ninja? well, i have great news for you. warframe is a space ninja game where you play as a space ninja and use your wide array of ninjitsushis like sudoku and guns to combat fierce enemies like space marines with genetic defects and isaac clarkes extended family, as well as a dense strain of the dreaded hepatitis b. you can play with your friends, and can perform a number of exciting tasks such as raiding spaceships to steal your enemys money and trading cards, running and jumping on the walls like a hyperactive primate, and murder. s good, play it.",5
"dead space meets samuris with superpowers. best in co-op.",8
"how to start... well, warframe is an action/fps/hack n slash game so addictive at the beginning, you will be surprised of the amazing and funny gameplay and method to obtain the stuff, its easy, its attractive, its fast, its cooperative, etc, you will be interested in being more powerfull with better mods/weapons/warframes, etc, later you will have a feel that its a bit repetitive the gameplay, then the absence of a decent vs multiplayer mode (like; capture the flag, deathmatch, control points, king of the hill, etc) will make you feel a void in your soul, then you will feel a lil disappointed when you realize wf in some cases is too p2w, and etc etc... afterall, seeing that wf is still on develop, you will say that is not that bad, when you have your mates there; its an amazing game to play and always it will make you go deep on it and having you playing more and more, obtaining what you want to obtain because its true, you can obtain the 90% of the stuff without pay (certainly, slots system is a bit abusive) and with all of this in mind you will say ok, lets try again to see if the boss finally drop the blueprint? :) and you will repeat this again and again... 9/10",7
"great game to play with friends! very diverse character builds and awesome animation!",1
"shld i download it? yea u should ,pretty amazing game <3",1
"warframe has improved so much from its humble beginnings but has shown so much improvement simply due to the receptive and ambitious nature of its developer. its a great squad based pve combat shooter that keeps things interesting with a pleatura of frames (characters) and weapons. the in game upgrade system utilizes in-game found mods that lets players pick and choose how to custimize said frames and playstyle. the environments and enemies can get old after a while and it can feel a bit grindy at times but implementation of trading, in game events and clan dojos have kept things fresh enough to keep me coming back for more.",3
"this is fun co-op game, would reccommend to my friends.",1
"this game is better than doat 2 or lol so :d get this instead!",4
"an awesome game for everybody. the game is getting updated frequently, and has lots of content. its free to play so i dont actually know why you are reading this review, just download and try it out, im sure youll love it!",1
"big recommendation: warframe is a bad- 3rd-person co-op shooter and hack & slash game offering an amazing (and refreshing) variety of play-styles, influential & fluid skill builds, challenging game mechanics, randomly generated levels, hordes of foes that will test your metal and spectacular graphics (surprisingly highly optimized). this game is literally an amalgam of the best elements of the fps and rpg genres, all in one tightly bound package. ffs who doesnt love space ninjas!!!",8
"youtube game footage does not look as nice as the actual game. if you have a high end machine, just try the game out and you wont be disappointed.",7
"warframe is a good sci-fi co-op mission game which has promising potential to be a great game but right now contains many annoying bugs which need to be fixed for it to be great. there is still much more room for improvement such as the user interface and animation set. if the developers can fix some basic issues, they will potentially have one of the best games of its genre. right now, i give this game in september 2014 a 7/10.",7

"it is fun but very challenging then i thought it would be",1

"i do wholeheartly recommend this game, spent a good few hundred hours on it off of steam. tis all i can say.",3
"you need a pretty good computer to run this game smoothly",1
"this game is cool, but is a resource hog to be sure, i know its still in beta, but it takes a monster pc rig to run it in highest settings, but it still looks nice enough in lower rez + medium settings if you turn a few things off... it controls nice enough with an x360 for win pad + it lets you remap the buttons... its a photo realistic game so it looks awesome, since its f2p d/l it, & give it a try.",1
"* puts on horsemask*** * i love it! 10/10 ***nb: there is no horsemask in game, 1/10.",4
"if you like shooting guns, slashing aliens in half, throwing kunai in their face spliting it in two which is only about 99% of the male population like doing. and if you havent started downloading warframe by now did i mention its free? so lets recap slashing aliens, shooting guns, throwing kunai like a boss, and doing all that with your friends for free. sounds good to me. and did i mention there are a tons of weapons i havent even seen 10% of them",1
"awesome game theme (ninjas with massive arsenals), smooth gameplay & controls, and an interesting storyline. two thumbs up for this game!",1
"i absolutely love this game. its very versatile and open to pretty much anything you want to do with it; whether you put money into it or not. its a third-person shooter, which is probably why i love it so much. id definitely recommend this as one of the best free-to-play games available on steam.",2
"great game, awesome graphics , good story line the game moves at the pace you want it and the game will teach you the basics of how to play the game youll get easily caught up playing with friends for hours at a time 10/10 score from me.",1
"the storyline isnt exactly in depth, and there are a few (minor) bugs. however, warframe is a fantastic creation and a very pleasant game to share with friends. a friend of mine constantly told me to download it. when he finally bugged me enough, i downloaded it and played it for the rest of the night. now we have a group of about 5+, made entirely of personal friends. the game can be challenging, even with a full squad (of 4), but the way the game is balanced to feature all playstyles works well with my group! for a free game, warframe can be played without purchase quite easily! ill admit, about $20 makes the run a little more fun, but you can function without the use of money very well! i cant wait to see this game in the future! excellent game!",2
"this game is amazing! have played for a while and will continue to play! every update brings new, fresh content in a unique style of play not found in any other game! the one problem is learning to play the game. the tutorial could use some inprovement, but aside from that the game is flawless! 10/10 side note: if you are struggling to learn something there is a lot of support provided on the games forums and within the game in various different chat channels.",2
"this game has everything that a person wants. fricken ninjas in space, dogs killing people, swords, guns, badass warframes and for the guys, sexualize warframes that will probably give them rageboners. im just saying.",1
"so here is the deal. warframe is aweful. honestly 0/10 would not play. maybe... maybe 2/10 cuz swords. other than that this game is lame. you force yourself to play a few hours, however, becuase it has gotten higher ratings than some of your favorite games. so youre in around ten hours, and you get to your first level 30 weapon. you have since then purchased and/or found other weapon parts and intended to build a superior weapon to the weapon you currently have. you give it a shot and holy dear lord is it good. and it felt pretty satisfying coming out of the 12 or 24 hour oven (foundry). so you play with that for a while and have a decent amount of fun. so okay, games not great, maybe a 5/10. at least its free. but, becuase this new weapon is pretty good, you want to see what else is on the horizon. rinse and repeat until about 40 hours when you realize that youve covered most of the starchart and have a few good weapons. rinse and repeat until you can take down anything in the starchart very fast. rinse and repeat until you can take out the stalkler in one hit with a meelee weapon. rinse and repeat until you can last to 45 mins + on t4 survival. etc., etc., ,etc. 10/10 god tier game. would recommend (even dropping cash on teh game) tl;dr graph of y = x where x is how much you play and y is your desire to play",3
"really bad game u cant be black without color pack. i r8 0/8 bad b8 m8. racist!!!!!!!! cant be an eraser so bad 0/8. how too be racist warframe",1
"a really, really good game with beautiful graphics, although the grinding is really strong it rewards you with tons of guns, melee weapons, warframes and lots of other stuffs. it is one of the better free2play games right now and doesnt need any money to be spend on to be good. you just need a lot of time... like really a lot of time.",4

"warframe it can be grindy at many points but not as much as other games great concept, missions do get repetative amazing graphics space ninjas good community responsive dev-team, always try to be on top of bugs/bug-fixes love the game i rate 9/10 because of the grinding",1
"be a space ninja and planet hop a dystopian solar system while grinding your face to the ground to climb the mastery ranks! be warned as this is a game which is better with friends. youre gonna have a bad time running solo, so get with some friends and play this game. if you dont have any friends that dont play it/dont want to play it, then youre ed. overall, i very much approve.",3

"i started playing on friday, by the time i went to sleep on sunday i had 50 hours played, so yea theres that.",2
"combine mass effect with diablo, add some ninjas, and warframe is what comes out. structured around 4-man instanced missions, warframe has a large variety of map objectives with random secondaries being added during the mission. overall, the randomization is pretty strong, piecing together gigantic levels that are easy to get lost in. exploration is rewarded with rare mats, bonus cash, and exp for all your equipment. the leveling system doesnt increase the stats of your gear but instead how many mods you can slot into your equip (and how strong); combined with a low level cap of 30 (for each gear piece), its easy for new players to jump in while veterans are rewarded with stronger mods. everything in the cash shop, apart from skins & colors, are purchasable in game or are craftable. my only major complaint right now is that the environment variety is a bit slim. overall, warframe is a well balanced third person shooter with tons of customization and replay value.",10

"very good game indeed, hours of fun alone or in co-op mode",7
"im going to sum up this game as simply as possible. it is a repetitive, grindy game. you should know this going in. do not expect a massive variation in what you do. now the fun stuff a parkour system - wallrunning, sliding, flips, vaulting, all that cool stuff while firing guns 4-player co-op (its not an mmo.) a good f2p model (only stuff that you have to spend real money on are cosmetics - weapons can be crafted using resources gained from missions and blueprints bought from the market for credits.) gun modding and stuff (customise your gun to make it more effective against specific enemies, or just make it set people on fire. clans (guilds, armies, whatever you want to call it. you share a dojo, a communal map that you all build which allows you to unlock exclusive clan-tech weapons. adorable sentinels (they fly around above your shoulder and shoot stuff. they are adorable.) 9.6/10 - not bad (ign) goty",6

"this game sucked up all of my time, and is pretty much the defining game of my college experience. anytime i play a game, i play warframe. super addicting, but in a good way. time is definitely money in this game, and often the majority of your time is spent in crafting sweet new weapons and warframes. updates are constant, with new content being released often. if you love fast-paced ninjas sprinting around with superpowers shooting and slashing everything in their path, this games for you.",2
"third person tf2 with more grind than a cheese grater in switzerland.",2
"great game, played it on my other steam account heaps :)",1
"update 14 has really made the beginning of the game more playable. i would absolutely recommend it now. pros: lots of customizations you get to feel like you earned your new gear plenty of variety interesting gamemodes great opportunities for teamwork each update brings a brand new ui cons: crafting new stuff *sometimes* requires days of grinding crafting things also takes time (i.e. 12 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, etc) you only get a limited number of weapon and character slots people can pay to buy pretty much anything with real money, which sort of kills the sense of accomplishment for people who earned their gear",4
"space ninjas. need i say more? this is a freaking awesome game, i have been playing it since just after closed beta. they are really working hard on it and for it still being in beta -- its very playable. its free so i highly suggest downloading it and trying it if you are skeptical. like i said -- space ninjas.",4

"if you want to be a freaking space ninja with guns, and have stealth elements this is the game for you",1
"its a amazing and wonderful game, full of action, adventure, and that splash of violence that just makes it great. though in the first few days or months (depending how much you play) it is difficult, mainly in money and resources, but that will soon end, and best of all, you dont have to worry that much about upgrading, since all warframes have unique abilities and traits to decide on! so i would definitly recomend this game, but for people who dont like 3rd-person view, space travel guns, lazers, swords, bows, robots, and ninjas!!!, turn your head and find a different game.",1
"grinding and running simulator space ninjas with energy guns so much hate with laggs and crushes with weak notebook why love this game? qooo~",2

"- story - they were called tenno. warriors of blade and gun: masters of the warframe armor. those that survived the old war were left drifting among the ruins. now they are needed once more. the grineer, with their vast armies, are spreading throughout the solar system. a call echoes across the stars summoning the tenno to an ancient place. they summon you. allow the lotus to guide you. she has rescued you from your cryostasis chamber and given you a chance to survive. the grineer will find you; you must be prepared. the lotus will teach you the ways of the warframes and the secrets to unlocking their powers. come tenno, you must join the war. i think in my opinion is one of the best f2p games i ever played.it has: weapons, space ninjas, archwing, character costumization, santinels, your very own pet (called kubrow) and more. the best advice i can give you is: take your time and dont buy everything you see on market.almost everything you see there can be created/optained through hard wark and patience. i definitely recommend this game to anyone that is looking for this kind of games...thats it, now excusie me, i need to get back and save the humanity.",6
"want destiny? play this instead, save yourself $60",1
"most graphicaly detailed mmo ive ever seen. love the game play. having a sword and bow in space is a fun new spin. i found that the mouse sensitivety is more sensetive than a menstrating teenage girl who was just dumped on prom night, even after i turned it down almost to zero. this gives the illision of extreme lag which can piss you off. everything is also shaped weird, as in enemies and such. like there armor is plated over bursting tummours which have serverly deformed them, but this keeps the game interestin and fresh. runs pretty smoothly.",1

"warframe is the best game i played so far on steam ! it has amazing graphich and the best gameplay that is evolveing every day.but it has repetiv ad that is its only downfall.but when you surpass that its amazing.you can chose betvine 100 weapons(fireing and meele) and dosens of sutis with their uniq powers!!! so log in and have fun",7
"well... after more than 400 hours of playing this on steam and another 200 of playing on their louncher, i can say that the game got me. though it gets repetitive, if you can look over that and become part of the community, youll never get bored of it.",7

"warframe isnt like every fps or third person shooter game, its based in the future or whatever the  its based in with some aliens or mutants or something, where you can use your sword to cut ppl in half, slice and dice, or shoot peoples heads off, pew pew. p.s hugs 5$",1
"i think this is the best game i have ever played i usally finsh a long game in a about 300 hours but this game i have nearly got 400 hours into it and im not even a quater way through it is a great game for users that like sci-fi third person shooters well you dont even have to be into sci-fi to play this game.",7

"one of the best free to plays i think i have ever played including demos and mods. and to those who say its pay to win. dont listen to them they are just trolling the review its actually quite balanced. first 3 free classes are some of the most powerful ones. now if you want to spend $10 usd than go ahead get a new class. but all you are buying is a completly diffrent skill set. all classes have their own uniqe play style so do youre homework and look them up on the warframe website.",7
"this game is a completely epic mix of assasians creed, gears of war, and star wars. for anyone who cant picture that, it is a third person, co-op, own-the-bots, lazers-everywhere, space-ninja, and its free-to-play  well. all in one flippin amazing game. oh, ad the graphics are pretty nice too...",2

"space ninjas with magic. do you really need to know more? this is a really good game and i love how anything youd need to better your play style be it mods, warframes, or weapons, you can earn. where as the only thing you have to spend money on is asthetics like color pallets and syanadas. but of course if youre market savy you really dont need to spend money to get plat :p",7
"a good game, but you have to grind for alot of stuff.",2
"warframe, the ultimate free to play game. this game has brought me and my friends much fun from just defeating a unlimited amount of hordes that consist aliens known as either the corpus or grineer. while playing this game, i wondered why this game is for free? it has desired gameplay, good graphics, and incrediable looking weapons. as well while knowing that you can spend cash on items; its best not to, since you can already unlock after completeing certain objectives if your patient. for the designing company who made this, thank you, for my laptop is just lucky enough to play this apple of eden. an the only negatives i can see this game are that the game can get boring if your not fond of having to repeat the same goals - though ive come to understand that most games are, therefore i enjoy this game. 8.7/10",1
"the story is terrible, the graphics are good but not anything special, the gameplay is repetetive and requires a lot of grinding to get anywhere. however for some reason its my favourite game and i find it completely addictive, it might be the space ninja robots, it might the super fun movement system or vast array of weapons and characters, im not sure but i love it. 9/10!",5
"this game is really good, and not good good, but so good, it will explode your brain *dont take it too literally tho* its about you, a tenno, which will stand up, and kill everyone.. well, not everyone, but most of the enemies, including the grineer, so this game, is just a freerun run&gun magic game, interesting boss-fights, and new-player friendly, which is always good. it gives you the freedom of crafting your own gun, hence you got the blueprint and the required materials, which are sometimes hard to find, but sometimes as simple of killing everyone and farming the crap out of it :d the gameplay is hard to master in my opinion, as in the beginning, even if its new-player friendly, the running and shooting mechanics can be hard to master, but if you just put some time in it (sadly, i dont really have that much time for it because of real life stuff) it will get easier. its beautiful, with great graphich, and even a low-end pc can run it on low settings. overall, a great game, still some room for improvement on some parts of it, but, for the most of it, its an amazing game, worth the shot to play :)",1
"this is fun co-op game, would reccommend to my friends.",1
"ive been playing this game since beta firstly came out as f2p, and game was good then but really boring, no trading, few warframes, a lot of bugs and i still got till 30th lvl before ive decided to stop. few days ago few mates and me saw it on steam and install it again, i found my old acc and started playing again. game is awesome now. the amount of bugs they cleared, stuff in stores, game mods, lvls, optimtizations and basicly gave mostly what people asked for, they are active on forums, answering q&a and very helpfull. love their blogs in which they love to tease and give people news about stuff they are working on etc. get it, great game, much fun, if you have few friends, start a clan and fight.",1

"great game requiring skills which are easily developed once played for hours... although pvps system sucks, the overall game is just magnificent.",1
"this game..is awesome. everything can be crafted in game without using real money, it will just take a lot of farming, but hey, that adds to the longevity of the game. plus it gives you a chance to level up your warframe and gear. i find it alot of fun. at first i thought this game sucked cause i didnt understand it. give is a try and look up on thi excelent community wiki if you ever have questions. i hope to see you in game :)",2
"i love the graphics in this game for one, they put a lot of unneeded detail into this game, not quite as much detail for its generation as metroid 3, which still surpasses graphics in many games currently being created though it was for the wii. i also love the combat style, and really everything else. my only complaint is how annoying it is to unlock everything, however that annoyance makes this game fun.",1
"the short version: the best 3rd person shooter game ive played. 9.5/10 with very minimal pay 2 win elements, this game is bred for success. with elements from halo, assassins creed, and diablo, this game adds an exciting mixture of space combat, parkour, and looting. you buy blueprints to build various guns and items as your journey through procedurally generated levels where no playthrough is the same. though you grind, with friends and effort, your grinding will be fruitful. after 11.2 hours of gameplay today, i experienced bugs only on one level, which ive played easily 30 different worlds, each taking a nice variety of successes and failures, triumphs and losses. not only are there different levels, theres different game types. you can run into a place and your mission is to kill everyone, or to spy and gather intellegence, or assassinations where your try to take out a war master. more will be added in the future. thanks for reading, i hope to see you in game!",1
"this game is really engaging and offers endless hours of gameplay. what i really like about warframe is that you can choose everything you want to do, there is no set questline or mission that you have to follow in order to progress. i mean, who doesnt like space ninjas with guns?",6
"a true to free to play game-- this is probably going to be destiny for the steam box when it gets really going (lol, they have spaceships for your solider and drop you into combat). controller support is there for in gameplay and works really well, but you need a mouse and keyboard for some of the menus out of game. sigh, with just a couple of more tweaks full controller should work. play through is like boarderlands, a team goes against ai, grinds, etc. weapons are up to you to craft through a meta collectable card trade system. people trade online stuff, but i have yet to trade myself. community and finding matches is pretty awesome as of this review. free to play-- yes, its a full functional free to play game with an incredible solar system to explore. the story can keep you engaged, and the grinding is pretty intense. premium content 29.99 (steam) 49.99 (their site)-- i have no clue if its worth it, and i dont know where this game will be heading as how it handles the community and its content. still fun to play so far for free.",1
"space ninjas! theyre space ninjas! what other reason do you need?",3
"interesting game, i like the ninja aspect of how the game tries to show itself to players, and the graphics are really amazing!!",1
"this game is rad as all hell so like, youre a space ninja and you run around shooting bad guys with space guns. right so already this is mega-badass, but heres the thing, you get space shurikens. thats right son. cyber ninja stars. so alright youre sold but you gotta be saying this is too good to be true nope. you also get a sweet  ninja jetpack that lets you fly around in space, as a ninja, and shoot space baddies with your sweet space laser. for real. and its free.",2

"i r t3h ninja. 11/9 scratch that. this game is really fun but its a free2pay game (not play, pay!) you cant get anywhere unless you are either playing with friends or you spend a bunch of money on weapons that you dont need! like seriously people, spend your money on something wortwhile like a slurpee. even though its a pay to win game, it still has fun mechanics and gameplay and surprisingly good graphics. overall i give this a 7/10",1
"gets me almost as horny as ariana grandes break free.",1
"im up and down on this game at the moment, i have not played it since day one however i have played it enough to know what i am talking about. this game is a grind, and a serious one. im currently just about 2000 mastery points from level 7. to be honest, i dont like the mastery point system which is how you go up in level. it requires you to experience the game via (using new weapons, warframes, playing different nodes) in order to unlock more powerful weapons. in which case you are out in nodes playing for hours hoping you get the right items in oder to make your new weapons and warframes to go up in mastery level. the combat system is pretty plain, 3rd person shooter with some mobility perks, + 4 hotkey skills unique to each warframe in its own. when it comes to upgrading, youre hoping you get lucky to find the right upgrade that you need in order to make the right elemental combos or getting enough damage upgrade mods to be able to take on the higher tier enemies. if anything, if you want to play this game and you think it looks cool than by all means play it. if you do and you dont like it than thats how you feel do not let my opinion change your mind. its free, its not pay to win as everything you get in game can be aquired by playing the game. i have 300+ hours, i like it, spent about $100 on it, i enjoy it.",4

"if you have a pack of friends to go with you, this game will be a blast. everything is simple enough so you dont need to worry too much, but still complex enough so that you have room to learn to improve your gameplay and character build. movement is very well done and flows nicely. though, dont dive in expecting a grand story behind the game. warframe is a solid 8/10 game. for a f2p game, it is very well done, and has a lot for you to do.",2

"brilliant game. its free, but if people so desire they can pay to advance further; or not. youll still enjoy it. a mixture of tactical third-person shooting and fast-paced free-running and melee combat, this game has community-minded features such as clans and alliances, and gamewise its got a huge number of varied mission types, playstyles and gear. aesthetically, its beautiful. you dont need a diamond encrusted alienware to run this at top graphics settings. almost everything looks good, and it runs very smoothly on most systems. an excellent plot, voice acting and mission selection, modding and inventory system. add the fact that it is still technically in development, meaning that theres constantly new content coming in, and youve got a masterpiece in the making. ive enjoyed this game since beta, and have done so with spending a very little amount of money as a founder to support the development. i would advise anyone who can get this to do so. youve got nothing to lose, and a lot to gain.",3

"i have only one question, how can this game be free of charge?",1
"i feel like this falls under the category of overhyped; i got bored with the combat and mission grinding not even 4 hours into the game. i mean, dont get me wrong; the concept is great. i love the whole idea of this game. ive seen the classes in action and i love it all. but its once again, one of those games where you can just dump your money all over it and already have everything in the damn game. you get a small selection of classes at the start of your playthrough, and youll quickly want to try out the new classes. however, getting the materials necessary for getting another class in the game requires a massive amount of work and time; i had to buy a blueprint for a blueprint so i could make the blueprint just for another frickin class to play! then getting the right material to make this one blueprint required fighting a boss that spawned on one world, and it had like a 3% chance of dropping. then crafting the actual crap together would literally take days in real time. whereas i couldve just dropped about a hundred bucks and already have that class and a load of weapons/items for it in no time at all! a shameless cash grab! i literally got into a game where two other players who already had everything rushed through a mission in less than two minutes and killed everything in the level with the  they just bought. really now? some open beta this game is. dont waste your time on this crap.",1

"this game is amazing for a free to play and the only bug that i have found is that once in excavation the scanner stayed at 100% power and the drill wouldnt spawn, but apart from that and a few clan dojo glitches the game runs really well 10/10.",2
"warframe is an amazing game for emphasizing your playstyle, each weapon is suited to a specific playstyle, or adaptive to make it fit your playstyle, this also can be said about the warframes themselves. mods further enhance playstyle to the very elements you want to fire out of your gun! while it is a grind, after that first loadout is bought and you have a new melee, primary, and secondary weapon, it becomes a game of using awesome mods and unique effects for each gun to mow down hundreds of enemies in different ways, using abilities lets you master the flow of combat. another thing great about this game is the animations, while they are triggered by player use on some, which can be a bit sudden, all animations look so smooth, and each weapon even has unique combos, stealth kills, finishers, and so on. i would highly recommend this game to anyone, and its ftp, but not necessarily ptw, the developers themselves said that everything in the game (besides color packs and excalibur prime, the donator frame) is obtainable for free. grinding to get a new weapon can be fun with friends, and the combat is so satisfying most of the time.",5

"this game is addicting and made me grind for most of my stuff.",4
"warframe is an interesting and innovative puzzle game. rather than the player trying to figure out how to use the game mechanics in order to progress, the game plays itself in the players mind. the goal is simple, you must escape the arsenal screen. sounds easy, right? youd be mistaken. the second you click appearance, the game has you hooked. it will not let you go until you have the right colors. what are the right colors, exactly? you have to figure that out yourself. buying new color pallettes will make the game either harder or easier, but the game does not tell you which ones do so. i have managed to beat this game once, playing as valkyr. it took a few hours, but i knew i had won once i started playing a mini game (theyre called missions in-game) and didnt compulsively feel the need to return to the appearance tab. at last, i had been freed. but i am still determined to beat the game with each warframe i own. if you like games that challenge the players mind, this is for you.",3

"dont get me wrong, i love warframe, and i do recommend that you at least try the game, but through my experience with this game i have had nothing more than trouble. game play is awesome, endless hours of farming and grinding, it is truely an mmo players dream, however the game has far too many bugs that the support team refuse to do anything about, from constant log issues to frozen ui the support team always recommend you allow the game to run through firewall, no matter the issue. personally i find no use in firewall, it does nothing but slow me down, and i keep my computer clean, physically and digitally, so for me, i have no use what so ever for firewall and it is always disabled. still everytime i run into an issue while playing (which i must say, happens literally once or twice an hour) and report it to the support team, they always tell me the same thing, allow the system to run through firewall. but when i exclaim to them that this cannot be the problem i am met with an apology and instructions on how to allow a program through firewall. its a great game with a terrible support team. my enjoyment in this game would usually tell me to rate it a 10 of 10, but the constant problems prevent me from giving it any higher than a 5 of 10.",2

"warframe is an interesting and innovative puzzle game. rather than the player trying to figure out how to use the game mechanics in order to progress, the game plays itself in the players mind. the goal is simple, you must escape the arsenal screen. sounds easy, right? youd be mistaken. the second you click appearance, the game has you hooked. it will not let you go until you have the right colors. what are the right colors, exactly? you have to figure that out yourself. buying new color pallettes will make the game either harder or easier, but the game does not tell you which ones do so. i have managed to beat this game once, playing as valkyr. it took a few hours, but i knew i had won once i started playing a mini game (theyre called missions in-game) and didnt compulsively feel the need to return to the appearance tab. at last, i had been freed. but i am still determined to beat the game with each warframe i own. if you like games that challenge the players mind, this is for you.",3

"amazing game, was better than i expected for a free game, cant believe its free. really difficult too, only critic i have got is that it got bad steam support and may be too hard in some aspects and a bit gear dependent for your own warframe. basicly, you control a warframe, or hero, or a unit like halo, which you can pick from alternative classes or warframes as to speak, which you can find and collect and craft weapons to level up with aswell. tons of levels, and a story, and excellent graphics, and smooth gameplay, and active online player base.",1

"note this review is not based of any new content as nothing feels new. the graphics and design are great and have 4 friends can make the game a little more enjoyable. however the game will get boring for you really quick as each level feels the exact same as the previous just with a different objective to complete. the levels are continously recycled and there is no real sense of progression you get from other games. when you level up you dont feel any stronger than you did when you previously. the crafting system is very hit and miss. the ui for crafting is very solid and very easy to use but getting the materials needed to create the items in question is horrorendlessly bad. the rare item drops needed to craft the items drop so rarely youll be grinding the same levels over and over just to get that one item that you wont feel very accomplished after getting it. youll just feel like you wasted a lot of time. the gameplay and sound for the game is actually really nice. the weapons sound good and impactful the sword swings are refreshing to hear as you cleave your enemies in two and the controls are solid. in closing i feel that the game could be much better but as it stands i cant find it as enjoyable as other mmos like world of warcraft or final fantasy xiv a realm reborn.",1

"this game is not a bad game dont get me wrong, it has cool graphics, nice gameplay, and good customization. the problem for me is the gap between veteran players and new players (such as myself). i found myself running behind this veteran players while they rushed clean the whole map, while all i did was collecting the xp, not that much fun. you can play alone sure, but that becomes very hard later on, and there are some modes that require 4 players to play effectively. getting the resources and warframes needed to make new stuff is not that hard, as long as you have 3 veteran players that take you to a advanced map to farm resources(while all you do is hide when the vets clean the map), try doing that alone and in low lvl maps, its almost impossible(to get the needed resources) the payed part of the game is a bit too much for me, i wanted to spend some money on this, but then i saw that is was more then 15 to unlock a new warframe... i didnt find it pay to win, since you can get all the stuff just by playing, its just the prices they ask for are too high for me. this is a cool game, if you have the time to grind and farm until you become a vet yourself, but i cant recomend this to new players, i wish i could select a neutral review for this, but i cant...",1

"if you had asked me if i would recommend this game before their newest combat system, fighting in space with wings, i would have given you two very solid thumbs up. i will admit that the space combat caught my interest but after trying over a dozen and a half times on one mission to complete it, i have to say this. worst mistake ever! there is no training for this combat. the npcs do not miss ever. you try and dodge, as its built into the combat flight system and yet they still hit. the npcs are able to capture zones faster than you can react. the devs in their wisdom do not give any mods to help you even in the combat, and when you do find a mod, if you fail the mission.....see above with how many times i failed it, you dont get the mod. congradulations de, you took a great game and screwed it with your need to make things so over powered, i will *never* return or spend money on your game.",4

"has lots of potential but, in my opinion, falls flat because of its repetitive third person action/shooter gameplay, which is nice in the beginning. but after ten missions or so (which usually range from 15-45 minutes i guess) youre starting to think that maybe youve seen all this game has to offer already. rest assured, theres tons of loot to find so theres plenty to come back for. you just have to accept that theres not much variety and the fact that people get lost frequently because of the terrible level designs. which is not good for a game that focuses on co-op. not a bad game per se, but just not my cup of tea. [rating: 74/100]",1
"the game is based around the idea of continuous, inevitable, tedious farming. space ninjas in space arent a bad idea, but the (d)evolution engine the game runs in makes it so with poor optimization, and higher graphical options just make it so you can see less and uglier.",4
"okay so this game is really fun i must say but there are many things that make it weigh more towards the no side. the game is a third person sci-fi shooter where you are saving your kind from evil that are trying to kill you off and you play different levels traveling through different planets in the solar system but i found that all the levels feel the exact same over and over. you have different objectives each time but it is almost always the same map layout and the same ultimate goal in the end making it feel super boring over time. the game is free to play but once your in the game you are almost always butt ed by the cpu enemy because you start off with bad weapons and in order to get better weapons you basically have to pay so its free to play the game but to enjoy it you need to spend money basically. but the game is fun with friends and has come a long way and still looks promising so i hope it can improve until then this game is a no for me 5/10",1

"this game is downright frustrating and boring. the gameplay is repetative, and after the prologue, there is no way or indication for you to know where youre supposed to go next. the only way i imagien this gam to be any fun is if you step in with your friends, and start at the same time. because any experienced player will just bombard you with information you dont understand, thanks to the system surrounding upgrades and leveling being so confusing. and not to mention my experience with random matchmaking. more often than not, i see two or three high-level blips on my radar, because i get to see them up close twice. once on level start as they run off, and once at the level exit, where they wait for me when they have murdered everything that moved. frustratingly complicated systems and no guidance or hint to what level mission to choose, as well as the pairing with high-level players make this game incredebly frustrating for now players. all in all, overly complicated game mechanics and a verry unclear dificulty curve surrounding a repetative core gameply, more resembling of grinding than a fast pace shooter, combine to make this a boring and frustrating game.",1

"this is a good game, it kind of lacks on gunplay, but it`s easy enough to be fun.",1
"i havent played much in this game so my review wont be based on the entire gameplay or story elements. i have had only one complaint with the game and it is completely personal opinion. in a similar fashion to other multiplayer fps games you can rank up your character to unlock more abilities/powers/guns/etc. however in warframe you have to wait 24 hours before you can rank up your first level. this means you are stuck using the same crap gear while grinding until you can unlock anything else, for at least 24 hours. but that isnt my problem. i can wait 1 day, no biggie. i come back the next day to rank up. first i have to pass a mission in 60 seconds. my newb  fails and now i have to wait another 24 hours... annoying! i would continue to play and grind using my crap gear but honestly i dont want to. that is my only complaint of what little i have experienced of warframe. if that doesnt bother you then there are lots of pros to this game such as; coop multiplayer, tons of variety in character customization, intense fast paced fps action (technically 3rd person), and many others that i didnt get to. forcing me into only wanting to play the game for a few minutes every 24 hours just isnt worth my time, personally.",1
"i played maybe 10 minutes of the game and quite frankly i wanted to kill myself, but then i stopped playing. then it was like being freed from a holocaust camp in 1945 and all sorts of hope,feelings, pride, respect all came back to my being as my soul was returned from the pits of tartarus known as warframe. so in short no, i do not recommend it, i do not want to play more, i do not wish this upon my worst enemy, and it would require them to pay me at least 50$ an hour play. so pretty much, they would have to pay a nuclear scientist fee for this game to ever touch my hardrive again.",1

"this game is awesome. you got a character (you can select 3 different in the start) and the character is called a tenno. you are a kind of an elite group and will get some missions. the grafic in the game is also pretty good and sound is awesome. it takes some time to learn all the controls and how to use them in fight. but its easy to shoot and it works good whit guns,rifles,and other. theres also some totaly sci-fi weapons and you can use mods on your tenno and weapons. a other weapon is sword. tennos is like a ninja and can make stealth kills. if you just take rifle and starts shotting a bunch of enemys they will alarm. and so there will come alot of enemys after you. but if the alarm starts you can hack the system and it will reset to normal security. thats a bit about the game. i think that this should cost money its so good. the only bad thing is that its a bit hard to get weapons. but the start weapons a fine so you can use them whitout getting to much troubble in mission. and in the missions you can make a squad whit 2-4 random players or some from your clan. and 75% will make teamwork and 25% will just drive solo. so i give 9/10 stars. this game is awesome download it",1

"warframe might seem to some a p2w game, but i havent looked it like that. sure, you can pay to get faster unlocks, instant warframes, more warframe slots, but id say the game makes up for the grinding in the amount of content. there are so many options to choose from, and while it might be boring to some to grind all the way to the best equips, it actually does help you to understand the mechanics of the game and the vast amount of different methods of clearing content. pros: +lots of options to choose from, be it weapons or warframes +customatization: everything is customizable +many, many, many different game modes +co-op play with friends +rather friendly playerbase +tutorials +combat system cons: -time-consuming, it takes a lot of time to get to the best equips available -there are a lot of pve missions, and if you want all the stuff, you gotta clear em first -some frames and weapons are naturally unbalanced -confusing at first all in all, i do recommend this game to the fans of the hack-and-slash genre and also to those who prefer sci-fi environmental fps games with variable difficulty levels.",1

"months ago i would have wholeheartedly recommended this game. for about a year this was my favorite game, i would spend all week soloing because my internet is terrible and every weekend at my cousins playing with friends online. then after the archwing update the game became unplayable. long loading screens, inability to join anyone online, and the game now lets your screensaver come on if left alone and when that happens it will crash the game and cause my pc to blackscreen. this state of horrible brokeness only affects a fourth of all players so if youre lucky you might get to experience warframe in all its glory. its a great game but its been broken for a large number of its players for months and its inexcusable for the devs to keep adding new content even though they havent managed to fix how broken the content they released before has made their game.",5

"an amazing game, better than any other shooter ive ever played. the game takes direct influence from one of my favorite games, dark sector, and while the developers insist theres no correlation its hard not to notice the similarities (eg. glaive, tenno, excalibur and nyx being blatant copies of the suits nemesis and hayden used in dark sector, technocyte virus... the list continues, admit that this is a sequel and the gamell be better for it.) warframe gives you the ability to live out your dreams as a super-powered space ninja, even if you werent exactly planning to be one, youll be happier just for the experience. warframe also has tons of replayability and weapons. every frame has its own abilites, they arent just cosmetic; and the number of weapons avaliable to players allows for hundreds of different playstyles. from the aspiring ninjas who use bows and other silent weapons, to the living tanks who just want to cleave through hordes with a sword taller than they are. warframe brings so much to the table, even before true release.",4
"run, gun, hack, slash. thats what you spend 90% of your time doing. but, whether you choose excalibur, volt, mag, or any other frame available, youll be having a blast running on wall or sliding around and completely decimating your enemies. the controls are tight, but a little buggy here and there, but it doesnt detract from the entertainment value. the sounds and music are extremely good quality and adapt to the changing environment as the pacing of a given mission changes. plus, ninjas in space fighting clones, zombies, and people with entirely too much interest in robotics and wearing boxes on their head.",7

"as much as i enjoy the game, i hate the game developer for not putting too much effort in it. ive played for 5-6 months. it could be fun if you have a lot of friends but things keep being repeated everyday. de get new things everyday but not enough, barely to keep the game fresh. you pass mastery rank 8 and thats pretty much everything i can own in this game. i can recommend playing this if you want a co-op, fast, fun game but not recommend if you hate doing same stuff everytime. pros: - fun, nice action - 4 player co-op - decent graphics - space ninjas, bows, kunai... - definitely not pay to win (you can pay to get some unique stuff) - no major bugs cons: - connection is pretty stupid. sometimes you have to wait for so long (4-5 mins) then connection to the host has been lost appears - ninja plays free but de recently gave players a lot of beam gun and stuff, not many ninja weapons - warframe does not scale to late game - too much farming - weapons so unbalanced - little update everytime, archwing not enjoyable as expected although i dont recommend the game but it was one of the best f2p i have played. id give a 8/10",7

"my first reaction: holy  space ninjas! this is awesome! after 40+ hours of playing:  this putrid diarrhea . difficulty does not scale with number of players. most missions are extremely difficult alone, by design. good luck finding people playing the mission you need help with, everyone is busy farming the same few missions over and over again. good luck progressing through the main quests. 6/10 on a good day, thats the best i can do.",1
"game is very hard to get into. very few things are explained to new players, and if they are it is done poorly (see damage 2.0, mods). it requires extensive reading into wikis and other outside of game sources just to get going. even being a f2p game, the grinding is ridiculous. i cant recommend this game to anyone.",1
"i dont like that you need to verifie the game to play",1
"your basically an alien assassin that gets missions and does them. for fffffffffffffrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee",1
"very awesome game if you can afford it. 300 us dollars is about what youll need to really be satisfied with it for a short period of time. if you got the money get it its fun. youll also need a ton of time to set it up before you even get to play. you can never sell it or even give items away . once you get it its yours forever.",1
"a game that gets fun once you put in the time sync. this game works around taking time to craft items and getting drops from enemies to craft those items. the game can start out slow for some but i enjoyed it the whole way and once you get to the lategame segments of you maxing out your weapons to the fullest and having your favorite warframe equipped is well worth the time sync and is worth money to put into if you like the game enough.",4

"anti-cheat. flagged me for having cheat engine running in background (not using)",3
"the game was fun at first, but after playing for hours, ive noticed that the enemies feel very repetitive. the enemies are doing the same thing, saying the same thing, and dying the same way. also, there are very limited characters and weapons. you can only level be leveling the equipment. and i got stuck on a level because when i couldnt afford to buy anything more, and maxed the levels in everything.",1
"its fun but gets boring really fast, in this game u can run around with some ppl, shoot and melee enemies. thats about it. it not difficult at all and offers almost no cooperation i felt like the coop mode was more like a race to the finnish. i can tell alot of work was put into the game and it runs smoothly, it really looks like a nice game but after u play a couple levels ull find thats its kinda like the same thing over and over again. i really dont mean to downvote it, its not really a bad game, i only down voted it because i personally dont enjoy it, its kinda good for a free game, its got alot of customization and main menu stuff but the actual gameplay dispite the graphics can be found in like a internet browser arcade game",1
"poor controls, hud doesnt scale to higher resolutions, and incredibly glitchy mouse movement. i dont know if its mouse acceleration, but it pretty much made me lose all interest to bother playing in just the tutorial.",1

"do not expect to get anywhere in this game without paying money or putting in way to much time.",1
"far too unpolished and ugly to bother with at the moment.",1
"too much grinding. reminds me of why i quit in january. epic items are usually pay to get or requires huge amounts of ingame currency. multiplayer is fun though missions can get repititve and sometimes annoying.",1
"garbage game, $40 for a starter pack? lol what. gindfest and you walk through half a level with no enemies and when they do show up they instantly die anyway.",1
"it started out rather excellent, beautifully designed and fast paced; full of interesting action. very quickly this degraded to utter repetition and hours of grinding for gear that would become useless once something better came out. dont get me wrong, it can be fun, but its not as engaging as it could have been.",1
"i didnt play it that long, just a couple hours. when i first started playing this game, it was really fun, but once i progressed further into the game, it become ridiculously repetitive. i felt like i was playing the same map every time.",1
"well.. this game was fun in the start, but then it just starts getting boring. you cannot play more than 4 hours of this without realizing that you can find alot better free2play games than this. 4/10",1
"i think this game is a little bit boring, but theres so many other games i can play",1
"i used to love this game. ive been playing since it was first released and it was amazing. but the 1.8 beta patch changed too much. and screwed over the older players. our amazing gear and suits lost that awesomeness and the game became pay-to-win. all in all it is a good game but not something i would recommend",1
"well... if you dont mind de randomly banning your accts simply because you mention in the forums that they cant seem to release a patch thats worth a damn. and you dont mind your game being constantly broken crashing and or bearably unbalanced every other week ya sure its great.",6
"really why do we have to get a ing verification email.i mean just...why",1
"every update make the game worse. and now you can buy everything in the game for cash. so there is no progression, you can buy anything you need form other players. and its not even pvp, so the progression was all the gameplay.. and now its gone.",5
"i decided to put off playing this game to stare at a much more interesting beige wall.",1
"awesome gameplay, but these guys are really greedy! inless you feel like grinding the same maps for like 40hrs to get tot he next place, youre not gonna be getting a new weapon or suit unless you pay atleast $20. also, no one plays this game from what i can see. i was waiting in a room for like 20min waiting for someone to come around, but no one came. the levels are designed for atleast one other person, else all what happens is that you run outta ammo (since the starter stuff is so scrub that it takes 1/10 of your ammo to put one guy down). dont even try to download this guys, all theyll do is nickel and dime you untill you figure out that the free running os gitchy and unrefined.",1
"i hate to say this, but warframe just isnt fun to play. i liked the concept at first, and put a couple of hours into it, but its just... droll. the gameplay is repetitive, and the downtime between combat is mind numbingly boring. i do like the exploration available within levels, but the lackluster combat is a huge turn off. its not exactly p2w, since you arent competing against other people, but the best weapons and warframes can be purchased for real money, and in some cases this is the only way to get those items. if the gameplay gets any better in the future, i may reconsider, but for now, warframe doesnt get a recommendation from me.",1
"this game is a hit and miss for me i really like space themed games with thrown in sy-fy like the next person but.............. this games problems lay in the fact your team mates will teleport due to latency issues the maps are kinda too big the maps i have take me 2-3 hours just to complete them repetition most of this game is just centered around the same enimies",1
"the game has been steadily going downhill for months now.",2
"other than the developer incompetence, the endless grind, the lack of end-game content [or really, any fun content], and the power creep that makes magic: the gathering blush and get a little moist, theres not much to talk about in this game. sure, it looks pretty, the art design is one of the few things they got right, especially if you like weapons copied from each other, or just given a couple gold plates and considered a whole new weapon. a year ago i put a hundred dollars into warframe, hoping that it would grow up and be a good game. instead, every time i joke about the worst move they could make they up the ante even further. if you have a couple friends, and you want to shoot dudes for a bit? sure, go ahead. if you want to invest time and money, there are a million other shooters out there, often ones that dont hide behind its a beta while heavily monetizing every single aspect of the game.",7
"if you arent willing to dump youur entire wallet into this game i would recommend not buying this game. im not saying it is impossible to buy things with in game money but it iis difficult and the gameplay is entirely not laid out well. i had a fun first couple of days with it but became very monotonous with each level and i became very irritated slowly realizing that this was a pay to win game.",1
"just play harvest moon. at least you have more progression with that kind of farming.",1
"i played his game for about five hours and i swear i done the same mission over and over again. when you first start it doesnt even give you a tutorial on how to make your characters or how to use mods effectively or anything. nobody works together. in my opinion okay game but way too repetitive",1
"to be honest, there are like few good free to play games and this one is not it. pay to win, or get some in game stuff.... also boring as hell. all you do is just run around in very dark rooms and shoot.",1
"my friends said that i would be playing this space ninja-ish game, he said that they were naked but when i play they have this armor on... i am still yet to find out how to remove this, maybe we can get a naked mod like in skyrim, pls de hurry up and fix this so i can thumbs up :d p.s. the female characters have big butts... this is no lie",6
"im bored, dont want to type, list time pros: +good graphics/sound +no paywalls +fluid combat and movement +cool weapons and sci-fi aspect cons: -no good original gameplay after the first two missions -requires to much money for such  items -the community is brain dead, theyll claim to be 2pro4u yet be the first ones down -no teamwork, just a race to get the most items from dead bodies, youll find yourself doing all the work while your teammates make double then you because they focus on all the loot -little to no difficulty, enemies are just stat boosted reskins of the first enemies you encounter all in all 5-6/10 in. my. opinion.",1
"slide on the floor and use super powers to fight the same three types of enemies across a solar system of narrow hallways and bright colors. warframe is a mix of most every sci-fi shooter game from the past decade and did prove amusing in parties with friends; however the amusement was short lived. limited levels and enemy types accompanied by lengthy grinding caused me to burn out rather fast on the title. there are also pay to win weapons, thankfully the game is cooperative; however this will not stop public players from joining a game and stealing all the drops. note: i did spend 55hours with this game, and im told the developers plan to release many more things including an open world play mode.",1
"the game was great but i cannot backup to play with my friends and my father also want play for a few seconds..please fix up the backup",2
"dont get me wrong here this game is fun but it is the most annoying game i ever played. for starters the game developers use most of the game levels almost every time including dialogue. its the most annoying repetitive nonsence ive ever listened to in a game for the past year also id like to point out the combat. for starters sword combat blows so hard because when ever you tried to attack head on the enemy is like yeah right like that sword is going to hit me im gonna slap it out of yo hand complete bs. id give this game 510 not great not horrenous.",1
"well..warframe is all grinding..the devs arent the greatest, its super repetitive, the mini games are impossible, the community is bad, and they always have some new warframe or wepons right after you wasted your time making the older ones, and its pay to win-for instance, you cant just make weapons or warframes, you have to wait 12 hours to 3 days for things or pay to complete it faster, and they are making thing harder and harder to get so you will give up your cash, and there are some things you cant even get without paying money, like some exclusive stuff or special armor and before you just gathered a few recources to make the weapons, but now its like you gotta make these dual pistols to make these dual pistols, and to make dual pistols to make the new dual pistols you need a pistol to make 1 of the pistols and you need 2 of those pistols to make the dual pistols to make the new dual pistols! its ridiculous! that was confusing wasnt it..well, id give the game a 4/10 at the most...",6
"-shudders- grindy, so grindy! the grind is so bad, it killed my inner child. i cut this out of my life like a malignant tumor. only way for me to get back into the game is to pay me.",3
"before i go anywhere, this is a pay-to-win game. i have spent no real currency on the game, and am judging my review on my first few days of play. i actually havent gotten past venus, and havent enjoyed much community interaction. this is, as i would describe it, a third person melee-shooter. too often you will find that slashing the  out of your opponents is more fun than shooting them from a distance. your starter weapons are trash, but they dont feel like it at first. this game makes you feel as if you can solo everything until you get half way through the first planet then you start asking for help. but none-the-less, it is still pay-to-win. pay for good weapons, pay for faster weapons, pay for more weapons, pay for this and that. out of 10, i rate this game a 3. its fun for a bit, but the pay-to-win part of it looms over you like a sin. hey, having fun down there? guess what? up here is where the cool kids hang out, with their everything unlocked ",1
"fun game, hard to navigate now though. rating: 8/10",1
"its okay, but its not groundbreaking. some weapons require platinum, and you pretty much dont get any without buying some. also, the level design is repeated and makes you feel like you are playing the same thing over and over.",1
"i cant play beceause of a internet conection problem that i cant fix.",1
"it gets fun at first until you realize it is the same thing over and over and over and over again. different planet? same mission but theres snow! the only variety is the bossess and the warframes themselves. if you are someone who plays desinty and like endless grinding and repeating the same thing then this is the game for you but repeats and grinding isnt my thing",2

"if youre looking for a good free to play game. then look give this a try. the game is fun and fast pace, yeah you do the same thing over and over but doesnt mean its going to be easy like the last. with a tone of warframes to choose from that may fit you best. this game isnt connected to the steam friends list. so you have to find your friends in the game (by asking them what their name is in warframe). i doubt this helped (or is even a review) but i really do think people should at least give this a go. also power levels are bull sh*t.",2
"very asem engin dewelopment and a fun game to play moltitplare",6
"so now that i know a bit more, ill go more in-depth. gameplay is varied enough, with abilities, melee, and stealth if you can keep your party in control. grind appears very short compared to other games i have played. while crafting does have those stupid wait timers, it is compensated by the few materials needed to craft items. i havent yet delved into the part of the game which relies on random drops from mission rewards, though. there are many weapons, most of which are pretty unique and interesting. augmenting weapons with mods is not tedious. movement system is okay. you can navigate very well in theory, but a bad connection will make it clunky. enemies within the same faction are somewhat bland, but across factions there is enough variety. tons of customization; almost every color of every piece of equipment you have can be changed, but you are limited to a very small palette of slightly bland colors unless you play $5 or wait for a free event-themed palette to come out. graphics are great but framerate is heavily influenced by your connection to the host. extreme amounts of mouse acceleration take a bit to get used to, but its not that bad after the first hour. overall a positive experience. i will be playing this for months to come.",7

"ignore what people say about microtransactions. i have been playing for over 300 hours and have some of the best gear in the game. i have only spent about $10 and that was on cosmetics. anyone should get this game, they wont regret it. :)",7
"this honestly is a very well made game, at least i think so. it mixes rpg/looting elements commonly found in hack nslash games with a 3rd person shooter game like gears of war for example. the problem is, the lack of variety. throughout the entime game youll be leveling up your gear, grinding for hard to find mods and resources, all to fight the same basic variety of enemies. they have just 3 factions of enemies in the entire game from start to finish. epic bosses? they finally added one with the orokin derelict missions, but other than that, they are all non meaningful and easily forgotten. i played this game for a while until i realized whats the point? whats the point of grinding to find better gear to constantly fight the same enemies on the same levels in a world that never changes at all...",3

"great game and very addicting but they have to stop making it pay to win just get money for making stuff that doesnt disturb me",2
"the new update for this game is amazing.. been playing since closed beta - and it looks like they finally hired a ui designer and gave some real decent thought to ux. the new player experience has also been an enjoyable introduction to the game.. each major update they have made it easier to get into for new people, but theyve excelled themselves with update 14 - it now feels like a complete game at this point. the game has evolved in leaps and bounds over the last couple of years and it is really worth a shot if youre even a little unsure about it.. plays great on either keyboard (though i had to change the keymaps a little to be completely comfortable) or gamepad.. ui used to be a real  for gamepad play though, so youd have to use the mouse and then jump back to the controller when you loaded into a mission.. no longer necessary. free to play elements dont seem to be too painful, you can get a lot out of the game without putting any money in, and if you do enjoy the time there are some benefits (most research/crafting speedups) from throwing a little money in.. warframes and weapons can be quite expensive when you look at the raw $$$ - platinum values but the leaps you have to go through sometimes to build a warframe from scratch if there is something you really want to play as .. $10-15 is worth it (only thing that would be nice is being able to play with a warframe/weapon before purchase.. not sure if that is actually in the game.. if it is i havent seen it yet :/)",1
"this is actually a seriously badass game and would recommend it even if it was at cost, but its bloody free! although most of the in-game features such as new classes to play as, weapons to equip, cosmetics, etc requires actual purchase, but initially you can choose between 3 base classes (each class is defined more or less by the 4 abilities its capable of using), a tactical class that uses abilities that effect the player themself, teleportation, decoys, etc, a second class that focuses all its abilities into offensive power, and a nuetral class that has some offensive and some supportive abilities, your first character is free but to get more classes you have to either buy them outright or find some materials and components to make them and then pay with an ingame currency that your earn from doing missions, its kind of rediculous and your just better off buying stuff, not to mention only some weapons and stuff can be bought with the in game currency, but the game itself is free, so i kind of balances out, and i guess this way you only pay for the things want, but overall you can still play the game to a full extent without paying a cent",1
"its like mass effect and ninja gaiden had a baby, and its awesome.",1
"any free to play game is fun, but this keeps you occupied with its crafting system and difficulty. the only down side is the endless grinding and farming for recorces and blueprints to build what you want. it also gives you a choice to buy the item, but it could cost up to 20 bucks for a new warframe, but its free to play, what can you expect.",3
"its really great, but it can be derpy at times, but all in all, its awesome!",1
"for free to play its worth a shot but its quite slow and repetative",1
"this game is very fun to play with your friends. a bit like borderlands but less randomness and more tactics . (i prefer borderlands :p ) the diffrent missions can be completed in diffrent ways . you can either come in all guns blazing or do the entire mission by stealth, using only your sword. after the first missions you might be a bit bored but after a few hours , when you have customized your character to make it personal , you have an arenal that your pleased with , and when you leave mercury (because you are always stuck on spaceships/earth and the other planets are more beautiful to play in ), the game will progressively be more fun. at some point (when you are a reasonable lvl) you can raid and do instances , online with random players or just your friends... the mod system (you mod your weapons so they become stronger) is very confusing for begginers but after a while you will get the hang of it , and its preeety dope.. i recommend this game to everyone .",1

"i was loving the game untill i was baned for no reaseaon it said i could play again in 2035",1
"i loved this game...for about a month. i still like it but i just feel it lacks good end game content. definitely recommend trying it.",1
"-      . the game is completely necessary to remove the use of machine guns and pistols - it nullifies the style of game. you need to create different modes of gameplay: level sweep speed, stealth, maximum damage, etc. add to the exterior of the characters individual items that are not part of the characters body: bags, antennas, ammunition you need mutch more effects in kills. enemies must to do something exept of just walking (every enemy). each enemy wants something, something must to do, etc. let enemies will be less, but every enemy becomes more interesting. the enemies have beds and toilets, a mess - a sign of life. more myths about ninjas in usual gameplay. the game will be alittle complicated but more interesting and exciting",1
"warframe is awesome, but you will need to spend a lot of time grinding solar systems to get good gear. its well worth the grind in the end. if your looking for a game thats got grity and hard fought battles that require a good team with some good ability to fill in the trinity (somewhat) warframe is your game. 10/10 in my book for a 3rd person shooter with the capablity of soloing most of it.",1

"very good f2p game. so much fun, fast paced action game, shooting and cutting up enemies :d points to consider: it needs a lot of development which is happening now, the developers are really nice and the customer support is very good. game is no where near finished and it takes a while (3-4 hours) to understand the base game.",10
"over the years warframe has drastically changed. it started out as another free game on steam but grew to be a remarkable game. the graphics have changed extremley and same with the gameplay. warframe is a game that you can pay to win but, you can still get the things that people pay to get but it takes longer. this game is literally just amazing. 10 out of 10. 5 stars.",3
"so this is most likely the best review of this game on the internet, so listen up. its a good game i like playing it idk if you will but if you want to try it out you can. you are suddenly amazed...",1
"this is one of the best 3rd person games i have seen.it has got everything.guns,swords and even powers.the only bad with these games is that you have to use real money to buy ingame stuff.if some games didnt have that then they would be the best.",1
"every  is fine well problems? is this really a ing free game? u serious about that ? every good equipment need really money to purchase and it is not cheap at all! wut? u want to try it free? good luck with that u r gonna spend weeks for sth those players who spend money to play will get in several days so i would like to this the game had better charge players (like wow or whatever) and let most of the equipment be availble for purchase via the in game currency instead of making every  no cheap in usd. besides, making it similar to world of tank--> enable using the basic in game currency to purchase advanced currency that currently only avaible if paid with usd. besides.... a corperation of 4 players? i though it was sth like the stupid eas battlefield i would rather play payday2 since this game wont charge usd on every ing gun about the graphic i only get a gt555m so i wont say too much i do enjoy it though sometimes the fps drops drammatically other features are pretty good >_>",1
"great gameplay and easily able to sink in many hours into it. the best part is its free to play. you can buy addition storage and items but its not necessary (i deleted frames i knew i wouldnt use anymore).",4
"well, its a very well balanced game, great graphics, complex stat system. before i explain why the actual gameplay is great, you should know that it has a massive grindwall which can be avoided with money. the physics system is still new and buggy, but it is definitely a great engine. the game starts off very slow, and takes a bunch of time to get used to. after the first 2 weeks you will have done no more than what an experienced player could do in a few hours. if you arent a vivid everyday gamer - i dont recommend it. otherwise, if you dig gaming, with friends and randoms - its certainly worth a try. lots and lots of content, complex player systems. all sorts of unique guns, launchers, blades and skill trees. thousands of multiplayer combo stratagies, hundreds of one-man stratagies. gamestyle is up to you, mass killing & fast paced, or higher dps, slower & challenging games. many updates and exclusive events. one thing i must warn you about is the community. ive been on the forums a lot, and have seen it grow old and bitter over time. the great majority of players are not your friends.",5
"the game is epic for the price - its f2p, and its epic. what else are you waiting for? warframe offers acces to almost all ingame items and visuals accessories without actually having the need to invest real money into it, but also wont make you poor if decision is made to put some into it. overall fast-paced and fun shooter with 3rd person view. oh and did i mention melee fighting and epic combos? i did now. personal info - played it before it was available on steam, linked it lately to it.",2
"best game of all time. you need to at least try it. <3",9
"this game is really fun alone or with friends or even with random people.",2
"spam kill. itll happen to you alot. theres only really one play style to this game. which is sad. makes configuration almost purely cosmetic. the skills are the best example of this. theyre all essentially the same thing.",3
"what a game! simple coop but intriguing play-and-craft style.",2
"free-to-play, amazing unique graphics, option to pay(but... you can gather materials and blueprints and craft everything that you could pay for with exception to some asthetic items. it is absolutely not pay-to-win. atleast check it out!",1
"well it is certainly a fun game. it focuses on loose teams of upto four players working together to accomplish a variety of goals; the assortment of weapons and armors is impressive and still growing, and the ability to customize the arributes of your armors and weapons just make it reign supreme when it comes to being allowed to do things your way. you can play it like an assualt shooting game or as a sneaky ninja game, theres even a solo mode for when you just want to have some fun all by yourself quietly. so if you enjoy co-op fps shooting, stabbing, cyber ninja games; this one is probably for you. go get them tenno!",8
"awesome free game!!! and its great to play with your friends!!!",1
"not a bad third person shooter, considering its free its quite good. takes a long time to get things i.e. you have to get matierals and then wait real time for them to build(any where between 1 hour and 24 hours. none the less it has alot of content and is fairly good. 7/10",1
"awesome game one of the best on pc but keeps freezing up on me and makes me restart my comp and lose progress",2
"cant get enough of this game! the constant updates keeps this game interesting and enjoyable! while it will take awhile to become a relatively good player and feel like youre doing enough damage, the investment of your time will pay off. also, unless you are going to constantly sink money into this game it will take some time to get better weapons and frames because you construct in real time and game resources are usurped quite a bit. the community is friendly and helpful, and the in-game trade is very nice as you can trade real money, in-game items, and in-game currency. all-in-all a great game that i would recommend to anyone and everyone. and the best part is...its free!",4
"great way to pass the time, and can be hard at times to level, but keep you intrested!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"good game,fast paced,action packed. worth checking out",2
"do you like sentai? power rangers? karate bugmen? then this is the grindfest for you. only complaint is not enough karate.",1
"so far its the best mmofps i have ever seen. the graphics are great, and there are several characters to choose from, but at first you can only pick from the 3 that they give you. so far the updates keep getting better and better. there are some items that can be bought with special currency, but there are also items that can be obtain just by earning money from the missions. if you wanted to do some missions on your own, you can play the game in solo mode. some mission can be challenging but they can be done. at the moment, there isnt a signal thing that is negative about the game.",1
"the games graphics and style are awesome and 3rd person-shooter action s pretty solid though the melee could be better. the game has a crafting mechanic for the weapons which is cool as it adds replayablity, however i found it very grindy and i play games like disgaea and monster hunter so when i say this game is grindy...it really is grindy, some people may infact love that but personally it was too much for me. -overall its a good game and is worth playing at least once since its free to play. give it a go.",1
"this game is incredibly buggy, but not so bad that it makes you want to stop playing. theres a lot that they can fix, but its still a new game. all in all: highly addicting game that you do not have to pay to play. if anyone else wants to play my username is of course, reikadeniah :)",9
"this game is great standing in my top 10 games,very much like tibes acend",1
"its a great game that has fun, fast paced shotter action. the missions are fun ( although not diverce) and the weapon and charextor levelinbg is relatively ok. the big fall offs from this game for me is the lack of a real story and the lack of super late game content. overall an amazing game that is free to play and well worth picking up. 8.5/10",6
"i totally approve of this game, bit glitchy from time to time but what did anyone expect from an open beta game. i tried it once, got hooked and so did a friend of mine who didnt like it at first, theres potential and players seems to be part of how this game evolves. 3 major letdowns though: #first out are those russians and whatnot who keep insisting *not* to use english when doing online gameplay even when they are asked to keep it so everyone could understand. #second, speedrunning kids who go from start to end asap without actually doing any real gameplay. #third, is more of a personal preference as *even if* they support the devs, i find it extremly lazy when people just buy their gear with platinum as it just takes out the fun of the game, everyone want it all, but no one seems to be willing to work and wait for it, shame. but other than that, its a fun game and even more with friends so bring them. /nazher",3
"its 3rd person shooter/hack-n-slash pvp, free, very active community and always getting better. give it a shot and youll love it",3

"warframe is a great third-person shooter,although it has some flaws here and there, which is to be expected from a game that is still currently in beta, its still a great game to play with friends.",3
"amazing game, takes the best of mass effect 3s multiplayer and expands it. it is also a nice plus that when you pay for things the devs dont laugh in your face, that money is put back into the game and it shows. this is the best f2p models out there.",6
"ninja space shooter with guns and swords. what more could you ask for?",1
"this game is great other than the fact you do have to be online to play. warframe is a good game for people new to third-person shooters and can be epic fun for hardcore gammers. this is one of my favorite free games to play right next to tf2.",1
"so much shooting action great preformance wish there were more missions like the cicero injector one.",3
"not my cup of tea for the kind of game it is, but i still enjoyed the 4 hours of playing it.",1
"very fun game with a large variety of characters and missions. i give this game nine tennos out of ten.",1
"this is a really nice mmo and i am having a blast playing it.",1
"warframe is a very fun game that gets updated regularly and is also very fun to play with friends because it has a stragey/stealth aspect that can be used. my only complaint about the game is the farming for crafting. its very tedious and includes you getting the blueprint for the item, getting the crafting components for the blueprint (usually involving farming), then waiting for the item to finish after you use credits and the components. other than that warframe is very unique to any other game in the genre and definitly deserves some attention for how cool it is.",3
"warframe is litterly an all around amazing game, the gameplay is very good, the weapon selection and combination possobilitys are funominal",1
"warframe is beautiful in terms of diversity and content. you can play any type of build you can dream, and it doesnt stop being fun, even when youve been off for a while.",10
"this game is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"if ninja gaiden and mass effect had a child, this game would be it.",1
"very good game the story is okay its kinda like halo but the fact its a 3rd person shooter im not a 3rd person shooter fan but i found that i love this game and also find my self running back to it.",1
"a bit complex to start off with, but after the first few hours it all becomes clearer. one of the most fun free to play co-operative- maybe even overall game ive ever played. the deep customization & gameplay mechanics, it is just so much fun. also chopping peoples limbs off is a bonus. i would recommend this to everyone.",1
"very fun game. its free so you can play with your friends.",1
"free :) its bad  looking to and plays well , i just need to figure out the difficulty settings could be ive only done 1 misson",6
"well it was good when i had it and i picked the wrong character accidently so i uninstalled it. anyway it just amazing its like a futuristic version of deadpool",1
"fun co-op game kinda reminds me of mass effect 3 multi",1
"i like the game however i only wish it was an actual retail game where i pay 20$ and get a physical copy with a good amount of stuff in it instead of a free 2 play game.",1
"warframe is a fast paced third person game set in our solar system in what seems to be the distant future. you play as a tenno, from what i can see are a group of highly advanced space ninjas, set to eliminate hostile species in the solar system. while its a fun game, the levels just keep repeating, like angry birds go. the levels are just :destroy the core! or find the hostage! or take out that guy! each gamemode has a different map but that map keeps repeating. each planet has a different mas though. now the maps repeat over and over again but this game just keeps getting so addicting! with a wide variety of weapons which of course, youll need to pay for them, make this game like tf2 with the weapon system except you dont really get weapons randomly like tf2. warframe is a f2p that is only available on pc, but now there is a version the the ps4 which isnt a f2p and i believe costs 60 bucks. id say just buy the game, but youll also need to create an account. be wise when choosing your tenno as each one is different. for new people, i suggest getting the balaned excalibur class. every class has a melee weapon, which you can buy different melee weapons. you start off with a sick katana which you can slice enemies with, or if you wanna go complete mafia mode you can get the electric knuckles! if you want my rating i rate this 7/10! install this!",1
"this game is honestly one of the best games ive ever played just the thought of a game like this can blow your mind",1
"this is a really good game with good graphics. unlike most free to play games, it has a lot of game play that you can do without the need to put in money. it is a game that requires thought and teamwork.",1
"fun game, i enjoyed it. never had any problems with it.",3
"breathtaking graphics + ninjas + parkour + tons of wepons + supernatural powers + alien zombies+ ugly enemies + the fact you look badass doing everthing... what does this game not have",3
"very fun, well put together game. i enjoy playing this game online or even on solo mode. i recremend this game to anyone who likes fighting close range or at a distance.",1
"amazing game absolutly love it i have the graphics on the lowest setting and it still a beautiful game",1
"decent fun for a few hours.. just dont go thinking you can go hardcore.",3
"online co-op halo game with magic. fantastic game, well optimized, great graphics, and fluid gameplay aside from melee. my only gripe is there are a few warframes that shine above the rest, my nova can destroy the entire screen instantly on everything but the hardest content, while my nyx is much...much slower. my rhino can solo everything in the game by just surviving through it all, but my excalibur dies very easily and isnt even as powerful offense wise as my rhino. the game is not pay to win at all - you can make warframes by crafting them in 3 days, and weapons in 1 day. the materials are easy to get and its mostly just the time spent crafting that is the hassle. now - if you are going to play 100% free just know that you should stick to 1-3 warframes, because you wont have enough inventory space for any more - its still great fun though. i still fully recommend this game to anyone, as it will provide at the very least 100 hours of gameplay.",2
"imagine an assassins creed, mixed with mass effect, and make it multiplayer-oriented. oh, i forgot to mention: alien space ninjas",1
"this is a fun game the download is long but worth it :)",1
"i tried to play this game when it first came out but it was a bit to weird for me. but ive gotten back into it in the past few days. once i figured out how to do everything and got my keys all set up i love it. the movement in the game is amazing! the ablility to run up along walls and climb on and jump on pretty much everything in the environment is awesome. i find the game menu a bit confusing with all the planets but its not to bad. the customization is pretty cool. i havent found much to buy with in game money yet, but im sure what will come. most of the stuff seems to have a real money cost. i like the idea behind it. its pretty original. so if you are looking for something new that combines a lot of different types of combat check it out.",1
"great game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"this game is awesome, great graphics awesome combat and endless fun. although the turorial is lacking i would recomend chacking out the wiki on start up info. i would definetly recomend this and have to friends.",3
"great quality, both in the graphics and gameplay department. great variety of play styles, a bit grindy but an overall great experience, recommended.",5
"a great game for players who are bored and seek action and a few challenges",1
"metal gear solid yes!!! naruto yes!!! bleach yes!!! (masked and sword everwhere) avatar yes!!! starwars yes!!! lag yes...sometimes when the host suck but no big deal all the ai also freezeing (freehit) f2p yes!!!",3
"i really love the game and the diversity you can experience. although i do believe they should lower the time to make things. warframes take 3 days to make by themselves not to mention the 12 hours for each part. other than the building times this game is very fun and i hope it can bring alot more warframes into the mix even though it already has so many.",2
"frankly the longer i pay this game the more i cannot believe it is free. now believe me, i hate to say that because of the risk of it becoming something other than free, but this game has some serious high points. first off, the game is beautifully rendered. the combat is very smooth and easy to pick up, even if you are just beginning. as you progress you become more and more aware of the acrobatic aspect of the game. this coupled with the different combat options makes for a truly interesting experience.",4
"slow at first, but when you get into it, its a whole new experience!!!",1
"space ninjas... this is all that is needed to be said",1
"do not payattention to the metacritc sorce becuase this game is one of the best free to play games of all time. to make things easier when you first start to game the games goes unto its oone seperate luancher which downloads all of the updates. some people find that the updating process is annoying but after that this game gets very fun. also you should know that this game does not operate on pay to play you can build wepons and new warframes you dont have to buy them, i repeat you dont have buy new wepons and warframes. take your time, be patent and dont buy new stuff and you will love this game. if you have a question just look up a guide on steam or google. thanks",2
"its a good and enjoyable game if u really understand it, its got varietes of classes adding to the joy",1
"this game in my opinion is one of the top 5 best free games on steam! although warframe thrives off of micro-transactions everything can still be done 100% free.",2
"the most addicting free to play mmo in which ive spent the most money, more than years of subscriptions to pay to play mmos. to me, this game has that addictive magic find run experience, you keep trying to find the best mods for your weapons and warframes. crafting is simple, getting the parts takes time but it can be done relatively easily! this game is a must play, i have not re-subscribed to ffxiv because of this game.",2
"great shooter and competitive game great with friends and still offers a good single player experience very fast paced not recommended for those with slower computers.",4
"this game is the pinacle of online co op. while most developers are copying the first person shooter warfame broght back the 3rd person shooter. you are a powered and skilled person in a suit, but it has a realistic sort of element to it. i cant really put my words on it, but you need your team mated in this game. and thats what makes it fun. that you have to work together, protect, and heal each other. its not just about pressing click, and aiming carelessly. great things like good xping, story, bosses, and upgrades keep this game refreshing. the visuals also are great for a free to play game. they update, fix, and patch the game consistently. as for any online game it does have bumps here and their, but getting into a game is fast unline most. definately download this game. i usually dont buy items online, but i bought one to show my little support of how i like these people who keep adding and fixing the game.",1
"good game, best played with friends with microphones for fun expierence game can get repetetive and lacking with things to do. stuff is still being added to the game but takes awhile for them to bring new content out.",3
"i love playing this game sooooo much!!!! if i would rank this game, it would be 10/10. it the best free to play game ever!!!",2

"one of my favourite steam game to play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ps:thanks steam for this game to download",1
"insanely fun f2p game. one of my favorites actually. amazing graphics on ultra, and fun to play with friends!",1
"very cool and fun game reminds me a lot of mass effect 3s multiplayer",2
"i cant stop playing this game. its got space marines, robotic proxies people, and space ninjas. what more do you want? okay, you want more. this is a game that you dont have to pay for, and have a whole bunch of fun with or without friends. the game is a lobby-based mmo that is the 3rd most played free-to-play game on steam, so theres never a shortage of people to play with. the development team holds the player base in high regards, often allowing them to choose the next warframes(characters) abilities, and give a pool of weapons to vote on to see in the game. so if you want to play a game of ninjas shooting, blasting, and slicing through swathes of enemies, this is a game you need to play.",3
"im about 10 hours in by this review and i can say so far that- especially for a free-to-play- warframes a blast. the controls are smooth and have a great learning curve while combats generally fun and varied. unlike other free-to-plays (im looking at you, blacklight: retribution!!!), taking the high road of not using real-world currency to purchase items doesnt leave you in the dust; it takes longer to purchase weapons, but not outlandishly-so. instead theres a rewarding feeling when you finally grab that beauty of a bow after so many playthroughs. the only thing so far that bugs me is the repetition, which the games got too much of. by the time its reached a final product new missions should likely become a big part of it to add a little variety to the grind, but so far im pretty happy with how developments coming for it.",1
"i highly recommend this game if you like crafting and collecting matearials with a side of a shooter/ninja",8
"great game, can be played solo but is most injoyable wih 4 people, does get a little repetative and getting new stuff ccn be a chore but its still one of the best free to play games out there and you should totally get it!",2

"great game with a bright outlook. the best f2p coop game hands down. smooth gameplay, excellent variety of weapons and stunning visual. the only thing thats lacking is end game, but thats coming out soon so dont worry. you can pretty much get everything except the cosmetics through grinding without spending any money. 5/5",8
"two words. space ninjas. pretty good f2p third person shooter with parkour and group play elements. can be a little grindy and repetitive after a while if they dont put out new content. other wise its one of the better f2p games you can download.",4

"hello this is a review for warframe do you think warframe is one of tose transformers game. this game is not at all like transformers it is like dota 2, csgo, left4dead and uberstrike. so if you have u chance to get tis game get it!",1
"a few words about the game. super fun, super addicting although this game reminds me of the dogs and mdk it fails to hit that humorous mark and creates live warframes from the tenno in spirit of mdk. now besides being a ba you pretty much own and have a hard time dying. the game mechanics are so fluid that dying is almost out of the question unless a) something went wrong b) you are an idiot. c) you went too much solo. this game is perfect to a t. however despite that once you are sucked in you will find you want to do other things despite this game being so blasted awesome! thereof the game hits the sweet spot in your gray matter of the cortex in your brain and vanishes from the fun nerve. in a matter of coloqiualism you miss that fun spot by a hair and make people pay for certain tech upgrades. i understand why, but this also creates road blocks. i wish you would simply attack $20. onto the title and then create a lot of free addons. this game is amazing but not quite in another reguard as its too perfect to be believable. soon you will find agg thhis seems too fluid and easy. to play....",1
"this is exactly what i want out of a video game. the plot: me good, them bad, kill bad man with gun. if you love being anime and killing hundreds of dudes, then this is the game for you. if you love co-op games but cant find one since army of two died, then check this out for sure.",1

"its a radical game about space ninjas goin round killin stuff. its not p2w, everybody has the same resources available, paying or not. so dont let others talk you into that. though the game is a bit of a grind at times. search (x) for (insert resource and/or blueprint here.) and build up the credits to create what you want. rng is a total hack, but dont let that water down your fun. overall; its a nice game to play with friends, or by yourself. money will make the game easier, though you dont have to at all.",7
"quite possibly one the greatest free-to-play games on the market, the community is decent, the graphics are dazzling, and the combat is explosive, however this game loses its appeal once the equipment and character acquisition grind come into play. all characters and weapons are craftable, however pay-to-win is a very viable option unfortunately, with crafting times varying from 1 day to 3 days for each piece, let alone the actual multiple piece item. the environments are recycled and lose their shine after a while, though it really doesnt detract from the game seeing as how it fits the clone/pirate/zombie storyline. overall a superb game, until you hit the equipment wall.",1

"i have played warframe alot and i can tell you that if you like shooters you will love this game. most free to play games i have played are really bad or are pay to win but warframe is not. warframe has a system were if you want to pay to get things quicker you can but almost everything that you can pay to get you can get without spending anything and the stuff you do have to pay for are mostly cometic. warframes combat system is very good and fun to play with becuase there is a weapon or tool for almost every play style out there. the people who make warframe seem to care very much about there game and what people think of it and have a content update every week and a big update every few weeks. one thing i wish warframe had more of is story and i think that that is pretty much the only thing that is lacking in warframe but do not worry because the devs are making meny updates to the story and lore. warframe is a very fun and very well made game and i think that if you like shooters you will love this game.",6
"the upsides are simple: this games aesthetic is amazing; tenno look cool, everything they do looks cool, player actions and stuff are cool, and dome helmets. the story is ambiguous enough to be open to whatever players interpretive powers might allow and it doesnt get in the way. you have guns and you shoot things, you have swords and you hit things. navigation is almost never an issue and teamwork is smooth and easy. pace is generally pretty fast and thus things dont get stale as quickly. the downsides are also simple: buggy as hell. this being free to play, everything that isnt basic xy or z costs dollars or a lot of time, especially aesthetic stuff. grinding is not too bad but still present. networking can be awful at times, and occasionally nonexistant. teamwork is not a necessity, having a team is, as the game doesnt seem to be balanced even remotely for less than the typical complement of 4 players without being laughably easy.",1
"very easy game to play, if you ignore all the grinding and damage calculations. and grinding. and endless grinding... but its a very fun game, mixes shooter with parkour-ish mechanics.",10
"this is hands down one of the most addicting games ive played in a long time. 20 minutes turns into 5 hours easy. you wont be disappointed",1
"fully f2p game , theres no way you can win this with p2w. tons of content and customization to use your creativity! just try it ! this game is full of action and unforgettable experience.",8

"this thing, id pay for this and its for free, its too well made to be true.",1
"a fun an unique third person co-op game, warframe is an all around interesting and fun game with a slew of objective based game modes that pit you and your team of space ninjas against three factions: the space marines, an evil space corporation, and space zombies. there is an incredible selection of warframe classes to play, weapons to use, and challenging bosses to fight. the biggest downside of this game is the business model. as a free to play game, you need to sink about a hundred hours or more into it in order to unlock new weapons and classes by grinding for obsurdly hard to obtain resources, blueprints and credits. however, the fun fast-pased action is enough to carry the game through its failings. altogether, if youre looking for a neat co-op game to play, either solo or with friends, warframe is at least worth a look. since only frames and weapons are locked behind cash walls, there is pleanty of game content to enjoy here.",2
"although at first its quite difficult to get used to, but once you get past the non-existant tutorial and some clunky wallrunning mechanics, you have a real gem. this game is incredible. it is sci-fi action at its best, short of mass effect 2. interesting story with characters they have yet to fully develop and explore. constantly updating with new weapons, gear and frames, not to mention custom colours, skins & visuals. gameplay is great, fast-paced with high-flying melee combat. one of the few games that has a realistic dive-shoot mechanic. some slow-mo, bows, rifles, shotguns, machine guns, swords, shurikens, sniper rifles, pistols, boomerangs. you name a gun, theyre probably working on it. but it is certainly not overwhelming. audio is good, with some blandness, but its still in beta so expect that to change over time. solid game modes and character mutation. features mod cards which alter the abilities of both your warframe and your weapons. want an increased clip? got it. need some radioactive arrows? got it. want your boomerang to have explosive damage? got it. incredibly deep rpg elements and leveling system. each gun has its own level along with each warframe, not to mention rewards for continually logging in. i cant find a real fault at all. especially conssidering its free!!!!!",4
"if you like ninjas with guns and have a good 300 hours to spend on a game, this is the one for you.",6
"a must play for all those shooting and hack & slash fanatics out there. warframe uses unbelievable tactics to infiltrate various planets in the system. earn materials to create items along the way and fight off some massive waves of grineer.",1
"a lot of effort put into this free game and its pretty fun",1
"of course i do. i spent so many hours playing this game. its tons of fun :3",3
"the game started off very fun with it having some pretty solid combat but unfortunately that can only get you so far. it ended up being the way of vindictus, the combat was amazing but the content was lacking. all the stages are pretty much the same and it gets extremely repeatative rather quickly. however, for some people it could be something new and fun to play.",1
"one of te better games available at the moment, its fun its free its big......... its worth getting an erection for.",1
"very grindy, but theres a fun game underneath it all.",8
"best game i ever played ever thats free...no really",4
"its cool and all, but it gets repetitive when you grind to level up and the missions are intense too, so you cant enter like a level 5 mission as level 2. gotta grind. which is stupid from the linear maps.",1
"it is a really good game for people who want something free and futuristic",1
"i tried to stomach this game. the videos looked good, they really do look fun. i downloaded, jumped into a game with friends and could not stomach close to 1hour. it really is boring. it does nothing... all you do is go from one room to another swinging your sword around, that is it. graphics are decent with smooth flowing but that is all it has going for it. lucky to hell it is free because if this had a price i think i would pull my hair out requesting a refund urgently because it is mind numbingly boring. i suggest leaving it alone, maybe give it ago but then youll see what i mean. it has no story, most things are buy for better stuff but it all seems to do the same effect, the character moves weird and makes me feel sick a little. anyway nope not for me.",1
"a smart and intuitive free to play shooter that gives numerous possibilities of gameplay. its simple and fun to play, highly recommended for people who like shooters with huge wars in it",2
"wont load and keeps crashing. i would get it though, since its free and alot of people play it. thats just my problem",1
"fun shooty. i suggest playing it in short burst so it does not become too repetitive.",1
"an enjoyable f2p game. graphics are pretty good. i had trouble getting it to work initially on my system; required quite a bit of tweaking and googling to get it to run correctly. the biggest problem i had was intense random lag on certain hosts. i mostly played with a friend of mine ~300 miles away and the lag i experienced made the game near unplayable. we both have mid-to-high level internet service and have no problems in other games. other hosts i joined 4000+ miles away were fine. ymmv.",8
"this is a great and crazy fun game to play. the learning curve is a much at first but once you have a few hour in this game you are hooked. the design and game game is wonderful. the frames to pick from or obtain offer everyone something speical to them and the style of game play you would enjoy. the dev are always releasing new content and items. i like that this is not a 5 hour game and then on the something else. this game is something you will enjoy for months and never look back. give it a try and hope to see you in the game. thegrid",4
"get this right now or you will never live as a true gamer",3
"very good quality game for f2p, rather grindy and repetitive but overall fun",1
"very fun game. there is a few weapons behind a pay wall. that being said you get a great game that i personally never felt pushed into paying anything for. my character never felt weak or wasnt able to keep up or fully participate. server stability was never an issue. often times running smoother than games i had paid for. highly recommened giving it a go.",1
"u better download dis naow or ill slap u in da face",1
"fun, if you have a friend, otherwise it gets dull pretty qukcly",3
"great shooter and competitive game great with friends and still offers a good single player experience very fast paced not recommended for those with slower computers.",4
"this game is the pinacle of online co op. while most developers are copying the first person shooter warfame broght back the 3rd person shooter. you are a powered and skilled person in a suit, but it has a realistic sort of element to it. i cant really put my words on it, but you need your team mated in this game. and thats what makes it fun. that you have to work together, protect, and heal each other. its not just about pressing click, and aiming carelessly. great things like good xping, story, bosses, and upgrades keep this game refreshing. the visuals also are great for a free to play game. they update, fix, and patch the game consistently. as for any online game it does have bumps here and their, but getting into a game is fast unline most. definately download this game. i usually dont buy items online, but i bought one to show my little support of how i like these people who keep adding and fixing the game.",1
"warframe is a kinda big game thats free-to-play and still keeps the quality of a game that youd buy. diverse gameplays on different maps and playstyles for different players. overall, a pretty fun game!",1
"this is a very fun game definentlay worth your time!!!!!!!",1
"warframe, a game with ninjas in space fighting robots, wierd evolved humans or something and aliens. also you are doing it all without effort in that full body suit that covers your eyes..... so i have no idea how you see, but still it is a great game and i give ot 5/10 for its bugs and glitches and weeks of trying to fix it",1
"one the best 3rd person shooters ive played in along time. space ninjas with guns what more do you want. the game is still in beta yes but its extremely playable and enjoyable. for a f2p game you really dont need to induluge in mirco-transaction to compete which makes for a pleasent change. overall 8/10, the game has pleanty of potential left in it for that to change to a 9.",3
"unrelentingly hard and crafting wait time simulator.... 10/10 game of the year",6
"i find this game to be somewhat of an oxymoron. it is centered around the thematic ninja, but is constantly devolving into chaotic button mashing and a screen full of bloom and particles. the game is given to us in the form of a crack a-team of space-ninjas, but very rarely does one feel like an assassin. the warframes are cool, and the art design for them is amazing, but some of these abilities are completely hit or miss, and especially in the late game, practically unusable. enemy hit points are simply too large for some of the games spellslinging frames to be practical. ability economy is at a low, but at least you can remove them from your frame. the game does do one thing right and that is the progression of equipment and building of new frames is very satisfactory. i cant tell you how desperate i was to complete my frost. and after you start crafting your preferred frames, you start to enjoy the game much more, but maybe thats because i didnt care much for excalibur. one of the biggest faults of the game is the annoying maps and the enemies pathing ai that dont want to work with each other, forcing the defense mission in question to be unwinnable. just something that needs ironing out. melee combat and movement combos are tones of fun, if not a little sensitive.",2
"wareframe is a damn good time, get three friends and play till your hearts content. i liked this game so much ive spent money on warframes and weapons in the real money market and i dont regret it, if anything its only made the game that much more fun. if you dont have the money to spend you can unlock almost anything just by playing enough. lots of cool feautres and a solid build.",1
"very fun game. you get used to what to do. id recommend!",1
"this is an excellent game and wil recommend it anytime. also it is free and some excellent in game purchases to help beginners",1
"really great game. i cant believe its free to play. it looks awesome, its fun, and has a cool space ninjas/borderlands feel.",1
"ive played this game on and off for quite some time now, both the pc and ps4 versions. i must say it is a lot of fun. i find myself coming back with wach and every update with more excitement than the last, and i am a founder and have been playing since the second patch.",1
"i like to do the running on walls thing and shoot the aliens in mid-air and have explosions in the background like its a michael bay movie. i recommend this game if you like shooting stuff.",1

"awesome gameplay, upgrades, graphics, etc.. this game is highly addictive. thanks to the developers for an awesome experience. :)",1
"one of my favourite steam game to play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ps:thanks steam for this game to download",1
"very nice game but you need a good dedicated gpu to play it and some of the items are very unbalanced",2
"this game is well worth downloading if youre one to play a shooter. the graphics are great, the gameplay is amazing, and the challenge is neverending, creating this amazing game that is ahead of its time. its worth paying for this game, even though its free. its easy to see this game as a full version, yet it is still in beta. but to put its gameplay into full gear, the multiplayer aspect is well worth upgrading/buying a more powerful computer if you dont have one already (as i myself am putting money into a good computer to play this game fully.) in short, if you do not have this game already, download it. you wont very well regret it anytime soon.",3

"if fast-paced, third person shooters is something that you like then i definantly recommend this game. the graphics arent really too straining on a decent system and look pretty well even on lower settings. the gameplay itself invites you to combat disfigured marines, diabolical machines and even infected, zombie-like monsters as a honorable space ninja known as the tenno. each mission is 4-player co-op with additional versus missions that allow players to battle by restricting their gears overall rank. these missions are very fast-paced and have some variety but i would like to see more. defense, survival, capture, rescue, mobile defense, exterminate and assassination are the game types with there being on assassination mission per planet that includes a boss from one of the factions. where most of the enjoyment comes in is when you are leveling your gear. the games crafting and leveling systems feel so rewarding when you reach that final goal. it is really what keeps you going that extra match each time. i give the game an overall 8/10 hoping they add more variety to the mission options in future updates which are currently being released at a steady pace by the games developer.",2
"this game is amazing. a free to play game that is on par with many pay to play games. the content is so dynamic with missions often being on random maps that change when you repeat the same mission. its so much fun to play a shooter where the map is ever changing.",2

"im about 10 hours in by this review and i can say so far that- especially for a free-to-play- warframes a blast. the controls are smooth and have a great learning curve while combats generally fun and varied. unlike other free-to-plays (im looking at you, blacklight: retribution!!!), taking the high road of not using real-world currency to purchase items doesnt leave you in the dust; it takes longer to purchase weapons, but not outlandishly-so. instead theres a rewarding feeling when you finally grab that beauty of a bow after so many playthroughs. the only thing so far that bugs me is the repetition, which the games got too much of. by the time its reached a final product new missions should likely become a big part of it to add a little variety to the grind, but so far im pretty happy with how developments coming for it.",1
"i highly recommend this game if you like crafting and collecting matearials with a side of a shooter/ninja",8
"warframe is a great game. just because it has a lot of platinum stuff in the shop doesnt mean you have to spend money.(platinum being the special currency bought with real money) you can use credits to buy blueprints and craft the items no need to spend money it makes the game a lot better when you have to work for all your new guns etc.",1

"very fun! kind of confusing at first, but once you know what you are doing it is awesome!",1
"i have played warframe alot and i can tell you that if you like shooters you will love this game. most free to play games i have played are really bad or are pay to win but warframe is not. warframe has a system were if you want to pay to get things quicker you can but almost everything that you can pay to get you can get without spending anything and the stuff you do have to pay for are mostly cometic. warframes combat system is very good and fun to play with becuase there is a weapon or tool for almost every play style out there. the people who make warframe seem to care very much about there game and what people think of it and have a content update every week and a big update every few weeks. one thing i wish warframe had more of is story and i think that that is pretty much the only thing that is lacking in warframe but do not worry because the devs are making meny updates to the story and lore. warframe is a very fun and very well made game and i think that if you like shooters you will love this game.",6
"the upsides are simple: this games aesthetic is amazing; tenno look cool, everything they do looks cool, player actions and stuff are cool, and dome helmets. the story is ambiguous enough to be open to whatever players interpretive powers might allow and it doesnt get in the way. you have guns and you shoot things, you have swords and you hit things. navigation is almost never an issue and teamwork is smooth and easy. pace is generally pretty fast and thus things dont get stale as quickly. the downsides are also simple: buggy as hell. this being free to play, everything that isnt basic xy or z costs dollars or a lot of time, especially aesthetic stuff. grinding is not too bad but still present. networking can be awful at times, and occasionally nonexistant. teamwork is not a necessity, having a team is, as the game doesnt seem to be balanced even remotely for less than the typical complement of 4 players without being laughably easy.",1
"very easy game to play, if you ignore all the grinding and damage calculations. and grinding. and endless grinding... but its a very fun game, mixes shooter with parkour-ish mechanics.",10
"this is hands down one of the most addicting games ive played in a long time. 20 minutes turns into 5 hours easy. you wont be disappointed",1
"first i would like to thank the devs for their beautifull hard work on this game. i started this game when it came out and it was .. meh.... fun and fast paced but repetitive and boring after a few games. since then, the devs have been hard working, every single update they did closed their flaws, optimised and unplayable game, braught it to an extreme content filled world, remade the ui braught thousands of bonus to player, and even after the game was branded pay to win after a few updates it felt as if it was already a thing of the past. if you feel like playing a game that is. - fast paced. - encourage either full out assault and stealth. - single and multiplayer experience. - challenging gameplay (hard to master) - hundreds of weapon. - full crafting system. - unlimited replay - dozens of character to play with and unlock - a good community and the best of all, devs that freakin listen to player :p this game will be for you, and for those who say the game is missing stuff or not to your liking, tell the devs and stay patient, ive never seen anything not getting fixed since the start of this game !! have fun and see you inside tenno :d",1
"243 hours in and i still cant stop playing. my recommendation for newer players is to get the dual zorens. my woosh will pierce the sky",3
"fun mature action-adventure instance-based mmo. the way mods, artifacts, weapons, powers, and pets are used upgraded and synergize is very complex and rewarding. things like mods actually make a very large and noticable effect on the way you play the game. this combined with twenty different frames and dozens of weapons makes for a very diverse game. warning: public matches are ok for the first few hours of gameplay. but a friend or three is crucial for enjoying the mid to late game. grinding can be a thing occasionally. consider joining a clan.",3
"extremely fun and addictive a little bugs here and their but the developpers know what their doing and even have so fun little livestreams about updates and stuff which also gives you a chance to win a draw",5
"i love this game its so fun and it keeps updating so the gameplay is always good",1
"metal gear solid yes!!! naruto yes!!! bleach yes!!! (masked and sword everwhere) avatar yes!!! starwars yes!!! lag yes...sometimes when the host suck but no big deal all the ai also freezeing (freehit) f2p yes!!!",3
"i really love the game and the diversity you can experience. although i do believe they should lower the time to make things. warframes take 3 days to make by themselves not to mention the 12 hours for each part. other than the building times this game is very fun and i hope it can bring alot more warframes into the mix even though it already has so many.",2
"frankly the longer i pay this game the more i cannot believe it is free. now believe me, i hate to say that because of the risk of it becoming something other than free, but this game has some serious high points. first off, the game is beautifully rendered. the combat is very smooth and easy to pick up, even if you are just beginning. as you progress you become more and more aware of the acrobatic aspect of the game. this coupled with the different combat options makes for a truly interesting experience.",4
"slow at first, but when you get into it, its a whole new experience!!!",1
"kinda fun to play, with friends or not, but it takes way too long to get any good items if you dont want to pay any money. like me.",1
"its a good game geted the kills i needed but they will pay for their useles lifes",7
"if you are having second thoughts on weather you should get this game, let me end it for you by saying that you should. everything about this game is extremely fun and entirely possible for any player. yes you can spend money to get things such as weapons or warframes, but the only things you have to spend money on are completely cosmetic things such as colors and scarves. yes, you will have to grind to get things in this, but if you have friends to play this with, or take every combat situation as something new, it doesnt even feel like grinding, it feels like playing and like fun. and even though the mission have limited types, the amazing devolopers are always adding new things to keep the game fresh and new. even if they didnt though, a mission could change completely based on what lotus (your contact on everything going on) thinks you should do, or your own actions on other missions. and then there are weapons you can only get if your in a clan. you can still get them even if you dont get into a huge and powerful clan. i know this because i am in a clan with one other active player, and have 2/3 of the weapons and warframes researched. trust me when i say it, you will love this game. just look at my hours on it. hell, ill even help you out if you need it, just message me. see you in the stars, tenno.",5
"if you like pay to wins or generic sci-fi... this game is barely for you.",1
"its a ing farming game... hours and hours of gameplay just to level up. great",1
"warframe is a fun game, but it gets very redundant (repetitive) very quickly. dont take this the wrong way, graphics are cool and it doesnt lag my bad computer. some tasks get repetitive though, repeating the same mission to get a part for a weapon blah, blah blah. its still fun, even for newcomers. 7/10 would play again",3
"i do recommend this but there is a bug taht bans u for no reason but it happens rarely so dw this game is totally awesoem and the addition of the kubrow makes it much more fun",1
"fun game, at times, farming is rough but other than that its pretty awesome.",1
"finally, a grinding game thats actually fun. oh, and the devs are awesome too.",6
"pretty good. it is pay to get better wepons but the wepons they give u at the start are not horrible. you can just upgrade ur default weps the make em as good as the others.",2
"this unique f2p game is one of the best pc games out there. it has a very nice system of parkour, combat, and other things. and the updates come out at a rather frequent rate, always giving you more, and looking forward to more. the one thing that i dont like is the secondary currency of platinum, which can only be bought through real-world money. but you can get up to 50% off discounts just by playing the game. and it is not at all pay-to-win. you can progress easily through the game if you really want to. platinum just makes it to where you can get a jump across some obstacles. everything is can be accesed, and nothing seems to be platinum exclusive. 9.5/10 stars. i really recommend this game!",1
"addicting and fun but maybe be boring after u have done everything.great game though :d",2
"its awsome...trust me its ninjas in space running on walls in space! killing zambies and robots in space while a ninja its good trust me dont be a hater)",2
"love this game.the fun of seeing yourself improve in this game is just exicting.and for free you just cant not say this is the worst game in history,its even free for playstation 4.",1
"it has stuff in it so its good. hope this review was helpful.",1
"recommend you play with a group of friends, otherwise this game is going to be a nightmare. best friendly co-op game i seen so far. has potential.",8
"its a great game really enjoyed because it was f2p",1
"this game is soooo totally next-gen. the graphics are awesome, the gameplay rocks. what else can i say?",1
"warframe is mass effects gameplay combined with halos versatility meshed together with left 4 dead 2s cooperative teamwork. this game is the epitamy of f2p games in my opinion with a very good model. anything that you can buy with real money can be acquired in game for free, and the best equipment cannot be bought at all. this game is easily my favorite one to play and i highly recommend you try it out.",7
"very repetitive and slow, it feels like an iphone game with all the waiting to do with crafting. a pay to win game, as getting credits and new warframes takes a tremendous amount of time and grinding.",1
"21:10 - z.x.t.: hows this game? 21:10 - z.x.t.: like blacklight ? 21:11 - supa : no 21:11 - supa : its like 21:11 - supa : coop 21:11 - supa : 3rd person 21:11 - supa : raids 21:11 - supa : 4 player 21:11 - supa : collect items 21:11 - z.x.t.: ewwww, sounds like new game defiance 21:11 - supa : lvl char 21:11 - supa : weps 21:11 - supa : modify char 21:11 - supa : weps 21:11 - supa : thats about it 21:11 - z.x.t.: and what about microtransaction model? 21:11 - supa : not really paytowin 21:11 - supa : you can crafta nything anyway 21:12 - z.x.t.: well, sounds interesting enough to grip me 21:12 - z.x.t.: maybe i try it later 21:12 - z.x.t.: hell, maybe we can even play together :d 21:12 - supa : :d:d:d:d:d 21:12 - supa : no. 21:12 - z.x.t.: ;_;",1
"great game and very addicting but they have to stop making it pay to win just get money for making stuff that doesnt disturb me",2
"this game is very fun to play with your friends. a bit like borderlands but less randomness and more tactics . (i prefer borderlands :p ) the diffrent missions can be completed in diffrent ways . you can either come in all guns blazing or do the entire mission by stealth, using only your sword. after the first missions you might be a bit bored but after a few hours , when you have customized your character to make it personal , you have an arenal that your pleased with , and when you leave mercury (because you are always stuck on spaceships/earth and the other planets are more beautiful to play in ), the game will progressively be more fun. at some point (when you are a reasonable lvl) you can raid and do instances , online with random players or just your friends... the mod system (you mod your weapons so they become stronger) is very confusing for begginers but after a while you will get the hang of it , and its preeety dope.. i recommend this game to everyone .",1
"a very well made game, suprisingly made by a small dev team but has become widely recognized to the point of a console release which is a great feat (even if it is download only) great game and more stuff being added to it",1
"its a fun and beautiful game but the only problems are: its ftp which means micro transactions, said purchaseable items are needed for the more difficult levels as free items are weak or take forever to acquire, you need to level every new weapon you acquire, there will be areas or missions where you will need a full team. play when you have nothing else to play or do.",1
"really fun game you could play it for days without geting board. practly endless replay ability. good bosses, crafting system, dojos, and drop system.",3
"beautiful game that should set itself as an example of whats to come into the future of first-person shooter mmorpgs, warframe blends superb graphics, great controls, a startling concept with an interesting backstory, and hella rad gameplay to provide a good time-sink and good game for all. try it, and you will not regret a single thing. also: did i mention its a free-to-play with minimal forcefulness in microtransactions?",1
"very asem engin dewelopment and a fun game to play moltitplare",6
"great co-op game with nice looking graphics. good community and awesome devs. not pay2win at all and if anyone says that they havent played the game at all. this game can be won without paying a single cent. of course if you want to pay for colours or attachments then it would require platinum.",4
"game is fun! love it, a must play free to play game. cant really put my finger on it but well its a well worth game! try it out! you wont regret it.",1
"tenno tenno tenno tenno pros - tenno - grind to grind more - diverse warframes - interesting enemies - parkour - asian architecture cons - level design is very repetitve - some levels include decent puzzles and hallways - gunplay feels bland warframe is an interesting tale, it is destiny before destiny. it is a literal grinding simulator. you grind items to grind for more items. it really is an interesting and fun game. the warframes (your character) have different playstyles and abilities to them and they can be fun to play around with. the majority of the game is spent doing tower missions or derelict missions, which, though fun, are incredibly limited in direction and design and get very bland after you do them once or twice. tower missions are a bit more diverse than derelict missions, but they are still very bland. the game could use one thing to make it much better, and that one thing is honestly more parkour options, i love the parkour in this game, it makes my  hard, only thing that would make it harder is more parkour. 7/10 - good fun with friends, but it can get pretty damn bland.",1
"i completely admite this game, although i do not enjoy the multiplayer. i always have to 3-4 minutes for one person to catch up in order for us to complete the mission.",1
"this lady told me to go in a room, where i then proceeded to be hit in the face with a knive by a guy. 10/10 would get hit in the face with a knive by a guy again.",1
"warframe is a curious blend of a tps, rpg, and pokmon catchem all style mixed with an ever-evolving sci-fi world full of baddies for you to defeat. you play as tenno, a race sworn to uphold balance in the solar system with the various factions that are regularly at war. so what makes your character special, you ask? well tenno are enclosed in special fitted armor called a warframe because they have been infected with the technocyte plague. instead of being sick these individuals display unique special powers such as throwing fireballs or freezing the area. there are plenty of warframes to collect and play, as well as primary, secondary and melee weapons each handles differently so there is a lot of variation. this game is regularly and is independently published so the devs actually listen to their cummunity and try to make the game better. the game is regularly updated so its an everchanging experience. this game does free-to-play justice as you only pay for convenience or for cosmetics. its a pretty addicting game with awesome graphics and an awesome sci-fi stting with freaking space ninjas! must try.",3
"fun futuristic game where youre a space ninja. choose from 4 beginner warframes that each have different abilities. battle your way through the system to reach different planets with different environments and enemies. there are several weapons and mods that affect your warframe and weapons. dont feel like buying your weapons with real money? well you can buy a blueprint with ingame currency, gather the resources you need and build it with the ingame crafting system. although it is a visually appealing game, the gameplay will become repetetive as you grind for resources to get a better warfarme or better damage.",2
"a fun take on modern first person shooters. who hasnt wanted to be a ninja... in space?",1
"tradeing a unused giftcard that i got when i bught a new grafiks card, its on 75 us dollars ( 50 euro ) trading it for ether the game saints row the third or gta episodes from liberty city ( or both if possible. the card have a code on it that you scratch away with a coin or so and is not opend ( scratched away ) if youre intrested take contact with me on steam or instagram whear i can take a picture and show it to you that it is not yet open or used. it also works for the games , neverwinter and marvel heroes.",1
"this is exactly what i want out of a video game. the plot: me good, them bad, kill bad man with gun. if you love being anime and killing hundreds of dudes, then this is the game for you. if you love co-op games but cant find one since army of two died, then check this out for sure.",1
"great co-op game, unlike anyother. no extra fees, it is awsome, some glitches, but, good support team 9.5/10",6
"this is a amazing game very fun more so if you have friends to play with",1
"once you level up a few times and understand how the game works (polarities, mod ranks, etc), the game gets a lot funner. this game is repetitive and is a grinding type game, so its not for anyone whos impatient.",5
"this game is very addicting at some points. dont believe the metacritic score! although it can be repetitive and grindy, the combat is very fun. not to mention a lot of variety with weapons, mods, and warframes. highly suggest trying this game out. its free, so not really any harm.",2
"warframe, a game with ninjas in space fighting robots, wierd evolved humans or something and aliens. also you are doing it all without effort in that full body suit that covers your eyes..... so i have no idea how you see, but still it is a great game and i give ot 5/10 for its bugs and glitches and weeks of trying to fix it",1
"one the best 3rd person shooters ive played in along time. space ninjas with guns what more do you want. the game is still in beta yes but its extremely playable and enjoyable. for a f2p game you really dont need to induluge in mirco-transaction to compete which makes for a pleasent change. overall 8/10, the game has pleanty of potential left in it for that to change to a 9.",3
"unrelentingly hard and crafting wait time simulator.... 10/10 game of the year",6
"i find this game to be somewhat of an oxymoron. it is centered around the thematic ninja, but is constantly devolving into chaotic button mashing and a screen full of bloom and particles. the game is given to us in the form of a crack a-team of space-ninjas, but very rarely does one feel like an assassin. the warframes are cool, and the art design for them is amazing, but some of these abilities are completely hit or miss, and especially in the late game, practically unusable. enemy hit points are simply too large for some of the games spellslinging frames to be practical. ability economy is at a low, but at least you can remove them from your frame. the game does do one thing right and that is the progression of equipment and building of new frames is very satisfactory. i cant tell you how desperate i was to complete my frost. and after you start crafting your preferred frames, you start to enjoy the game much more, but maybe thats because i didnt care much for excalibur. one of the biggest faults of the game is the annoying maps and the enemies pathing ai that dont want to work with each other, forcing the defense mission in question to be unwinnable. just something that needs ironing out. melee combat and movement combos are tones of fun, if not a little sensitive.",2
"wareframe is a damn good time, get three friends and play till your hearts content. i liked this game so much ive spent money on warframes and weapons in the real money market and i dont regret it, if anything its only made the game that much more fun. if you dont have the money to spend you can unlock almost anything just by playing enough. lots of cool feautres and a solid build.",1
"game is really focussed on borring farming of resources to make your character stronger. plot is really in the background and it is so generic and so obvious it can as good not be there. whats more game is really vulgar about trying to make you to use pay to win strategy. the only pros ive seen is an interesting graphics (theme + quality) and quite good mission group matching. if you want to play game about farming for items - install diablo iii - much more fun :p",1
"i buy honor pack but i did not recieve anything . why ? did just pay for nothing ?? really ? fix this issue or i want my money back please !",1
"warframe. futuristic ninjas in space with magic powers and abilities who can run along walls, shoot guns and slice (or smash!) their way through whatever they encounter. sound good? get stuck in, maggots.",1
"another one of those pay2win games. fortunately, the pvp is extremely bland, and everyone does the pve, so you can enjoy the games content to a degree without paying a dime. the entire game is a huge grind, with no sort of side activity or anything to mask it. it will be painful. it will be boring. though, the first few hours of gameplay, it will be fun, entertaining. with plenty of different playstyles, characters, and weapons (latter two require $, or extreme patience (10+ hours for materials to craft the itme you want if youre lucky)). but for the things you can experience for free, the fun melee combat, the special attacks, the stunning visuals (with bad texture pop-in :c) id have to give this game a 6.5/10.",1
"game says go in as a ninja... the reality is just go in kill everything then do the objective",1
"i love this game, just wish my parents hadnt gotten rid of it",1
"just a warning to any one intending to invest time into this game. through my own personal experience i have now lost months of playing time and hundreds of dollars because this company decides it was ok to delete my acount with out my knowledge now ive been side linded in support for almost a week the customer service is digusting and respond with aditude toward its customers, this businesss practice is disgusting and unacceptable. so just a note if u plan on playing and spending money you do it at youre own risk",2
"great demo, cant wait for the full game! what? its already a few years old? it feels so incompleet, but looks so good and new and fresh. so much potential, but all there is is grind and the developers rather add some cosmetics than actually build out the game to what it could be. also, if you stop playing after a while, they will kill your dog.",5
"its fun man so play it man just do it man you know you want to man",1
"great game at start things start to get boring after 300+(played 200+ house before connecting my warframe account to steam) hours of endless farming to get items that you want but the first 100 hours are amazing. the new contents added every update are really fun and if you are the type who like farming for items, warframe is one of the best games for you. new prime gears and new warframes every major updates or some of the sub updates give an additional 20-50 hours to farm all the items so if you wait patiently for the updates, warframe could be a never ending fun for you. ive quit warframe now but i still enjoyed the hours that ive played in warframe. its a great game to get and i also reccommend buying platinum just for weapon and warframe slots.",2
"its got space ninjas and explosions and wallrunning and shiny weapons and big swords and its free.",1
"its an amazing looking game and feels like your in the game whilst you play you run up walls kick people in the face and did i meantion your a ing alien",1

"ive played this game on and off for quite some time now, both the pc and ps4 versions. i must say it is a lot of fun. i find myself coming back with wach and every update with more excitement than the last, and i am a founder and have been playing since the second patch.",1

"awesome gameplay, upgrades, graphics, etc.. this game is highly addictive. thanks to the developers for an awesome experience. :)",1
"this game has great graphics and a good selection of weapons. further more the game offers a huge selection of different types of warfames so that players can have a wide selection of playstyles to choose from. the only thing the game lacks is different kinds of creative game modes. also wondering when will they make a rhino prime.",2
"chopping, slicing, dicing, shooting, and rhino . 10/10 best ninja",4
"i am stuck to this game, i love it so much, that i sold my bills hat and my earbuds to get some platinum. i dont know why, but it just captured me like i was a fish and warframe is the fisher. love it, amazing f2p, sometimes buggy and glitchy. 10/10 would buy",4
"its a fantastik game with alot of content, the co-op shooter feels original. but it do have a bunch of bugs, so it would be great if you tried to fix them, just for an update (like chrashing getting stuck in walls randomly dying stuff like that). and could you use another ip then 3960 and 3962 my pc keeps blocking those.",7
"ninjas in space. what more do you need? this is a free to play third-person shoot-um-and-slash-um-up game with a variety of play styles and weaponry. there is not really as much pay to win mechanics as pay to speed up progression, which normally might take a day waiting for something to craft, which will be done by the time you wake up the next day usually.",6

"its not a pay to play and play to win game....nice",2
"better then destiny thats for sure. okay, you need to buy weapon slots. warframe slots. and more random crap... but hell, this game often has events where you can get paid items for free as a sure thing for a victory, unlike destiny.. warframe offers randomly generated maps in whole deck of different themes, making grinding bareable. unlike destiny... sure destiny has a better pvp system, but wait another two years and warframe will have a way better pvp system then destiny. so long story short, play warframe (or borderlands) and never ever pay for destiny.",2

"amazing game, takes the best of mass effect 3s multiplayer and expands it. it is also a nice plus that when you pay for things the devs dont laugh in your face, that money is put back into the game and it shows. this is the best f2p models out there.",6
"50/10 play this game if: you like a good grind if you want to feel like superman if you want to oppertunity to kick some  out of pay-to-win players if you like dismembering things if you want awesome movement mechanics if you want to fly like a badass in space if you like a challenging co-op or solo game if you like to craft things if you like to die a lot when playing single player (challenging as ) if you like really challenging levels with gold-plated enemies if you dont want to pay money then get this game. pros: graphics that kicked skyrims  when it came out you are a ing ninja music that you can tune-in or tune-out amazing gameplay and character animations enemies that know how to dodge, while you dont you get your own spaceship and its front window is ing amazing its absolutely free and not in any way pay to win you can play it on your  laptop different tilesets between planets constant ing updates cons: the fun kind of grindy stuff takes actual time to build (good for casual players) playing things solo is ing hard",4

"its a fun game but it has many issues. important (downlad from warframe website and not steam!) when you first download it it gets around 6 gigs of data, then when you launch it it patches the game. so if you try to verify or backup the game you lose all fiels and it will donload the 6 gigs again, and then patch it again. save yourself some headache and download the game from the warframe website. i gave it a thumbs up cuz its a good game but man i had to download this game 3 times already and that is not fun.",1

"this game is by far the most detailed free game to play. truly remarkable graphics and with each update, it only gets. better. but there two aspects i would like to bring to the players who would like to play warframe: 1. the game severly punishes you if you truly wish to enjoy the game, as it will force you to play for many many hours to get new warframe and weapons. 2. although a game that does force you to play a long time, i must say the player community is the most helpful and fun than that i have experienced in any game yet. so making friends to help you gather the stronger weapons can be much more fun, eventually ending up with something more valuable than those top tier weapons. a friend x3 anyway, i hope you enjoy the game. the game of warframe.",1
"interesting concept and pretty fun to play. it gets to grindy and repetetive later though,",1
"overall it is a good game pros: *good graphics *nice fight scenes cons: *needs a warframe account *it does not serves you breakfast",1

"a repetative, samey third-person-shooter with no real entertainment value. the constant micro-managing of upgrades and the same enemies through the same corridors for the same missions over and over, doesnt appeal to me at all. worst of all is that the game locks your warframe when you choose it, and wont allow you to change it for a minimum of 4 days, and thats after youve spent hours searching for random drops for the resources you need to construct a new warframe. all-in-all, not a very good game.",1

"this is a great game! it is all about the way you play! when i got my bow i still havent gotten rid of it becuase it is a full charge one shot. but i dont really care if you get the game or not but i would definetly reccomend it if you want a cool kind of power and action kind of thing. but if i were to have to compare it to another game it would be a good version of destiny, so its good so far and if you dont have money that doesnt matter! its free!!!!!",1

"this game is amazing if ur into the thrills of adventure and fighting aliens!",1
"ok, ive decided to come back and rereview this game. with all the updates and small changes, its alot better, and it doesnt feel as boring and samey. the particle effects can chug the frame rate, but other then that the graphics are still top notch. the weapons are kinda bullet hosey, but with what ive been using its still nice and responsive. the melee attacks feel better, some how, the have more impact then nothing. playing with others is definatly were this game shines, but keep in mind your revives. the whole self revive is a bit annoying when you run out, as you need to pay, so thats a tad stingy. overall the business model is somewhat fair. you get credits faster and level up faster so it doesnt feel like a grind. i now do recommend the game, as it is much better, and deserves extensive play, even if not in one sitting. however, the business model isnt perfect, and can feel aggresive, so be warned",3

"nice gameplay, stealth, and fighting.. also the gore..",1

"alot of fun but needs some work on the pvp elament.",1
"i was initially wary of playing yet another f2p pay-if-you-want-to-enjoy-it game, but warframe defied all my expectations and ended up highly entertaining. you can play it casually, with yourself and a couple buddies/random internet dudes, or you can play it competitively with a large clan. the variety of cooperative pve missions and the different unlockable characters/weapons/giant swords keep you coming back for more. the pvp isnt as fun, due to the unbalanced nature of certain warframes, but its gradually getting better. graphically, all i can say is the visual style is distinctively warframe. each faction has unique challenges and levels, as well as distinctive themes. the tenno faction, the one you play as, utilize warframes - insectlike suits of incredible power. id pick this game up and try it at least once. its free, after all, and while the real money currency, platinum, is useful it is not required to progress.",5

"ill be honest, i havent really played much of this game but from what i have played so far, it is really fun! a lot of people are talking about the grind here which i havent gotten on to yet but im sure it is there. so far, paying to get certain items doesnt seem like a necessity and can be avoided. its really fun and probably one of the best f2p games on steam right now. great for co-op!",1

"exellent graphics, slightly confusing at first leveling system(started on beta release may have change the tutorial), has optional pathways for story line but you can branch out every single way, parkcour is decent in the game, tactical or simple your choice, gameplay youll never forget with friends. i love this game",3

"warframe is by far one of the best f2p games i have ever played in a while. the presentation is great, the atmosphere, the gameplay is fun and addicting, it makes you want to constantly evolve your character, you can play it with friends or alone with other people online. the game developers constantly update the game, having in consideration fans feedback, which makes for a great and overall fun game. if you are looking for a new game to try out and get lost in, warframe is definitely a top contender nowadays.",2
"this game isnt for pipel that go for realism, not for monsters not for magic or physics, but for feeling the combat, fight.. action. lemme explain: u come near any enemy and when u swing with ur melee weapon, do ur melee attack, it doeznt matter if u hit an enemy with a blade, or grip, or pole on hammer instead of hammers head, u will still give damage which iznt important how much, whatz important iz, game mechanic. it workz great! u do all sortz of parkour $hit but when u need to feel d hit into an opponent, u dont. even when u jump from 20m on enemys head, nothing happenz.",5

"when it first came out it was good, but with change after change the developers watered down the warframes and made this a pay-to-win game instead of a free-to-play game. it was good while it lasted, but youre better off getting something else. path of exile is easily the best f2p game, and yes, ive thrown them money for a job well done.",4

"yet another disappointing free to play game. what is it nowadays with these games overcomplicating everything? nobody cares about story or context. no-one wants to spend time in unintuitive user interfaces. a free-to-play should be instant jump in and play without the need for a tutorial. warframe is yet another brick in the wall of free to play games that make no effort to attract your attention unless you are willing to play it for hundreds of hours. the graphics are horrible, controls arent smooth and general gameplay is dull.",1

"i know im a harsh reviewer, but some positive reviews of this game really baffles me. the physics in this game have been programmed by an 8 years old. your character moves and especially jumps in an horrendously wierd way, like any time makes me say what?!?! and so you never know what to expect, thus making it quite difficult to control and to make him do what you want to do. yeah, i suppose that if you play it extensively you can get accustomed to crappy physics too, but why bother? this makes melee combat a total joke. ranged combat is not bad, but its really not enough. even more... theres no pvp, just co-op.",2

"dont be fooled by my steam profile, i have 400+ hours on this game from before i started playing on steam. the first few months were good, but i left for a while because of work and computer issues. when i came back, the damage system was completely different, and all of the maps and missions got very repetitive. as my friends all left the game, i noticed that the only reason that i played was because of the co-op with my friends. if you have no one to play with, it gets pretty boring and repetitive.",1

"this game is overrated people go on and on and on about this game when truly, its just not good.",1
"this game, man ive played it a lot and in truth, i cant honestly tell you why. it isnt terrible, no where close in fact, but the developers just dont seem to want to advance it beyond anything more than a concept. as a result there still is virtually no campaign to speek of. the game consists solely of grinding the same missions (sometimes 100s of times) to get items and blueprints to build new weapons and frames... and thats about it. whats annoying is the fact that, if the developers actually tried to make the gameplay (beyond farming for farmings sake) better then there is a lot of potential for a really good game here. unfortunatly, after having played since the middle of last year i cant really see this happening ever. with each update comes more frames and weapons to grind, but beyond small ui changes and fixes to bugs no progress in expanding the game is really made. if you do decide to play this, just bear in mind that beyond just farming for materials etc there is nothing else to keep your enjoyment. a great concept let down by poor developement vision and foresight.",7
"i only played for 15 minutes. the intro and one mission. then i was left to try and figure out where to go next and for some reason, everything was locked off and i couldnt go further and tbh, i couldnt care to go further. if you enjoy it, great... but i found it to be esoteric and terse, which is not a very good feeling to have by a new player. maybe in the future, when i feel like checking it out, i will google some video tutorials on youtube but not tonight.",1

"warframe was fun for a while and running around as a space ninja is very cool, but it ended up being very repetitive after a time. having only 3 factions to fight in the same boring corridors got old very quick. in addition, the way the mod system is designed mean that weapon and warframe upgrading essentially becomes dependent on the games random number generator meaning that just playing for a long time does not guarantee any sort of improvement in a players stats. it eventualy felt like a grind to just find the right mods and it causes players to rush through levels just to reach the end instead of having fun fighting. the game is also very pushy about microtransactions by making some items completely unobtainable unless you purchase them with ingame money (platinum) and by making the creating of some items (namely, warframes) very tedious to do on your own by requiring you to posess the blueprints for 3 different parts, craft them each, then craft the final warframe with yet another bluerpint. by comparison, you can purchase the completed frame along with a pre-installed catalyst (an item that improves the mod capacity of a warframe) for a few bucks. i feel like ive had my fill of this game for now. perhaps i will come back later if some serious changes are made to the progression system.",2

"its quite good yes i know, i played it for 12 hours but after that it just seemed pointless whitout buying things, because i couldnt get a better weapon/warframe after 12 hours of grinding, really stay away from this game, unelss you want to wait 24 hours before next rank, or 15 hour to craft a helmet, this is a real p2win game horibble, but its quite good if you pay alot of money;)",1
"one of the worst games you could ever play. i would explain why... but it isnt worth my time, nor is it yours.",1
"its a big p2w but you can unlock all those things which can be bought by real money with game money but also you have to work a lot for it with crafting system and except the harsh true that no cutscenes and a hardcore storyline it`s fun to slash your enemies and stuff but also there are tons of hackers and you can complete mos missions by just running",1
"its free and fun to play until you realize all the best warframes and weapons and stuff requires lots of grinding even then you gotta wait set amount of hours for your stuff to forge or you can pay money to unlock them out right(not worth it imo). could of been great if the gameplay had more to it, just shoot through levels reach the end with different variations but in general the same concept. i liked the game but realized its just to grind heavy and bit pay-wallish to have any real fun. if you like games wear you can grind with buddies then go for it,otherwise theres plenty more ftp games to try. still had fun with it in the 16-17hrs i put in the game",1
"i dont recommend this game to those who either have a budget,or time is something precious to you. it takes hours to find blueprints to make weapons. it may be easier for those with money or with alot of time,but for people like me with no mney and no time, things just go very wrong. high levels are high levels due to massive amounts of time they invest into the game including money as well. some of you may disagree and say thats not true,it isnt pay to win or its easy to get materials and blueprints. those of you who say that think to yourself how the late warframe gamers that log on for the first time ever,after the game has been out for a whole year, no one is i nthe nooby area, guilds consist of high levels going about there daily thing. while noobs can join in and try to take on high levels with their guilds. nothing changes, time kicks in,the ability to stay alive long enough to get anything in a mission. it may just be my opinion,but for people who need to work for money,and cant sit around half the day to acquire materials and blueprints will see it a bit differently. the game have been easier back then, but it isnt now, the game has progress to far to support any new players,unless they have money to invest. so before you downlod this game and waste away a few gb think about what i wrote here.",3

"pros : hack and slash game with impressive visuals and faily stable client in a outer-space settings with fast paced combat that would be enjoyable to most casual players. cons : the progression in warframe is almost nonexistent. you could buy everything you need either from the in-game shop or from other players using real money currency platinum. the reward to effort ratio isnt designed well. players refer to the reward distribution system as rng god which is basically a lottery ticket system, you could spend countless hours farming a certian weapon or a component to no avail.the game starts with an average difficulty setting but as you progress it becomes even easier and less challenging. enemies and levels do not scale well with how players do and it has been like this for a very long time. the development team is spending less time fixing certian broken parameters in the game and more time on new content just to keep the majority of casual players around.",4
"honestly. this game is great, and it was one of my favorite time kills. however, it is a very demanding game. when i first started playing, having nothing and everything was new , the game offered me a great time sink with a feel good reward system as i progressed. at some point i hit a content wall, and had nothing more to do so i went off and played a few other games. the first few major updates kept me heavily invested, i have spent around 100 dollars or more because of how addictive the gameplay was. however as time went on, the game.. got more tedious. at the current place where my character is, id need to grind missions to get gear. im no fan of grinding, at all. and worse yet its not light grinding its hardcore paying for advancement is easier why are you even bothering kind of grinding now. to me, the game has died. it has so much more content now, but it feels like it is built moreso for those who are willing to pay, then the original free players are competitive too stance it originally started with. i would not recommend this game, unless you are strapped for cash. although if thats the case youll probably end up fustrated as i am with the demanded grind.",2
"this game was very interesting and fun back in january but after a while i started to grow more distant to it each day, and i grew more fond of it each day. i quit for a few weeks back in may and i just couldnt stop the temtation to play this game again, so i played it again. then there was the day satan had a nasty plot : he made de make update 14 or should i say nuke of death update that almost no one will enjoy! after the update i was very very very angry, made a video on all the flaws they made at the time (note that there are still flaws i didnt go over), and stopped playing a game that i thought was one of the greatest games ever. i strongly suggest if you are new to this game you will be fine but quite a few vetrans like me quit because of the blights that they put on this game.",3
"as it is now, it has potential but it gets boring and repetetive pretty fast. missions are all basicly the same, go do something and face hordes of foes. stealth doesnt seem to work and once you break stealth there are endless hordes of enemies who automaticly know where you are. it has potential as i said though, more imaginative missions or even a greater variety, fixing stealth and such would do the trick in my opinion.",2

"the problem with this game is simple: it never feels like youre progressing, because every step you take just opens more and more meaningless grind opportunities, and every update just piles more and more to it, be a new frame, weapon, mod or resource. that there are mods so essential to your progress locked behind a shit of a rng is one of the most stupid and hostile gameplay designs i have encountered. add to that the gameplay changes they do every now and then, nerfs that make your already  weapons completely useless, changes to damage types and values, new weapons that completely outclass the previous ones, new resources that require more grinding, etc... and it all becomes meaningless and disheartening. and if you want to play solo youre in for a world of hurt with so much grind, rng locked content and 4 player balanced missions, a lot of then required to unlock new planets and with it, resources. its not worth it, so i stopped playing. nothing changed, nothing got better or made the game more fun or less of a chore (quite to the contrary), most of my playtime was spent trying to get the essential mods so that my weapons become useful enough to kill waves and waves of enemies quickly for me to solo through the missions and unlock new planets, where i would repeat the same process, while slowly gathering resources and blueprints to craft a marginally better weapon or frame that would become useless by the next update. rinse and repeat, ad infinitum.",2
"best free to play game out there in my opinion. it takes time to build up your weapons and frames, though that is the point of the game. unlocking everything. you can pay for items. some are purely decorational, some are weapons/frames/pets. things you cant buy:the best weapons/mods in the game. if only every ftp game went with the no buying power model. and then they changed everything and went back on about every promise they made in the days before there were more than just the excalibur prime.",6

"some of the gameplay mechanics are a bit flawed. the graphics are top notch, no doubt, and some of the fighting abilities are distinct to this game only, but a game needs to bring more depth for me personally. this lacks even a tiny bit of strategy for the most part, being a team oriented game, but even that felt weak. i felt as if the teamplay wasnt cohesive enough. like everyone on the team has little impact on the actions of the other against the enemy. it is a cooperative versus enemy, but thats about it. still felt like a free-for-all action in the end for me and after playing a few hours i removed the game from my collection.",1

"this game was fun. i enjoyed it for a prolonged period of time after being diagnosed with late-life, high-functioning autism disorder. then it turned out to be completely awful because de is a bunch of money-loving potatoes. imagine if your favorite black ops character was replaced with a man in a monkey suit that made various shouts when he entered combat. im not giving you anymore j-tokens, you cheeky breeky fast-flyers.",2
"this game got boring and repetetive very fast. it uses the tactic of just throwing a lot of enemies at you and hope for the best. it is free, so no real loss if you still want to try it, but i don`t think it is worth anyones time.",1
"this game is designed to make you pay or grind for ages.combat is standard, the parkour system is clunky, the melee system is useless and to get anything i have to do the same missions over and over and if you do pay you get everything immediately. seriously  this game",1
"im more so on the fence about wether or not to recomend it. the game is fun no doubt, but if you arnt willing to spend money its almost worthless effort. you can get most items ingame without paying, but you have to craft them and some parts are extremely rare. colors for cutomization is very limited if you dont want to pay. no alternative helmets can be obtained without paying. the mastery tests that you have to beat to level up, are lets face it, broken. they are extremely difficult if you dont want to pay (next to impossible if you dont have or know what mods need to be equiped). i had to beat the first test twice for it to count. some missions spawn an infinite number of enemies, ive been stuck on the same mission for the past 2 days, because there are way too many enemies. i would say wait till they fix some of this before getting it.",1

"while this game is fun and action packed, it can get extremely repetative and pointless. the game is fun to play with friends, but it can be absolutely mind-numbing to play by yourself. pros -great graphics and lots of shiny environments -action packed -the different warframes have a few unique elements that make for some fun gameplay -in theory, you can build the warframes (the ones you would usually have to buy) cons -game is super grindy -environments, while pretty, become stale after a while. you are basically in the same 4 or 5 different environments with slightly different layouts -the system to level up cards to gain powers is interesting, but again the grind... -little to non-existant story -certain warframes are completely unbalanced (namely the ones you have to buy) -most things worth building take forever to create this was a fun game, but at the end of the day i cant recommend it. theres way too much grind and not enough going on behind the scenes. this is a fun little coop game to play with your friends, but youll quickly start to feel the repetition as you reach the 10-15 hour mark. there are some games that are super grindy but hide it well behind interesting gameplay, a good story, or a variety of builds to work towards. this game is not one of them.",1
"a 3rd person over-the-shoulder fps. i personally didnt like the game. the controls felt a little clunky. whilst the graphics were nice, a lot of the levels were poorly lit, and it was hard to pick out the enemies. teams were really hit and miss - with one person racing off to the finish, leaving team mates behind. the tutorial leaves you to pick from a number of planets across the solar system, but the only choice is mercury - a little tip to say pick this first would have been nice.",1

"some of the gameplay mechanics are a bit flawed. the graphics are top notch, no doubt, and some of the fighting abilities are distinct to this game only, but a game needs to bring more depth for me personally. this lacks even a tiny bit of strategy for the most part, being a team oriented game, but even that felt weak. i felt as if the teamplay wasnt cohesive enough. like everyone on the team has little impact on the actions of the other against the enemy. it is a cooperative versus enemy, but thats about it. still felt like a free-for-all action in the end for me and after playing a few hours i removed the game from my collection.",1
"a bit confusing and not quite to my taste. the gameplay seems sloppy, and the lack of any real direction make this game a turd.",1
"this game was fun. i enjoyed it for a prolonged period of time after being diagnosed with late-life, high-functioning autism disorder. then it turned out to be completely awful because de is a bunch of money-loving potatoes. imagine if your favorite black ops character was replaced with a man in a monkey suit that made various shouts when he entered combat. im not giving you anymore j-tokens, you cheeky breeky fast-flyers.",2
"this game got boring and repetetive very fast. it uses the tactic of just throwing a lot of enemies at you and hope for the best. it is free, so no real loss if you still want to try it, but i don`t think it is worth anyones time.",1
"warframe is a fun game when you first start out. things are new, the concept is cool and there looks like a lot of things to do. then you realize it is nothing but grinding the same 4-5 mission types over and over and over to get a resource that doesnt come fast enough to actually have you access any of the different frames/weapons. it isnt pay to win in the sense that it isnt a pvp game (there is pvp in it but there is no support for it and it is horribly inbalanced because of that), but if you want to do anything fun, be prepared to drop some money on it. after about a week or so of playing the game and giving them money so that i could actually use a weapon besides the basic ones and play a frame that wasnt one of the three you can choose at the start (you dont get to keep all three, just the one you pick initially), it became one of the most boring games i could think of playing. also, there is nothing in the game that is hard. the game has a mode where the enemy gets stronger the longer you are in it, but with four half intelligent people, you could all fall asleep before it became something that required the attention of three people, let alone four. if youre looking for a quick fix with money to blow, try it out. otherwise, dont bother.",2
"so i get to a rank up mission, and i fail it, because i suck at killling stuff. and when i try it again, it tellls me i cant try again for 24 hours. what a ing joke. digital extremes can go  themselves.",1
"really hard to even start to play without friends already playing and into the game. while the games starting tutorial/first missions are a great learning curve, it really doesnt show you anything on how to best team up, socialise or interact with other players",1
"play the first 3 levels and boom, thats the game, rush as fast as possible to the end and skip 3/4 of the mobs. would not reccommend, gets boring after an hour.",6
"awesome game, i like the mass effect 3rd person shooter feel. however it is too much of a grind if you do not want to spend money on the game.",1
"it is a fun game but over time i noticed that the levels are all the same, the enemies are the same or re-textured. honestly though if you dont mind these things play the game it is fun. but i wouldnt reccomend it.",1

"amazing graphics, well optimized, its a blast.... for a while. the game gets repetitive quick, and there doesnt seem to be any great end-game value. by the time youve invested way too much time you realize that its just a p2w grind-fest with no real direction or purpose.",2
"grindy but not fun at the beginning the content is good but later the game is boring grindy",3
"screw this game. period. second mission in it completely destroyed itself and my computer would pop up with a blue screen every time i logged on to my computer. the little bit of gameplay i experienced was enjoyable, but that literally game-breaking bug is completely unforgivable. consider yourself warned; play at your own risk...",1
"this game ing sucks. i cant even complete the first mission without dying. pay to win",1
"this game is terrible. i really dont understand how people can even play this game, or why it has such a large following, becaue it is truly a gpos (giant piece of ). anyone who plays this game, and is on my friends list, please do me the favor of removing yourself from it.",1
"this game is meant for consols at home not computers its laggy it is hard to control and most of the things you need to buy the coins to get it",1
"this game had promise. it is too bad that it was ruined by the f2p pay model. after only a few missions it forces the player into a grind session just like any other f2p game. instead of focusing on game mechanics, design, and fun, the game is about repeating the same stupid levels over and over and over just to get enough credits to upgrade an absolutely necessary mod by one degree (or just to get the mod), in order to advance through to the next mission. i would have gladly paid $60 or even a monthly fee to play a game with real content and real fun. too bad this game chose the f2p model, theyll not get a cent from me.",1
"game is poorly optimized, graphics are a little dull. the game itself gets boring after playing the first 20 hours, theres nothing to do except play a level and get loot. levels are the same basically, the maps get boring. its hard to get certain materials to craft items. overall, if you really want to enjoy the game youre going to have to spend a lot of money on the game. i do not recommend this game and i am giving it a 3 out of 10 for its dull graphics, bad optimization and common server problems.",1
"fun game, but, after a while it becomes midly repetative.",4
"i cannot play multiplayer games. when i enter the squad and the game starts, i am logged out of the squad and cant play. please fix it and wil be a great game as it used to be.",1
"from gameplay on youtube it looks like a good game. and it is. but the system requirements were misleading and it really does not run on my computer even though i fit the minimum requirements.",1
"ive rewritten my review about four times now, and each time has been a fairly positive review, until now. currently, warframe isnt doing that great. many players are sitting around in a state of impatience for new content, and the many updates weve had still has not satisfied many players. we are missing many things such as polish, endgame, and fixes to some current issues. as much as id like warframe to succeed, i cannot recommend the game to anybody looking into playing it. other than the issues we have and the things we are months later than we should have them, getting into the game is extremely difficult and time consuming. even 200 hours in, i doubt you would be even close to top tier content unless you were really good, are good at studying a game wikia, and had help. by the time you get as far as i have, you will very likely feel unsatisfied with where warframe currently is and with the lack of content to go by. you will also be frustrated with digital extremes for not releasing any good content, and you will hope from update in to update out that de will release something great, but in the end you will be sorely disappointed. i intend to change my review to a yes if they start making good releases and show that they know what they are doing, but until then i intend to give a no. take care, xievie",8
"this is ing . idk if i can recommend this game because it wont let me play it xd this game wont lemme download it.",1
"pure grinding. the grinding emphasis is so strong that most games are just people running through the levels, ignoring all enemies, to the end to finish the stage and get the rewards. new players will be lost as they try to fight and actually play the game. it becomes a look how fast i can run through this stage simulator. graphics are cool, story is cool, gameplay idea is cool. though everything got exploited into a weird grindy running game. many people will enjoy this, no doubt. i didnt get hooked though, and i love grindy games.",1
"great game, but used up all my memory, turned my desktop purple, and all the icons are gone now... :p",1
"i give this game 2.5 out of 4 stars. explanation: -1 star due my character getting stuck in walls just about anytime i use the run on walls skill. -.5 star due to difficulty setting up keybindings for use on a pc. this game would be much better played with a game controller - thank goodness the game has such an option or i would have taken a whole star away instead of half. the positives are: excellent graphics and character detail along with an awesome story line.",1

"a good game, and there is some real fun to be had however it is so buggy and unstable that it just ruins the experience. it becomes really annoying when you are getting higher levels and really need to finish a level and it glitches out all the damned time. so in its current state, i couldnt reccomend this game.",1

"where to start with this one... well first off, i like the ghrapics, the gameplay, and the abilities. however, after a couple hours of playing, i noticed that the enemies started doing way more damage, and i was doing roughly the same as i started out. so i decided to look for a new stronger weapon. i find out, that you cant buy a weapon thats better using the in game credits. oh no. you have to buy the currency using real money, in order to get a decent weapon. its that, or you can do the facebook style of upgrading, buy the blue print, play a level a half dozen times to find a resource, and then hopefully after a day of grinding you have what you need. did i mention, the fact you cant kill the enemies even on the first level anymore, because their difficulty progressed with you? >.>... so good luck getting those resources! yet another potentially great game, turned to  from greed. i would have much rather paid 50-60 bucks for the game, and the ability to progress with ingame credits that i didnt have to buy, versus having to buy 20 dollars worth of game money, for a single weapon. really. as for those of you who fell victim to that, and want to hold onto that pride so to speak, of this being a great game, it is, sure, but only for about 45 minutes.",1

"it is fun olny if you have lots of money. cons: 1. the trade system is flawed. you can buy in game currency called platnum with real money and buy any thing from new warframes to weapons to invintory slots, but it is also tradeable. there lies the problem. people want to trade in game items for your hard spent money only. player to player trades olny work if the buyer has in game real money platnum. no item for item trades are seen or done. 2. the chat system is messed up as 99% of any text message is lost with out the person it was directed to sees it. the chat folds into the side never letting you know if somthing was said out side of the current squad, like in a clan or pm. voice is there but limited to current squad and most people turn that off all togeather. pros: 1. uniqe gameplay makes it fun. just up untill you want to make any weapon or warframe stronger.

"worst visual experience ever. mouse lags so bad. motion blur makes me think im actually blind. the first half an hour i didnt know how to play and i was looking at planets because the menus didnt appear until i reset my game. really micro-transaction based. cannot upgrade anything even buy putting in the hours into the game. if the currency for the game was cheaper id think about buying some points, but its not worth it because everything that requires it is also overpriced",1

"is the gameplay good? i honestly have no idea. i played the game a while ago and really enjoyed it. i decided to get it on steam. however, when i did this there was a massive camera glitch in the missions. the mission/world select screen worked perfectly however the cmera glitched out and i just saw a mesh of green colours. i asked in the chat for help and it was full of unsociable and a trolly community. i looked through a help section and again had no help. maybe if this was sorted out i could have recommended the game, but its simply buggy. the new patches havent fixed the bug, so i guess i just have to do something else until then.",1

"even with all unusual style and gameplay this game is terrible, because it requires tons of your time to grind, so you can get decent items/mods and become a player, who worth something. my favorite weapons was nerfed, new classes overpowered and old ones was nerfed hard. this game was made to suck money, because without donation you will waste many hours of trying to complete missions you want or get items you need. with money in your pocket you can easily get everything and turn on easy mode. ive played long time ago and it was decent, there was of course one of the starting classes, that could win everything in solo, but the rest of them was useful. now everything changed in a bad way. i am very disappointed.",2
"i more of a fan of first person shooter and also the mouse movement is to sensitive",1
"my friends have been going on and on about this game for a little over a year now and so i thought id try it out. no thanks. its really dry, maps feel cramped, it just doesnt seem to move well to me. if youre heavier into 3rd person shooters id say go for it, but i feel like it was laggy and not worth the space on my hard drive.",1
"great game lots of fun. to bad it comes with to many bugs and crashes and these just take the fun out of the game. fix these and i would recommend it but for now i wont",1
"its a simple 3rd person shooter that feels like youre playing by yourself even when you arent. i got on and played a round alone and it was just lacking something, but it was alright. then i tried out the online game play and this is where i would take a few things into consideration before using up hard drive space. the idea of the game, after reading up is that every unit is individual and contributes to the larger team effort in a unique way. great concept! however it falls so flat that one might believe that it was tossed off the top of the empire state building. it turns into a run and outgun frag fest where all you end up doing if trying to get the most kills and score the most loot while leaving everyone else behind. the exp has nothing to do with team preformance or teamwork and instead only values the indiviual. thus turning what could be a great teamwork experience into super mario party with guns.",1
"do not buy this game its a great concept with good game mechanics but it is completely ruined by pay to play and more or less all of the interesting items you will never get because the grinding is stupidly tedious, also you have this 4 revive a day system so you cannot even grind for long periods of time. this game is great but yet another game ruined by micro transactions",1
"warning: this game and its studio (warframe/ digitalextreme) has sold to perfect world entertainment on july/2/2014. pwe has a long history of bad reputation and not before long warframe will become one of its revenue machine. right now they are banning people talking about pwe in forum/stream. this game has its moments but its time to move on.",4
"looks fun to play but keep crashing every 5 minutes or less ...",1
"its fun at the start, gets old fast. dont get me wrong, if you like runescape, youll like this. +godly graphics +rediculous mechanics +lots of content -replayability is very low if you dont want to pay -very buggy movement -no sense of progression -have to grind -ai are really dumb and easily beaten",2

"my game launcher would not download the newest update.",1
"theres a few reasons i do not reccomend this game and theyre real simple. there is a lot of lag, the missions are not that clear, it takes for ever to figure out how things work, and when you do itll still not work the way it was supposed to because you pressed the wrong key or something. it also gives me headaches byond belief. the game has potential, and id say to give it a try, but its just not for me.",1
"warframe may be a costless game, but i cant think of a single person i would recommend it to. way too many other free-to-play options exist to even bother with it.",3
"game has some potential, a bit too deep in warframesque words/ language. can use some tutorials better than it offers (wiki). has serious issues in connecting player to player, which is its format and possible death to the game. warframes mantra seems to be connection lost to host, returning to multiplayer menu",8
"this game has a verry basic tutorial that only teaches you how to swap wepons move and so on but the game has allot of features that it pretty much just throws at you like they are simple and easy to use but they arent. also the game is more like a store than a game virtually all of the wepons and warframes will cost you real money.",1
"very fun game to play with a lot to do at the start, customize anything about your character and buy items via the store. the only downside to this game is that as you get towards the end of the game it gets repetitive.",1

"ultra-fast-paced dungeon crawling, mmo, rpg, shooter, hack-n-slash. a robust tutorial to make the tiresome and difficult early game easier and a very expansove end-game round out this package. pros: graphics; if graphics are your thing this will deliver, absolutly gorgeous maxxed, but youre going to need a decent computer pros; armory: there are tons of different weapons to choose from pruimary, secondary and melee. cons: armory; once you find the warframe and weapons that let you win, it gets old really fast. community: the community is great when its not awful . rumors of devs having a secret war against one clan or another seem unfounded on the surface as the devs and the community at large are helpful in all ways to both new (and long time gone) players.",4

"all free games have 2 types of currency, the kind you pay for with real money (platinum), and the kind you get from playing the game and completing levels. this game is no exception, but there are some companies that take advantage of this and become pay to win (basically, this means that if you dont pay real money, you cant compete with the people that do). thankfully, this game has a healthy balance. it is possible to get everything (except cosmetics) from playing the game, in fact, there are even things you cant buy from the market place using any kind of currency. all you need is patience. if you dont want to wait, then you can pay real money and get everything then. if you want the prime weapons, there are 2 ways to get them: 1) buy them from other players (this means that there is no set price for any one item, all prices are based on supply and demand and/or the niceness of the seller/buyer) or 2) you can earn them from running missions in the void (the void being a node system that increases in difficulty and offers different rewards for different missions on different difficulties). do i recommend this game? heck yeah!!",6

"amazing game even better as its free :d go play it now",1
"good 3rd person shooter, great customisation but my only issue is like most free games nearly all the items cost way too much (most have to be bought with converted money to in game points), the transaction cost from real money to in game credits is simply silly. i would like to give them a bit of money for the game but not at that rate. i.e 125 in game points is 6.99 when 125p wont get you a new character. 75p is to unlock a colour pallet! one! of the pallets. that said!! it is still a fun shooter with some interesting moves and a good story line. so id say give this game a go!",1
"9/10 i liked it alot and the game play was amasing but aside from all that it is nearly impossible to get your platium back without having to pay it annoys me because that means you have to be mlg pro to beat levels without revives and auto refill is ridiculously over priced to my standards of a free2play, its is a great game dont get me wrong but as soon as your revives go its nearly impossible to advance further into the game restasured this game is great but i would like to see more platium in the future.",1
"nothing is more satisfiying then cutting multiple enemies in half with one slice",1
"i played this game a while back when it was still in beta. i have to say it was quite addictive and fun to play. if you enjoy the concept of space ninjas, fps, along with having melee weapons as an option, then you will certainly find enjoyment here. personally i love the art direction and style of this game, the frames themselves are designed beautifully. on the flip side, if you are looking for an extensive storyline and/or plot, and character development, or pvp, then this will not be the game for you. overall though, if you want a fun game to play, then give it a shot, it is a lot of fun. (after not playing for a while, and seeing it now offered on steam, i am going to be getting giving it another go).",2
"i would recommend this game to people who are willing to spend a lot of money on things like customization and upgrades, unless you can enjoy the standalone fun of the free game.",1

"i started this game back in version 7.0 and it was amazing. i spent enough time on it to make it worth spending cash on it, and it didnt disappoint. when update 10 came out i was a bit warry of the new ui and redone stamina system. but all in all it was still great. then version 11 came out... they completely remade the damage system, ruining many peoples builds, changing the weaknesses of the enemies, limiting your options dramatically. melee weapons became almost useless, formerly amazing guns were now junk, and everything you spent money on was wasted. the time and effort people put into this game when they loved it, when it wasnt overcomplicated, was good. i loved the game. but change is always make-or-break for anything and in this case it broke me. ill look back fondly on my time playing the game, but that was a different time. pros: -space ninjas -graphics -audio cons: -cash items are overpriced -takes forever to craft things -takes even longer to get the parts to craft them -dont even get me started on neurodes... -damage 2.0 made things far more involved -all the remakes of the maps are harder to navigate -its now hard to distinguish enemies from friends, and those from the terrain -boss changes that make no sense -harder to navigate the menus than it used to be, your character even gets in the way now.",2

"warframe, whether being played casually or in a more hardcore direction, offers plenty of entertainment. from loot drops to grinds, the game is a wonderful change of scenery in the seemingly bloated, dull f2p category in which were all trying to fill a void with. although yes, there are some options to spend money, there is nothing required. everything can be bought after desiring and grinding for it. all in all, id give this game 8/10. i indeed recommend.",1

"another one of those pay2win games. fortunately, the pvp is extremely bland, and everyone does the pve, so you can enjoy the games content to a degree without paying a dime. the entire game is a huge grind, with no sort of side activity or anything to mask it. it will be painful. it will be boring. though, the first few hours of gameplay, it will be fun, entertaining. with plenty of different playstyles, characters, and weapons (latter two require $, or extreme patience (10+ hours for materials to craft the itme you want if youre lucky)). but for the things you can experience for free, the fun melee combat, the special attacks, the stunning visuals (with bad texture pop-in :c) id have to give this game a 6.5/10.",1

"great demo, cant wait for the full game! what? its already a few years old? it feels so incompleet, but looks so good and new and fresh. so much potential, but all there is is grind and the developers rather add some cosmetics than actually build out the game to what it could be. also, if you stop playing after a while, they will kill your dog.",5

"not what you expect, but in a good and bad way. mainly bad. when the game isnt pouring instructions at you over and over without telling you how to do it, or when the game decides you dont need to see so it puts up a talking face, the game is good. gamplay: 6/10 fustration for game: 11/10 the lack of showing you how to do things and objective markers that move, make the game already harder than it is, with overpowering damage from npcs. another great thing is that if you want to get any weapons or gadgets/mods, you pay real money! other then the fact nothing costs the money you get from missions, even if you do buy the blueprints with this. you have to play a sokid few hours to even get the components to make it, which it also doesnt tell you how to find components. overall, i give the game a 4.5/10",1

"this game is the biggest waste of time, rip off i have ever had the misfortune to play, unless you are either an idiot and like throwing money at a free game or have no life, you will have no fun playing this game, it is a gimmik i enjoyed it for around three hours after that i found out you need around 50 - 60 hours a week for farming and then when you finally have all the required parts for somethinf it takes anywhere from 12 hours to three days for it ot be complete. this game is a pure waste of time i would rather gouge out my eyes with crab claws covered in salt and lemon juice then ever play this again",1
"this game is boring. all you have to do is complete uninspired missions such as defend something, retrieve data, kill all the enemies of the area etc. its not fun, its osnly repetitive. at least the gunplay is ok and graphics are not really bad for a f2p game.",1

"best graphics ever for an indie game!! when i play free-to-play games on steam, i always think man, this will probaly have the worst graphics and gameplay but the seccond i played it, i was like holy *bleep* that was my thought when first entering the game. but later i was thinking best game ever!",1
"the game is beautiful, im not one to like shooters like this, and i love it, cant have a day i dont play an hour or 2 if i can get away with more, but in a fairly big issue is the game needs a dedicated server, the shenanigans i have to do for multiplayer to work is very unpleasant some days it can take 4 hours for a scheduled meet to work out and others we give up and solo what we can. all in all this minus dwarfs more the pluses but regardless i am actively recommending my friends this game, though im not using the ingame recruitment option.",2

"the game is going the pay2win road, after some hours its just grind for new weps that are  and only the prime weapons are good. the new cool weps are so bad none uses them melee is ussless in high levels you have to grind 12 hours for resources then you craft warframe parts 12h then you wait 3 days for warframe and some of them have only 1 skill thats good or some are so bad none uses them. sorry for misspelling.",3

"i have mixed feelings about this game. its definitely a pay-to-win game. although the action and design can be fun, all too often you come across punishing (not challenging) points of the game can be easily overcome by throwing money at it or will make you walk away annoyed. for some of us, that isnt a problem. for others, we prefer to earn our rewards and the cost financial cost of purchasing the win is often more than one can afford. the faq says, nearly all content in warframe can be earned over time for free. you can collect credits anywhere, but the only currency that actually matters is platinum and platinum is only purchasable. multiple in-game currencies is a terrible concept. you can make it available for purchase, but being unable to earn platinum leaves out a good portion of your players. the community is absolutely full of judgemental s. be prepared. in short, if youre 12 (or have the maturity level of a 12 year old), like gobs of violence in lieu of any form of story, and dont mind buying solutions to all your problems, this is the game for you.",2

"wanna crash during an important mission? then this is the game for you. want endless grinding with no story? install this game. want good and balanced multiplayer? dont play this game. want a game that wont crash when steam is on your pc? dont play this game. 10/10 would crash and swear when submitting crash report. update: i logged in today and the pc restarted by itself the devs should go  themselves players are grinding, devs are sucking each others  my game is crashing, devs are sucking each others  im sending crash reports, devs are sucking each others  my pc restarted when i started warframe, devs are still sucking each others",1
"ive recently wanted to play this game agin, because it looks cool and well made. i had the game before but it needed some serious updating (4 gigs worth). lo and behold, what was i greeted with when i decided to just re-download the whole game? - start warframe - downloading updates - updating directx - checking for new content (here is where the fun starts) at the point where the launcher searches for new patches, it would start downloading, briefly. then an error message pops up (one of many probably), and the launcher crashes or forces you to restart warframe. and here you will be stuck. some people get the game working after having to re-validate their game folders and having to download everything again, but for a lot of potential players out there, there is no support. searching the web finds you more unhappy people and unresolved problems than actual solutions. i was furious and disappointed because i actually played this a while back and enjoyed it, but i can just forget about it now, because the errors never stop, no matter what you do, and the solutions (which are quite varied) only apply to some, not all. if you get this game to actually run and successfully update, congratulations, but your friends might not be so lucky.",1

"steam recommendation: this game is amazing - ive played it since before it was on steam, during the closed beta phase, and it was great. after the game went open beta with update 7, it just got even more awesome! the gameplay is great - over-the-shoulder third-person shooter, but you have special powers too, depending on the suit you use. id recommend excalibur as your first frame - hes really beginner friendly, the volt is in the middle, and loki is insanely difficult to play as without any prior experience. anywho, this game is one of the best ive ever seen, and all i can say is: this is free-to-play anyways, get it nowww.",2
"warframe is just another free-to-play (mmo?) where they start you off with the bear minimum, that almost good enough to get through half the game. the biggest issue is this game has its that its also another  you, fight off this entire over powered army at first it didnt seem like that, but 4 story missions it really, became that. instead of 5 enemies that are mildy strong. its 15 enemies that that have perfict acuracy, do way to much damage, and run away as soon as you look in their general direction. the first boss (literaly first) is able to teleport, perfict accuracy, way to much damage, way to much health, summons soldires (like stated befor) that run into the corners of the room to nip you, he also throws granades that suck away your sheild if your within 20ft, and is able to put a bleeding dot on you along with a electracute dot and is able to damage you right throu your sheilds. remember thats just the first boss. dont bother playing it, unless you have all 4 party member with you.",1

"the point of this game is to farm while farming to farm even more",1
"i can not recommend this game to anyone. clunky mechanics, endless grind, and pay-for-convenience plague every aspect of it. what could have been a tactical, fast-paced co-op game about space ninjas devolves quickly into repetitive combat and boring, efficient farming against waves of grunts that practically run into your bullets. once you have completed every mission type 10-15 times, you know what you are in for the rest of game. the developers, digital extremes, have no cohesive vision for the games future. content patches include needlessly redundant features, and uninspired weapons that work in uninspiring ways. they are also rife with new bugs, and poorly balanced. an example would be their much awaited archwing updated, which introduces a new game-mode that is practically standalone from the rest of the game. there is a massive time gate for even the highest-level players, unless you pay real money, and then once built you must find and then level-up mods associated with it and nothing else. the kubrow update worked the same way. what initially attracted me to the game was its art direction and pace, but ultimately its just not enough to keep me slogging through the same missions with almost zero context behind the effects of each one. dont fall for the freemium trap, avoid this game.",6
"grind, more grind, a bit more, lets not stop there, keep going. the game is mostly made of good ideas with bad executions, they keep trying to reinvent the wheel while still driving.",6
"i certainly not recommend this game, because you will waste some times on there. it is a free game, but the only quickest way to get the best items is to buy them, to able to buy them, you need to cost money. so the only way to earn items is to wait or buy them. i think that you should spend your hard earn money on other stuff rather then spending on this game. this games crafting takes a long time, when it finished, you might not like it, but you waste lots of times just waiting for this to craft. time is very expensive in some way. the game is free, but if you want to enjoy this game, only way is to spend money, so i think this game is not very good for you guys to play.",2
"this game was very good and as you can see i have played it a lot, but de is getting sloppy and this game is losing value fast. i have used over $120 dollars in this game and it was not worth it. save yourself from spending money on platinum and just dont get this game. instead, find a game that will cost $15-$30 at the start but have everything unlockable instead of having a free game that will suck your wallet dry. i will update my review if de decides to get smart again and fix this broken game.",7

"its . never start the grind or you wont be able to stop. the devs are a bunch of incompetent dip that actively ignore advice to better their product. where as the product itself has little to no guidence for new players, the end-game is nothing but a grindfest for late game players. not only that but the devs treat the player base like beta testers, as opposed to people that have spent time and money on the product. the lack of serious support this game gets (terrible streams do not count)combined with the ineptitude of the developers leads me to not recommed this game.",4
"warfarm is far and away the worst offender when it comes to rng-based, unfun grinding, and the developers are probably some of the most incompetent in recent history. melee is shallow and nonviable, stealth (though for some reason encouraged) is not an option, there is an incredible lack of enemy variety, every single mission type feels the same, the grind-based progression in this game is some of the worst in any game i have ever played, the mod card system is unsustainable, and the developers are completely incapable of making the big changes that need to be made, opting instead to put a band-aid on the issue in the form of borderline-worthless mods. this game being free may seem attractive but i am warning you now that warframe is the most colossal waste of time you could ever try out. just save up some money and buy another game, or go look at other free-to-play titles out there. dont waste your time with this game, and please dont waste your money.",5

"i played it in beta, and loved it. then they released guilds - so you have to be in a populated guild to unlock certain things and thats the only way you can get them. at the same time, i ran out of weapon slots and warframe slots. i understand that it is free to play, but its basically a demo when you have to start deleting warframes to level up new ones to increase your total level. i wish i could see all the new content they have added, but i just dont have the will to go back and get frustrated with the inventory limitations.",1
"when i first started playing this game, i thought it was weird. the controls were all far removed from the standard - f to change guns? x to interact? but quickly the game grew on me. alot. it was all i played for 6 months of my life from late 2013 to mid 2014. it was one of the best games ive ever played. but recently, this has no longer been the case. from the ui changes, to annoying, impossible to sympathize with characters who completely fail to place as comedic inserts, to enemies that are hardly challenging but incredibly annoying, everything de has added to this game for a long time has made me fall further and further from the love i once held for the game. where many times i gave this game stellar recommendations to friends, i cant recommend it anymore. the grind that drew me in has become beyond unreasonable, and i never feel like im accomplishing anything anymore. i return to this game every so often looking for nostalgia, wanting to love this game again, but i cant anymore, and i cant recommend anyone play it.",4

"i played this game back in closed beta before it became a uber grind fest mentality, there were skill trees for weapons and frames, mods existed but were not essentialy needed unlike the current system were as now i need to grind hours of my life away in order to actually have good gear that was once good back then becuase apparently the mod system was better and skill trees were silly... pvp was promised but i feel like it should have been there sooner to provide end game content... not really p2w however if you want more then 2 frames either attempt to sell things in the player market or sell a frame. (even vintage items are sold for crap so expect farming forever) despite the few hours logged on steam, ive been around for quite some time, and as a casual gamer i get on here and there so my rank suffers for me having other things to do. yet again a game that is fun to play but requires your life and attention for you to enjoy it to its fullest. warframe had potential, even look at tbs wtf is warframe and you can see the skill trees yourself.",1

"the monetization in the last few updates makes the game almost p2w (or pay 2 not play since grind = content). shallow gameplay, broken promises and horrendous decisions made by the developers make this game unbearable. avoid at all costs. the time i have put into this game is my poor attempt at trying to get value for money since i bought a founder package, still feel i have been ripped off.",5
"if you ever had played mass effect 3 co-op then youll never prefer this pile of garbage. the shooting is completely unsatisfying and the graphical design is horrible. the whole f2p aspect of the game makes you grind for weapons and characters and still, some of them (glaive) can only be bought for money. when in me3 co-op you can unlock everything easily and the gameplay is very satisfying (you can even create a character build that only uses powers and nothing else), here you stuck with the same items forever. or you can craft them but it literally take days even if you have grinded for resources needed. even this game being free doesnt justify all that - you better off buying heavily discounted origin key for me3 (all co-op dlc there are free) than wasting any money on this train wreck of a game.",3

"the game itself is decent, and its addictive enough for some people to warrant the 900+ hours on record, but the game itself is quite flawed. large amounts of old or unused content are still in the game, so if you dont load correctly into a map, you might be looking at an old or unused user interface and cant do anything about it. a lot of bugs go unpatched for extended periods of time, and when they are finally addressed, it sometimes feels more like a workaround than an actual fix. whats worse is when this happens to some things that impact the game design itself. i feel kind of bad giving this a negative review, since the developers clearly care about what they put out, but what theyve put out thusfar feels almost more like a tech demo with project creep than a full game due to its lack of meaningful content. that said, the game is enjoyable, i just couldnt recommend it to my friends without a laundry list of caveats. hopefully that list will shrink in the future.",10
"the core game mechanics are in need of a serious overhaul. the devs are focused on adding new gimmicks that are separate from the main game or highlight just how undercooked or even broken basic things are. with every new update the game becomes clunkier, the gameplay loses its flow and the experience leaves you frustrated. its sad to see de lose their focus and just throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks.",9
"this is a great game but the developers dont listen to, acknowledge or respond to their community. its like they have taken a great concept, then focused on aggressively creating situations for players to pay as much money as possible. this is f2p tactics obviously, but digital extremes take it to the extremes... : generally f2p games have some level of balance, and a great example of this would be planetside 2. this and ps2 arent pay2win games as people complain, but they are pay 4 convenience. the issue is that de focus on making this game as inconvenient as possible, and the only way to avoid any inconvenience is to pay money continuously and forever. the more you progress into this game, the more inconvenient it gets (youd think the opposite). the aggressiveness of the push to spend money by de is not really apparent until around the 100 hours mark of playing. i beleive the push to make you spend is becuase there is no end game. what you do at the start is the same at the end. if your only a casual player, then this game is a lot of fun and especially so with friends. if you get invested in games then this will likely become compulsion, rather than fun. its such a shame, because its a great game. but the unethical business model and a clear lack of direction ruins it. in the end, this game punishes you for player more of it.",3
"warframe is a game that idolize war. that is why it is called war frame cause in game you frame the war which means you put it in a frame and hang it up on wall. many people lose lives in many wars such as the world war. take this game off of the market, it is bad for kids to play and very bad messaging for people around",1
"3 words. client-side hosting. if you love laggy games because your host is from mexico and his isp is 2 tin cans connected via shoe lace or if you love grinding 20-40 mins in a match just to lose all progress and items you earned because the client disconnects then this is your game. and sure, you can ticket for lost items but from my experience they rarely ever compensated me as theres no proof the game even took place unless all 4 players also submit identical tickets.",4
"a bright, flashy game where you fight imperialist clones and capitalist cultists. acrobatics can feel very smooth if you pull it off right. guns all have strong character and design. grinding is annoying if you invest heavily in weapon variety, especially if you want achievements or min-maxed weaponry. a neat game, but unless you like to grind its not worth the results.",1

"this is one of the coolest f2p concepts ive seen, and in the beginning it was really fun to play, until the devs decided that user friendliness and usability were less important than looking flashy and catering to 10 year old console players. now, the controls are clunky, the mod system is annoying and counter-intuitive, and i regret the time and money i put into it.",4

"ok, let me rephrase this (since people likes to give you bull about everything). its a nice game to kill time with friends, it is quite pretty, the weapons are interesting and its not complicated to play. but the eternal grinding, the waiting to craft items (which can be halfway acceptable), and the pretty expensive pay2win kills the mood. by all means give it a try if its your style of game, just keep in mind, eternal grinding.",1

"i enjoyed playing, but they use every trick in the book to get your money, making the game almost unplayable for free. all in all it is a fun game but they got too greedy and now i dont play it any more. i imagine it would be less expensive as a monthly subscription game than on its current model. oh and also the multiplayer is a bit glitchy/frustrating. if your friend drops out of your game, they may as well quit because they have lost every reward up to that point & all of the enemies have been revived & are coming to eat their faces. out of interest these are some of their methods to grab money: - limited lives per day, and choke points late in levels so you are forced to revive (revives cost money) - the drop rate of good items (weapons etc) is rare to encourage you to buy them with money - in-game money will usually only buy you a blueprint of something, which you must then craft, costing extra in-game dosh and items - crafting (which you have to do to get your new weapons & suits) takes hours/days of real time but if you use money you can bypass the wait - pets need daily medicine that is expensive with in-game cash, but also available for money - some rare items are only available as rare rewards from places you can only go if you get a rare drop, and have a limited life span (eg 24 hours) before they are destroyed from your inventory",1

"update: after another 300 hours i can say that this game has gotten better than it was before. they updated the launcher and its actually really good. theyve put in a lot of work in that amount of time and added some things to make the game more fun. the weekly small patches really add up in the end after over 300+ hours i think im ready to make my review.... this game is . -launcher is broken as hell and the developers (de) wont bother to fix it -support ticket system is repetitive and doesnt help most of the time -the game is buggy as hell, a hotfix is generally a hotbrake more times than not -the game is just a repeat. though mission levels do randomly generate its just still the same thing over and over. -this game is basically a farm simulator. you spend more time grinding and farming for stuff than actually having fun with the game -the game is a resource hog. my computer never used to crash or overheat while playing this until update 14.0.0. i could play it for hours on end the developers are just lucky i have enough patients to deal with their  game since i have nothing else to play. good game -10/10",6

"i thought this game would be really good i had fun with it for a while thats until i realised that in order to actually have more fun with this game you need to get the other weapons the problem is that you need to visit this store thing and get one but guess what you cant use it which is a rip off also you need to do alot of back tracking in order to level up which is annoying. over all if you like this game thats fine but i dont.",1
"one word: boring. other notes: 1. unless u pay u cant get any non-default weapons/frames easily, it didnt look to me like unless u live inside the game u can get anything non-default at all actually, unless u open ur pockets of course, then u can get everything instantly. 2. lack of any story, yup, they just toss u into the action and go ahead, grind mobs p_p very... fun, that. 3. gets boring very quick. 4. higher lvl players with awesome gear can get into your newbie party so youll be just walking around feeling worthless. 5. you can get into high lvl party with every1 having awesome gear except you.. and once again you will be just running after them feeling worthless, and will likely be kicked when they see your 0 kill count. 6. graphics aint that good. 7. to lvl up u need to pass some kinda exams which would be fine if... u didnt need to wait 24 hours to have another attempt if u fail.. which aint no fun at all.",1

"let me start this review off by saying....i used to be addicted to this game..... its actually a pretty bad game when it coems down to core mechanics, but somehow it gives a lot of satisfaction. if you hvae a lot of free tiem and dont mind grinding or paying a little(a lot actually) then yeah play this positives: -good graphics -good sounds -a lot of satisfaction when getting new weapons or frames -many different weapons, frames and mods negetives: -no really skill needed, no fun in gameplay -grinding and farming for materials -microtransactions are a lie._. -you must pay at least a little for the full experience -i have to say this again....gameplay is empty, hollow, boring........... all in all a kind of good time waster but it is addictive but not fun",3

"worst matchmaking ever. if you play any public match, get ready to be nuked. there is always at least one high level player who joins the beginner level. what happenes? the game ramp up all the enemys. giving them rocket launchers and lots of armor. you wont do much damage to them and die fast. even fail the mission. this game is full p2w. most of equip you have to buy with real money. grinding for resources is impossible if you are just a lowlevel, since the needed resources are hidden in higher levels. at same time, as you get some ranks, which dont increase your strength/damage, the enemys are scalled up, increasing everything (damage, shield, health). there are some missions you could solo. but at least half of the missions need coop. without the right group its impossible to win this missions. go and grab borderlands 2. more fun.",1

"this game is nothing more than a pay-for-items grindhouse. while the gameplay is decent, the tantalizing lack of good items early in the game will have you spinning wheels trying to get things to craft, and then waiting 12 hours to craft something, and how you have to buy (with cash money) all the upgrade slots on your guy and inventory. the prices for all of the items is inconvieniently designed to keep you buying the in-game currency, as you will never come up with an even amount that will allow you to spend it all, unless you buy things that should be included anyway, like color palettes. this is my honest impression of the game, that it is solely designed to be a you can skip the grind for three easy payments of the low low price of $19.99! but heres the thing: the entire game is an unabashed grind. i thought the story and gameplay concept was interesting, but the business model feels like give us more money disguised as a game. it might say free-to-play! but it would be more accurate to say pay to have fun! skip this game, go buy a real game if you are tempted to buy any in-game items",1
"this game is cool but i cant create an account always says invalid activation always retry and retry i tried many times!!!!!!!!!!!! fix it now!",1
"terrible game, super repetitive and honestly horrible graphics for what it should look like nowadays. another microtransaction game lel if you can call it micro at the prices they charge for ridiculous things. use your money and go buy a real game. honestly dont waste time on free to play garbage.",1
"understandable how this is still beta and all but...  those crashes. i crash like 2 times a day, and sometimes, the crashes are so bad, i cant even exit the application itself, leaving me a white screen where i do  hole. i seriously do not recommend it until these major issues are fixed but if your willing to put up with it, go ahead.",1

"i find it boring after the 5th hour of play. but it was a pretty good 5 hours.",1
"play this game if you have absolutley nothing else to play. the only plantet anyone plays on is earth and(for me anyways) it takes 20 min. to connect to a game.20 min! overall not worth it.",2
"horribly repetitive grindfest with most of the interesting gameplay locked away behind grind or paywalls. do not play unless you like to get lost in huge mission environments built from generic pieces, unsure of where to go next. then do it again 5 times. graphics are nice but definitely not enough to redeem it.",1
"1: repetetive gameplay. 2: time consuming if you dont want to spend a lot of money. 3: no option to change your first warframe at least once. how would a new player know what he wants/gets without having tested the different warframes first?",1
"i have waited 2 days for them to activate my account, and it dosnt tell you how to find the message thourgh junk or steam to accept it. help plz",1
"poor game design. only cool graphic and sound but the game play is kinda boring and repetitive . you better spend time playing another games.",1
"this is a great game but no mater what i do it does not run on my pc it does respowned even if it does have another trick up its sleeve. pls tell me how to fix this",1
"first the good parts of this game. game play is fun, landscapes look good, weapons and armor customization are almost limitless. now the bad. ninjas in space is kind of wierd, as are the biotech visuals for the warframes. i can look past that. network code is buggy with regular failures to join sessions and disconnects for me and my clan mates. squad population levels are very slow to update making it confusing and annoying trying to join squads. and i could get past all that too. what makes this a negative review for me is the rank up mechanic that is a challenge you have to complete to advance to the next level. you can only perform this challenge once every 24 hours. what makes this bad is the amount of time requried to achieve enough xp to take the challenge, for me this was over 20 hours of game time to reach rank 2 and that was with the help of my higher level clan mates. i then failed the challenge twice because of inadequate gear and a 3rd time because of the above mentioned network glitchiness. after 3 failures over 3 days im annoyed. annoying potential paying customers is not a good way to run a business.",2
"gameplay is awesome, runs smoothly even for my crapshoot of a computer. faced paced and full of action. it is, howerever, impossible to continue if youre just starting out unless you have money, or good friends whove been playing awhile to carry you through the missions and get you stuff. might have been better off just being pay to play, instead of free for inconvenient, but thats just me. if you enjoy spending hours getting very little progress at a time because you cant afford the virtual currency, then have fun.",1
"hell yeah. quick, fun, lots of play styles... i like it! revisited: the game is pretty good, but the community just sucks. very juvenille. since figuring out the basics depends on information from other players, youll spend a lot of time hoping for someone to answer simple questions rather than posting yet another braindead your mom.. line. pitiful.",1
"the only time youll have fun is when youre not playing this game",1
"this game has good graphics, its fun at the beggining. but the only problem is the grinding and you can rank up once per day.",1
"personally, i love this game. space ninjas, magic, and mass murder is pretty damn great, however, it has some game breaking bugs that always coincide with events. i had a party bug that made me go solo always, which was no problem, but running a melee only interception is ridiculously difficult. if youre gonna hold an event, make sure that your game doesnt break during it. seriously. anyway, i have no other complaints because this game is amazing, but devs, i understand the weekend is your break, but the events usually start on friday anyway. i really hate that. i really dont wanna play this game because its gonna suck me into it again, and then break and ill be left scratching my head.",2
"poopiest game of the year it took me 2 years to finally download it with my .02 download speed kappa",2
"theres literally only one problem of the game and its based individually on each person. how far are you willing to go? after completing weapon mastery of over 60+ weapons, i can say that it is in fact based on what youre willing to do. the game-play does get repetitive after reaching your first mastery; however, people usually subside this repetitiveness by playing a different style, warframe, or using a different weapon. dueling is another way, but in the end, i dont expect this game to go competitive where cash prizes may be concerned.",5
"ignore my playing hours. ive been playing this game every day for 8 months now. first impression: highly satisfying game. you get to choose one of the three starter warframes, primary rifle, sidearm and melee weapin with different abilities and properties. as you proceed, you will feel a sense of satisfaction is finishing missions, progressing through the star chart, acquiring new weapons and warframes along the way. you get a sense of mysteriousness of the story and also you will know that this game has a very deep story-telling waiting to be told. awesome graphic and sound effects too. after playing it for some time: addiction yes, you wanna play it again and again and again. spending hundreds if not thousands of hours to acquire that one weapon, that one part of a warframe. grind and grind and grind until you hate the game. after that you hate yourself.... but damn after all that griding, now you have a new weapon, a new warframe. it feels kinda worth it. you feel like starting a new mission...",3
"people have their opinions, some enjoy grinding all day. some dont. some are fine with the simple enemy design some arent. but when you make people have to pay to continue progressing... nobody enjoys that. this used to be one of my best go-to games if i just felt like a kill everything in creative ways mood. however with the added inventory system that requires you to buy space with platinum i cant progress. as much as i love this game, you cant call it free to play unless youre fine with about 100 hours of gameplay. the inventory system is a way for the creators to milk as much as they can from the players while still passing off the game as free to play instead of just making an initial fee to download it. i dont know if this was recently added or has been in since first created, all i know is if looking for a game you can pour a lot of hours and really get into this is not your game unless youre willing to pay.",2

"okay, i know my opinion wont mean much due to my low play time but take it from someone who has seen what this game has done to people. this whole game is one giant  measuring contest. [this is basically what i heard when my friends talked about what they had in the game] guys i got a [insert rare gun name] *players digital  size increased* breh i got a ing [inserting random prime character name] *players digital  size increased largely* dudes i got a [insert a decent item name] *players  size increased* bro thats not even good. *other players  size decreases* but but but i got a [prime character] * size hits the roof and roof explodes* this game is awesome. *3 weeks later* this game ing sucks omg this is  why does this exist i hate it *has 12,132 hours on the game* i agree this game is ing stupid *has 7,424 hours on record.* i think its okay.. *has 2 hours on record* and that is how this game affected the people around me.",1

"this game is amazing! it has some of the best graphics i have ever seen and is a fun fast paced alien rpg! there are several things this game has to offer and trust me it does, and is a fun game to play with your friends or to see how well you do on your own! on a scale of 1 to 10 i rate this game a 9.5, pretty good! if you like weapons and aliens im sure you will love this game!",1
"space ninjas?...no. this game gets old very quick as it repeats the same levels over and over again just with different objectives. one mission you rescue, the next you destroy. every mission looks pretty much the same! not bad for a free to play, but not worth your time, and or money for dlc.",1
"complete . every mission is the same and the game feels like it was designed by a 12 year old",1

"great game but it takes an arm and a leg to upgrade the damn character",1
"honestly, warframe is not a bad game. but i find it is one of those free to play games where you need to spend real life money to get anything cool, considering getting in-game cash is very slow and takes forever. the storyline is great, the graphics are great, but i find the level design to be too repetitive. if your are fine with repetitive level design and using lots of real life money in a game, then get this.",1

"i use to love this game, played it for over 500+ hours, spent over $400 on items/upgrades and when they made the interface changes that totally turned the game into a new look, ships, all that junk, it ruined the whole experience. i would not ever recommend this game just because of that one change... something amazing became something just unplayable and complicated to even look at. i wouldnt even rate warframe 1/0... it gets no props for this screw up. people pay money for this game and i am just 100% displeased by their interface changes that i will never play a digital extremes developed game ever again as well for the simple fact they only show they change a good thing into a negative one when that change did not need to take place to begin with, and then keep moving forward with this negatively impacted interface decision. my friends even stopped playing... all vets of the game from beta when the game didnt even have more than 100 players on the weekend. i never been so pissed off about a game update in my whole life.",5
"so many bugw, i have reinstalled multiple times, its a great game dont get me wrong but the bugs really ruin it and customer support is",4
"i hope you trained your fingers well, otherwise you will lack in mobility. first off bigest issue the keybindings. ingame you need to switch from sniping to key-smashing-meele. sadly while keysmashing the 1 meele-button. you lose one button for your movement. when you now try to use an ability, you can only run in one direction, making it worse to meele. this is a problem you properbly wouldnt have while playing on a controller. sadly i cant aim that way. minor issues: - the bow is op as hell even if uncharged i often used to meele-snipe instead of meele, because: - meele is either a one-hit-kill (in the back; assasinate) or a feather against a stone(in the front) - story is so linear it hurts for example (rewards): machine for blueprints -> blueprint -> materials - ai 10m away they wont see you. you can snipe as you want unless they press the alarm, but: - the alarmsystem is somehow spawning enemys as strong the first hard encounter, but can be hacked by a 3 year old - abilitys consume mana like hell so can max. use 2 unless u find a box with mana for a half ability pay-2-play: if youve chosen a character and your weapons: you can only change the weapons, but good weapons cost gold by the way if you dont like your character dont worry a cooler one is playable, for money ... jeeey",1

"more like warfail. total ing grindfest now, if you wanna cut the grind times to a minimum you have to pay for it, and the premium currency prices are ing outragous. and forget about all this new weapon every week . all the new weapons are just crap now, like that new staff weapon, which looks like someone sat on the end of a bo staff, the starting weapon, which is excacly what it is. they may have added that space combat crap in, but it got sooo boring really fast, considering all you can farm is another two weapons for it. its also disorientating, so unless your a hardcore ace pilot, i recommend getting some gravol on standby. theres a few new missions to play on a new planet, but the problem is the planet is trying to kill you. its colder than hoth, and if you build up alot of freezing you take damage! even if your playing as the warframe that shoots ice and causes avalanches. this game used to be fun, but now, since its soooooo popular, they mess the damn thing up with so much crap, its unruly.",4

"its a pretty good game. pretty much just a low budget destiny",1

"personally, i love this game. space ninjas, magic, and mass murder is pretty damn great, however, it has some game breaking bugs that always coincide with events. i had a party bug that made me go solo always, which was no problem, but running a melee only interception is ridiculously difficult. if youre gonna hold an event, make sure that your game doesnt break during it. seriously. anyway, i have no other complaints because this game is amazing, but devs, i understand the weekend is your break, but the events usually start on friday anyway. i really hate that. i really dont wanna play this game because its gonna suck me into it again, and then break and ill be left scratching my head.",2
"poopiest game of the year it took me 2 years to finally download it with my .02 download speed kappa",2
"theres literally only one problem of the game and its based individually on each person. how far are you willing to go? after completing weapon mastery of over 60+ weapons, i can say that it is in fact based on what youre willing to do. the game-play does get repetitive after reaching your first mastery; however, people usually subside this repetitiveness by playing a different style, warframe, or using a different weapon. dueling is another way, but in the end, i dont expect this game to go competitive where cash prizes may be concerned.",5

"when i first downloaded this i thought, hey, samurai ninjas in space, and its free, why not? but after playing for a while, i found out the gameplay was extremely repetitive and got bored of that. and the gameplay isnt even what people focus on. they focus on racing to get items and not really shooting the enemies. this is a shorter review, but the gameplay gets boring after about 2 hours. yes, i only have 3 hours because thats all it took for me to realize that these missions were the same thing over and over again. i give this a 3/10, the fun does not last long at all.",1

"i was a alpha tester for this game also a grand master founder(and if you sit for like 2 hours you can see my name on kappa) and i knew some of the devs ingame, the game just isnt good anymore.. it was a game of derping around having fun with friends as space ninjas then the addition to the void happened and it became a game about grinding more grindy than wow, then pwe bought majority shares and now there is pay gates on the features of the game.. like meele for example. it is impossible to reach any sort of progress on this game without spending money on microtransactions and there is a lot of microtransations.. i would ask for a refund, but i know it would be refused",7
"this game has good graphics but the gameplay is terrible... the missions are really generic and i dont consider it to be a good game. the game also updates every time you launch it and that gets old... overall a pretty crappy game...",1
"this game looked awesome! up until the point where it was constantly bugged out saying it is trying to connect to a server for over an hour and after uninstalling it, and re installing it 2 times, and trying other methods to fix it, i came to the conclusion that  this game",1

"good overall. the co-op is nice the game is fun to play, and whole mess of missions that you can play",1
"this game is.. very unfriendly for new users, first few steps are easy to play. and looks like enjoyable. but after that, suddenly player need hard effort for game. fast reflexes, understanding of warframe, mod, and many things. if you finally got something know-how about this game, still game is too uncomfortable and stressful. repeat same mission over and over again for resources to make warframe, weapons.... and because of this too hard leveling, there is no new users to play regular. just oldbies who wanna new equinpment update, not a new users. so, if you cant find a friends or clan in game, you must solo in every mission to unlock mission nod. thats very painful. and sometimes impossible for one user. eventually i dont recommend this game for new players who wanna fun with action game. and this game is not a fresh thing, its old, almost 2 years. but still didnt change a basic problem, just updating new gear for oldbies like ventilator to dying man.",2
"i played this game before dota 2 because i thought it was such a big deal. but i have to say it suffers the same problem as watch dogs. even the story of this game is unbelievebely boring and messed up. well, it doesnt deserve to be compared with paid games but still, this game is a dissapointment.",1
"this game starts off very promising and fun, but it eventually boils down to nothing more than retracing your steps over and over and over and over and over and over again. the drops are terrible, the combat gets really boring, and the entire game just feels really clunky. for a game that claimns to be centric to space-ninjas, there is nothing resembling ninjas at all, save for a few obsolete frames/weapons. did i mention how horribly slow and sluggish these ninjas are? chris farley could catch them. if you like broken records, stale combat, or just like farming for hours on end, then farmframe is for you.",4
"[1.5/10] i tried to play, but the ai are stupid beyond belief and all the combat is the same",1
"i dont see what is so fun about this game. it is well made and great looking, the developers are active in expanding and improving it, and its a very popular game on steam. even so... its boring. its fun at first and every now and then but each mission is almost the same with similar level builds and same enemies each time. warframes and powers are cool but eventually their colors fade and it goes back to the same old grind. maybe its just me but i think its repetativeness is boring but hey its a free game. no harm in giving it a try for yourself.",1
"gradually removing all non-p2w gameplay elements is not jolly.",1
"insanly expensive pay to win. nice grapics but not worth the money or time investment.",1
"this game is absolutely beautiful and extremely exciting. then a 20 hours later its the same thing on repeat as the difficultly slowly disappears completely.",1
"graphical quality undeniable but honestly disapointing the most repetitive game ever seen... too long and boring but big vent though 4/10",1
"theres way too much grind for too little reward in this game. only play if you either like repeating the same thing over and over, or have the money to shill out for every item you want.",1
"of the bit that ive played, i cant personally recommed this game. to me, it seems rather shallow and relies a bit too much on multiplayer mechanics. i find the combat to be quite shallow, thus having only about an hour and a half into the game. if the later game is much better, thats unfortunate because i will never reach it. you should never have to spend 20 hours to get to the good part, the game should always be in the good part. id stick away from this one, although it is free to play. so you might as well give it a try, to see if you enjoy it.",1
"its like a christmas present your like oh this is a really nice looking present and then you open it.......what the f*** is this s*** when did i ever f***ing say i wanted this!?!?!?!?!?! also how the f*** does one do a whole mission then get killed by 1 f***ing soldier who i had killed but he was still walking, how, if this game is so great why does it have so many god d*** bugs!?!?!?! explain this s***",1

"grind frame. just say no. but seriously, i played this game more than a few hours and the infinite power creep is mind numbing. grind, grind, grind to get a new gun or frame to grind, grind, grind, to max out and rank up and then grind, grind, grind to get the next frame or gun. would not do again.",5
"first of all i cant play the game, i need admin permissions to run the game.. which i dont have. (team fortress 2, dota 2, war thunder, ghost recon phantoms, etc. work witout any permissions.) please make it work, i know im not the only one with this problem so please fix.",1
"i have fun till it start update, warframes updating process is really a pain in , and each time the only difference is always from bugframe 1x.10 become bugframe 1x.20. so yeah, why not give a negetive as it make itself unplayable.",3
"fun shooter f2p with loads of customization and different characters, which makes me sad its so hard to get anything and even the color pallets is paid for in real $ all i got are stupid standard colors. apart from that this game has a lot of potential although bugs and lags that ruins it most of the time. i meant to recommend this game and ended up bashing it....",1
"nope... sorry. not addictive and very repeatitive!",1
"no no no, no no, no no no no no no. i played a little bit of it, really pathetic story line. stupid third person play, lighting sucks.",1
"wareframe could have been a great game, if it wasnt impossible to progress without spending copious amounts of real money just to stay alive each mission. i would give this game a favourable review if they kept whats meant to be free to play, truly free to play. make your money with bonuses and speedups and so on, but atleast make it possible to play the game without spending money, like your genre so blatantly lies about.",1
"too much pay to win im sorry i dont recommend you to play this",1
"by far, this game is worst game ive ever played. ever. this game was so bad that i felt bad for my computer having used my ssd to house the files. simply atrocious. if i had to choose between a bullet to the head or playing this game, i would vhoose the bulltet every time. this game has cursed my gaming experience to the point where i didnt even want to play another game. if you value your life and the lives of your friends and family, please, i beg of you dont even mention this game to them. please, save your life and be a hero, never play this game, never look at this game, never even talk about this game aside of this review. please do the right thing. please.",1
"i am impressed that they managed to make a game about space ninjas boring. grind grind grind until your bitter husk of an existence is over and you should be rewarded with some high damage items at least, not some  space larping axe and a nerf gun.",1
"poorly executed. a brink but much much worse. awful campaign, awful graphics, awful multiplayer. however if you would prefer a fps alien swarm, this load of garbage is for you. do not waste your time and money on this free to play. its free for a reason.",1
"linear, monotonous and boring game with lots of donations.",1
"game./ very repetitive and lacks any thing to come back and play it unless your the type of person who likes to grind soo much just to get a sutpid skin or weapon and grag about it.",1
"yeaaaaah i dont know what the fus about with this game.... how come it got so high rating ??? this game is just not interesting. you go around shooting and killing thing and do it all over again. theres nothing unique about this game... high boring factor. if you wanna pass a few lazy hours killing stuff with no purpose this is for you. ther game can be challanging thoe. a , lazy made 3rd perrson shooter, you can slice, shoot, and jump.... so what? the character have no chracter, nothing to pull you in, just jumping and shooting, and shooting and jumping. boring....... try it out, dont waste any money on it. i give it 5/10 boring.",1
"itd be fun, if it wasnt such a ravenous money-suck.",1
"this game sucks, way too much grinding...bad new player intro",1
"good graphics, but the free to play model ruins it. also i love the physx effects, ive never wanted to explode so many barrels in my life! if you have a radeon cards its no biggie, but youll be missing out on a lot of pretty little particle effects like the 4th of july!",1

"at a time when many free-to-play games feature very unfair monetization, warframe is a breath of fresh air. firstly, it is one of the best looking f2p titles i have ever seen. secondly, the combat system is very enjoyable and the community is very active. thirdly and most importantly, the monetization is very fair in this game. you can easily work towards building any weapons in the game by sinking time into it or simply by purchasing it through the store. however, compared to games like planetside 2, gaining weapons and frames without spending money is a very feasible way to progress in the game. i would suggest supporting these developers - you can tell they love what they do. i highly reccomend this to anybody. cons: graphically demanding (but very well optimized).",3
"its an amazing game, ultimately flawed for many either due to its lack of pvp for some and repetitive item grinding nature. if you can look over those two issues that some will have, you will have an outstanding game with ninjas flipping of walls throwing elemental force powers while, with steady upgrades from a determined developer the game is well supported. its pricing model is a little rough, however there is a daily login reward which after consistent daily activity you have the chance of a 75% off the purchase of currency, then everything is good with the model.",3
"warframe was becoming a dissapointing grindfest but with the new added quest system, new tilesets and by loosing the bonds of rng it has redeemed itself. its still by not any means perfect but beats destiny in most aspects. its also free and stays as it if you know what you are doing.",6
"n!ce looking game, great graphics for a free to play game but as i always say free to play does not necessarily mean free as there is always a catch ie, buying dlc packs at a greater expense than a aaa top of the table game that you would on average pay 30.00 for. but there is always one free to play out of them all that will be worth installing and playing without actually purchasing all the expensive add-ons that one needs to win or play most of the time. this game is one of those free to play exemptions... worth downloading and playing even just for killing some time with nice graphics :)",1
"for a free to play shooter, this game is incredible! dont look at that 66 out of 100 metascore and say to yourself that this game is going to be bad, because the gameplay in this is very well done, even though you are pretty much killing the human race and other alien species. many people who may have played mass effect should be settled very quickly into this game as well, but if you are not a mass effect player you should get into the combat system very easily anyway. the only negative thing i can really think of is the recycled maps for different planets, mars would look like pluto, which is strange since mars is the red planet, usually this is patched every update though so there is more variaty to the planets. another good thing is that microtransactions arnt compulsary in this game, most things you can buy with platinum (bought currency) you can earn by earning credits (in-game curreny), it justs takes a bit more time. overall i think this is a great shooter, maybe if this was proper paid game, it may not be worth it, but for free, this is awesome. 8 out of 10 kubrows ;)",2
"this game is absolute garbage i once pooped out a better game and my boi alen played it for over 3 hours. that is an acheivment onm its own.",1
"imagine starting in a world where your a space ninja and you get your very first weapons the kunai, the pairis and the boe. but here the catch its mk1 the worst teir of weapons you can possible get in the game. but the tutorial makes your weapons look actually good. but later on when your play like 2 or 3 mission to realize that youve ing forced to either buy completely over priced in game currency or spend 14 entire hours of your life grinding for a bloody secondary pistol. my friend keeps telling me that each level is different but seriosly it spawns you into area where 2 thirds of the doors are locked and that makes me think why not place a wall there instead of a locked door that cant be opened and here the thing the can add more room but de are just lazy people that just dont and what i mean about they can, i mean you can build a dojo and keep expanding untill your wallet is empty from the hundreads of dollars you just put into your steam wallet to bloody keep your virtral pet alive. and get this they charge money for colour pallets, so you have to give de more money to suit your colour combination. my final thing i want to say about warframe that its way too repetitive. overall its easy to become boring and in my opinion not worth trying",1

"even though im not that good at this game, i still enjoy it. the survival, the stealth, the missions in-general! its all so perfect and it fits this world which was created. and! its free! this warframe looks beautiful and the gameplay is fluent, the parkour element can be irritating yet it still works when you use it correctly. however, most say this game is p2w -- i respectfully disagree, as some items you can pay for, you can simply craft the items when you have a blueprint, i found a banshee chassis and paris bow blueprints, which is pretty good. the tenno you can play as add a whole new, not very complex but again, extremely fluent gameplay. you can go to the very well balanced excalibur, the first. electrocute your enemies with volt, fry them -- literally! you can also crush your enemies with mag, again -- quite literally. ram through a barrage of grineer with rhino! turn invisible and move behind your enemies with an advantage, create a energy created duplicate of yourself to distract enemies to get an advantage as loki! these are five tenno from many more, its extremely lovely to have so many options but that can irritate you also, you always must think about what tenno is good for what! excalibur is a mostly all-round tenno, rhino -- i would say is pretty offense to me, there are so many options its amazing. i would actually never think to remove this game or decide not to play it, i give it a 9/10 with a seal of badassery, a must own game. get it.",2

"warframe is a rpg-shooter in a sci-fi space scenario. the player can choose between different forms called warframes with special abilities. while a warframe can be equipped with mods (attribute enhancements) the player can chose between dozens of weapons for ranged and melee combat. the difficulty of warframe is very low. new players have a hard time but after the first 30-50 hours of gameplay the game becomes very easy and repetitive. there are no rewards for mastering a missions in a short time or suriving very long. endgame doesnt exist because it is not rewarded by any means. the overall financial strategy of this game is to restrict items by one-time events, forcing people to trade them for real money. this includes more powerfull mods and weapons. while this concept works well for people who have no real life schedule, it doesnt work for casual gamers.",6

"warframe has come a long way from when i dropped some cash to help out with the development (around 100$), however its still the same boring, uninspired, and highly grindy game it was before. yes, you can make your warframs and blah blah blah, but it takes forever, feels like a second job, and now theyre instituting things you outright cant make in game and the prices on their in game currency are absurd. i once read an interview with the guy that makes world of tanks where he said in a free to play model you should never try to extract more than the price of a movie ticket out of your players every few months, and nothing they can buy should overtly influence the gaming experience (paraphrase)... the people that make this pile of ish should read that interview because their game is overpriced and very boring.",1

"a fun game i shall admit however it has afew problems: its too repetative find,kill,capture,escort,defend,survive thats everything in the game in a nutshell. the balance is almost non existant. with some of the hardest to earn frames being the weakest and the easiest to earn being the strongest. youll need to grind for hours or even days if your unlucky to get enough resources for a single blade or gun. other then fighting there is nothing to do. i wouldnt mind that if maybe the ais were not the old 2d attack style ais that always walk,run at you in a straight line. when with infected they could have wall crawling,wall/roof pouncing ect. or having some sort of unique attack style other then get target in visible range then fire til i or it dies. all up its a fun game for awhile but once you notice how limited it is and how much of a grind fest it is you will move on.",1

"i played warframe for a little bit. i have to say it really spoke to me and was great fun with my friends, going on missions, fight, explore, and get loot, and whatnot. i liked the playability of the frames, how they moved and how you could do some interesting parcour-like tricks with them. i liked the cards that you could slot in your armor and weapons to modify how your warframe operated, and i especially liked finding new cards so you could upgrade and do all that good build-stuff. after a while though (i say this after some 20+ hours of play), the combat got really boring, repetitive and just didnt feel like there was any point to it. the missions, environments and loot is pretty much always the same, you cant really do anything with your money, dont get me started on the leveling system, and if you want to craft and upgrade, you have to heavily invest your time into it (or bust out the ole credit card). and maybe thats the problem, i just dont have the time or patience to keep grinding missions and doing events. i feel like i would have liked this game when i was 15 to 18 years old, when i had the stamina to just keep doing the same mission after repetitive mission. as it stands, i dont like the game because the challenge to me seems to be a test of how much time youre willing to spend getting minimal rewards and character growth. so its a no from me. i dont recommend this game.",1
"great idea for a game and had a lot of potential, but is completely broken with bugs. inculding a game crippleing bug that has been in the game since launch 2 years ago. btw this game is still in beta after 2 years, really?! my oppinion, do not buy this game.",1
"the interesting concept of swappable abilities is negated by the fact that 90% of the content must be purchased with real money transactions. youll have to purchase a pack ranging from $50 to $200 in order to unlock weapons and other characters. if the game had limited these transactions to merely cosmetic features, or had allowed a one time purchase of the game and the ability to earn them by playing i might sit down for another couple of sessions in the hope of earning something cool instead of having to buy my way to victory. also, if a player dies 4 times during the day, they must spend more real money for additional revivals. the enemies and gameplay are mediocre, though warframe tries to include a wall running mechanic to spice things up. its sadly under utilized in every area, making each stage a forgettable copy-and-pasted version of the last. enemies have a tendency to slide and teleport around as well. they have a chance to drop ability cards for you to equip, which an interesting idea, but since shooting everything in the face with your default weapon (which doesnt require recharging like abilities do) clears them away just as well, theres no real tactical reason to use them. the main characters and weapons look pretty good, but the stages and opponents are all forgettably grimdark. do you have an hour to kill on a gimmick shooter? look no further. want something with a more depth? go play tribes: ascend instead.",1
"let me tell you a little bit about warframe. its the absolute biggest pile of trash i have ever played, the story goes as follows,you play as some dumbass noob robot and his dumbass best friends and go and kill everyone in sight, the end thats it thats the game is ing abysmal. also not once during the game do we get to put a picture in these mentioned warframes and hang them on a nice wall, the title is very misleading in this way. i expected a nice picture hanging simulator and all i got was  dumbass robots",1
"i did not like warframe, its short, missions are repetitive and buggy. for example, one mission i was trying to find and capture 2 guys. first of all the minimap icon for the guy i was supposed to find was not right and then someone else finished the mission then every enemy went after me. if that isnt bad enough, the crafting is not well thought out. to craft things, you have to farm for rare materials that you can rarely find, or the thing you are looking for is on a planet that have enemies that are 5 levels higher than you. and if you think you can just buy wepons from the store, then you are wrong. most, if not all the good items, require real money to buy, so i take this time to mention that the game is free to play. my final complaint is that there is little to no cover in the game and only one enemy has a melee only attack. and if thats not bad enough, than listen to this, i am not completely sure if there is a crouch button. so all and all dont get this game. its not as good as it looks. if you are looking for a game like this i would suggest destiny",1

"if you want to have more than two frames and more than two weapons, be prepared to shell out real money. you only get four revives per day, and to get more, you must pay real money for those as well. the game is filled with microtransactions. its also filled with grinding. empty matches, and an overzealous chat censoring system.",1
"no one plays this games its soo bad in the way no one plays remove this game its just killing steam",1
"at the beginning (maybe) youd like it. its entertaining once you get some new warframes to play and maximize (same with the weapons), and constructing a dojo is more like if youre lucky or not. however, is a bit frustrating when the pvp lacks some competivity or some rewards... in fact, practically no one enters there since theres nothing in return (no ranking system or something that makes you play more of this) at the end of the day, youll realize theres nothing interesting but to gather resources to buy some weapons to see how powerful you become... and for what? well, heres my realisation quote: is that it? i wasted my time id even go back to lineage 2. i do not recommend to play warframe, could be addictive but still frustrating afterwards. -arkl1te",2

(dont get me wrong though, everything else with this game is absolutely perfect.) i was recently playing this quest when i noticed many things wrong about the gamemode (i was playing the interception mode). first of all, i noticed the grineer have absolutely no idea what contesting an objective is. no matter what the grineer instantly capture points despite me being there to contest them. instantly. secondly, the grineer spawn in basically unstoppable and unrelenting swarms. seriously, its like an ork waaaaagh. though that may be just because im not that high of a level with my archwing stuffsydoodles. thirdly, when you do complete the mission, i find it difficult to kill them all. mostly because theyre inside the asteroids. good luck getting to them. and then theres the constant crashing. in game, in the loading screen, and, wierdly enough, in the launcher menu- thing. all the crashes all the time, and you dont keep your rewards when you crash. it really sucks. overall, warframe is a great game, and i hope it will continue to be so. but the archwing is just too much rage for me to handle xd. i really hope these bugs will be fixed asap, but until then (or until i manage to actually complete the limbo quest without too much crashing and rage!) im giving this a nosauce.",2

"warframe, the game about space parqour mercenary ninja gunslinger craftsmen who aslo are ery good contractors, the first impressions were good but they soon lost its wow factor once you begin to see the same backdrops and level structure over and over again. warframe is better enjoyed with friends but they will too see its just a grind fest for diffrent guns and characters, i have introduced 6 friends to warframe and all have met the same fate of leaving once it got repetitve. the game is no doubt perfect or finished and i hope to play it again when they add more content but as is right now there isnt enough to keep you entertained for more then 20hrs",3
"warframes visceral combat cant make up for the fact that it a total time-consuming, grind-fest; nty",2
"tried this and found it not only to be brutally unforgiving during the starting levels, but the lack of information on what to do about anything in this is absolutely pathetic. lets dive into details that need some serious work. pay 2 win. a lot of weapons are pay only. you cant make them at all. meaning unless you sink a bunch of cash into this, its available armaments, while varied, are only about half of whats actually available. leveling up is locked to once a day. im not going to try and do this crap every single day when i have other games i want to play. this feels like a time sink and a waste of effort. level information is also badly hampered by the fact that its not explained during the starting missions, and what its for. this should be effortlessly explained during the first few missions so you know what the hell is going on. i would definitely hold off on this one unless youre willing to grind your  off 6 ways from sunday and get bored from it before you hit mid-levels and do the same thing over again, with a more severe grind.",1
"this game requires the creation and loging in to a third party system. i didnt play the game, hence no rating.",1
"endless, pointless, repetetive grind. gameplay is mediocre, mission objectives are childlike. microtransactions are horribly priced. atleast its not ugly.",1
"i personaly hate free to play becauce they have microtransactions and lots of them are pay to win. but this games i can injoy. it stil is the same  as all free to play game, but it has solid gameplay and good graphics so if you are just looking for a free game to play, this is your game. but still dont pay for microtransactions!...

"destiny probably wanted to be this game, and thats not a good thing. its very repedative and boring. not enough feel to it when you slice some one and the parkour is not even practical most times. i feel it could use a bit more buffing in terms of gore maybe to feel some real fun. but all in all i used this  game and got some items for free then sold them for cash. play4profit 10/10",1
"gets boring extremely fast as after the tutorial its all about grinding outside of looks the game is just underwhelming for example upgrading mods starts with minimum cost of 15,000 credits cheapest weapons cost 25,000 credits each as a new player you wont make even 1000 credits per mission",1
"when you start playing the game looked pretty good, but over time you realize that it is only slightly more than plenty, and with a very large instability, hopefully with better weather, is a game where you only play to win more weapons, the campaign is boring and meaningless.",1

"this game isnt uploading when it needs to can someone help",1
"that ai is just plain bad. you get the feeling the ai does shot at something close to you, but not at you, sometimes i thought they dont hit you attentionaly. if you want your loot for free, the pve here is right for you. nearly impossible to not win the first few levels. did not played the later once, but i doubt a change here. a massive waste of time.",1

"fun game play. easy to get into. good balance of sword and gun fighting styles. but... you will never get to enjoy this game fully without spending so much money that you go bankrupt. everything in this game is made for you to spend money or have to grind 100 hours to find the one random blueprint to unlock your next warframe... avoid unless you have some extra cash to blow.",1
"graphics: stunning, gameplay: challenging, overall: complete . its completely pay to win out of the beginner tier of objectives. its impossible to solo anything. even more difficult to obtain a competent group and the progression is an absolute joke. just move on.",1

"the game has a great prospect to be one of best action game....but sadly the game gets boring just after 1 hour only. the game even though has a gripping action, soundtrack, graphics (and totally free too) but it gets boring after 1hour due to its reppetativeness....plus the game has no story....i wont mind spending bucks on warframe provided that it becomes atleast slightly diverse...",1

"what i ll say bout it,it s basically grindframe, played it and it s in boring,repetitive missions,terrible ai,main characters are boring",1
"this is one of the worst games i have ever played. it wouldnt let me quit during the tutorial part of the game and upon completing it, it crashed and restarted to the opening cutscene. the mechanics are incredibly sluggish and fragmented, nothing is smooth and intuitive controls are non-existent. the engine is bad and glitchy. it definitely feels like a console-port, though im not sure if it is. horrific, i want to vomit",1

"from a collectors point of view and only from this view : stay away from this game. lot of exclusives that you wont be able to get : - helmets with powers - weapons with good stats - mods (enchant weapons to get special effects) that are better than others - cosmetic stuff (which is okay for badges, less okay for the scarves) your dedication is not needed if youre a new player. because you were late, you wont be able to get the best weapons. they will probably never come back with special events because they dont care. for others players who dont care about playing an uncomplete game, its actually an interesting game that evolves a lot and could be really great if it didnt consider newest players like crap. fortunately for me, im an older one, so i can actually enjoy it.",9
"well great game but becouse of ing bugs i have to download it again for the 5th time seiously i am on rage right now",2
"the only thing i can say is,fix your suckish controller support.",1
"warframe, where do i start? the graphics look nice, you got space ninjas, you have blood and gore, what could go wrong? - everything, major bugs draw me out of the game, such as falling through the map while trying to wall run (happened twice) when in a party with friends sometimes the mouse will stay on your screen after you invite somebody / been invited and accepted doesnt seem like a major problem right? well you cant move till the maps are loaded in (happens alot) by-far, the worst thing about this game is the grind, you want to buy a boltor? that will be 225 platnium or, you can go grind for hours to get a single weapon. or just pay 225 platnium. the platnium prices are a bit over-priced, its not so less of a pay2win game, but a grindfest to where you kinda are forced to buy platnium because some items are almost impossible to get. the game has gotten better lately, but it shouldnt do the kind of payment method they have, its overpriced and its obvious that they are trying to rip you dry. this game isnt that play for gameplay except for the glitches and errors, but the grind is rediculous. i cant rate this game due to it being really good but really bad at the same time (love hate relationship)but i can give it a nickname, grind simulator 2014",1
"to me the game was pretty boring. same goes for missions. abilities are kinda all right, but its not good enough. i was happy to remove the game. i just dont like it and thats it.",1
"this game has a unhealthy tut, and the gameplay is boring. the story is stuipid, and every moment of the game wants you to buy more things, like a slightly better gun for 49.9$. the game also takes up too much memory! only get this game if u hate all games on the market. cus this one is horrible. the reasen why it has verry positive is the fact that they maniuplte players with gifts, to get them to right a good revew. -_- *face palm*.",1
"warframe is a 3rd person shooter with co-op muiltplayer. there are around 140 (rough esimate) levels in warframe all based on different planets under a solar system. each level has different game modes set to it like defence, capture and survival which can add a lot of varitey to the game. in each planet you can find different materials and items as you play through it to complete certain types of things like weapons which can bring a bit of farming at the start. during each planet there will be boss to fight with its own type of style and will drop special blueprints for a warframe. these warframes are different types of suits which can be used like fire and electric. you can only have 2 without having to pay for more. during your travels through space you will come across new blueprints, new bad guys and mod which can make a weapon or frame better. the game is good allround but after time it can become stale having to farm for materials going through the same level 20 times for one thing. during missions you will see that you will be coming acros the same layout of level over and over which makes the game repetitive and boring. in my opinion it is good at start but losses replay value quick i rate 6/10 i know it is in beta but it gets boring and repetitive to quick.",3

"it keeps on frezzing on right at the begining when the ship crashes",1
"its boring, its ugly and really lacks anything that would drive me forward, wanting to see more. actually left in the middle of the second mission because i simply couldnt force myself to play. missions are just dull, levels and enemies are ugly and boring and it feels like playing quake ii from 3rd person view, with a sword, better graphics and no fun at all. its not a bad game but its not a good one too.",1

"my computer is pretty powerful, and this game lagged it so much, that i almost crashed. the graphics are fine and all, but i cant play the game without dropping to 5 fps. plus, to attack you have to click one of the # keys at the top of your keyboard, but i couldnt fix that because i would lag, to the point in which i could not pause or move my mouse. over all, this is a  game.",1
"i removed my bad comment because i thought this game became fun.nope.i come back after a couple of weeks and 3 glitches caused me to almost uninstall the game. pros: graphics/art style cons: crafting system-lets take the rhino for example,12 hours for each part(3 parts),48 (i think)to comibe them all.add all the time it took to get the things you need and you end up with around 100 hours for 1 warframe.also it takes about 15k credits for each of the 3 parts then 35/45k to combine them all replayability-its the same thing over and over.sabotage this....capture him,defend this,go on a mass murdering spree. there is no story-for a game like this i expected a great storyline but there is not one,like at all too easy-there really is no threat in the game,you die super slow but enemies super fast.the only threat is bosses (i will get to that later) nearly impossible to play solo-bosses,take the final boss in world of warcraft and put him on crack,cocaine,and steroids.you need like a full party. this game is bad and the creators should feel bad (not really).if you want a good f2p game play warthunder",1
"they sure do shove micro-transactions down your throat. 2 of the 3 available in the tutorial cost a lot, a lot of the weapons they let you use cost a lot, and my daily reward was a discount on my next platinum purchase that only lasts 48 hours.",1

"it shouldnt be this difficult to do something as basic as log out of the game!? wtf. i have played a ton of games and maybe i am missing the obvious, but i see no way to log out or quit the game besides force-quit. life is too short and this is free. sianara.",1
"the only reason that made me not recommand this game is simple, its not becasue the game play or story line or other ingame aspects, becasue its listed as an mmo game but actually doesnt have anything to do with it, the only things that you might concider as an mmo is playing a mission with other players thats all,when i downloaded the game, i thought that its is like world of warcraft and other mmo games. while trying it i discoverd that this game is a third person shouter with slightly multiplayer action. so i felt tricked and fouled when i downloaded it and found out that its not an mmo. the game itself isnt bad at all, good gameplay and story, wide variety of weapons hope this review benefits you",1
"just eye candy, the game has a terrible control setup and the tutorial level doesnt teach much. quest objectives are also unclear. im all for no handholding, but this is ridiculous. also a lock on enemy feature would be very useful. its also a bit pay2win",1
"all im saying is that this is definatly not worth your time...",1
"i liked this game for a time. i really wish steam gave a depends recommendation for this game, because it is fun for the first few hours. afterwards it gets repetitive. it would be better if all the maps werent the same, but they are. the story is alright. i didnt care about the story, though, i focused more on combat(which is the greatest feature in the game.) you can use bows, throwing knives, katanas, rifles, and a lot of different things. heres where it gets bad. the replayability is nonexsistant. not even the daily rewards kept me coming back. not to mention that pretty much all of the characters(named warframes) were available for cash instead of space credits or galaxy googas or whatever. i give it a 6/10.",1
"unlocks take so long by playtime that the options are to get thoroughly bored of what you have, or pay to unlock something else. now dont get me wrong i think free to play games should have good paid options, but there are no meaningful options to pay that arent basically the cost of an entire game on steam. different frames or weapons cost around $10, which is absurdly overpriced to me, when an entire game on sale can drop as low as $2.",1
"they try an get you to spend real money on revives after you die 12 times, otherwise when you die you forefit all your progress, and as a noob your gonna die. i uninstalled immediately after i realized this. what a joke, i can not believe the game is as popular as it is or that people would actually spend money on it. literally once u complete a few missions youve done everything the game has to offer. stay away from this game is my advice.",1
"worst game ever! do not buy (even though it is free) as it is sooo ing boring!",1
"oh my god the lag. it seems like it would be a great game all-in-all...if you could even get through the first level. i have a 2 year old pc toshiba with very little applications and i still can barely run this game. its glitchy, its slow, it laggs a hell of a lot. if you have some super computer, then be my guest and download the game, otherwise, save yourself a world of pain and just forget about it.",1

"great game however the mouse delay makes it almost unplayable.",2
"the visuals are fantastic, the gameplay is solid, matchmaking works just fine and theres not much lag. whats wrong with it then? getting new items and warframes (character classes) is an enormous grind. ive put 30+ hours into the game and havent been able to aquire a single new warframe yet. this is because certain components of warframes can only be found in the latest stages of the game, meaning if you dont want to spend cash, you essentially have to nearly beat the game using the same 4 abilities that come with your starter warframe before youll be able to get a new one. it would be like forcing you to only use 1 champion in league of legends until you reach level 30.",1

"there is no point in using the steam service because warframe uses its own, completely independent. so there are no auto updates, you have to login with your war frame acount everytime and say good bye to your friends, if you want to play with them you will have to add them through the game again. the ui is really bad and the optimization of this game doesnt recognize my dedicated graphics card. even though the gameplay might be sort of enjoyable, there is nothing that makes it more interesting than other fps. also the amount of time needed to upgrade your character and equipment is ridiculous, just another pay-to-win tittle, not recommended at all. 60/100",1

"its a great game. also i would like pvp. p.s. i havent played it for long.",3
"warframe was a very interesting game. it definitely had its grind having to rerun lots of missions to get the materials you needed to craft other frames and weapons. id probably have had more fun and stayed longer in it if i hadnt just bought the frame and weapons i wanted outright and used those with my friends. then again, i suppose if it wasnt for that option i might not have wanted to do the grind anyways. the action is very fast paced and crazy. the survival missions get really hectic and thats when the abilities flare up the most. while i didnt get hooked into it like some of my friends have. it was enjoyable to play when i was in the mood for it.",1

"warframe is, in my opinion, one of the best examples of a free to play. it keeps you entertained with the cool boss battles, weapons, and skill sets(warframes). though this game can get quite stale if you attempt to play it alone, which means get a couple of friends to download this and set off a weekend to beat the crap out of enemies with your preferred loadout. also, you can obtain every weapon and warframe without paying, it just more of a, pardon my language, pain in the  because it means you have to go full grind mode and collect massive amounts of items for a item, which is actually the incentive to pay for platinum, real currency, to take less time to grind. still this game is much better than most other free to plays, which show a pay to win model.",1
"this game is a good 3rd person shooter. it has good graphics and it has good game mechanics. warframe is fun to play with friends . in warframe you get to become part of this clan of space ninjas and you get to pick wich ninja you wanna be. in my opinion ill give it an 80/100 .",1

"well, to start of, this is a free to play game, so you can expect that you have 2 ways to earn your things... you either pay or work hard for it. the gameplay itself its great, and sometimes very team based. i dont understand the push to talk system because, when your playing with a bunch of people its hard to tell who is talking.",1

"this is how you do f2p. with one or two exceptions, this is the most fair, balanced f2p model i have ever seen. the exception to this is the very limited invintory space the game give you at start, forcing you to buy more slots, other than this, the f2p model here is flawless. now we talk about the graphics: personally, i think this game looks good. very good. my rig can handle maxed out graphics, however my amd processor does not let nvidia phsx run, other than that, pretty good graphics, lower end pcs should be able to run the game fairly well on the lowest settings. now, moving on to gameplay: th controls are...awkward at first, but once you are used to them, they feel very smooth, and fast. not much else to say about the controls right now. overall i like this game, and the developers behind it. download warframe and see if its your cup of tea.",4

"when i first started this game, i thought it was pretty awesome. i had a great time running through the missions and just playing with other people. then, i noticed the pay to win feature in later missions. thats probably the only thing i dislike about the game. for example, the first time i played with a player who payed to get a sentinel, his sentinel killed everything and all the rest of us could do was follow him. but, then i realized that even with players like that, the game still maintains a pretty good challenge of trying to out do them and just trying to win. tl;dr: its really really pay to win but still would recommend.",1

"recommending because its a free game, cant complain. so then, steam says i have 6 hours played so far, and well after those 6 hours i still feel like im doing the exact same thing i was doing in the beginning. the game looks ok, the melee combat and bullet deflection looks quite nice, but the levels feel exactly the same. i find myself enjoying a maximum of 2 missions before having to take a break, which is very unusual for me. that said, i do think that if you buy in-game currency via steam or the market, the larger weapon and character variety will make the game a lot more fun. im not patient enough to unlock things (its really quite slow - get materials, then craft, then wait until its crafted), thus i didnt quite enjoy the game as much as i would have liked. this game is also significantly more fun if you can play with friends on skype or something. tl;dr - good simple shooter just for the sake of killing things. progression without donate too slow.",1
"great game with constant updates and improvements. the best thing is, its free!!",2
"been playing it since cbt and before it got onto steam. great fun at first but will get grindy near end game. the dev are working on improving the end game contents and adding new stuffs with every update so its worth a shot and they take players feedbacks seriously. gameplay: 7/10 graphics: 9/10 sound: 5/10 replayability: 8/10 community: 5/10 dev support: 10/10",1

"remember the first trailer for dark sector that showed that the game was originally to take place in space and in the far future? well digital extremes decided to take the concept of that early version of dark sector and make a completely new and free to play third person action title out of it. and so warframe was created. you play as a member of the alien race known as the tenno, a slight nod to the protagonist in dark sector, who has been summoned from the dark reaches of space to the galaxy to fight the evil grineer who are out to take over the galaxy and also wipe out the tenno at the same time. but youre far from helpless in your struggle, you have a special battlesuit called a warframe, each one of them have unique abilities that can turn the tide of battle in your favor, a wide array of firearms and several types of melee weapons, all of which are powerful enough to cut an enemy apart with one single powerful swipe. and you will also be fighting alongside other tennos in your mission to rid the galaxy of the grineer as well as any other alien race that intend to wipe you out.",1
"great game and it was for free highly reccomend it !!",1
"ninjas in space, think of naruto all that funky jutsu they use, cool moves, ultimate finishes ect...... its nothing ike that",1
"this game is amazing. most maps are very fast paced(except defense missions). this is mostly a pve game. you can tell right away that this game is made by passionate developers who really care about making a good game, and if you spend some time on their twitch channel and get to know some of the people who put this game together...youd definitely see that. the game gets frequent updates, with loads of new content. the mechanics of the actual game are nice. the mod system is ok...i like the extras you get from mods but it will definitely take you a while to sift through your thousands of mods to figure out which ones you want to use. the crafting system is nice, i actually do like that it takes a day or two to craft stuff. my biggest complaint would be the limmited inventory space, limmited character space....this is designed to piss you off and make you purchase more space. as a free game though, you can definitely enjoy the hell out of it. there is a decent variety of game modes in this game but after a while it does start to feel like a grind fest...with not much reason to be one...because you dont need the extra stats to beat everything. but thinking about it more...itd be really difficult to create the ideal system with that in mind. the other thing i really like about this game is they have events going on all the time, to spice things up, but you can also get really useful items that normally youd have to buy from the shop. ps. lotus is a total babe.",3
"this game is awsome its not that difficult and doesnt bore you to death after playing like 1000 times like most games",2
"i... love ... this game!!!! what more can i say, its free, its fast paced and its ninjas in space.... the controls are fluid whether using a keyboard or controller, and the community is very competitive and helpful. the clans that are in this game really do battle it out for control its amazing. it does require some hefty graphics card mumbo jumbo but even so its still great",1
"its an amazingly addictive game once you get into it however it is in development and bugs are common.",1
"honestly i wouldnt recommend this game. i will admit it can be fun from time to time but unless you want to pay real cash then getting new frames takes so much grinding and time its honestly not really worth it. most of the areas re-cycle themselves and even when youre not grinding the same level for items it feels like you are. its creative and almost a brand new idea if rengoku for the psp didnt come out like e_e 6 years before this. overall not worth your time.",1
"good but could be a lot btter that said it is still in beta. if like me you intend to play solo the game can be quite lonely and to date lacks depth in terms of story development. also can be expensive to play if you chose to buy platinum.",3

"absolutely raises the bar in the free to play category. graphics are smooth, contemporary and optimized. gameplay equally so. unlike most games in the f2p genre, this one is considerably generous. cosmetic add-ons aside, the game gives you everything you need - free. modifications, weapons, in-game currency, and even warframes. kudos to the developers, although they almost certainly still make a buttload of dough. nothing about this game forces players to pay-to-win. if youre willing to spend real cash, thats your choice. at least give it a go. itll cost you nothing but your time.",1

"warframe is a great game were being a space ninja sometimes involves using rocket launchers or sawed off shotguns.",2
"i loved this game look at my f#king hours! but in all seriousness its pretty damn awesome excluding the slight repetitiveness but you can oversee that while youre hacking and slashing or if youre a normal person shooting is good too. not to mention the game is not a p2w you can get everything excluding cosmetic and slots but that shouldnt stop you go download this game right now.",6
"well, this is a fun game so far but there is a bug that makes you start the whole beginning thing over again when ive already completed it. this may not have happened to you but it happened to me. you can se my hours on this game not much because of this bug. and when you star its in windowed mode for some reason, why?. its a free to play game (or pay to play as most free to play games are considered as). but just try it out and see for yourself because what the heck! its free!",1
"warframe is a great game once you get into it, so much customisation in weapons, new characters (warframes) and pets. it has some grinding in it but overall i think a very rewarding game.",3
"warframe was fun for a while but after a good 3-5 hours, you see yourself just grinding till the very end. but overall, its not that bad with the graphics, gameplay, etc. i give it a 7/10",1
"i have only been playing this game since april 2014, but i am addicted enough to spend hundred hours (probably will until thousands) and experience almost all the characters, weapons, and companions! the design of the factions are pretty cool and ability to modify your appearances really add a lot to the game, not to mention all those actions you get in-game with your mod-customized primary, secondary, and melee weapons together with your parties. i am hoping in the near future there will be more to the lore / storyline! thumbs up. recommended.",1
"its reallly cool. space ninja. shoot things. do missions",1
"its a beta, but as of u14 i cant stand the interface, it feels confined to a single menu, and thats the game.. i liked pre update 14, but i cant argue some of the things they added were phenominally great.",4

"i cant play well the game is always getting crash :(",1
"this game is so f***in awesome ninja style i choice loki",1
"imagine mass effect 3 multiplayer with worse gameplay and more grind. thats warframe.",4
"great third person shooter. the visual style is fairly unique. action is fast, and the warframes allow for a great variety of gameplay. you play against ai opponents, alongside other players. a recent update added pvp, so now you can play against other warframes as well. wall jumping, melee weapons, guns...oh so many guns! graphics are top notch with all the fancy shaders that you would expect from a modern pc title, yet it can be scaled easily to lower system specs. the user interface could use a lot of work, right now it is more style than substance and makes upgrading mods and your warframe more difficult than it needs to be. but, it looks great. you dont need to pay to get into the game, and once you get into it a few bucks here or there to speed things along will probably be worth it. the developers are dedicated to the title, and version 14 added several new features for new players to make the game more accessible. oh, and did i mention ninja wall running?? yes there is ninja wall running! run along walls to avoid fire and shoot your opponents, flip up onto a platform and summersault over your enemy to slash them with your sword...all great fun!",1
"i have only played this game for a few days, but i have to say i am pretty impressed. for a free 2 play game its very well done especially graphically, reminds me a bit of the borderlands loot mechanics, but instead of guns, its about mods. it has its glitches here and there, but again its free, and so far it does appear that the devs work out the kinks. if you liked borderlands / mass effect / crysis, this is a blend of all 3, it is free after all.",1
"1 mission in, i was hooked. its the fastest game of its type that i have played. far faster than titan fall, far faster than vindictus. its fast. there are some bugs with the update 14, over 3/4 of which were fixed within 2 days of the release. i can see the devs care about the game, updates are coming fast and often, and the game is just beautiful to play, and beautiful to look at. in no other game, have i ever seen so much teamwork.",4
"great game! even though you can get most items for character and weapon customization from within the game itself, there is a constant incentive to buy platinum. avoid using platinum for mundane things like speeding up build times of weapons and wareframes. other than that this game is fast paced and has incredible depth in character customiazation and weapon builds. constant updates bring new things game modes and mechanics to the game that keep you interested and even draw you back to it. plus its free to play!",9
"warframe is a really fun free-to-play mmo that takes gameplay by missions. teaming up with up to 3 other players, each 4 person squad tackles the designated challenge with an array of different weapons, and warframe, providing a multitude of power and player combinations. the game itself can be entirely played without spending a single cent, through hard work and determination. though if youre the kind of person who wants to collect everything, you will have to pay for extra weapon and warframe slots (not the frames and weapons themself). since im that kind of person, ive spent money here and there for more slots. i highly recommend this game for anyone that enjoys 3rd person action/shooters. especially since its free!",1
"this game is seemingly fun, loot driven, has good progression, enjoyable aesthetic and design, but in my limited run with the game thus far i wanted to give a first impression of the initial state of matchmaking. i mean, the game is pretty easy early on and thats to be expected, but with the way matchmaking works the game tends to pair people by latency and not their gear level. when i finally group, i dont need raiden super god robot flame sword explosion guy joining my low level nodes and skullhumping all the challenges into submission before i even face them (sprint mods). that is boring, and i might as well be waxing their plated  to avoid my team mate from dying of friction burns as he speedster hacknslashes to victory. with moments like those, it degenerates to me playing solo and then... whats the point? metal gear rising has better combat and slicker boss designs, so what would be the point of slogging through this game? well, progression. there is a permanency to content being added. there is a satisfaction to unlocking new content, and looking over the wealth of unlockables i as a new player can kick back and say to myself yeah, that looks like itll be awesome when i finally get there. all in all, if youre new like me and looking to start this game - do it with friends, have them be the same gear level as you, and scratch and claw and work your way to cool hi-tech horizons.",1
"do you like grinding? if so this game is pretty awesome. its basically all you do. exp grind, crafting mats grind, and more (grinding, that is). plus, being a space ninja is rad.",2
"you can play it as a single player game if you dont feel like playing with others (though the matchmaking system is quite good). rich storyline, good voice acting. controls feel really natural. nice amount of personalization in your choice of class, weapons, and abilities. excellent visuals - very immersive. loving this game so far!",1

"great free to play game if you love ninjas and sci-fi!",2
"warframe is, to say the least, absurd. you play as a post-human space warrior with powers supported by an eldritch demension to slaughter cannon-fodder hordes of degenerate clones and cyborg corporate drones. update 14 just came out, and its definitely a huge step from the beta this once was to a full game. early playing, once an absurdly difficult task, is now assisted by a whole tutorial quest designed to get you into the game and never come outside again. you possess a small spaceship now, used to upgrade and purchase weapons. its definitely helped the immersion quite a bit. a big part of this game is grind: playing parts over and over again to get resources to craft weapon parts. you can get everything in the game for free except cosmetics, which must be purchased with in-game currency. the grind can be fun, or it can be not fun. how that turns out is up to you. story is minimal, gleaned from the lines of your boss and entries in the in-game codex. what we do have, though, seems amazing, a sci-fi epic spanning thousands of years of which your little adventure is merely the tail end. so overall? its worth playing, and giving it a try. the devs are very good listeners, and seem very involved in the game theyre making, so you really are in on the ground floor here. spending money may not be advisable, but if the grind breaks your soul, by all means spend some cash. some weapons are just nearly impossible to craft - ask about argon crystals and youll understand. good luck, tenno.",3
"a very addictive game you will explore our echo system like never before, earn multiple weapons armor, pets, abilities and warframes. in a free to play co-op multiplayer experience. i find that the game sticks out from other games with its map randomizer the maps are never the same. even though the game is quite repetitive, the game is way more fun to craft and earn your upgrades and weapons by collecting resources on the multiple planets, though if your that guy who just wants to get to the good stuff you can buy your way through the game, though i find it ruins the game a little. i would rate this game an 8.5/10 for its creativity and gameplay overall its a great free to play game and i recommend you give it a try.",1
"magic ninjas with guns and rocket launchers who do parkour 10/10 would warframe again",2
"a great stealth shooter, handicapped by its inability to tell you what the missions objectives are. there are no tool tips in mission selection to tell you what to do. having to use google to find out what mission objectives are ahead of time makes this beautiful and challenging game abusive and neglectful. there is no quest logs, or hints that lead you to the next correct mission. players cant find out where parts spawn in game without trial and error. the game is solid but the on ship ui and quest interface in so pathetic it makes this not worth the learning curve. the game also gives you a choice of three starting classes but there is no way to test each one with out making 3 accounts or spending cash on the other two free classes. if you like ninja shooters this is a great game to try, but until they figure out how to build a story line and a quest manual it is more of hack and slash than a well crafted game experience. leveling seems to be completely useless in determining difficulty as stats only increase through moding your gear not through levels. this means your level 15 and your level 1 can have the same stats if you dont mod your gear. something prehaps your constantly talking computer could mention. all and all this game is fun to play but isnt worth investing the time to figure out how to move up the ranks and play harder missions. unless you like research this is a try and trash not a keeper.",2
"the games is excellent, it has a great co-op gme play. don;t expect much of a story and honestly youll learn the game better form youtube videos, the game has an excellent free to play model, you can truly play this game without putting a dollar in it. the loot collecting and customisation can get highly addicting. graphics are nice and game play is smooth. a solid 9 / 10",1

"its got ninjas, coop, spaceships, guns, throwables, swords, amazing graphics, and companions! the recipe for a good game... except for the ing micro-transactions... that turns the game into a pay to win game. its impossible to know who bought all their gear, and who slaved for hours building it. i recommend but only if you have a deep pocket full of $$$. that way you can be like the rest of the payers not players. it even has ing starter kits!!!",1
"im enjoying the gameplay so far! only complaint is not being able to easily obtain platinum in-game, but everything else is absolutely amazing! excaliburs balaned set is exactly as the warframes discription says: perfect for beginners. not only that, but im not usually very good at first or third-person shooter games, but i think im doing well in this game! vor was my definition of one bad guy you just do not wanna mess with. hes creepy, ugly, and really gets in the players head as well, to the point where you want to get rid of him once and for all, and are more than happy to do so! lotus and ortis are both very well-made supporting characters, and overall, if i had to rate this, id say 9/10. very good, and very addictive! (i laughed at myself when i kept trying missions to get a morphites, only to find i had the exact number of platinum needed to buy it! xd )",1
"this game is amazing though i found that it is more fun and easier to play with friends and it does have quiet a bit of grinding but it also has a lot of diversity from other third person shooter games and its the only one ive seen that has actually clans.",1
"fun game, when i understand it more will update my review but so far so good.",1
"this game is awesome. graphics are awesome. gameplay is tons of fun. play it! play it now~",1
"this is a really good game despite lacking a story. it has a main missions but they arent that important. it focuses more gameplay and weapon variety because lets face it, if you have played this game it gets insane sometimes. the game visually looks good, plays well for the most part but still has some issues. and my only major issue with the game is pay2play, the prices are ridiculous, you would spend 20$ on platinum to buy 1 single character, thats right 1. alot of items also take a long time to find pieces to but in the end the missions are usually fun enough to go through and gather material and just in general kickass anyways.",1
"hell of a fun in co-op mode or even single player..public doesnt really work that well because most of the random players got a bad connection. you start from a space ship hub where you can unlock different planets to travel, new warframes, weapons or companions. on the planets you fight simple enemies in similar levels but hey, you can walljump and... chop enemies in two pieces while sliding 10/10!!!!! :d",1
"fantastic game with or witout freinds would recomend to anyone",2
"mission log 45: kubrow finally matured. put a couple of forma into her today, she is stronger than ever. i think im going to sell some of her dna too, because platinum is always top priority. mission log 51: i turned into a puddle today. dumb grineer kept drowning themselves in me, now i feel dirty. oh, and i managed to unleash the kraken too. i wonder if i can use the tentacles for other purposes.. mission log 53: i switched out my warframe today, looks like i now have the power to turn invisible. hell, i even able to teleport. god knows what ill be using my new powers for! mission log 60: i now control the dead. i can summon their souls. theyve been doing all my chores for me, pity my ship is a tad too small. mission log 101: i have received news that the orokin are planning to take over the whole star chart. this might be my last mission log, i dont know if ill survive. mission log 111: im recording this in the field. the situation doesnt look good.. if you find my ship, please, take care of it. ordis can be crazy at times, but he bears no ill will. i have put my kubrow into stasis before i left for the void too. take care of her for me. my arsenal will be my thanks to you, feel free to use it as you deem fit. colonel blessance, nekros, signing out. best game ever 10/10 would recommend.",8
"i love this game, a very good parkour element mixed with balanced shooting makes it a very fun game",3
"fun....but it takes a certain mind set to properly enjoy it....u must be pacient since itsin beta and bugs are to be expected also does a lot of unfair things and makes u feel like livestock sometimes so keep that in mind before u chose to invest in this game(this reffers to both time and money)",8
"this game is really good. for a small company to keep tabs on their game like you guys have is amazing!!! keep up the good work and i expect more greatness out of this developer.",1
"i downloaded this game but it keeps crashing i dont know what the issue on how to fix it",1
"awesome graphics, great gameplay, really addictive and, ofcourse, sweet co-op pve pwnage....as a frekkin space ninja! play!",1
"damn im really haveing a blast with this game,very slick.",1
"a lot of fun, yet also quite complicated. the only reason i would say i would facepalm is because of the rank up system",1
"after the update 14 the game has a few bugs, but im sure theyll fix it in 2.0. they need to fix it where uninstalling mods during fusion wont freeze the game. fixing the kubrow quest because even if you get an egg it doesnt allow you to hatch it, and you cant get another egg since you already have one. also the combat system for the kubrows since they suck, so they need to fix that too. other than that this game is quite nice, it is a fun game, and i think ill give it 8/10 maybe giving armor to the kubrows, and fixing those bugs and the combat system for the pets.",1
"quite possibly the best free to play game ive ever played. stunning visuals, smooth gameplay, excellent combat system and gear selection. i highly reccomend this.",1
"ive been playing this game a lot over the past 4 months, so far im really impressed. great graphics. smooth gameplay. action packed levels, easy learning curve, tons of weapons. new content gets added on a regular basis and patching is quick and problem free. dozens of game modes. in-game clans even get a sci-fi customizable/expandable base. craft new weapons and armor out of materials and blueprints found while blasting and slashing your way through intense hoards of aliens, infected, space marines, or other awesome things. not just any weapons and armor, but awesome sci-fi-ninja- medieval-laser-explosion-missle bow and arrow-jet hammer-living plasma rifle-gravity and time-space bending weapons and armor. etc. there is no end to the new weapons and stuff i can make and, suprise!, every time its something cool and ridiculous. thumbs up.",2
"warframe was one of the very first games i got on steam. frankly, i dont have any regrets. its perfect for people looking for a game with awesome gameplay and weapons. it also has some nice art and mechanics. only downside is, if ur a person without a lot of time, then this isnt the game for u. u would have to spend so much time getting the weapons and mods, but for me, thats really fun",3
"generic ballistics, poor story, its free, though, and unlike most games its not pay2win at all, because of course paying will get you things faster, as with most f2p games anyway. im just not a fan of grinding, but for a free game, its pretty cool.",1
"update 14 intruduces many new things that appear to be for the better, but sadly youll likely have loads of bugs, such as freezing out of your game and having to reboot the entire thing, connection issues to parties, having to possibly solo quest missions that will likely be too hard, boss scaling so once what was easy is now a super pain in the  when you just want to get something done. dont bother getting the game until they can actually fix it. before i get replies saying that its me, i can assure you that it isnt, ive done everything to troubleshoot any problems, i have a good pc, and run on low graphics settings, and have 20upload and 40download, all ports are properly forwarded, and ive tried with/without them forwarded, same results, ive had other people have the same problems as me. if in the event your game is working properly, youre lucky, but ive had it with the game, and will no longer be continuing to play it.",2
"one of the most fun games ive played in a long time. it gives the feel of an over the shoulder shooter while still sustaining that feel of an rpg. with the multiple choices of weapons, frames, and toys in the game one is sure to not become bored very easily. their is alittle grinding to the game to get some items but in the long run it doesnt take all that long really.",1
"its pretty good for a free game graphics wise and a large variety of missions/quests in which you can travel far distances to other planets in the solar system hopefully they will add even more soon. this game could have a good future ahead of it.",1
"the first thing that happen to me was that i couldnt click the mission node to begin. second, i tried asking the community for help but they were annoying s! i asked what does the mission node look like? and a person replies a mission node is a node with other players backing that up with a lol. so if you want to deal with bugs, an annoying community, boring gameplay, than this game is right for you!",1
"5/5 - its that game where youre ninjas are in space. fun game to play.",6
"space ninja with magic. the only negative thing about this game is that the plural of ninja is ninja. and its sometimes buggy. but they just released an update where you can earna space dog. 12/10 goty every year.",2
"at first, i didnt like this game because it didnt have a very good tutorial at all in its somewhat earlier stages. i had to use youtube to understand what im doing lol. but once i got a hold of it, it is one of the best 3rd person shooter ive played since a long time. and now it has a storyline! plus the developers keep updating it and they have not yet disappointed.",4
"for a free to play you should definitly play it! its well worth your time. this is a game where you play off and on playing continuously will wear you out.",1
"why i cant verify this game with my steam account @_@",4
"ninjas play free - warframe warframe is a fast paced online third person shooter. i would recommend to play online, but the game can be played offline too. there are challenges like bosses, levels, ranks, worlds, and many more to discover. one of the most important features are charecters and customization. the customization in warframe can make the player look advanced or cool in certan ways. the player can mainly customize there helmate, torso, arms, and legs. the player can also customize the swords color. the last feature i would like to go over is guns and bows. the guns are for people that like to go into the fight and have a strong wepon at there side. as for the bow, its way stronger and is better used at long range. but there are also crossbows that can be used at both close and long range. over all, i would rate warframe a 9/10",1
"excellent gameplay and characters. good hardcore missions and epic skills and weapons. this game is the beginning of a new generation of gaming.",1
"got a frame that controls air,,,, suffocated. 10/10",6
"do you like ninjas what about robots lucky for you a freak accident combined them into robinjas play",1
"this is probably the most unique game ive ever played. sure it has a few glitches, but it combines a sci-fi atmosphere into a combat situation where you must use stealth, hack systems, parkour, or just go guns blazing to complete the mission. also it has co-op online, character and weapon customization all while being free. i strongly recommend warframe as it will keep receiving updates to become the perfect game. my only complaint? it is extremely difficult to earn new weapons and characters, as they want people to use in game purchases. still, amazing game.",1
"the game is so bad it cant even install properly 10/10",1
"youre space alien batman fighting against clones and robots while looting resources from their planets... its ing alien bandito star wars 10/10",6
"interesting concept, stunning visuals, good gameplay. the background music sets a cliche samurai-faceoff mood (not that its bad). the best part has got to be its co-op play and clan support, such as the dojo. the sad thing about the game, is how it forces players to go though micro-transactions to progress in the game, such as the restriction of warframe/weapon slots. even if that is not the case, the level-scaling for the game is broken to a level such that over 90% of the weapons become near-obselete at higher level missions. and for a game based on ninjas, there is surprisingly no proper stealth mechanics set in place for any stealth gameplay. the game is too focused on gun-blazing action and flashy skills. regardless, it is still a great game worth playing.",3
"definately is worth the download, its fun and can keep you busy for a while. you always want to get materials to build things and always trying to get the top weapon in the game, one downside is the platinum thing, i mean really this ruins this game but if you dont mind not having the best skins and things like that, then youll love this game. 8.5/10",1
"i do not like this game whatsoever, its like halo where they throw every monster at you every 3 seconds and i personally did not enjoy the game whatsoever.",1
"out of the many games i play i still find myself drawn to warframe from time to time. it starts a long time after the game dark sector and the lore and the characters are simple enough for a child to understand. warframe is a must have if you are strapped for cash and looking for both a stealth and assault type of entertainment. the controls are fluid, the graphics are amazing and the overall feel of the game seems to be alive. warframe also sets a f2p point of genius by making almost every item in the store craftable freely. i wish more people would play and pay. this is one game that needs to last for dark sector and f2p sake.",1
"this game suck a$$ if you pay you have a chance other wise dont bother",2
"want to be a ninja? in space? with a sexy tight suit? then get this game, its free anyway. :d",1
"without a doubt one of the best games i have ever played.",1
"there is actually no reason not to get this game. youll be hooked into this indepth universe, and even if you manage to get out, youll come crawling back asking for more.",1
"its a free co-op game with clan pvp in the mix, alot of weapons to pick from as well as frames them selfs, each with there own powers, like some control fire, water, ice, lightning, others contol sound or good at healing the party have to say very good game, with alot of good clans",6
"great game, pretty large learning curve also but once you understand the game and start to aquire more powerful items the game does feel much better to play.",2
"good graphics, smooth gameplay, and great currency system + frequent updates & lots of content",1
"this game is awesome, warning, very time consuming, and very addictive",2
"best free to play game ive tried. you dont have to spend real money at all if you dont want and its great with friends co-op!",4
"very fun game! it can get a bit boring grinding out resources, but they keep bringing in new content and if you have friends on it, itll be sure to keep you for hours on end. i have over 200 hours in and not planning on stopping anytime soon!",4
"very fun. a bit on the slower side, but you have fun while you grind.",1
"i only tried warframe because i noticed the art direction was exactly the same as another game, dark sector. go look it up, because its pretty neat. anyway, it turns out warframe was the original idea that digital extremes wanted to make. this is grand because warframe is rather good. back when i first started playing warframe, it was nothing like it is now. everything has been polished and lots of content has been added. its your run of the mill co-op game with grinding all over the place. thankfully, its possible to get everything without paying a cent. nothing outside of some cosmetics is locked from the player. all of the loot drops for schematics and parts are based on chance, but they only drop at certain locations. if you know where, you can find it. if you have some friends to play with, its even easier to get the items. theres no publisher, such as ea, lurking over digital extremes and demanding things; so, theres more emphasis on pleasing the players into forking over money than resorting to  tactics to leech money, see ea (again). chances are, youll play this for a good 10 hours, then fork over $20 to just get a slight boost and to support de. warframe is a prime example of how to do free-to-play. worth your time.",4
"corridor shooter simulator 2014 10/10 would play again",1
"ive played warframe way before it was on steam, and since then a lot has changed. its always been a beautiful and high quality game, but that beauty and quality has been since made so much more interesting with a story that any space ninja cowboys will enjoy.",1
"warframe is a very fun 3rd person shooter that has some cool matrix style game play elements. witht the new release the story line has been buffed up and is quite interesting. if you like short but challenging missions that dynamically change as they are unfolding this is a perfect game to try out.",1
"really amazing game. the combination between shooting and hack n slash at its finest. the movement is great. and there is a lot of variety in skills, weapons, playstyles. developers are really taking care of the game, gets lot of patches and new stuff all the time. even tho the last, but very big, update had some buggs, yet they are fixing it with little patches every day. only con i give this game is that it might feel repetive after some time. there are lot of different mission types, still feels the same sometimes. but others than this its cool to see that levels and progress dont matter that much here. so a new player can easily join up someone with a lot more playtime. he may not be so effective but still he can enjoy it the same way. over all, just great game. and i can recommend it to everyone who likes action.",2
"ninja aliens in the future solar system with supernatural powers fighting robots,infestation and clones you are going to get hooked",2
"this is easily one of the best f2p games on steam, its such a shame my computer doesnt run it very well. but i do know what ill be downloading once i get a better computer!",1
"great scifi 3rd person shooter but can get a bit boring if you dont have something to work towards 4/5 stars",1
"space ninjas in exosuits using superpowers. nuff said. but beyond the intriguing lore and beneath the joy youll feel catapulting off of a catwalk and unloading a clip into the poor corporate soul beneath you, are the basic flaws any would expect to find in a free to play multipeople game. namely finding people to play with and finding a reason for you to trek your way around every mission for every planet after youve obtained all the things youve wanted to obtain. other than that... its updates are fairly regular and as a game thats still finding its feet, it has and will continue to improve in leaps and bounds. worth making an account and sitting through a patch for.",2
"this is the free to play game ive ever spent money on solely becuase i have so much appreciation for the game and its developers. it is insanely fun and given me more hours of intertainment then most high budget ubisoft or ea titles. it has a very cool setting, looks great, probably the most fun 3rd person shooter, and not spending money doesnt hold you back or limit your enjoyment of the game. my only complaints are the prices of the cosmetic items and, as far as i can tell, no quick matchmaking system to join a random mission on a particular planet. this game is fun, free, and definitely worth a try.",3
"space ninjas the game good if you like grind-based games, since youll have to make everything unless you wanna pay with real money. also good if you like shooters, can be hard at times, but gets really fun later on.",3
"damn straight i recommend this game! so much fun had with this!",1
"electrocuted 3 dudes, jump flipped into a crowd of a half dozen more and gunned them down through a plasma shield, then wall walked across a gap to a distant platform while shooting at more dudes. fell directly into a lava pit immediately after, like a true professional. 12/10",1
"the lights in my house flickered once and i thought the stalker was coming for me. i  my pants. i should stop playing warframe so much. 11/10 would poop my pants again.",5
"this game is tons of fun, from the array of awesome space ninjas and beautiful graphics to the fluid combat system. i clocked hundreds of hours into it. the endgame pretty much consists of maxing out the weapons you bought or took days to build. each time you want to make it more efficient to max out, you have to reset its level. its free to play, but that doesnt mean its without temptations to spend money. its extremely expensive to upgrade some of the mods to put in your gear, and there is a whole trading market for them. however, its not very optimized for steam, and it shows. a few updates ago, the launcher completely stopped working, so i can no longer patch or play this game. so i recommend this to any shooter fan -- if it works.",3
"after the tutorial this game really picks up pace. the way you play is up to you, you could use stealth or run in guns blazing essentially you are a space ninja when you start then you can evolve into more of a space ninja or into a tank when you get a high enough level.",1
"its a bit tricky at the start but is fun to play with other players online. running around as ninjas destroying everything is immensley fun.",1
"if you like ninjas/aliens, this is a game for you. youre a complete badass with a sword, primary and secondary weapon. most items are able to be collected in game, instead of having to buy everything (free to play cliche). if you want to build items instead of buying them, it takes time to gather the materials and the building itself takes a ton of time, but is worth it in the end. super fun, especially when with a group of friends. at first it can get repetitive, but the more you play and earn better items and new planets, it becomes more fun that it was when you started. overall, great game!",1
"the current game is quite enjoyable. despite still being in a beta stage there is quite a lot of content, the combat system is dynamic and allows a lot of different playstyles. but since it is a beta it there are alos some bugs (which happen every now and then but generally dont cause too much problems (though youll probably have to manually abort a few missions or alt+f4 the game). a few bugs ive encountered: game hanging on trying to find a squad, some hosting problems (especially if the host disconects), getting the wrong map, enemies not spawning correctly (like they dont spawn for a while - though this is great if you get this in interception missions <- atype of point capture mission). clan battles (battles between clans that allow non clan members to fight for either side) are in my experience pretty laggy at times. ive several times experienced massive desyncs where i had to actually guess where the enemy that i just saw will be for my attacks to hit and see what i did seconds after it or even be completely unable to change or use my weapons. this is not a common problem but since the game is still in beta stage dont be surprised if it happens to you too. i really am looking forward to see how this game will evolve especially to see if lotus (your ingame advisor/boss figure) will start giving actually useful inmission advice (instead of the usual ambigous you are surrounded by enemy or a lot of enemies ahead, prepare for a fight).",1
"this game is alot like halo but free, awsome game.",1
"am i the only one finding it hard to download this game?? pls reply *the downloaders download is soooo slow",1
"its ninjas! who in the world wouldnt want to play a space ninja game? (if you do, we all cant trust you)",1
"pros free combat is fun, when it doesnt frustrate the heck out of you. when you give a bad review they give you things. cons free cost too much, im talking $5 for a color palate to customized your character with no other way to unlock! toturial is almost none existant. still very buggy as well and crashes often.",3
"this game is cool! its fun and graphics look amazing. this is so futuristic i wove this game",1
"definatly repeditive. nice grafics, interesting characters, but it just keeps repeating after a while. not bad, but not something id pay for.",1
"this game becomes much more better since update 14 because it is much more user friendly now. besides, it is the only game that i find that resemble the experience from gunz. and it is so fun to play with as well. definitely recommend it",1
"lots of action, slicing and dicing, people pinned to walls with harpoons. space ninjas??!!!! sounds fun? its your game!",3
"this game is like mass effect 3 multiplayer - only people still play it, and not just the level 3000 people who will totally just destroy you (<_<). despite the random, complete overhaul of the game, its fun as  and well.. you get to shoot aliens with random people who may or may not be total idiots, use magical powers and you even get a sword. (!) its free too, so you dont even have to wait for a steam sale! go play now and join the ranks of kittywizard ,.. because she needs friends ;_;",1
"this is a combination of chaos, aliens and ninjas! one of the best free tps ive ever played",4
"always improving the mechanics and ui. good game for f2p.",1
"i loved this game, i could play it for hours and hours! always new content, and something fun to do for everyone.",5
"if you do not own this game, what the actual hell are you doing.",5
"i wish your charactar was faster and more controlable but all in all a good game",1
"extreme variety of weapons and characters to play from. graphics are incredible and provides intense and satisfying gameplay.",10
"this game is awsome its not that difficult and doesnt bore you to death after playing like 1000 times like most games",2
"i... love ... this game!!!! what more can i say, its free, its fast paced and its ninjas in space.... the controls are fluid whether using a keyboard or controller, and the community is very competitive and helpful. the clans that are in this game really do battle it out for control its amazing. it does require some hefty graphics card mumbo jumbo but even so its still great",1
"its an amazingly addictive game once you get into it however it is in development and bugs are common.",1
"+ a great alternative for destiny! + warframe is worth your time! + with very fascinating worlds! + amazing crafting sistem! + nice character customization and making system! + funny! + rich! - pay to win. - controls.",1
"love this game. cant get anymore amazing than this!!! and the game is still going through updates.",1
"this is a great game, i fell in love with it on the ps4, but its really something you need to spend some time in and maybe a trip to the wiki or the forum to really see its potential. if youre cool with shooting a lot of basic enemies and occasionally some badass ones, youll be fine here. honestly, when youre traversing half the area in a spin attack and slicing through infected like a space ninja blender, youll appreciate this game.",1
"i am a sandwich this is a fun game play it or i will take over the world and eat all humans like you eat us",1
"every update makes the game bigger and better. development team actually listens to the community. slightly repetitive at times, but it is all for growing more powerful. probably the best free to play game currently out there. real money features are actually implimented well.",3
"got to level 3 and a guy called me a noob when he was over level 30 and wasted money to look like a pimp. 11//10",1
"this game is awesome but there is a flaw the items i buy at the steam community market are not showing up in the game i hope this will be fixed or not this game would have been a 10/10 but because of that it is a 9/10",2
"i loved this game its so fun my friends had fun i recommend this game hope you enjoy :}",1
"warframe is an awesome game, not too much on the story.. i dont really know why, the story is not in-depth. however, the gameplay is ing beautiful. you may choose out of a lot of these things called warframes, theyre like characters.. there is a lot of variety, and different builds out there.. final rating, 9.5/10.",1
"game is great has a good challenge i would recommend to dark soul players",1
"i realy like the game, but this update fcked me and many many ppl big time, cant even log in for more then 10 minutes.... that is when im able to log in wich is not many times atm",3
"ive been playing this game since closed beta. 10/10 on my spectrum.",7
"the game was more awesome before when the fusion cores werent that rare but i still like it for some rerason.",2
"very fun game, sadly i chose the wrong day to start playing as a glitchy patch made it hard to log in or even play so now im stuck in a loop whenever i log in, hope they fix this soon so i can play ;d",1
"because it is insanly addicting you have a lot to do and it is multiplayer and it kicks",5
"a free to play game with better graphics than most paid games and alien free running space ninja super suits. nuff said.",1
"ive been playing this game for a few months now, and i have to say that its a blast. definitely one of the best free to play games out there. the only minor complaints is that the parkour system can interfere more than it should, preventig you from entering vents and such, and they could make a few improvements to how the clans work out. also, it gives a pretty crappy tutorial. other than those, however, the gameplay is nearly flawless and very fluent. using parkour is an all out blast, and dicing apart baddies has never felt more satisfying. seriously, give this game a shot. its totally worth it.",1
"great shooter with interesting rpg abilities and with badass ninjas",1
"this game is probably one of my favorite free to plays on steam. there are certain things you can pay to get, or you can craft them yourself. amazing graphics and original concept.",1
"great game, still in open beta, and could use work, but best f2p shooter ive found on steam. mobility is awesome, graphics are nice, melee combat isnt a button for i win. its great.",1
"the best third-person game played, but somtimes it becomes boring (because of farming resources). every big update returns player back to game. its just beta. ninjas play free.",8
"pros... its a free game, amazing graphics, addictive gameplay, controller support, new content is added all the time, cons... since its a free game the micro transactions make the game a p2w(pay 2 win) since you can buy pretty much anything and if you dont decided to pay you have to grind and grind and grind to get the mats to build the items you want and after you killed all the bosses the game becomes a repetive grind for everything, the chat/invite system is to complicated but my main issue with this game is the lag problems it has, since the party host is the server host it depends on the connection they for you to have a playable experience other wise you have a 1-6 second delay on everything, you can shoot an enemy and see him die but the body will still be around cluttering the screen that means that you will have a massive amount of enemies just standing around blocking your attacks. i have a pretty decent connection(100mbps/100mbps) so i know its not my connection causing the issue and its seems that the only solution to this problem is to find people that have good connection and play with them, if the devs can fix this problem i can overlook all the other issues and actually enjoy the game.",2
"at first its really confusing, but once you get used to it, it is a really decent game. 7/10",1
"well ive put a couple hours into this game, got all the prime warframes now, and today marks the date of update 14. perhaps the biggest update warframe has had... do i like it? play it",4
"a very solid piece of work for an independent studio. works well with f2p model, not pay2win, though sometimes i felt like they were pushing me to pay a little too hard (or tempted me too much:-) ). if you enjoy action co-op games give it a try. the only minus in my opinion was its art style, but that is a matter of taste.",2
"it handles like mass effect 3s multiplayer and if you squint, you might think youre playing a game set in the me universe. for a beta, this is a beefy game. lots of characters to play as and weapons to kill with. there are over 100 missions to complete on various planets. im loving this game. havent had a bored moment yet! dont be scared away by the free to play tag. it is definitely not pay to win. everything in the game is accessible to free players with the only strictly purchasable items being cosmetic. warframe is the shining example of a f2p game made with the players in mind. now with pets!",2
"free to play is an awesome concept and warframe is entertaining enough that everyone should give it a shot. vastly confusing and has a rather steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, its really a lot of fun.",1
"i punched a guy, and he exploded... im quite sure its a good game...",1
"warframe is a very good game worth your time allowing countless hours of gameplay with yourself or with friends",1
"this new update is kinda of a drag though. there isnt even a log out or exit button anymore. i loved how it used to be.",2
"sliced my way through a horde of infested and swung my way through a hole in the wall that led me to my never ending decent through the bottom of the map. 10/10 would play again.",3
"fun game and lots of content but alot of which is only accessible by using real money or grinding a whole lot which can become very repititive",1
"for a f2p game, waframe has surely made a name for itself. this 3ps is very impressive in terms of its unique character set, diverse environmental setting and large weapon selection. this game is so beautiful on a pc with high and nvidia settings on- the attention to detail is mind-blowing, enhancing the gameplay tenfold. as the game has progressed over time, more and more functionalities have been introduced in order to create an easier to understand interface within the modding and mapping systems. join the tenno forces today, if you think youre ninja enough! p.s: update 14 just came out! and i must say, it just sets the game to an entirely new level of omgawesomesauceness!!! i already thought this was possibly the best f2p game out there, but now i can say that with no doubt what so ever. the interface is far more interactive, pulling you into an interactive prologue which explains a bit about the tenno and their history, and the intergalactic war between the grineer (and corpus). the game has become even more realistic on its sci-fi basis by providing players with their very own warships, to which they can build upon and travel through the voids of space in to distant and neighbouring planets. also...you get pets now...and ordis! :3 <3 <3 <3 honestly a damn good game! *such fangirl* *many wow* :p",3
"warframe, is a nice refreshing challenge from other team games. i love tps games and i like feeling like a ninja ... lol. yes, there are issues with the game at times, but what game is actually perfect? i enjoy the fact theres constant updates to the game. i shall be checking out the newest update and finally get my ash so i can be happy. keep it a coming !!",1
"i was only thirteen years old, i loved warframe so much. i had all the orokin cells and neural sensors . i prayed to kikbot every night before bed thanking him for the life i have been given. warframe is love i say, warframe is life. my dad hears me and calls me a . i knew he was just jealous of my devotion to warframe. i called him a . he slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. im crying now and my face hurts. i lay in bed, its really cold. a warmth is moving towards me... i feel something touch me... its loki! im so happy. he is my favorite warframe. he whispers in my ear this is my prime. he grabs me with his powerful tenno hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. im ready... i spread my  cheeks for loki. he penetrates my . it hurts so much, but i do it for loki. i can feel my butt tearing and my eyes start to water. i push against his force, i want to please loki. he roars a mighty roar as he fills my butt with love. my dad walks in. loki looks him straight in the eye and says, its all prime now. loki leaves through my window. warframe is love i say, .... warframe is life",2
"i love this game because well you can play this game for hours on end. this is a great built game (if that makes sence) but any way i love how you can play this friends and or anyone that has this great game. so many places to explore and the cutomisation is great to your character and guns/weapons!!!! 10/10",1
"played this game off and on. usually in between my other games, but loved it every time. sword, guns, bad @$$ fighting game. 11/10, updates keep it fresh as well.",1
"teennnnoooooo! pros: - you can be a cyborg ninja. cons: - sometimes you just get one-shot randomly. its cool though, you have 4 revives a day. oh, you got one-shot again? welp.",1
"i only played this game for a little while, before this last patch, and the gameplay was fun. the only problem was that it was kind of odd and clunky to navigate around. this new patch fixed that and the ux and ui are brilliantly redone. it really doesnt feel like a free-to-play game now. the gameplay is still really fun, its running, gunning, and grinding. id recommend this game for anyone who likes a fun game that has a lot of gameplay, unlockables, and grinding (although that is optional, but not p2w).",1
"this is awesome adventure game which is a bit like halo you have a choice of 3 characters with awesome powers",1
"you will definetly enjoy this game if you like cutting clones into bits and filling robots with lead. i have to say, it takes a while to get good items at a high tiers for the swarm",1
"warframe is fun in the way that makes you happy for an afternoon and question your life when you play 90 hours of what is essentially a slightly above average tps with 40 different rooms.",1
"pretty cool with really simple controls lots of gameplay and action its not a p2w game",1
"fast frantic fun. the fact that its free to play, makes it even more sweeter.",1
"overall, warframe is pretty cool. you get swords, guns, swords and guns, etc, and get to destroy tons of enemies with them. the damage system is really deep, with different types all affected by the different mods you apply to your weapons. one thing is that everything is very expensive, so you will have to grind a lot of resources, but re-playing levels endlessly isnt so bad when you do it with an awesome crew of friends.",1
"aww yiss moda blooping explotions and waste of time for very cool stuff like new frames and new weapons arm up with swords bows crossbows shurkians, kunais feel like an armed futurastic ninjas and stuff",1

"this game is great is has good graphics awesome powers and more........i would recommend this game to everyone. 9/10",1
"this is an apsalutely greate game! i couldnt imagin a single better one. fantastic graphics, great gamplay but sometimes lag spikes. awesome game 5/5",4
"two nincompoops made me play it but its an ok game though.",1
"i have played this game for a very long time, and it has come a long way. a year ago today the mercury tile set was the only tile set, and now they have antire planets! i love this game, and i will follow it untill the multiplayer servers are no longer officaly hosted and then some. keep up the good work digital extremes, and thanks for this amazing game. `big-head hancho",3
"good game 4/5 skulls, wood recomend to all famly and freinds. gg everyone this is crakin up to be a grate year in gameing history.",1
"if you like call of duty and battlefield 4 plus 3rd person view, then this is the game for you 8/10",2
"best game!!! well maybe not the best game but this game are really fun",1
"playing as a ninja is fun and adds a whole new style of gameplay but depending which country you are playing from.....the lag can be quite bad when you play with others. other than that, its generally very fun.",1
"this is actually a fun game, i can see where it gets grindy but thats just one downside. it has plenty of good sides, like the fact that youre a ninja... come on now, a ninja. i just wish it had a player vs player mode. now that would be beast.",1
"im going to say that yes, i would definitley reccomend this game. it is a very fun game that does require some skill. i lke the fact that you do have the option to stealth your way through missions, or go guns blazing and tank your way through. the starter quests i will say are quite helpful and really hlep you get accustomed to the game. i love the hacking implemented into it, and how you can stop enemies from triggering alarms and such. i do not, however, recommend doing this game completley solo. although it is a lot of fun, the missions that are on par with your level can prove to be quite difficult, especially if youre a noob. overall, i very much so enjoyed this game. it can be a bit stressful when clearing out enemies and hakcing computer consoles, but that makes it that much more enjoyable. i like ai, how they will hide behind walls and such when they become aware of your pressence, and i find it quire humours how you can stealth kill an enemy right in front of the others and they just stand there and completly disregaurd the fact that their friend is laying on the ground with an arrow stuck in his back. overall id give this game an 8/10.",1
"highly recommend this game. best to play with friends to get the most out of the competitive side of the game",2
"such good game. can cut people in half and vaporise their body into thin air. 10/10 good if you have friends with you on skype playing.",1
"this was a very fun platform shooter with epic bosses and cool metroid-halo futuristic level design. i would recommend this to anyone with a fast graphic processor (i like the game enough for the lag to be ignorable).",1
"3rd person action shooter what more could you want?? everything about this game is well polished and mostly complete, apart from the platimiummmmm prices",1
"everything is good accept that it is free to play and you can only really do the same thing and thats just to get new items but its still a great game",1
"this game is awesome,,, really good game,,, jumping, shooting,, and cooooolllll man,,,",6
"one of my fav games on steam probaly better than tf2, very adictive, very fun. but please bring the old map screen back the new one is confusing, the idea of a ship is done well another problem is that my resources keep disapearing before the update o had 7 morphics and 100k now i only have 3 morphics an 4k",1
"its amazing but theres a glitch that stops you of getting the mercury nav segment",1
"awrsome game with some many things to do with epic powers",2
"warframe is one of those games that grabs your attention right off the go. grapically its realistic game play challenges even the most attentative to detail and the game play is just unreal. fans of sci-fi orientated play will rejoice in the combination of challenges that come with each level. i was hooked right from the opening sequence and look forward to more.",1
"very grindy when you are starting off, but once you manage to get going, this game becomes tons of fun",7
"nice . you get to play with your tight biosuit and alien ninjas friends in coop fashion against some ugly controlled bots. thing is.. if you want to get a better suit, more tight (sexy) to your body than the current one you have to spend some  in it. this is a game for people that likes ballet.",1
"i like it but its hard to build wapons and warframe and there alot of stuff i need to buy it by platinum but i had a blast with it and i still playing it",2
"awesome!!!!! this game is a direct masterpiece, everything about it is awesome! i like the sci-fi feeling and everything. cool game!!!",1
"it has its limitations, but for a free-to-play shooter, its actually pretty fun. the story is pretty interesting too. my biggest peeve is that it gets very repeptitive after a while. otherwise, i rather like it.",1
"warframe is a fun third-person shooter in space. like a multilayer version of dead space in a way.",1
"one of the best free to play games ive ever seen. fast and fun gameplay, along with superb graphics and great multiplayer make it worth the half hour 1.7 gb download, which is tiny compared to other games.",1
"warframe i just have one statement badass ninja kicking, jaw dropping and f2p defying game tis not for the weak",4
"this game never fails in adding new stuff and updating also the devs listen to what the community says, which makes it great on every updates",5
"want to be a ninja? what about a ninja in space?! warframe is a fun multiplayer co-op shooter and meele combat game with many different combat styles and lots of customisation. while some of the missions can be a bit of a grind, there is enough variety and progression to keep things interesting.",1
"in essence, this is what i would have wanted from any multiplayer function to come out of mass effect. the feel of the game is in fact similar to the series, but differs in the heavy incorporation of platforming andstylistic choices. it is obvious that the game, at this time, has some holes, particularly in platforming controls, but it is fun and visceral. im always a fan of co-op games, with rpg elements in particular, and warframe, despite some short-comings, satifies that itch. beware though, as with many games in this monetary mold there is a strong pay-to-win feel. nearly all items of statistic consequence can be unlocked through play, but the number of hours required to do so, in untenable to anyone unwilling or unable to put in the commitment. also be aware that the game is built around co-op. if your connection or computer is not up to the task you may find yourself aggravating fellow players unintentionally.",1
"ninjas get to play free. probably one of the best sci-fi tps mmo rpg massive multiplayer games out there. 9/10",1
"there are a few bugs like any other game, but the vision, hard work, and communication of the developers is the best i have ever seen. they release amazing content and keep me very much entertained with all elements big and small.",4
"youll forget u ever were alive once you play this !!!",2
"oh man, awesome game, even more avesome when you make a teamwork! really nice f2p tps game, all it needs more story... but really nice. but also=needs fixes... seriously. man, i go from a really known and nice path, or tunnel, i fall down to nowhere! and there are major glitches, i added a video about it. but still enjoyable.",1
"its a game of space ninjas with a good free-to-play model; i never hit a wall in which i had to be paying money in order to be competitive. ive put many dozens of hours into it, and im still having a blast. perhaps my only criticism of the game is i wish there were sometimes moments when you and your team should play slowly and methodically. every single team match ive gone have been a non-stop sprint of slaughter. perhaps a deliberate nature is more common on more difficult levels, but it certainly isnt for any old pick-up group.",2
"please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others. please remember to be polite and follow the rules and guidelines. obama ??",1
"well yeah its fun just does not hold my attendion very long :p uninstalled it a few times but keep coming back idk it just seems to need more thrill i guess to keep me there its very exiting its just something about it that is fun but only for short periods",1
"this game may be great, i wouldnt know because i uninstalled after the updates were installed and i saaw i had to have an online log-in just to check it out. i installed it because it said there was single player capability, and i have no desire for multiplayer at this time. it wasnt until i had already installed it that i learned that is is an open beta (not a big deal) and that i had to create an on line account and log in just to open the program (not what i was looking for). that probably doesnt matter to anyone else but me, so unless you just really dont want yet another on line account to deal with, go fo it.",1
"i dont like the fact that in the update 14,(well in my experience of the update so far) kubrows die and i had wasted 80 platinum (currency). it feels very unsatisfying to know that i wasted money on this game. i want a refund",3
"very fun, kind of unsettling/spooky single player; much better with friends. some lag issues currently, but i expect them to be fixed soon (rubberbanding, enemies dying before i get there etc.). be a robot space ninja. raiden. metal geeeeeear. aaaarrrrggghhhhhhhhh.",3
"do you like ninjas? do you like super teched out laser guns? do you like taking giant swords and slicing freaky aliens in half? if you answered yes to any of these questions, you have a good chance at liking warframe. the best part is its free!!!! :d and unlike some ftp games where you have to buy the only good gear in the game (ehumneverwinter) you can craft anyting you can buy with real money. and, like most games, you can trade items. this and a lot more is why warframe is fun. yes it can be a little repetitive at times, but its a coop game what do you expect? this is why you should download it, and if you dont like it dont play it because its free. edit: they ruined warframe with the new mirage update. d:",2
"wonderful game! i love it! one of the best si-fi fps that i ever played, and the whole game set-up was very well planned out.",6
"this is a must try for sure. i love it. it is player vs. ai tactical gameplay that rocks!!!!",1
"a remarkable game truly unique in every element i had some good fun playing this with friends some who have spent 600+ hours on this game. i almost shocked this is a free to play game. the graphic are amazing as is the gameplay for a free to play you can not lose on this one it offer awesome co-op game play!",1
"its a good game but im so  tired of deleting it every ing update since it always get ed up during the update process and then i have to reinstall, nonetheless its still a good game and worth the time reinstalling -_-",4
"if you like simple games and fully free to play aswell as have a good amount of time on your hands i would suggest no other",6
"i dislike that when you choose a type of character you can not reset to choose a different one",1
"fu**ing space ninja with magic, hell yeah ist worth your time",4
"great game, amazing graphics, this is a great f2p.",3
"i played this game and it worked 53% of the time. 9/10 would recommend",1
"yes epic gun time nija style platformer with amazing characters weapons maps and swords there is no pay to win effect on this game u should try it 10/10",1
"the storyline is huge , but i guess the levels need to be easier somewhat for newbies like me.",1
"i have to admit that i am addicted to this game and that i am hardly proficient in the playing of this game. i am trying to learn as i go along as it is impossible to find any step by step on how to play this game. one thing i tried to do do is keep up with the expert players that run really fast and then i realised that they are missing out on what is one of the best things in this game, the scenery, i mean just look around you and take in all the work that makes up the mission, walls, ramps, tunnels, machinery not mention the bad guys. ok, so i dont get there as fast as you guys but i do get to end and have really enjoyed the trip. hopeing to rise in rank. my graitude to the guys that make this wraith of hell",8
"easily one of the best free to play games to ever exist. de have done a wonderful job with warframe. defnintly worth the download.",4
"space guns, aliens, and personal space ships. what more do you want?",3
"become the super badass killing machine you have always dreamed of. kill enemy with style and grind, build and gather all the bling frames and weapons you can find because nothing makes more proud of yourself. and did i mention your own bloodhound which you grow from puppyhood to a loyal companion?",4
"i do recommend this game , but its a huge farming fest and getting another warframe or weapon requires tons of time of constatntly playing which was the reason why i stopped playing the game from time to time. buying the items using real money isnt the cheapest option too. other than these complains its a really nice game with an excellent art style and fancy moves that you can combo effortlessly!",1
"the game is better after the update and it become more simular to bungies destiny but the graphics are too high for my pc. i would realy like to chose the graphics quality myself so i can run warframe smoothly.",1
"hell of a fun in co-op mode or even single player..public doesnt really work that well because most of the random players got a bad connection. you start from a space ship hub where you can unlock different planets to travel, new warframes, weapons or companions. on the planets you fight simple enemies in similar levels but hey, you can walljump and... chop enemies in two pieces while sliding 10/10!!!!! :d",1
"this is a great game but since most of it is pay to play and it costs alot to get waframes and gear its nt the most in tune game for an online game also the new change to the game has left all of us warframe gamers lost to what we do now most cant mpve or do anything and other are pissed thatthere is yet more pay to play things in the world of warframe but dont take me wrong it is or rather was a great game but this change has mostly left it far less fun and wantably by todays players if warframe took up the more modern way of pay to play like being able to sub to them for monthly payments far more players would be here and i think i would love it far more since it would be alot easyer to use gear and warframes if you got them all for a monthly payment in the ned it used to suck a bit now its just worthless to play if you dont care about either 1 losing a boatload of cash or 2 looking like a moneyless penny pincher then it will be fun other wise play another mmo as most are bettter than this",3
"this game is incredible. and even better because it is still open beta (loads of things to be added). im caps lock crazy btw",2
"if you love grinding or putting copious amounts of money into the game to avoid said grinding, this is the game for you. otherwise, the combat is entertaining and fast paced, and the various suits you use are distinct and enable you to play the game the way you see fit.",4
"this is a game about space ninjas, a game cant get much better than this.",5
"amazing devs, so many updates, so active with community. they are reason enough to play this game.",1
"one of the coolest and best f2ps out there. definitley worth the try.",1
"yes, yes, and more yes. the words no and bad dont exist when associated with this game.",1
"this game is really great. the only thing that could be upsetting is that at times you may want more power with your weapons and you just will not get it unless you mod your weapons or find all the parts for your blue prints. it can be very challenging. i feel almost like i cannot avoid taking damage, but you can definitely deal damage. all in all, i do enjoy this game and it is holding my interest. also, it is a plus that you can pve in it unlike some other free-to-play action games.",1
"if you think ninjas are about swords and throwing stars, think again! we got flamethrowers, miniguns, shrapnel cannons, grenade launchers, and some dude named rhino...oh, and if ninjas are stealthy, warframes are freaking rambo on drugs.",4
"unique mmorpg coupled with fps plus free style hack and slash, and on top of that, you get to customize your equipments, skills and progression of your characters just as you would in a mmorpg. great!",1
"great graphics and game play. good fun for groups and solo. so many options to play.",9
"a lot of fun, yet also quite complicated. the only reason i would say i would facepalm is because of the rank up system",1
"after the update 14 the game has a few bugs, but im sure theyll fix it in 2.0. they need to fix it where uninstalling mods during fusion wont freeze the game. fixing the kubrow quest because even if you get an egg it doesnt allow you to hatch it, and you cant get another egg since you already have one. also the combat system for the kubrows since they suck, so they need to fix that too. other than that this game is quite nice, it is a fun game, and i think ill give it 8/10 maybe giving armor to the kubrows, and fixing those bugs and the combat system for the pets.",1
"quite possibly the best free to play game ive ever played. stunning visuals, smooth gameplay, excellent combat system and gear selection. i highly reccomend this.",1
"ive been playing this game a lot over the past 4 months, so far im really impressed. great graphics. smooth gameplay. action packed levels, easy learning curve, tons of weapons. new content gets added on a regular basis and patching is quick and problem free. dozens of game modes. in-game clans even get a sci-fi customizable/expandable base. craft new weapons and armor out of materials and blueprints found while blasting and slashing your way through intense hoards of aliens, infected, space marines, or other awesome things. not just any weapons and armor, but awesome sci-fi-ninja- medieval-laser-explosion-missle bow and arrow-jet hammer-living plasma rifle-gravity and time-space bending weapons and armor. etc. there is no end to the new weapons and stuff i can make and, suprise!, every time its something cool and ridiculous. thumbs up.",2
"warframe was one of the very first games i got on steam. frankly, i dont have any regrets. its perfect for people looking for a game with awesome gameplay and weapons. it also has some nice art and mechanics. only downside is, if ur a person without a lot of time, then this isnt the game for u. u would have to spend so much time getting the weapons and mods, but for me, thats really fun",3
"generic ballistics, poor story, its free, though, and unlike most games its not pay2win at all, because of course paying will get you things faster, as with most f2p games anyway. im just not a fan of grinding, but for a free game, its pretty cool.",1
"update 14 intruduces many new things that appear to be for the better, but sadly youll likely have loads of bugs, such as freezing out of your game and having to reboot the entire thing, connection issues to parties, having to possibly solo quest missions that will likely be too hard, boss scaling so once what was easy is now a super pain in the  when you just want to get something done. dont bother getting the game until they can actually fix it. before i get replies saying that its me, i can assure you that it isnt, ive done everything to troubleshoot any problems, i have a good pc, and run on low graphics settings, and have 20upload and 40download, all ports are properly forwarded, and ive tried with/without them forwarded, same results, ive had other people have the same problems as me. if in the event your game is working properly, youre lucky, but ive had it with the game, and will no longer be continuing to play it.",2
"one of the most fun games ive played in a long time. it gives the feel of an over the shoulder shooter while still sustaining that feel of an rpg. with the multiple choices of weapons, frames, and toys in the game one is sure to not become bored very easily. their is alittle grinding to the game to get some items but in the long run it doesnt take all that long really.",1
"you are a cybernetic ninja fighting against an empire with a lust for war; a high-tech race of advanced cyborgs, robots, and powerful corporate conglomerates; and a scourge that threatens to wipe out and corrupt all life. also, you are an alien. those warmongers i mentioned? those guys are from earth. those robot dudes? experts at technological warfare and cybernetic manipulation. the scourge? its a  zerg infestation (fyi its actually called the infestation) the best part is that your ninja isnt so crass as to be just a cybernetic alien ninja, you can have a psychic cybernetic alien ninja, a cybernetic alien ninja pyromancer, you can have a complete-screwball-who-murderapes-everything-in-his-path cybernetic alien ninja, i think you get the point. if you enjoy free running, combined with well-designed maps and environments, combined with awesome enemies and bosses, combined with powerful and badass guns, combined with uberbadass melee weapons, combined with super cybernetic alien ninja powers, then this game is for you and anyone who enjoys good games.",3
"this game is great in quality, doesnt lag at all, has so many missions the game gets more and more fun. i dont think ill ever get done with all the missions(: get game if you like shooting guns and cutting bodies in half!",1
"the best free to play game out there! this game is amazing, the graphics, the effects, the variety of things available and everything in this game is just amazing. of course since this is a free to play game do not expect the story of a legitmately written game with huge producers and a dedicated studio with proper funding, but nontheless, this game will be the best ftp you have ever played. the game does not look like any other free to play, and you will be happy for sure. the best part is that this game is not pay to win, everything is craftable. the developer does not nickel and dime you, the only thing they want is money for customization and for slots, which is not that bad. platinum is pretty cheap too since you can get a login reward for 70 percent off the platinum in the first place. the game is extrmemely fun to play and really represents all our childhood dreams, running around as a space ninja, with super powers and butt kicking machine guns and a kick  sword to slice and dice everything that gets in our way. i guarantee you will love this game.",1
"this game is fun for fans of lots of action, explosions, aliens, and most of all, combo moves! i recommend for players of moderate to advanced skills!",1
"good game, but i wish there was a pvp gamemode. after a while all the grinding gets old, but its fun to play every now and then",2
"this is an amazing action and sci-fi game i would recommend this to you bros, its an amazing atmosphere of alien-like technology. i woyld recommend this for you bros. brofist",1
"its so good but tther is a problem with geting sum metrils",1
"i love this game its amazing and it has space ninjas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it cant get any better",1
"good stuff , but the platinum is overpriced and the chance to win cheaper platinum is xtremely low unless you just started , the plat is overpriced :(",2
"this is a fun game with great graphics, badass character design, good weapon vairety, addictive gameplay, good sounds/music, fun to play with your friends. in conclusion: on a 1 to 10 scale, i give this awsome game a 9 out of 10. (p.s.:if you havent played this game yet, then you have to give a chance to this game.)",2
"why the hell are you reading the reviews? you can be a bloody space ninja> get to downloading prospective tenno!",4
"very good gets boring after a while so get it but i have not got very far so its very boring.",1
"its alright but the recent updates have made it more and more less interesting and its heavily p2w probably because people are losing their interest on it",7
"warframe is a great hack-slash/shooter game with magic, and sci-fi elements, for a f2p game, it has amazing graphics, and its overall amazing, i really dont like game with in game purchases, its overall really fun, and great to play with freinds. 7/10",1
"extremely good quality, extremely good game, micro-transactions no one likes them but it is what pays for the game. overall good content, playability and replayability. a hole lot of hours of fun stored inside and constant updates and new content, if i had more money to spend i would spend some here, no doubt! have fun.",1
"i do really like this game first i thought you could only get weapons and new things if you payed but when i came further and further in the game i saw blueprints which you could make the stuff with other items you get from killing bosses / survivaling and i already came pretty far in the game and its really fun tho",1
"it got boring fast. although it was fun while it lasted.",1
"cool game but kinda tough to get into without help.",1
"for one reason the greatest ninja thirdperson ever.",1
"warframe is one of the most interesting f2p games out there. almost everything in the game can be gotten by simply playing the game. and the few things you have to pay for are cheep as homebrand chips. with each warframe being its own class, the differnt ways to play are amazing. there are a few things that they still need to work on (stealth) but what that have done, they have done well. this is a game you want to play atleast once, just so you know what its all about. and with the lore comeing from des previece game, darksector, there is a lot to like.",5
"one of the best games i have ever played. must get!!",1
"seriously, dont read this, just get the game, its completely worth it.",6
"very fun and consuming game. im surprised it is free, let alone in beta. i highly suggest if you like customization, fps, futuristic settings, or co-op.",1
"this game is a fantastic over-the-shoulder shooter with high customization on your character, weapons, and provides diversity between yourself and your team of 4. it is easy to start but retains some challenge later on for experienced player. the best part is its ever evolving gameplay. though it is still in beta, the creators are always looking for new and exciting ways to expand the gaming experience and make it far more enjoyable to play.",5
"one of the best f2p games ever. its not p2w either, because its not pvp.",1
"this game is a lot of fun. i worry about it being a long term game though due to the nature of doing the same exact thing over and over forever.",2
"this game is fun to play with friends, i would give it a 9/10. many bugs but the developers try their hardest. very interactive staff and developers that will reply to your post and comments on the forums.",4
"i enjoyeds piral knights greatly when i first started into pc gaming. and when i see warframe it just flat out loks like sk for big boys to the people complaing about grinding thats kind of how mmos work if you dont want to spend time playing a game to level your gear and character then they have the cash shop but trust me on this when you spend a couple days working twards the item you want to complete a specific loadout but its so much more rewarding to put the time and effort in yourself to actually earn it and the whole using premium currency in the auction house is something sk did to help make it more accesible to players who didnt want to spend money on the gameso all i ask of you is instead of reading post after post trying to decide if you should try the game remember one thing its free to play so just download it try it out if you dont like it uninstall if you do mayb i will see you around",1
"left 4 dead + mass effect + prince of persia... thats what you get in this gloriously over-the-top game!",2
"this is a great game. it is very fun to play and the devs are just going at the updates! more content is being put in constantly with new updates every 2 months or so! i recommend this game to anyone looking for an inbetween game if they are just waiting to buy new ones. its still in beta, indefinitly (unfortunantly), so watch the bugs (most of which is on the newer content, nothing serious normally, although i have had my fair share of game crashing bugs.) but for the most part its a fun 3rd person action game with alot of backstory! hope you guys enjoy it as much as i did!",6
"this game suprised the crap out of me its combat is fluent and indepth all in all its the best 3rd person anything ive played on pc yet!!!!! and its free which is totally bonanazzzzzz",1
"without out a doubt, i love this game, 10+ hours, but as all f2p games the p2p option is always better, but it is not terribly hard to get ito the game once you have familiarised yourself with the game and the basic know-how about, it becomes prgressivly easier. now ganted i sometimes do see myself a little vacent for ideas on what to do but farming & quests are always a good way to take your mind off of the grind involved in advancing through the game if you do get the game and want a freind to play with, im down to play just add me and drop me a messege telling me which one you are, ign: ronsha. but general rating i would give 7/10 - fun but i would like to have more content to play with (new prime warframes and missions/pass-time events) other than that i enjoy it greatly",2
"kawaiiiii its a game about space ninjas with guns !!!!",1
"this game is really fun with new contents that is constantly updating to keep you in the zone. and the best thing is... its free!!!! it takes time to master your warframes and weapons but thats the challenge in warframe.",5
"basically a farming simulator, but, fast paced and with quests,lore,crafting,pets,future pvp and all that in beta. good time burner and makes you feel that you achieved something everytime you play it, even if you just leveled one of you weapons.",1
"played this game since the date it has come out,it is very fun on the start,u are like some space ninja assasin,killing bad guys and stuff,pritty fun. after some time in my opinion it gets a little bit boring cause missions all look the same,just different enemy.the game itself is a little pay2win concept but only if u want to look good and cool,and if u want to have some badass wepons,but if u ignore that,this game is pritty fun to kill some time. :)",1
"best free tp play game ive played this year. feels like mass effect meets halo.",1
"great game to play with friends. if you liked mass effect 3 multiplayer, youll like this. waves of enemies, cooperative for the most part done in many different mission types.",4
"now i dont have a big playtime on pc but you have not seen my play time on ps4...",1
"its an good action game, i have alot of fun when i play this game!",1
"one of the most amazing games ive played, but still a lot of buggs.",1
"best free game i played. it has realy good graphics and the best part is you get a sword and a gun.....i damn near unstopable now.",1
"very fun game. being able to choose between singleplayer, or coop with your friends makes it a very enjoyable game. recommend this one to anybody that likes shooters, mmo style games, or games you can freely choose between single and multiplayer.",1
"its a good game with intense graphics and an insane story",1
"if you like ninjas/aliens, this is a game for you. youre a complete badass with a sword, primary and secondary weapon. most items are able to be collected in game, instead of having to buy everything (free to play cliche). if you want to build items instead of buying them, it takes time to gather the materials and the building itself takes a ton of time, but is worth it in the end. super fun, especially when with a group of friends. at first it can get repetitive, but the more you play and earn better items and new planets, it becomes more fun that it was when you started. overall, great game!",1
"the current game is quite enjoyable. despite still being in a beta stage there is quite a lot of content, the combat system is dynamic and allows a lot of different playstyles. but since it is a beta it there are alos some bugs (which happen every now and then but generally dont cause too much problems (though youll probably have to manually abort a few missions or alt+f4 the game). a few bugs ive encountered: game hanging on trying to find a squad, some hosting problems (especially if the host disconects), getting the wrong map, enemies not spawning correctly (like they dont spawn for a while - though this is great if you get this in interception missions <- atype of point capture mission). clan battles (battles between clans that allow non clan members to fight for either side) are in my experience pretty laggy at times. ive several times experienced massive desyncs where i had to actually guess where the enemy that i just saw will be for my attacks to hit and see what i did seconds after it or even be completely unable to change or use my weapons. this is not a common problem but since the game is still in beta stage dont be surprised if it happens to you too. i really am looking forward to see how this game will evolve especially to see if lotus (your ingame advisor/boss figure) will start giving actually useful inmission advice (instead of the usual ambigous you are surrounded by enemy or a lot of enemies ahead, prepare for a fight).",1
"this game is alot like halo but free, awsome game.",1
"am i the only one finding it hard to download this game?? pls reply *the downloaders download is soooo slow",1
"this game is awesome. sometimes it can bore you with is monotony but if you find a good group of friends to play with, you will not probably get bored",5
"amazing game in all honesty. stunning graphics and fast paced action to the max, awsome designs and very good controls. community is very active and friendly. all of the shop items are available ingame so its fair to everyone.",2
"update 14 has some major bugs with mission in game things like my screen going black bassically crashing but this is all i have to really say about it its a really good game overall",2
"dont even think about it just get it... its 100% free and in my opinion its the best game i have and i have alot of great games. there is no doubt that you will like it and i gurantee that its very addicting i got addicted in like the first 10 minuites i played it and then i couldnt stop... so just get it and i gurantee that you will like it :d",2
"this game is amazing once you really get into it. the start can be a bit disorienting, but it has been made easier lately with update 14. make no mistake, though, this game is a collectathon and farming marathon - you will run the same missions again and again to unlock and level all of the gear you want. the more gear you get, the more further gear you unlock, and high-end gear unleashed upon enemies is incredible.",4
"fun game! great graphics, but very very buggy... lacking a good story line.",1
"my re-review for this game. the early game is still difficult. but that really depends on playstyle. the first few guns are rather crap, and you cant farm very well on solo, especially early on. the remedy to this is public play or friend play. either grab a friend or two and team up to progress to saturn to farm for things for new warframes or weapons, or do the same with public matchmaking. once you start off, the game gets more fun and a little less challenging. i finally finished a new melee weapon, primary, and rhino warframe, and was much better off than i was with my excalibur. if you intend to play this game for a while, dont waste any time finding a new frame or primary weapon. youre going to need them.",2
"this game is fun if you want to spend time on it. it is free so you dont have to spend money but everything is very time consuming and kinda grindy. if you dont want to spend money and have some time on your hands then it is pretty fun.",1
"verry good f2p game but 1 problem . did you craft item you must wait time for warframe you must wait like 4 days to all craft is not verry big problem but okey i still like game .",1
"great game! has mutiple ways to fight great crafting system. no need to spend real money to continue within the game. combat is amazing. the aspect of the dojo for clans is amazing be able to make a base for your members to craft there items and also requires crafting. such a good game. check it out.",4
"fun and insanely intense at times dont do a mission alone you are a dead man because of that people help each other and thats what you should look for in a game beacuse this game is fun",1
"machine gun down enemies to get some uninteresting upgrades like +10% damage. wall running seemed a cool idea but ninja moves are worthless in practice. game glitches and freezes quite often, forcing you to alt + f4 during a mission.",1
"i thoroughly enjoyed playing warframe *before* update 14, and although the content added was beautiful it broke the operating system to where i could not trade reliably, or even go on missions and hope to stay logged in long enough to get my rewards. i can not reccomend it as it stands currently. hopefully future patches will resolve these issues but i will not buy anymore plat for a game i cannot stay online to play.",9
"since the mad cephalon update, a lot of things have really changed, and the game is getting a whole lot more immersive and user friendly. i played this game in its early stages, and compared to back then, i would say that this is a perfect time for new players to join. there is just the right amount of stuff to learn so that it will feel immersive, but not so much that a new player will get overwhelmed. i only see a good future out of this game, so come join! (my clan is recruiting, and we are geared towards getting more new players. shoot me a message in the forums!)",9
"current version: sometimes the screen turns black and the navigation is really annyoing...points into wrong direction or guides you directly into a horde of wolves (nearely unkillable at lvl 4). was better before the updates!",1
"u are a space ninja with badass weapons. what else do you want in life?",1
"greate free game, dont have special system request.",2
"i love this game and i most love that its not a shooter if you dont want it to be. all the crafting and editing of the dojo is so fun to do. the game and all of its aspects connect perfectly together like a puzzle. except the new tutorial doesnt make it as confusing like a puzzle but you get my point. i hope.",2
"short form of my review ( im too lazy to write a long version) : the gameplay is fun ( fun factor is at his best with friends ), the graphics are good ( isnt really needed as a + point because in my opinion graphics dont matter that much), its definitly worth a try. so grab some friends an hop in!",1
"if your looking for a fun game with ninjas in space and mostly killing space romen empire men and some robots, this game is for you!!! (ignore) sadly there is alot of farming for materials that you build weapons with but, there is no  p2w in warframe and the game contantly updates with weapons, fixes, warframes and more!!! so come to warframe quickly, we need you tenno.",9
"this game is a great one. the only things that descibe its absolute awesomeness is space ninjas and you must download now!",1
"awesome game once you realize its more of a tps dungeon crawler heavliy influenced by mass effect. you have your navigation console to pick which planet and stage, its not like an open world. that being said, this is one of the best f2p games ever made. everything in the game is faily easy to obtain without money(aside from a few cosmedics) and everything is based on a rgn drop rate and can be sold/traded for in game money or in game currency. its a flawless design, youll never feel a need to pay and you wont feel scammed if you do pay. it has extremely fast paced, high framrate action. definitly one of the best games ive ever played.",2
"this has fun and very active 3rd person gameplay, i would highly recommend this game",4
"looking from a basic point of view...this is an amazing game, but in all truths do we really want to pay for revives? do we? cause thats pretty stupid. this game however does have some amazing features that you may be able to get over the fact that you have to pay to revive when you run out of revives. such as being able to cut enemies to pieces with a katana like sword and using your ninja skills to assassinate and kill enemies quickly and crisply! the controls take some getting used to but this is overall an amazing game and i recommend it only because of these features and a few more awesome features. do not get game if you cant afford platinum! which is used for revives and buying new warframes.",1
"about time ninjas got a turn. pirates have been playing free for years. ;}",4
"this game is very fun! i played it on a friends ps4 and found it on steam.",2
"i used tentecle porn to wipe out groups of enimies, ign 10/10",2
"just gave this game a shot to pass the time, first impression.. awesome. ive heard mixed things about it and have yet to really delve into it, but i got very involved for awhile. i could see myself playing casually from time to time.",1
"solid f2p shooter. just get over the first 3ish days then you will be lovin it also the buisness model is fair and you dont ever have to pay for content. i havent spent a penny on it. hope you enjoy it as much as i did. 8/10",1
"the bugs in this game, every time they fix the game we get like 1000 new bugs and 1 thing fixed! :d",3
"ninjas in space? and i though it was an odd combination untill i played it, they also recently updated with the new kubrows and a ship for your warframe, i think its really cool, and you should play this someday, and this is played by a certain youtuber (which is me)",4
"very fun game if you have friends to play with, but the random people you encounter can be unpredictable. also trading is very difficult and the way the item system is set up you either have to constantly farm items non-stop so you can build your upgrades, or you have to spend your entire allowance/paycheck to buy what you need.",7
"warfrane is a pretty fun game. each mission can last a while, granting you several hours of a gameplay. it is best played with multiple people.",1
"awesome game! :) i enjoy it. did not like it at first but once i got playing it, i got into it. if you need someone to play with just let me know",2
"this game is great i like the gameplay but i think games that are free to play try to make you buy things or it makes it harder for you too play untill you buy stuff that will help that is anoying but other then that its a good game",1
"pretty good game, lots of options for various play styles, slow to start, but once you get the ball rolling, you learn it all quickly.",4
"great game but i would recommend you get platnium for completing planets but you get about 50 platnium so you can buy it also but if you complete a planet you also get",1
"this game is the next generation of the third-person shooters",1
"shoot things, get points, craft stuff, conquer the universe.",1
"i am a space ninja assassin armed with claws only ripping through the enemies like tissue paper. 10 out of 10",5
"can laser fabricate high tech alien weaponry from dirt, but cant auto feed a space pooch kibble 10/10",5
"play this game... if you dont like fight style, fine, but there are bows, guns, swords, battle axes, of which you may need to craft, you do not have to spend a dime on this game, you can, but it isnt required, this game is visually amazing... and with that said, it runs better than anything ive ever played. did i mention it is free?",1
"a couple hours into this game and i already feel the nostalgia of hours of hours of sitting in the same room, staring at a screen with a mic pressed up to my face. god bless warframe. 10/10",1
"this is an amazing game. regardless of the continuous grind, there is an incredible amount of content, and the quality exceeds that of many paid games. great job, the devs really did succeed.",1
"great game, graphics and gameplay. - tho it is a farm fest it still hast to be one of my top 10 for 2013-14",3
"this game blows f2ps out of the water with how much fun it can be. feel like playing a solo stealth game? check. feel like blowing up thousands of aliens trying to kill you with friends? check. feel like doing those things with tons of weapons and [easily] over a hundred missions? like a walk in the park for this game. the only downside that i see to this game is the lack of propper introduction and the pros and cons of each weapon, however this is easily dealt with early on in the game. not to mention this game is beautiful and runs like a dream on my rig. almost all items in the game can be obtained without paying real world currency. oh, by the way did i mention that you are an alien ninja? no? well you are. i cant wait to delve in further.",2
"i fully recommend this game to anyone who loves stealth/hack and slash/ shooting fps. it depends on your game style.. and it has updates and everything keeps getting better. ive been a supporter for this game this is one of the best free to play game yet...",5
"one of the best f2p games ive ever played -- and ive played quite a lot of games. short, quick, in your face action thats addicting as all hell. dat loot grind, always one more match to get peice to build that upgrade to get better peices for more upgrades and unnnnnhhhhhhhhhhhhh. ninja gaiden meets halo meets dynasty warriors meets etc. etc. etc. good stuff.",1
"action packed mind blowing game. if you liked dark sector this is the game for you because it is basicaly like a multiplayer sequel. double thumbs up",4
"i dont recommend this game, when you play for some time the maps are all the same, just copy/pasted one after the other. it gets pretty boring. another reason for this is that it takes for ever to get stuff. just dont waste your time playing it.",1
"it is one of the best f2p action game. you can gather everything by playing the game but the only minus thing for the game is the routine and the story side. co-op play and the style is well though and if you are a group you can even plan strategies for your gameplay. ...",4
"grind - a word used in any mmo representing the repetitive actions taken in order to make the character stronger. the grind is also a substitute for normal life functions. sleeping, eating, drinking and being social are not important, when it comes to grinding.",7
"really fun, fun to farm, but once you are done farming, got all weapons you want, it starts to get boring really fast.",1
"pros: incredibly fun. graphics are amazing. wide variety weapons and battle suits that you can choose from. interesting and well made parkour system that replaces classic stealth game dynamics. still in open beta so lots of potential despite it already being a top notch game. free to play. you can pay some money to speed up certain processes but this game is all about the grind. cons: lacks some endgame content. but by them continuously changing the game on a weekly basis i would definitely expect that to change. thats it in my opinion. just be open minded about it and realise that it is in open beta. meaning they will be fixing minor bugs every now and then.",6
"amazing game, very very good game!!!!! if you like star wars, guns & swords, aliens and alot of action, this game is perfect to you!!!!!!! i highly recommend this game to anyone like the thing upp here!!!!! and the best of it, its free@@ <3333 but you have to pay if your gonna buy things to the game (in-game) and so long... get it!, ure gonna lov it!",1
"this game is a grindfest, and they have a entire seperate tab for the story. so that means this is a combat focusd game it feels like dating: at first its all nice and pleasent sitting around and blowing people off, but after a while you just plainly get bored and you have to go on like fifty rollercosters in order to actually move to a haunted house. poorly made metaphore aside its fun at the start but you have to do it over and over in order to get the last piece for a slightly better version of the weapon you are using. if you dont play it to often i reccomend it, if you plan on playing it for more then 5 instances then dont play it.",3
"this shooter is amazing. i myself normally do not like tps (third person shooters) but this one is amazing as you fight endless amounts of creatures and follow a story line with co-op. the gameplay is everything because there story line really is just to do missions through out differnt regions of space. this game i would give the story line a 4 out of 10 and the gameplay i would give a 9.5 out of 10",1
"this game is one of the best third person shooters ive ever played! list of my favorite third-person games 1. warframe 2. the last of us 3. star wars battlefront series",1
"great game, thought it was gonna be cheesy since you know, your robot ninjas in space but its a great game with a very unique play style. id strongly recommend to play it multi-player with buddies through voice chat because its a hell of a lot funner that way",3
"in one word, warframe is megaawesomesuperduperswordfightinggunsablazingactionpackedkillingmachine. this game may start out slow, and you may think that it is a pay to win. well, putting into prespective that pretty much everything in the game can be obtained ****for free**** doesnt make it a pay to win. it is a game that takes a lot of time, though. it is also really fast paced, so dont expect to be good at sniping in a corner. you gotta be out there on the front lines chopping grineer heads off with your pole-staff. i have lots of fun playing this game, but sometimes trying to obtain items can be a pain. yes, you have to repeat missions many times, but who cares? the more grinner heads rolling, or corpus wire cutting, the better! oh, and why complain about a fully free game for free. a few problems i experience. when the game released the beta, i got it and enjoyed the simple fun missions. the game has had a lot of updates. 1. i do not like the planet map anymore. i dont know why, i just dont like it. 2. sometimes the game stops working and crashes when i get to extraction. please fix these problems. extra stuff that makes it aweomse: ninjas, the stalker, bows, arrows, sickles, pole-staffs, lasers, gore, warframes, kubrows.",1
"the game is pretty grindy, but it looks really good and plays really well. if you like shooting things and having really cool powers i would recommend this game.",6
"this game is great when it comes to action but you might get confused on how to do certain things at first",1
"warframe is a good action game great graphics runs smoothly and everything the only problem that happended to me but might not happen to u is that to me it got kinda of boring but u might not feel the same way but everything else is fine so go check it out.",1
"i have to say this is one of my favorites; great gameplay, badass weapons, and awesome warframes! i cant wait to see more!",2
"ing amazing game i love it i wish alot more of my friends played this with me so i can get my small clan up in size!!!!! but ya ing awsome game!!",1
"alright gonna say this now but for people who dont like to grind/gather/wait for your equipment to build. dont waste your time. as for everyone else, i highly recommend atleast trying this game. everything in this game can be obtained (besides a few retired items) without dropping a dime into the game. region chat can be random but always fun to read also.",8
"one of the greatest games ive played on steam, completely action packed and full of origional sci fi stuff",1
"great game and the warframe powers are awsome i cant wait until the new update and wall running is awsome to",1
"great game! the gunplay is top notch and the leveling system makes this a really good time sink.",3
"warframe is a third person action co-op game. it provides a wide variety of warframes, weapons and other customisation. if you like being a futuristic ninja, this a game that is suitable for you :)",1
"this is a fun game that you can play with your friends. i havent seen a game in a while like this. its so addictive and fun.",2
"pretty nice game consindiring its is free godd graphics",1
"to be honest this game is like rengoku if you know that game",1
"great game, wish i could die irl and become a tenno like those people believed after seeing james camerons avatar.",3
"i like this awesome game because thats my kind of games",2
"space ninjas and parkour, everyone should play warframe, if not, go f*** yourself buddy, cause youre missing out",1
"this game is broken as all hell also whoever put ordis in the game needs to be shot.",2
"warfarm is a lot like having a really nice sock that you always pick up and deposit your coconut juice into. you can use it plenty until it begins to start chafing your meat sickle. eventually, theres just nothing comfortable or pleasant about it. however, de does wash the sock for you every so often, so its worth coming back to now and then. great game and the devs are working on it all the time but doesnt have much to do once youve forged end game gear. definitely worth a go and a rewash every so often.",4
"nice third person shooter with potential co-op with friends",3
"its awesome and its free? yes please! think of it like ninjas in space.. 9/10 (sign up with this link to get ingame rewards!",2
"its fricken amazing 151 hours in 2 weeks i love this game",3
"this game is amazing and worth getting. i love the rpg open world scifi type elements! its not bad plus pretty much any decent computer can run it!",1
"i definitely would recommend it! it has amazing gameplay that i personally find different than other games. its a unique take on third-person shooters.",1
"really great game , till the end. not much end game but over all still worth to play.",1
"its a very nice game. would be quite the game fer you ninjas.",1
"love this game so much its awesome its exactly what i like in a video game",1
"awesome. if you like shooting things and killing other things just to do it again this is your game. while it can get repetitive at sometimes its fun sometimes its rough here and there but overall good with a lot of things going for it. awesome",4
"this is a good f2p game, it is not a pay to win but a play an event to win. i love this game but i absolutely bloody hate it",1
"a really fun and different game, with a a large variety of weapons and awesome melee combos that changes it from a standard sci fi third person shooter. the only downside is the huge grindwall for resources in order to craft weapons and other loot. in fact id say this game currently is the worse ftp for acquiring new content due to the grind+wait time on crafting equipment(in my experience anyway). waiting a total of 36 hours to craft each part of a new warframe(armour) and then another 3 days to put each piece together is a terrible mechanic. if this game was not so fun and different then i would not recommend it. dont expect to get anywhere unless you dedicate a lot of gametime to this title.",2
"youre a space ninja that kills anything that moves just for crafting materials. 10/10",2
"warframe delivers a wide variety of unique quests and some secret rooms and the rank up building new weapons , warframes lets get started: cons: - building takes alot of time between 12 - 24 hours! - if you reached rank 10 youll feel bored cause you wont unlock anything - argon crystal is a very rare item can be found in void only - if you want to build more warframes you need to buy slot with platinumand so with the weapons pros: + unique f2p + many kinds of warframes + void and bosses give you a pretty good challenge especially t iv + no payment walls rating: 7.9 / 10 (since it stills on beta the review and rating may change)",3
"im not sure what it is but this game sucks you in and there is no known way getting away from it.",1
"a fantastic rpg like tps with a good elements and the stealth is great but not alot of players see it as is a great way to clear stages and most classes are great and the co op is good but tip of mine the nyx is the hardest becouse your team can kill your cantroled unit so i saw rarely glitches but its great 8/10",3
"its an amazing third person shooter. it has missions you can play with friends, quests, and even parkour! the amazing part is that its almost lag free!",1
"warframe is really fun because i really love third person games",1
"ninjas own people by their technique with katanas , but when they get weapon there is no chance of living near them :d this game is purely awesome.",1
"great game, althought its just one of many pay-to-win game, even your character not strong enough to do a mission alone, but over all is a good game, epic story, good graphic.",1
"if you like explosions, constant action, co-op gameplay, and slicing & dicing, then pick up this game. in my opinion the market in this game is great. you buy a blueprint for whatever item you want (gun, new secondary, melee weapons, or a shiny new warframe to play as) and then you build it using items found during missions. this forces the player to work for their success. it also has a unique mod system that gives you anything from increased shields to more bullets. all for free, you cant go wrong picking up this game.",1
"its ing trash omg, needs more variety in gameplay, better levels, a better campaign, and more smooth gameplay with tighter controls. also some pvp would be stellar.",3
"this is an addictive game to play and you will stick to it even at the first 5 minutes of gameplay.i truly enjoy this game since it is free-to-play. although there are some premium features, you can get pass this by just playing. this game requires alot of grinding and knowledge about the game. the community is great and there are many people willing to help you suceed in the game. this is one of the best games i have played in a while.",4
"best game ever! easy then its gets harder lol , like playing online its fun",1
"still a pretty sweet game, and getting solid updates from time to time. rough to start out on though.",5
"if you have time to kill , and just wanna play somthing this is it! but besides that its more like p2w from my point of view",1
"this game is like no other game that i have played. its very well versed and all around creative. the community is wonderful and i enjoy playing it !!!",3
"pretty good until you realize they break the engine a little more with every update and the game consists of eternal farming with no sense of reward , progression or development. its just grinding for the grind",5
"this game was really fun even doe i just started it (much killing lots wow)",1
"its an mmo third-person co-op shooter, yes a co-op shooter. the pvp conclave was added in the update 10 in september 2013 but the heart of this game is the 4 people co-op. each warframe have 4 different unique skills and abilities to use and quite similiar to ninjas. and when theyre in space, this game is basically space ninjas shooting aliens. there are many game modes that diversify from other shooters and provide variety instead of just shooting things outright. the downside of this game and all mmos is (of course) the grinding for materials and blueprints. its still in open-beta so expect newer content, changes, and the bugs that comes with it. all in all 8/10.",7
"1st: ninja 2nd: space 3rd: ninja in the space <3 f2p so just try it out",4
"the best part about this game to me is that even though you can spend real money and get almost anything you want at the start, it really doesnt matter since skill still plays a huge part in what you can and cant do. also there is nothing that cant be gotten by farming, and there is even stuff that you can only get by farming that is not available in the market. the game can be a little repetitive, but what isnt entertaining about being a space ninja and running into a crowd of enemies and killing them all with throwing knives, or killing them with a blast of fire. play this game, you wont regret it.",2
"this game is awesome. the variety of characters and weapons is huge and each one its own perks and disadvantages. the only problem is that you have to wait if you are building a new weapon.",4
"im having some login issues where it keeps adding unessisay letters and my war frame freezes in the middle of game play but other then that the game is excellent",1
"do you want to be a space-ninja with your friends ? play it.",1
"this game is one of the best free to play, with stunning visuals and great co-op play. whilst the game itself is not pay to win as every item in the game is accessable for free, you would certainly benefit from investing in the game. weapons take up to 5 hours of collecting resources on top of another 12 hours to build, that is my only complaint.",1
"id rate this game 6.8 out of 10. the gameplay is quite smooth and the graphics is outstanding. the missions are pretty standard and easy to understand however every mission feels almost the same, not really thrilling but still enjoyable. the only complaint i have about this game is the limitations of buying in-game wepons, warframes, etc. the requirement of using real money to buy things is abit overrated.",3
"4 of us, trying to plug the datamass in the terminal, going complete zoolander on it. suddenly a wave of enemies came down on us, we killed all of them. another wave, no big deal. still didnt figure out the terminal... 10/10 time suck.",1
"a must get for dynamic shooter fans. tps with loads of abilites and upgrades for your suit and guns. great for solo or co-op play. take the run and gun approach, or use the incredible invisibility armor skill and silently take out patroling guards. runs best on high graphics cards.",1
"alittle bugy at times but over all fun and enjoyable",3
"great game just everyone thinks its all about running fast and being first to the finish line lol",4
"this is the best game. its design lets the player never become bored of this game.",4
"sure, its an fps...well...tps... and most of the hipsters/rpg gamers dont like that but after playing a game like this, it makes you apreciate the free games on steam. im not saying that this is he best gme ever. im not even telling you to play the game a lot. im just saying that maybe, you should try it. if you dont like it, dont play it. it is a game afterall... anyway, i give it a thumbs up cause it is the only shooting game that i like. the story is a minor part of the game but it still affects the levels/gameplay. multiplayer is abundent in the game but you still have the option o choosing to solo the missions. the enemies aer wierd and sci-fi ish and when you kill the enemies, they explode and blodd splatters as if its a zero gravity area. there are some glitches but they usually make the game cooler. clans are available and every item that is available for people who make in-game purchases is also available for players who dont. all in all... 8/10 ?",6
"im hooked on this game. highly recomended if you enjoy coop and third person missions. grindy, yes, but i think thats what i like about it. with the huge selection of weapons and frames, there is always something to strive for wether it be attaining that item you dont have, or leveling it to max it out.",7
"this game is ...........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................friggin awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"cool game. but soon p2p not f2p anymore. and not in steam anymore :(",1
"this game gets crap from people for being pay-to-win. it has no such aspect. sure you can buy the in-game currency to get things that you could get for free sooner but it is all available to you, you just need to put in the effort of playing to get what you want. this game has given me countless hours of fun while not having to pay a dime. if you do want the platinum, you can sell/trade things to other players who have payed, or trade them for a piece of equipment you have a hard time finding. the devs do their job by releasing updates constantly bettering the game for its players, putting up livestreams, checking the forums for bugs and many other things. a++++ for warframe.",1
"its free if you dont mind spending some time on it, but that makes everything you get fulfilling. if your not playing warframe, what are you doing with your life?",4
"good game, good graphics. worth the download! enjoyable game to play.",1
"its missing somethng... not sure what... it would be cool if the foundry was in game... not in menu, maybe make it more like halo? cinematics?",1
"one of the best free to plays ive ever had the pleasure to try. i highly recommend this title to anyone with a few hours to kill and a decent internet connection.",1
"space ninjas with guns. thats all you need to know.",1
"i believe this game has much potential. it needs improvment in areas espicially how it runs. at first i thought the diffuculty was my pc, even though other games run very smooth on it, so i put everything graphics wise to its absolute lowest and still encounterd frame rate drops. although thats the great thing about pc games, they can be greatly improved. beyond that, this is a tuly an amazing game and im yet to encounter any bugs. combat is very cool and addicting with great wall running mechanics and animations that truly make you feel like a cyber ninja. missions are huge and should take you and your friends, assuming your online, awhile to complete. the ai works well, you wont really be challenged unless your alone however. platnum is the worst money drainer as i only have 40 platnum without paying, and items cost all the way to 300 platnum. you can choose from 3 starting characters, and need alot of platnum to get more. as a score, its atleast an 8/10. i didnt really get into the story, which is good but pretty confusing, and you might not get as many frame rate drops as i did. overall this is an amazing free to play game that i highly recomend.",1
"in all honesty, i cant truly recommend this game, as in my opinion, a recommendation is something that you would give a game that you can play as a main game. something like battlefield, or ghost recon. something that has depth to the gameplay, and a variety of ways to play. while this game does have some depth, and some variety, its mostly surface level. there is very little variation in missions. the most variation youll get is what kind of mission you pick. and even then, your stuck with only a few options. namely massacre all the enemies, rescue a prisoner, grab some intel, plant false information, sabatoge a generator, or some variant of capture the flag. basically. but that in no means makes this a bad game. its fun as a kind of off game when you want to shoot some stuff up, sure. the gunplay is tight, rewarding, and the variations of weaknesses that each enemy has (again though, a very limited amount) requires you to learn what works best against what faction, and within that, what enemy within each faction specifically.",5
"awesome game. really reccomend this game. craft warframe weapon. seek for components and lots of modification. lack of player is this game disadvantages but with time it shouldnt be matter. play this game !!!!",2
"warframe has great graphics and also having it in third person just adds to the good qualities of the game. the controls are easy to learn. the story is a bit hard to follow. having the game where its an optional online campian was an amazing idea by the creatures.",1
"it is a okay game.. it is a great co-op game. :3",1
"i only can say that this is one of the best games on steam free-to-play games.",2
"warframe is kinda repetative, but its a really fun game!",2
"this game is robot space ninjas with guns and magic. i cant describe it any better than this. free to play, no pressure to buy anything. only thing im not liking much is the real-time delays on being able to rank up and make new weaponry and such.",3
"great pve n ocasion update . one of the best free tps",4
"great game, lots of fun, for the gamers who dont bother end game repeating! always introducing new stuff",2
"awesome, free, and fun. using super-alien-jedi-space-ninja-soldiers to shoot, slash, and blow up enemies, really if you arent sure, at least try it, cuz its free. progressing is a bit slow without platinum (premium currency), but youll get it.",1
"looks like a great game. unfortunately im not a ninja.",1
"its decent, while it gets repetitive after a little while its a fun way to kill time or something to do when you are bored. 7/10",1
"i would defenantly recommend this game for two main reasons and a few other small ones. the two main ones being; its free, and your a freakin ninja! other than that there are some other small aspects of the game that make it great, one the graphics are amazing especially for a free to play game. two everything that you can buy besides decorative items that dont do anything can be obtained in game. lastly that the grind to get these objects is strangely addicting. so go get this game and lets kill some things.",3
"absolutley amazing game with amazing graphics. the gameplay is amazing and the modding system is one of the most in-depth i have ever seen. 25/1",10
"hi i am the king on nigeria and as a proud nigerian i aprove this game",1
"probably the best free game ever! great graphics and gameplay, mobility and weapons! still in beta so i wont fret about bugs that are common",7
"this game has you playing as ****ing space ninjas with shotguns. is there anything left to say? i would think not.",1
"this game is really fun and cleverly done. each warframe has its own strengths and weaknesses making the player decide which is best suited for what sort of gameplay. the same can be said for the high amount of weapon choices. you could have a frame and weapon for each of the three factions (grineer, corpus and infested), and mission mode. or aim to have your favorite warframe and weapon loadout tackle anything and everything. all in all its a great game. plus the staff actually works hard to resolve bugs and balances in a timely manner.",3
"good game, great graphics and nice movements. for a free to play game its a very very good choice. try it.",1
"do you like space ninjas? do you like killing space nazis? do you like parkour and carnage? if you say no, you are obviously a machine, and not human. everyone else, will really enjoy this game. ^_^",4
"this game brings more excitment to playing games in my opinion. its one of the few i actually still like to play on a regular basis because the devs really like to make it challenging. always adding new content to keep players entertained for the time being. well worth the $free.99 it costs to play.",7
"love it addicting fun awesome gameplay diffrent modes but if you have time you can get to the highest level on a warframe withen a short period within a month or 2 you have all planets unlocked and then gameplay becomes repetitive i suggest playing with friends .",1
"fun game up to a point. you start the game with a basic warframe, as you play you can get blueprints to craft stronger warframes with unique abilities. modding the warframes and weapons is fun an interesting, but the only down sides are once you reach a certain point the only way to get items and blueprints are running voids, (think instances). groups for these are very frustrating to get into and from what i have found most clans in the game are pretty dead. all in all fun for the first week or two then just gets frustrating and repetitive without getting into groups, or active clans.",1
"a very fun shooter that i spent a good amount of time enjoying. 8/10",1
"this game is completely free to play and enjoy, yet if it had a price tag on it i think i would gladly pay for it. this ninja-running, over the shoulder shooting, magic powers using action game is hard to put down once youve gotten a feel for your warframe. just make sure you pick the one you want and research a little bit before starting up, or you could end up with a warframe you dislike for a long time if you dont spend money on platinum.",2
"space ninjas!!! whats more awesome than that? exactly, play this game!",9
"games awsome, its my go to game i play with my nephew and friends. finding games like this one if very hard to come across, its diffrent from every syfi, action etc. games out there i would recomend this game first, as i do many times. id give it ***** (5) stars",1
"warframe is great. to some extent, the people complaining about warframe being repetative are correct. however, i also feel these are the same people who spend weeks studying boss fights and how to properly raid in wow. warframe accomplishes what most games these days lack: it is fun! every aspect of warframe is not repetative though. there are some customization elements to the game. i think the best part of warframe is having one or two core people to group with. its fast paced action is perfect for laughs and fun. thats all i have to say.",1
"10/10 would play 300+ hours again. bknelson and jadavis have small dongers.",3
"i like the game and all, but i dont like that it takes you so log time to get a new weapon.",1
"great f2p game that is fun to play with friends. definately recommend this.",7
"interesting third-person shooter, may be a challenge but definately worth playing. very fun with others, and pretty hard to get bored with. overall a good play :)",1
"love this. combination of ninja, space, alien, rambo, magic, gunshot, dynasty warrior , max payne, tenchu, etc. you will like this or you probably gay",2
"everthing is good about this game, especially the game play. the game play could be described as futuristic ninjas with space tech weapons killing aliens. the game itself is free to play, though there is a in game store that requires you to buy the majority of the items with real money. however, the amount of pay to use item does not offset the balance of the game, one can still enjoy the game without spending money purchasing items.",1
"ninjas vs aliens and alien ninjas with guns, quick gameplay, decent controller support (if you like that), free to play. dont really need to ask for more. definately one of the better f2p games ive played this year.",8
"small review for this game: its free. and awesome. think future inter planetary space ninjas. just so good!",1
"fun game,fun customization but can have a steep curve to it when paired with other players that are not so good.",1
"the game actually made me arsed to write a review i hate it 5/5",1
"great game to play with friends, awsome graphix and unique gameplay and mechanics.",2
"this game has no words to explain it...its well made and thought and time into this i highly recommend this game for futureistic sword fighting loving gamers who desire such content",1
"if you love grinding in rpgs, if you love mass effect, if you love ninjas and weapons, weapons everywhere then you will love this game. its a f2p game, you can access anything in the game without paying if you commit! make sure you use the alerts app or follow the alerts on twitter. the only reason you would need to pay is to expand your storage (more frames/wepons capacity and also event weapons give you storage spaces) and colors/skins (some helmets are even obtainable for free). in other words, i love this game. its fun, its repetitive but theres always new content coming out and the repetitive is just leveling up new weapons and new characters every day for fun.",7
"excellent graphics for free game and is getting content regularly",1
"before update 11, it was sliding simulator 2013. after that, it became space-ninja-dodge-everything-or-die sliding simulator 2013.",3
"this game rocks. almost 200 hours in and still having a blast.",7
"i played this game over 24 hours, so i might know what im talking about. warframe is a great looking game in many ways and yet feels good too. this game seems to be a too good free-to-play, but yet i feel like i paid for it. story is good but not bad, but what we all gamers care about the fun and gameplay in games, and this game does a great job of doing this. i highly people who really spend their time playing video games to play this game... but yet im not a player who playes all day and i still enjoy playing it. if i were to give it a score of 1 though 10 it would be a 9-out of 10, because it still has more updaes to come and yet when a new warframe comes out every update it get sadden and feel that im not powerful anymore. some bugs here and there but you will not run into any on your great adventure in this game. this game is a should have.",2
"really detailed 3rd person shooter with some free running mechenics but as always microtransactions that are not really neccesary to play the game all in all a good game and only 1 gig",1
"this game is a menagerie of fast paced action of all types. it seriously is one of those games you can lose countless hours over. definately look into this, if you havent already.",1
"its so great, that i cant express my feelings. just one disadvantage. its free to play.",1
"its space ninjas! whats there not to like? joking aside, its a great game. everything from the gameplay to the lore to the graphics (wich are stellar by the way) oozes awesomeness! even though its still a diamond in the rough i higly recomend it!",6
"icredibly fun and fast paced action with amazing gameplay wrapped in promising yet unfinished buggy rpg grinding.",4
"its free, why not try it? its a really fun game which is centered around, basically space ninjas. its really addicting once you get the hang of it, and the potential this game has is huge. the game is currently only in open beta, but for a beta its pretty well completed. it hooked me good for a week, and still has me every few weeks. its not at all pay2win, because there is no winning against other people! youre set in a co-operative environment, besides the optional pvp. in that area i cant say, but i know most (if not all) store items can be made with blueprints and in game items (which will only cost you time and credits (credits being the default currency)). overall id highly suggest this game to friends. id give it an 8/10.",1
"amazing as it may sound, this game is better than many many other retail titles in so many many ways. graphics, mechanics, cool ninja moves, stealth action and high customization are just the tip of the iceberg, as the cooperative play is teh real blast you can get from warframe. playing coop will make your enemies tougher, and theyll use attacks that will require your companions to free or wake you up to not get owned. a simple and not too various (were still in the beta section though) ai director changes the structure of the levels every time you play them, taking away the predictability of enemy positions. same goes for loots and treasure chests. a real great game, for no price: its christmas early this year buddies, enjoy!",2
"its a fantastic next-gen free to play game. the micro-transactions arent anybodies cup of tea but premium items dont get in the way of pure skill at the end of the day. its multiplayer only for now but single player looks promising, the co-op aspect of this game is great with a mix between racing too the finish and helping teammates destroy enemies or claim objectives. no pvp yet but a not so popular duel-mode is currently in place. the mission layout is expansive and pretty good to navigate through and the graphics are a treat.",1
"almost same map,same enemy,same missions.annoying shiny flash visual effect kills my eyes.class,skill system is not so mach fun cause almost anything is same.you need so many time to get weapons ,money,exp but not worth.and enemy has bunny ears.bunny ears.",5
"such a ka game! i love the atmosphere and the fighting but mainly team work!",1
"probably the best free to play game out there. the fast paced action is amazing!",1
"this game is awesome. best free to play game. forget metal gear rising. this game is awesome for hack and slash. and the shooting is also great. best free game out there. i am also getting the ps4 version. with that said. the pc version works great with xbox 360 controller. the start menu, like briefing doesnt work that great with controller, but the main menu, and in game, work great with controller, just the like minute of like mission briefing, you have to use mouse, which is a minor complaint, but apart from that the game works 99 percent on xbox 360 controller,",1
"this is an awesome especially because it is free. you can really find no better deal than this game if you like third person shooters.",3
"if cod and uncharted had a baby, it definitley wouldnt be this.",2
"this game is probably one of the most satisfying gaming experiences ever. with this game, you have the ability to earn/or build pretty much everything. weapons, frames, skins...you can play this game and not have to pay a cent and have some of the most powerful items in the game. i find that earning all of the materials to build your equipment is extremely satisfying. combine this with the extreme replayability and you have one of the best games that could hit the market. i will recommend this game 100% to everyone who asks me about it. good job de, you have made a jewel!",4
"i really wished to review this but im busy right now, try again later.",1
"this game is a awesome co-op game! you work together to fight off enemies and finish the objectives. go get it its free!!!!!",1
"addictive gameplay, yet somewhat annoying if you decide to avoid platinum purchases and grind for recipes/components which could take a significant amount of time. other than that - beautiful picture (at least on my gtx670m), adrenaline action.",1
"awesome game but needs to have a system to buy platinum without having to go to website to buy platinum",5
"the game its fun at first but the more you play the more boring it gets i have playd for some time and i just lost intrest in the game. and paying players have a big advantage here they get better weapons and rare mods . the game should have a goul or something but here its just same misions in same maps just gets harder. the grafics are good and its a great f2p game but the only problem its gets boring after some time.",2
"this game its like deadspace 3 and but with less of a horror aspect and more oprative feel to the game i give it the tomsaka (i love it) seal of aproval :) :p",4
"this game is worth a buy its vary grasping i keep wanting to play it. it might look like just a shooter but its way more then that, this is a must get",1
"a cool game with good graphics and suprisingly low requirements. the missions quite repeats themselves, but fun nonetheless. however, it could have been a much better game if you could earn platinum without the use of real-world-currency (besides the trading system and the honor of the lotus login reward which are good too). but overall this is a very good free-to-play, probably the best on steam.",5
"slick and well-polished 3rd person shooter with a lot of content. under continual development. sadly after update 11 optimization has suffered and the game runs at about half the framerate it used to. eta after update 14 my framerates are back to normal.",5
"this game is pretty sick in a lot of ways, good ways actually. but there a quite some bugs and glitches which might take away the fun. major problem is that this game barely gives any good rare or uncommon mods and i cant progress good enough. the thing is the the that one problem that really needs fixing is the transmute section, i traded like 4 rare mods and got a common weak mod. i just lost all my money cause of that. other than that if you want good stuff you need platinum which will take your money cause trading is hard. the game has its ups and downs but i still recommend this game.",4
"ninjas in space, whats not to love? best f2p since league. or tf2 but i paid for that game. also bo life. if its not a bo staff, youre not donatello.",1
"i have been playing this game for almost two years now, and i have seen this games ups and downs. ill start of by saying that this is a very good game that you can play for hours on end. you should definetely give this game a try if you want: 1. an active and friendly community. 2. a long lasting game that you will play for a while. 3. bugs that take like a year to patch. (lol) in all my time playing this game i have never really come up with any problems, other than those bugs that the devs are finally fixing. the community is great, i have never gotten into an argument with anyone (which is rare for me). by the time youre finished with the latest update/patch there will already be a new update with a crap-load of new content. best of all, you dont have to pay to get everything. although buying platinum makes things easier, you can obtain everything in the game without having to pay a penny, with the exception of one or two guns. 10/10",2
"an amazing third person shooter, free, and you can get just about anything in game without having to use your hard earned money.",2
"very fun and great mission system overall a great game really worth getting...",1
"the game is repetitive in its level design and missions, but its constantly updated with new content. the biggest draw for me was the fluidity of the shooting, platforming, melee combat, using the powerups... it feels smooth and very fun. especialy when youre playing with a friend using a mic, then youll have tons of fun. additionaly the game is absolutely beautiful with its use of colour, its lighting and shadow effects, which is even more amazing considering it runs smooth on my low-spec pc.",1
"easily one of the best action games ive ever played, with loads of different ways to play and choices of weapons and how you can customize them, ive enjoyed it so much that even though its free to play ive spent a decent amount of money on it and i dont regret a single cent. well worth every second of playing time in my opinion, a must play.",10
"fantastic game, especially seeing as its free. however, if you want the best stuff, you have to pay for it - and its not too cheap. if you really enjoy the game though, its definitely worth putting in a little bit, after all, they need the money. my main problem with it is that it just loves to crash; especially when you get a message on skype or steam or anything along those lines. overall, a bit faulty but well worth it.",1
"oh my god, this game. this game. warframe is a game about the tenno/warframes, a bunch of guys in oddly-designed space outfits. theyre ninjas. in space. if you dont think thats awesome already, theres no hope for you. also, you can be a space ninja with a flamethrower. and a battleaxe. and dual revolvers. and you can run up a wall, backflip off it into a s face and cut said  in half. 10/10 would farm orokin cells.",3
"it i a very fun action game i love the fact that you get to sneak around and that each weapon has their own sneak attack",5
"it is a fun interactive game that allows you to create a warrior capable of either destroying everything or a healer who helps their friends",1
"warframe is one of the best free to play games i have ever had the pleasure of playing. this is a game where pay to win is not an issue, if you can play well then you will have a good time, gear only makes it a bit easier, plus anything you can buy for real money can be built (albeit with difficulty and time) yourself with ingame currency. if you like run and guns, or if you just like the idea of third person shooters you should like this.",5

"game is awsome and mod sysytem awsome recomeneded for all but... bugs close the game not because low specs i have over the requirments in 1080p and building takes up alot weps in 12 hours some 24 warframes 3 days but the game is great very addictive i play 8 hours a day total of over 116 hours not recomended for gaming addicts",7
"did not played it to much until know, it seems like a nice blend of a fast paced, stylish, collective action game",1
"very fun game, great graphics for a f2p, and very creative ideas, you can fuse mods and use them on your character, very creative. love it.",2
"i dont have this through steam but i cannot recommend this game enough. if you dont play this game especially with friends, you are missing out.",7
"amazing games and free to play, great graphics and a lot of content",4
"this game is ing sweet. like running on walls? get it like sliding on your knees and shooting guns? get it like superhuman powers? get it like randomly generated levels? get it like amazing customisation? get it like owning sections of the galaxy? get it like occasional horror levels? get it",1
"warframe is a great game. its offers alot for what youre paying (which is nothing). you are a ninja like thing called a tenno and your job is to cleanse the solar system of the enemy factions. it has great graphics and great gameplay. if you download this game you will not be disappointed.",3
"its a game about space ninjas destroying space nazis and futuristic ea representatives. i dont think i need to say any more here.",2
"the game is free to play!! a lot of grinding to get the goodies but the game is free to play!!.",3
"this is a very fun game and i would recommend it. it is best to play with friends,",1
"amazing game with beautiful graphics and easy to learn controls! 10/10 one of the best games on steam!",1
"a very well polished game. just wish it was open world",3
"great f2p game, has some buggs/glitches but they are doing their best to fix them. not pay to win since you can get everything without paying but its just faster if you pay real money.",2
"best ftp game ive ever played. truly a diamond under the ftp games out there.",7
"you play the role of a rhino headed ninja. well, there are other warframes available, but one of them looks like a rhino headed ninja. you fight people that look ugly and need to get a makeover, so you kill them for your relief of saving money from not having to pay for their beauty treatment.",1
"warframe is a good game. one of its best features is its beauty. everything in the game looks crisp and clear from the environments on the different planets to your warframes armor and abilities. charging in and destroying waves after waves of enemies by using your amazing powers is a great experience and seeing how to coordinate them with your teammates makes it even more enjoyable. the downside of this game is its repetitiveness. missions, environments, and enemies lack in diversity. even the method to upgrade your warframe is repetitive. you need to reach max rank to upgrade and once that is done you start at zero rank all over again. this is a enjoyable game to play but it might get boring after awhile.",6
"i enjoyed this game with the 100+ hours spent ingame. the players are wonderful and the the design and interworkings make this game enjoyable. my only upset is the serious farm required to play this game for free, but that is like most free to play games. the entire grind gets you to play. 8/10 it is pretty kubrow",2
"what i like about the game the crafting system makes you actaully want to do missions in order to get new weapons to spice up the gameplay like forsay gathering materials in a rpg to make a better weapon but some elements kinda just make the game more frustrating for me like how i have to wait to get something to potatoe my warframe or weapons itsa minor thing but it dosent really ruin the game the missions try at least to be creative you have capture the baddie kill all the baddies defend the depot survival etc and with each warframe you get different abilitys like one can shoot ice one is a tank but kinda slow one cant take  for damage but fast overall teh weapons seem to be made to fit different play style like are you the guy that likes running around shooting with a sniper rifle theres a weapon for that if you like katanas theres a weapon for that etc the game does get a bit repetitivebut witht he updates and new weapons it kinda feels a bit new albeit the same id recomend this game to anyone really that likes shooters or rpgs",2
"great game, takes a while to get used to gameplay.",1
"mass effect meets ninja gaiden. devs constantly update the game with new maps and guns, looking for material is enjoyable unlike mmos, and the gameplay is fluid. pay to play items: platnium is just like nx for nexon games, or any other boost. you dont need it since getting materials and looking for certain items are fun - no dull grinding. items drop at a reasonable rate to keep players engaged but also working hard. this game should not be free for how good it is and how invovled the devs are. 8/10 would keep playing",4
"as soon as i share my library with a friend that already has it, it just tells me to buy it instead of playing it, then it goes to this site and you can never download it cause it says its already downloaded... what the",3
"this is one of a rare few f2p game that i would really recommend. the development studio really is involved in the games community and takes what they have to say very seriously. if you are looking for a great way to unwind, with lots of running-n-gunning and hack-n-slash wall running, ninja craziness all taking place in a dystopia future of our solar system, then this is a game for you!",10
"i think this game rocks one question before you start reading this review. if you think a game shall be awesome and fun to play then stick on cause this is the best game in history. 1. no lag 2.no spam 3. no legit that was all guys",1
"best for stealth and running and gunning as long as you have a good setup",1
"i love it! super cool and fun game, i would easly buy it if it would cost! but its free! :d",1
"equip a frame with weak weapons and few mods, then do a mission solo, feel the pressure to survive and feel what the game could have been. enjoy that before remembering the grindfest of mass destruction that warframe has become. either way its still great if you find the right clan to chat and share.",7
"a grindfest as others have said, but the grinding is the whole point of the game - the grinding is legitimately fun. its basically mass effect, minus role playing, plus mmo, plus parkour space ninja.",1
"quite possibly the most diverse fps ive ever played, epic battling, hugely customiseable everything and addictive gameplay. worth spending a few quid on some in game stuff but not essential, not regretting a single  spent on this.",3
"imagine halos masterchief, without the armor plated armor but with his skin suit, add in his shields, flipping, wall climbing, and swords mixed in with l4d team resussitation. congratulations you may have just pictured what warframe is... freaking space ninjas in space! with guns! pros : clan constructed modular lairs. great textures , models, voice acting. (to counteract the first 2 cons, farm for most stuff.) choice of stealth or run & gun / sword. cons : pay 2 win, pay 4 everything. time locks - construction, assembling gear, ranking up (to unlock more stuff) all take real time hours (various). 4 knockouts daily, after 4 used instant fail mission (solo).",3
"pretty fun gameplay but kind of confusing. im not sure on how to upgrade my character or even if i ranked my character. i think im rank 1 but average 9 on my items. im glad this has some controller support.",1
"im not huge on fpss, but this being ftp and having a good friend devote hundreds of hours to it made me try it out. its a little clunky to get into, but its extremely enjoyable once you get a feel for transitioning in combat. im still digging into it when i get free time, but my multitude of un-played games can wait a little longer while i stretch this one out.",1
"this game is a real good tps, i really recommended to yall",1
"i like the scifi ninja hack n slash factor about his game which is quite unique to this game",1
"all i have to say is this, if it looks fun or semi fun to you, give it a try. however, if it looks like its not you kind of thing or that it doesnt look fun, then hey, you dont have to download it. personaly i had fun with it. i wouldnt say its one of the best f2p ( free to play for those of you that dont know ), but i hade fun with it.",1
"its...okai i guess the only reason i play it is for my friends... id give it a 7/10",1
"very good game. coop play is a very nice feature that helps you to finish stages quicker or just enjpy the game with friends. leveling up is also great and the mods add to it, diff mods for different areas for your warframe and weapons. it is free :).",1
"the most fun ive played this series generous gun game!!! egame!",2
"space ninjas, decapitations, blood, guns, super swords. what else? get this game!!",1

"warframe you start out as a teno or some thing.i couldnt care less.fighting as a badass robot vs cyborg twins",1
"10/10, really fun, just takes time to become very good, trust me i know",8
"its a fun game and i recomend it, but my key bindings in warframe are ruinned and i cant fix them ;(",2
"i like this game adventure game shooting and some arcade thanks bro",2
"whats cooler than frggn space ninjas yering aliens and multiplayer. just wish the performance was a little better,the sensitivity is really high and its very hard to see anything thats going on while looking around.overall... prestty good game.:3",1
"i highly recommend this game. easily the most fun i have had playing any game. ever.",1
"warframe, for a free game in open beta, is very well-done and includes an intricate upgrade and leveling system. the game is multiplayer-friendly when there are no connection problems, and the different warframes, weapons, and abilities make for fun and dynamic playstyles. my favorite aspect of the game is that it makes you feel like a total badass.",1
"this game is a very fast paced shooter/sword fighting game yet when not hacking your way through enemies it has a well done crafting mechanism though it does take a lot of time to build items this doesnt really matter if your willing to put a bit of time into this game if i were to rate this game it would be a 8/10 because it is hands down one of the best free games ive ever played or the best maybe the only thing negative about this is that there are still a bunch of bugs in the game but otherwise this game is awsome everyone should try it!",2
"a free-to-play multiplayer game thats not pay-to-win, and its about space ninjas. what more could you ask for?",4
"a great beta that is continually getting better. the developers really listen to the fans and adjust the game accordingly as the updates come out. i expect it to be truly magnificent when it is completed.",2
"the dankest of the dank when it comes to fighting aliens as a badass ninja warrior",1
"havent played this game in a year. i like the games dynamic, its a gut-wrenching game, and its fun i tell you.",1
"tps with co-op dedicated mechanics. solid gameplay, top-notch graphics but repetitive level system that deteriorates the experience after 10+ hours.",1
"not a bad game its kinda balanced too i recommend becouse it has crafting and difrent stuf for people who like technology totaly recommending to give a try!",1
"i have only played it once in the past, but its very fun",1
"for a free-to-play game it is pretty awesome. badass ninja aliens kicking other alien ? definetly a must have considering it is free!",4
"i didnt like this game much back then when i frist got it, and well ever sease my freind started playing it (too much) i fianly came on to see why it was so worth playing so much and well now i love this game its geart i love the warframes and my nekros as you can tell by my image :3. and the prime stuff is soooo goood. also space ships soon!",3
"if you like co-op with many levels and major customisation get this! if you dont like getting lost and figting invisible people that is most likely a bug dont. 5/10",1

"this game is good and all but i got banned for buying a gun... i got banned untill 2035 plz fix",1
"youll probably like the game for a few days or weeks, depending on each person. playing online is fun when there isnt lag, big variety of missions, weapons, warframes... but f*ck normal reviews, lemme give you my experience! as a new player, i loved it. it was fun, fast, exciting. everything i could ask for cut to today- as a slightly veteran player, this game has made me realize that i probably subconciously enjoy pain. it teached me the horrors of rng. it made me question free-to-play games everywhere around the world. i cant play anything now, warframe has killed gaming for me. so what the f*ck are you waiting for? go get dat sh*t right now!!",5
"this game defines 3rd person shooters, solo or co-op it delivers fast paced action for any play style or frame you choose to master and with the module system in place you can tailor and refine it to your personal tastes.",5
"its a good game with new updates around every month",1
"kicked a puppy and heard a very satisfying crunch.......... 10/10",1
"some one once told me, your greatest pains, can also be your greatest strengths. well that person is a f#%king liar. i dont think that my incurable brain tumor well give me super powers any day soon. aneurysm/10",4
"after more then a 100 hrs on this game i will tell you this. this game is for people who are not scare of seeing blood and killing factions. and being at stealthly as possible or as fast to kill factions and the 3d look to it is great the frames are well played for different types of people ways anyway you should get the game at all cost",3
"um it looks like a relly good and great game to play lots of fun action, but where the heck do i sign up to play i already have the game downloaded. someone plz tell me im deperate to finally play this amazing game ive seen others play the game and i really just want to join the game and play online or maybe solo",1
"this game will beat out any other game that is similar in any way %100 of the time.",4
"cmon its ninjas with swords. how can you go wrong.",6
"its really pretty, super fun, and can even run on my semi-toaster of a computer just fine. no lag and it adds other players to your game if you are playing alone!",1
"warframe is the first 3rd person game i ever played. it was the best game and still is. i played it when it was in its v0.6 progress! it was very buggy, but look where it is now. it is growing to be a fast pace action game. if you have a laggy computer, then put the settings all the way down to low and turn off everything.",1
"probably one of the most fun and enjoyable free to play games i have ever played. ive played a few hundred hours of this when it werent on steam and im not really fond on third person games but i love this game. its not the sort of game where you have to pay to get anywhere and is pretty balanced with only a few bugs here and there which arent really problems.",1
"space ninjas that use magic. that pretty much sums up warframe. play.",3
"its good. there, i said it. now... i was promised donuts...",1
"this is an amazing game! i just wish my computer could handle it",4
"the main point is to kill things. one of the best games ever. 10/10",1
"warframe is 3th person 3d game. ive played this game and i must say that this game if pretty good. the only problem about this game is that is big requirements.",1
"i think it is a beauiful game but the lag is crazy. as soon as i start a mission i lag, if they can reduce or stop the lag the game would be amazing on pc.",1
"this game has ninjas, guns and armour you can customize, and charecters with abilitys that are fun to use, did i mention that you can level up armour,guns and mods? plus you can do some parkour on levels and join clans, or make a clan of your own and build the place the way you like it. to sum up what i said, warframe=awsome!",5
"the game is pretty solid and fun once you get the hang of it. but newbie players wont be having as much fun until they start to buy stuff. still, i recommend this game for anyone that likes fast paced action and has money to spare. 8/10",1
"its awesome i cant find any other words x) devs are doing a awesome job keep everything up and running, combat system is very good, never seem to get tired of and it has its challenges for those who are more solo types.",3
"very good game! at first it will be boring to collect all the resources to get the wanted weapon, but when youll get the weapon the fun starts!",1
"theres something very satisfying about running around in a killing machine that you have build armed with weapons of the same. all around good times.",3
"definitely an amazing game, truly free to play aswell. its a little slow at first, but you get the hang of it after a while.",2
"im still very new to this game, but its amazing. its like gears of war meets mass effect meets dead space. it has some of the most beautiful scenery i have seen in any game, but suffers from a lot of repeated textures and entire rooms. this is without a doubt a game worth playing.",1
"this game is awesome wish u could trade non prime weapons",2
"hitting harder makes you better. striking faster makes you stronger. youll be playing for more hours since your work is never over.",2
"very good game with beautiful visuals nice controls and fun play style. allowing pvp was a bad idea though. 9.5/10",1
"amazing game.best third person shooter ever i really recommend this game :)",1
"great game... only played for the last 3 days and im hooked xd",1
"i hate it shuts down all the time i hate do not play this pice of junk",1
"ive played lots of free-to-play, pay-to-win games in my time, and this is by far one of them",1
"this game is really fun and addicting except theres lots of bugs and glitches, this game has been in beta a long time and crafting things in the foundry such as a new warframe takes three days to complete please make the time less and finish this game.",3
"1000 hours. no regrets. better than doing normal human stuff or having a social life. :d",10
"its good im just terrible at it (also its gotten better since ages ago)",1
"its an interesting game to play: slash, bash, shoot, loot, all the stuff youve come to expect. it also looks really good except for a few glitches. however, dont expect much of a story or any driving force to do anything because you will basically be farming to unlock cooler stuff later on, such as more warframes, better weapons, etc. and try not to waste your platinum, because thats the way they getcha monies. but if youre only interested in doing cool ninja stuff and becoming an amazing bad***, go on and play already!",1
"so good game. might be hard to start playing,but when you understand the modding n stuff its going to be awesome.",7
"at first i thought this game was quite, welll.....stupid, but! now i have my own clan to look after as well as two warframes to kick  with!",4
"i enjoy this game very much, spent a lot of time just conpleting missions. this game is worth your time.",1
"good game, i had lots of fun with it, but its still need much work",2
"i really enjoy this game, once you get a better warframe than the inital then its really good fun and with riends even better 9/10",2
"pve game with a tf2 like economy and futuristic stuff",2
"ever wanted to be ninja?.....ever wanted to be a ninja with guns?.....ever wanted to be a ninja with guns in space an slaughter everyone who gets in your way with a simple sword swipe from your flaming blades of fury, and then shoot another guy impaling him into a wall which u run up only to do a backflip and stab another guy?....ever wanna do it with a friend?..... warframe in a nutshell.",2
"im just going to throw this out!! this game is free and looks awesome!! also ninjas shooting guns!!",7
"this is a must play game; its super fun and action packed!",5
"warframe is third person shooter co op action multiplayer game were the protagonists are the tennos a kinda ninjas from space but theyre not aliens they are humans trying to get back to their power the solar sistem that is conquisted by a variety of bosses and powerful normal enemys so if you like third person shooter games you should play warframe ninjas play free!!!",5
"this game is so awesome! there is a lot of cosumization to you warframes and weapons (warframes are your suits). although a lot of things have to be bought with actual money, you can still get the items without it, it just requires more work. i like it like that because it gives you something to work for and for to play, looking forward to. there are so many missions! you travel to each planet of the solar system (plus more) and their moons. there is hours and hours worth of gameplay here; ive already sunck 12+ hours into it and im still having as much fun as when i started! however, there are a few problems with joining friends and members of your clans and crashes, but its not a constant thing, so its not too bad. i absolutly love this game! i would recomend this to everybody who loves action, uprgrading everything basically, explosions, and amazing graphics! even with everything dropped, this game still looks beautiful. amped, oh my god! you have to see it if your computer can handle it! there are no wors to desctibe it! deffinatly play this game if you have the time!",1
"really great game considering its f2p. i was hooked for 50+ hours before it started getting a little repetitive, but its being updated all the time.",1
"pretty much the best for short bursts of play if you dont have much time to spend invested in fun. guns feel pretty dang good swords are always a plus whips? yeah they got those power fists too",2
"this is a game about how i play as zero in borderlands 2.",1
"yes i recommend this game to any people it`s fun, there is alot of cool stuff in it like guns, frames and melee weapons and all the stuff there is all can be found in the game without paying platinum but if really want platinum its your choice its your money its worth it to play this game.(there are also some scienceish like the planets that would help you remember stuff in space if you need to :d)",3
"good quality and just the best sci-fi game ever played",1
"this game has a pretty fluid movement system and lots of loadout customisation options, as well as a great community.",1
"play as any of the many types of space ninjas with shark fin helmets that you want! from ones who shoot electricity, to others who glide through to air, to even one who was experimented on and went insane and now goes on bloody rampages! play solo, or online co-operative to beat each mission. start on the planet mercury and work your way among the stars defeating rival factions. level up and gain mods to augment your play style. seemlessly switch between melee and ranged fighting to deal deadly damage in a variety of ways. whats not to love!?",1
"gr8 gameplay lots of blueprints and things to build so you dont get bored. 8/8 would buy on bluray",1
"love the character design and idea behind it. cool, awesome and the best free game out here, i would dare to say its even better than some buy2play. and no this game is not pay2win, its grindy but you can easily get behind it.",1
"frekin awesome game, must mention this is a in-beta game, but hell its worth it, 10/10 would forget what the sun looks like.",3
"really good for a free to play game. dont need to pay for anything to have fun.",3
"warframe is a great shooter game that plays in 3rd person.... now be it that it is a tad slow at times and also a tad fast in other times it is a great game in my opinion. i especially like to customize my characters and weapons at that. very fun game i do recomend it and the best part is... its free!!!!",1
"this is great, the physics in this game are so realistic. parkour all day everyday.",2
"this is the best game i have ever played, it is verry chalanging. the 1 thing i dont like i that the game has almost no story, no cut scenes or anything... but it is still the best game i have ever played, i reccomend this game to anyone who has a strong enouph computer to play it.",2
"with hundreds of warframes, guns, and melee weapons to choose frorm, and 200+ missions to play, warframe will never bore you. parkour-style actions to move around the map. tight responsive controlls bring it all together. this is an incredible game to play whether its your first tps, or youre jut a fan of the tps genre. not much of a story, but thats not what warframes about. its about beating the crap out of hoardes of enemies with a group, or by yourself (if you plan on going solo, make sure you have alot of firepower. this game is hard without people.) overall, yeah, i recommend it. you wont be dissapointed.",1
"it is very entertaining game. it can get repetitive if dont get into a clan with people you like to spend time with. for a free-to-play it is absolutly astonishing gfx-wise and you dont really need to spend mony on it if you have time and patience. very recommended. just waiting for cross-platform play.",10
"this game is a total life ruiner. grab a friend or two or three and do it co-op, cuz when youre playing solo, it can be pretty difficult, unless you want to waste your revives.",3
"four words: cybernetic ninjas with guns. the game is a 4 of 5 or a 7 of 10. it has good graphics and great gameplay. the game is still is a work in progress and the new updates are polishing up an already well-built game. the co-op is the fondation of the game, but a bit of a let down when you are forced to race through a mission because your teammates decide to race to see who can kill the boss the fastest. this can be fixed by communication with the teammates or knowing your team, however it can be a time consuming to find people who operate like you do or will tolerate scavenging for resources (which is essential). the mod and upgrade menus are pretty straight forward and easy to use. i would recommend if you like the shooting of halo, the free-running of mirrors edge, and the sword play of dynasty warriors.",3
"great game. i highly recommend playing this game with your buddies. solid game mechanics and fluid motions.",1
"really good game to have some fun time, especially if you can find some people to play it with. and dont forget, free to play :d",8
"these graphics are good i could not play this on my other pc i couldnt but iplay onmy momsdamn boy theseactions like df men so much action iplayed this game i waslike omfg so much awesomenes",1
"parkour space ninjas. thats enough to convince people.",1
"while this game looks great do not be fooled, these ninjas are subpar for any true dark warrior. kamas are fashioned with subpar material, nikanas obviously not shinobi-made and my mom found me playing this and grounded me.",2
"alright game fun for anyone wanting to play a space themed online game.",1
"really weird but fun. hard to understand menus and main screen, but once you stare at it for a while and let your mind fracture you began to understand about 1% of it.",1
"it looks good but they should add more guns to like come on you know that everybody likes guns",1
"fun and addictive, has some interesting depth that isnt apparent at first. if you enjoy lobby based co-op third person shooters, you must try this one.",2
"lost my filipino ex-boyfriend to this game which subsequently ruined my life.  this game.",1
"best free to play game ive played to date! everything about this game is good. gunplay is very satisfying. graphics in game are really good (dof effects are really nice). the overall presentation of the game is superb....from the menus to the upgrade / crafting screen. it has coop *woot!* missions are fun and varied and i like the crafting system and the loot drop system of the game. only down side is being f2p its an insane grind to get anything. but honestly the core game is solid enough that you can have alot of fun without dropping a dime into it.",1
"warframe is a co-op game with millions of players. its about a race called the tenno who are space ninjas. overall the beginning is quite horrible but the mid through late game is extremely fun and addicting. i hope to see you online welcome tenno.",2
"cant activate my acount i dont know how there is no activation code im waiting a loot for the code for 6 days and no activation code mann i realy like this gameee :(",1
"its truly a fun game there is alot of gryding for the stuff you whunt but i a way it is vary fun and even more enjoyabl with frind the clane system in this game is not like eny other it actoly pays of if youer on a clan have exclusive wepons and warframs at youer disposal",7
"shoot endless waves of aliens and mutated animals, rescue prisoner or just enjoy slashing some dudes into peases. weapon/teno crafting, slight custmozation, upgrades using mod system. playn alone or with friends-your choice. gl playing :p",2
"hi you see this game and see me? well they ate my lolipop ): its a very good game cant stop playing (:",1
"its got ninjas and their cyborgs n . 8/8 fun when theres no fun on another game.",1
"great game but pretty graphic intense. you need a beefy computer if you want to play it with high quality graphics",1
"if you love playing a gun wielding ninja in space with some crazy weapons, youll love this game!",2
"ive been a regular since right after the end of alpha, and ive got to say, these guys are working consistently to create a fun and interesting product. more than a year later and im still hooked, and for a minimal monetary investment on my part.",9
"realy cool game....you must try it if you like being a ninja",1
"too easy, or too simple either way i would not play again.",1
"cant get enough of it, best mmo of all time! with space ninjas!!!!",1
"its amazing you just cant seem to stop playing it xd",1
"very fun game i would recommend this game too a first time pc gamer",1
"super fun when you play with friends or alone with op weapons",1
"really fun game i can highly recommend it. the feel of the game is quite good. theres a nice selection of diffrent types of weapons.",3
"though it is mostly pay to have fun, its got solid foundations as a shooter. just play through in online mode and you can watch your guns and warframe evolve with you and your playing style.",1
"a really enjoyable game.it really is a grindfest but is not that boring,is actually a lot of fun with friends.",1
"this is an amazing game. the only problem i can see is the fact that the missions get really repetitive. otherwise, i would recommend this game to any avid gamers out there looking for a free non-pay-to-win game.",10
"great game! took like maybe 1 minute to figure out the controls and is very fun. the best part is the fact that you are space ninjas!!!!",1
"it looks so freaking awesome but i cant login ? can somone plz help me i have made an account but i cant login :c",1
"awesome game for playing without a good internet connection, it let me play it offline.",1
"not an actual f2p title, its just free to download, pay to play. >mfw level 25 with a walking stick",1
"omg finally they updated this game it so amazing i love it so much i love the company!!",4
"pretty dumb if it says i have to buy it because someone else in my house is playing it. fix this  steam.",1
"its fun but just like most the online competitive free-to-play games here, this one would require some ching-ching for you to win and pls no i wasnt trying to be racist. also, most of the missions would require you to play with more than one person. about the game: i only played briefly as i have the wonderful world of dota 2 right after i downloaded warframe. basically what you are is an alien ninja species that can use guns as well, a species called tenno. the tenno are almost extinct because of a certain faction which i forgot the name. so, what youll do is to team up with other tennos (or you can solo if you buy powerful items using real ching-ching) and defeat the evil faction. there are also some other side missions where you do other stuff idk i havent played yet. keep in mind these: -if youre looking for a free to play game, this is a no-no because youd get bored. -even though my time was brief i enjoyed it and i had money to spare so it probably helped tremendously with my experience. -i didnt try surviving the game without money, so since its free and if you have time id recommend you to at least try it. happy gaming guys.",1
"it is a very fun third person shooter, with a very active dev team that is always working on the next big update and always keeping it fresh and new.",2
"i love how this games controls work and cyborg ninjas are epic",2
"warframe is an excellent example of what a free to play game should be. its not pay to win, though if you find you dont have time to play and grind for what you want just pay with cash. there wont be any cash only items, so for those who dont have the money or prefer to earn it youll be right at home. this sci-fi third person shooter is a great game for anyone to have in their steam library. though this game is 100% more enjoyable with friends rather than playing solo. so stop reading and go embark on your quest in space new fellow tenno!",1
"very fun and action packed, can be a bit repetative at times but still very fun. if you love action and or sci-fi you will love warframe.",1
"farm. farm. farm. 630+ hours in and im still farmin",8
"this is a great game. i would highly recommend it to others!",1
"great game! but... the price for things are little to high!",1
"good co-op experience! , new content almost all the time, time consuming in a good way ! paying will only make you look good, no stat or damage increase in any way ! everything can be unlocked without paying ! well some stuff are for people who have played for a long time. overall, its fun to play, but more fun to play with friends ! ( and girlfriends / boyfriends )",8
"holy space ninjas, this game is pretty great to say the least. you always seem to be in a firefight, plus you get to customize your weapons with mods to make them all powerful. overall, great game i recommend playing this! :)",3
"great game! although many a times dont find groups :( but awesome fun!",1
"this game is really cool and has the most innovating controls ive seen in a while",1
"it is a pretty good game. for a while. i put over 700 hours into the game and for the first while its fun. 700 hours later and the game kinda lost its touch. it has plenty of weapon and warframe options and stuff, but i feel that the missions are all boring now no matter what i do. most of the game follows the same formula: >select warframe >select weapons >select one of the missions youve done 100000 times >complete objective the most exciting thing to do is build a new weapon and warframe but that joy only lasts about five minutes. i still dont have all the weapons but i dont plan on getting them because i find it really boring and unplayable now. i recommend it for the first while but dont expect to keep playing it after youve done every mission.",7
"sliced a guy in half then chopped his head and arms off 100/10",1
"its reaptitive but the point of the game is to unlock new stuff like charcters,weapons,ect.then you hve to rank up and unlock planets by beating the main objectives of the other planets amd so on and there are still the updates which and new stuff so yah practiccally endless",1
"pretty sweet, but pretty complicated as well. tutorial is a great addition. the game is much better if you have a friend or two to play with.",3
"dosnt let me play when i go on to the game is says udates failed all the time can someone help :d",1
"excellent game, very good graphics, nicely optimized, gameplay is quite fun, its not a pvp game as a lot of people might think and though it can be a bit repetitive or a grindfest, still recommend it for everyone to try. its free-to-play anyway. 9/10",2
"dont like the controls that mutch but the rest is awesome.",2
"clocked in over 400 hours. thats over 17 days. ...what happened?",6
"i really enjoy this game. my friends brought it to my attention and i really dont like this genre of game but it really blew me away with how fun, complex and engaging it it. five stars!",3
"if you like fast paced third person shooters like this its your game besides the boring storyline and slow in game currnecy its totally worth it 10/10",1
"so just started to play this game the other day, and i think i may keep going at this.",3
"a fun third person shooter with a lot of dynamic options on how to achieve the mission objectives within missions. the difference between marching down a hallway in nearly invincible armor burning everything in your path or sneaking behind an enemy commander and riddling them with arrows can be achieved by the difference of a warframe and a single weapon. and each unit gets 3 weapon slots per mission (primary ranged weapon, secondary ranged weapon, melee weapon) allowing for many unique capabilities even among the same warframes. and there are hundreds of mods that change damage type and weapon capabilities, making each weapon unique to its owner.",4
"it is a game about being a space ninja not much more to it it is a 3 person shooter with a melee combat system on top best with 3 other friends as it is a coop game. takes a longe time to grind the materials for the weapons and gear or you can buy it for real money can get boring after some time cos it can be a bit repetitive but all in all have had some very fun time with it so yea try it out for free",3
"great game! the only problem i have with this game is theres no story! it would be awesome to have a single player only story, and also have the missions you do in the game, because after awhile these missions do get repetetive and boring. my rating: 7.5/10",1
"this game is really fun for me. you can also play co-op online. so yeah get it",1
"best f2p game so far... everyone should own this!!!",1
"okay lets be honest here. warframe is an excellent free to play game. the graphics are beautiful, gameplay is phenomenal, and the weapons/items differ from those that you would see in other free to play mmos. this is absolutely a must play for gamers who arent looking to pay $40 or $50 on one game",1
"new content every week (almost). third person shooter unlike any ive ever seen. want to reach the top without spending a single cent? definitely possible. beware the rngods, though.",4
"its like a futuristic diablo and borderlands 2 made a third person crack baby",2
"i wish it would work so i could play it!! :/ tried restarting computer, reinstalling, etc. i watched my brother play and was excited to play also.....but now :(",1
"i really enjoy the warframes unique and stealthy mechanics, the many ways you can kill an opponent, the various and unique weapons one could use especially the games mod system. this game starts slow but once you reach a certain level any playstyle will be playable by any player thus there is no one playstyle a player should follow, thus i praise this game for that very aspect. i dislike the fact that most warframes are press to win warframes and would like to see warframes with more mobility based abilities like ninjas would. i give this game a 9/10",8
"just a heads up. this game has about a 100+ hour learning curve, but well worth the effort.",3
"there are few words the can be used to decribe teh game that is called warframe. but i find that awesome space ninjas works quite well! its a great game, and its free to play!",1
"i think that the amount of hours that i have played is a clear recomendation. its f2p so give it a try today!",2
"fun stuff, great time killer in solo, and tons of fun with friends. early missions are a cakewalk, but it definitely has its challenging moments. love how the game evolves with the player.",1
"i think everyone should get this as it as lot of adventure and blood and killing and killer weapons!!!",1
"i love this game, the interface is fun and not too complicated, the game itself keeps me entertained for a long while and when you actually come across other fun players, its even better!",1
"its fun for a time then you get bored(best thing to do when you are board is just stop playing and wait for an update) you eventually come back to the game though",5
"its a nice instanced, co-op shooter. be sure to read the wiki as there isnt alot of explaination about some useful stuff.",1
"very good game i would play it for countless hours if real life didnt barge in.",1
"warning!!!if you download this game you will never see the sunlight again!",1
"digital extreames. you might know the name looking on the back of the startrek game of 2013. they did awful on that, so this has to be the same right? if you think that warframe is the same as startrek, please, download this game to see how wrong you are. startrek had some hype to it. it looked good, but playing was not the same. warframe didnt have much hype when i first downloaded it. it looked too good for my computer, and so after turning down the graphical settings, i finally got to experiance this bliss. im not going to drag on with this one like i do most of my reviews. itll be as quick as it did to make me fall in love with this game. so graphics, ive never seen anything more beautiful. controls are tight, resposive, and swift. map design is ingenious, with corridors and platforms, different goals for ships, and loot a-plenty. pay to win aspect is pretty much not there. its more of you can earn this item but its also avalable for purchase, making handing over money an option rather then a task. the bouncy shoot-n-slash combat is mindblowing, sounds are the best ive heard ever, and over all warframe is something you should download right now. im not one for the whole rating system, but i have to give this a 1010. it is amazing, and whoever is curious to download it, please get a better computer or a ps4 so you can experiance the tubular graphics while playing an off the hizzy game.",1
"well this game is really fun with its parkour, weapons, enemies and daily challenges but it gets boring around the 50-60 hour mark because every map starts to look the same.... but its a free game so go ahead and pick it up for and have fun with it ;p",1
"i liked this game because i got to stare and grope hairy ballsacks and thats just something you dont find in alot of games nowadays, so in conclusion we need more free to plays like warframe, because my ballsack gropeing o meter is almost empty and if it goes to zero i get cancer.",1
"very good game with high end graphics for a low end gaming comphuter. very grinding and events are very fun. gets very very challenging at later points.",2
"and yes . warframe is a good game that only supported a few os but not including windows xp home edition or later . i downloaded warframe in the cyber cafe but it cant run , it displayed ( propably ) > u must run warframe in windows xp , windows xp 3 or later , i hope u guys can change the supporting os and let more people launch happilly . yes im the 1 of the warframe player , but my pc is now under format . so that i play in he cyber cafe .",6
"try warframe its epic you can run on walls the downside that it takes ages to download plus you can select your charecter and you can unlock mods for your player , pistols and guns",1
"warframe is one of the better free-to-play games because it doesnt have a pay to win setup. almost everything in the game can be gotten simply by playing the game except: cosmetic items, temporary boosters, and extra slots to hold more weapons, and warframes in your inventory. it does requires alot of commitment to get to the higher levelled parts of the game, and can be off-putting to some people. starting off can be difficult and is best played with a group of friends to help with fulling a party to make missions easier. joining a clan is recommended in this game because there is alot of content that needs to be researched in a clan dojo before you can make it. the further you get into warframe the better it gets because you get to take part in special events, fight new enemy types and bosses, tryout new gametypes, find rare mods and weapons, and even prime gear.",1
"its a good game , its even better when you joined a friendly and outgoing clan",6
"i like the fact that every item in the game can be aquired threw running keys or bosses it has decent graphics and it is being updated fairly often",9
"a fun free to play game that keeps getting better!",1
"space ninjas, guns, and extremely fun co-op. this is my favorite game i have.",3
"free game to pass the time. basically a pve instance shooter with up to 4 people. kind of restricted unless you spend real money, but you still have access to everything with a bit of a grind.",1
"too much fun i just wish i had a better pc to play it on.",1
"this has a potiental to get amazing, its a free game! how could you rate it? i like the game, although its not the best. its worth the hard drive space. i dont like the games mechanics and code source, i think its javascript instead of python but overall its great",1
"im really sad, because i cant log in my account :(. basically when i donwloaded it, then i registered in warframe website and afterwards when i activated acc, i loged in and started playing it. i played it 2 day,then when i tried towt log in again, i just couldnt, i even tried changing pass few times- didnt work! btw when steam asked to join waframes account with steam economy i declined it all the time. so if somebody knows the problem you would really help me. please help me!!! :d",1
"i know im da scout but dis game is amazing when u dont have a computer dats laggy my computer is soooo laggy dat i hide it from da heavy and soilder!!! i love tf2 cuz im apart of it im the scout :d",1
"cool game and story but most of the feature you have to pay :( ( 3.5/5 )",3
"i like how people that spent 2.000 hours on this game are giving it a thumbs down :d. seriously kids, this is a fun game and you should play it.",3
"i have got 93 hours (so far) of entertainment out of a free to play i presume that makes this a good game",1
"i would recommend this game to anyone who likes to have fun.",6
"awesome game love to play it i just wish i had someone to play with so please download and try it if you like it send a message and we can play",1
"this is an absolutely great game! the part that makes it better is that it is free! this game is basically about space ninjas. you are a tenno and you must help the solar system. during the process you can also upgrade your equipment to make you the ultimate tenno. it also features four player coop which is extremely fun with friends.",6
"the best!!! its getting better after the 13.0 update",1
"the best free-to-play game of the solar system. the graphics is so awesome and i dont even have enabled phys-x for more particles. its online game but it looks like some a-grade game. combat is awesome, all is awesome. im really happy that this game is free to play. really....try for yourself ^^",1
"fun fun fun!!!! this co-op pve fps style game is a must play with terrific graphics with nvidia physx technology and high paced customized combat this game wont die anytime soon. think mass effect combat with co-op play and fully customizable ninja nano-suites ;)",2
"very fun game that feels like it changes each time you play or de (digital extremes) releases an update. this game just sucks up your money, though...oh well.",3
"it is one of those games that you increace your self and your stuff and the levels get more intense with high overpowerd action with third-person shooter games that you could go on a day playing it and never get bored",1
"remove beggars remove beggars you are worst scrubs. you are the scrub idiot you are the scrub smell. return to officil forum and reddot. to our forum cousins you may come our clan. you will live in pending list...ahahahaha,reddit we will never forgeve you. scrub  but   scrub stink beggars shazbot..srub genocide best day of my life. take a bath of dead scrubs.. ahahahahahreddit we will get you!! do not forget moa event .warfram japan we  score on, gook return to your precious china...hahahahaha idiot poor smell so bad. remove beggars from the premises. grineeer alive in warbros, grineeer making praise of warbros.devs=warbros. we are rich and have plat now hahahaha you are poor stink scrub you live in corridor hahahaha, you have no dojo",3
"warframe is a third-person shooter that has you running around missions doing objectives and slicing up or shooting anyone who gets in your way!",3
"great game with a cool/in-depth atmosphere. very immersive, and polished combat/upgrade mechanics. i not really one to care much for the detailed, and probably exeptional plot, but definately worth playing!",1
"this is a must-to-play for anyone who apresiates a action game with beutifull combact mechanics that features aton of weapons from blades,axes,dagers,guns,lazer,launchers,knifes,shotguns and dont forget the best part,ninjas play free :)",7
"i have played ash through much of my time on this game. it has great fast paced gameplay and is definitly challenging. customizations are a little limited if you dont pay for them but regardless custimizations are not necessary. overall great game definitly reccomended",1
"probably the best free-to-play game i played so far. its not an mmo. you just join a battle and play till the end and then over and over again. during first 30 hours of gameplay you realize how many different cool things out there and want to check all of them out. then you play for about 100 hours more enjoying a very dynamic gameplay and trying to finish all the planets. whenever you think youve done probably everything you may find yourself in a situation where youd want to farm a lot of very rare things. ive played for almost 300 hours and i havent yet upgraded even a single weapon or warframe to a perfect state. not to say less this game is really amazing and with frequent updates and changes to mechanics the game becomes even more amazing.",5
"can be fun if you lay with friends but otherwise...well download and see ^_^",1
"warframe is one fast-paced good time! the graphics are phenominal, the gameplay is nearly flawless, with a few bugs here and there (that being understandeable since the game is still in beta), and the multiplayer is exhilerating! 8.5/10",1
"this game is awesome if youve ever wanted to play a space ninja type game then download this now!",1
"when i first started this game, i thought it was pretty awesome. i had a great time running through the missions and just playing with other people. then, i noticed the pay to win feature in later missions. thats probably the only thing i dislike about the game. for example, the first time i played with a player who payed to get a sentinel, his sentinel killed everything and all the rest of us could do was follow him. but, then i realized that even with players like that, the game still maintains a pretty good challenge of trying to out do them and just trying to win. tl;dr: its really really pay to win but still would recommend.",1
"pros: friggin space ninjas, color customizable characters, more warframes than you know what to do with, cons: none",1
"this game is amazing, a third person shooter with amazing graphics...and the fact that it is a f2p, just amazing 10/10",1
"probably one of the best games i have ever played. didnt think i would like it but just how smooth it runs and how fun it is just won me over. 10/10 would recomend.",1
"excellent 3rd person shooter, 100% free yet not pay-to-win. fun coop.",3
"holy  it has robots, what other reason is there needed to play it! just ing look that robot has a kick- sword, what the  else do you need in a game? i get rock hard just thinking about it",5
"this game is, by far, one of my favorites. the biggest reason? its not pay to win. all the best stuff, you have to make. well, that and its totally kickass.",9
"its very fun being all silent and shiz and even more fun with friends",1
"cool, i like the swords so i can go slashy slashy.",1
"this game is amazing!!!! (and that all there is to say",1
"this is the most time ive spent on a free to play game. it is more fun than it has any right to be. it is phantasy assassins bordercell 5 and it kicks all of the asses. play this game with me and everyone you know.",1
"its a good game, apart from theres no teamwork, everyone just runs around trying to come 1st. no one actully works as as team but still, good game :d",1
"the game links parkour to third person shooting with an amazing lore. the game provides different wepons and the variety of skills is what makes it specials, different moves and finishes can be done in many different way.the game also provides the alternative ways of gameplay.either you play stealthy or go in blasting your rifle into enemies face.the game is really fun and you can hardly get bored from the gameplay i would surely rate this (8.8/10)",1
"its an amazing game and its free so theres no reason why you shouldent get is right now.",6
"great game! the gunplay is top notch and the leveling system makes this a really good time sink.",3
"warframe is a third person action co-op game. it provides a wide variety of warframes, weapons and other customisation. if you like being a futuristic ninja, this a game that is suitable for you :)",1
"this is a fun game that you can play with your friends. i havent seen a game in a while like this. its so addictive and fun.",2
"pretty nice game consindiring its is free godd graphics",1
"to be honest this game is like rengoku if you know that game",1
"insanely fun, simple and yet, challenging. there are bugs here and theyre but mostly minor things. my one complaint is that the game looks fantastic except in the jungles. its like they lost interest and said heck with it, that or they hired a team that only has experience with making metalic props. but the game itself id give five stars, bravo, bravo.",1
"if you love third person ninja shoot-em-ups, then this free title is for you. it boasts amazing graphics and latest features while keeping the requirements at a decent medium. the variety of characters and weapons give this game much color and room to master. i recommend this to all of you, just for its mere size of ~2gb.",1
"very good game. fun to play with your friends and can sometimes get challenging",1
"nice game, atmospheric scenes while playing, even though it is and online 3ps.",1
"neeed help can login to dis game really want to play this game :(",1
"the diffuclty of obtaining everything is the only downside to the game. other than that, its amazing!",2
"it is a nice game! trust me this is all im gonna say",1
"my favorite game and still playing since closed beta. the bio-armors (or frames) have a great design as the entire game. the combat style is real fast and gives you a large edge for tactics and customization. updates are made in a fair schedule. the veredisct is: awesome.",5
"youre a space ninja that kills anything that moves just for crafting materials. 10/10",2
"warframe delivers a wide variety of unique quests and some secret rooms and the rank up building new weapons , warframes lets get started: cons: - building takes alot of time between 12 - 24 hours! - if you reached rank 10 youll feel bored cause you wont unlock anything - argon crystal is a very rare item can be found in void only - if you want to build more warframes you need to buy slot with platinumand so with the weapons pros: + unique f2p + many kinds of warframes + void and bosses give you a pretty good challenge especially t iv + no payment walls rating: 7.9 / 10 (since it stills on beta the review and rating may change)",3
"im not sure what it is but this game sucks you in and there is no known way getting away from it.",1
"a fantastic rpg like tps with a good elements and the stealth is great but not alot of players see it as is a great way to clear stages and most classes are great and the co op is good but tip of mine the nyx is the hardest becouse your team can kill your cantroled unit so i saw rarely glitches but its great 8/10",3
"its an amazing third person shooter. it has missions you can play with friends, quests, and even parkour! the amazing part is that its almost lag free!",1
"warframe is really fun because i really love third person games",1
"pretting fun and intence multiplayer co-op game. lots of content for a free to play, little bit of a learning curve but once you get the hang of it its pretty fun.",1
"great fun - unfortunately a bit costly if you want stronger weapons! (taking in account r1 = $10+)",2
"this game has more martial arts and grinding than jackie chan and jay-z running a nightclub falling  over teakettle on acid",4
"well, to start of, this is a free to play game, so you can expect that you have 2 ways to earn your things... you either pay or work hard for it. the gameplay itself its great, and sometimes very team based. i dont understand the push to talk system because, when your playing with a bunch of people its hard to tell who is talking.",1
"but they need a mac version too because i just got a new mac and would love to play it on my own computer",1
"insanely fun. really graphically intensive though. i suggest turning your graphics settings in the game to the lowest setting.",2
"this game is awesome, and its free. really, its free! you can get almost everything. all warframes, weapons, etc. (excluding new colours, some customization stuff) can be crafted.",3
"great game, even if it does feel grindy sometimes. it is great fun to be had, especially if you are a part of a good clan",1
"youre a ninja and you kickass, all you need to know.",2
"i recommend this game with full intensity, and great great great graphics (that i cant run)",3
"good game but gets boring after you half way through the game its basicly a grind",2
"i my self must say this is a game that is amazing it may not seem like it but ive seen this game evolve in to what it is now and it has become something that i would say is one of the best free to plays out there.",2
"very good game. u can get all by spamming a chat and sell stuff for plat (boring like hell) it have a  24h wait for lvl up mission that is.. . just that, . :)",4
"another recommendation that took me far too long to write, warframe. like ive said before, and ill say it again, you can never go wrong with free, especially not when its got the amount of polish that warframe has. space ninjas, put plain and simple; with fast-paced action, some little puzzles here and there, and relatively bug-free overall. crafting systems are quite rewarding, and a clan system thats actually beneficial in some way rather than the traditional nametag added to your username. threatening bosses, procedural levels, and randomized obectives oh my! warframe, is the , that is all ladies and gentlemen, good evening. 8.5/10",6
"best game multiplayer and solo game .... yes good game i louve it..",1
"now that ive added this on steam id like to say that ive been with warframe since early closed beta and its been nothing but a joy to watch this game grow to what it is and what it will be. if someone told me 5 years ago this type of game would be ftp i wouldnt have believed them. warframe is like mass effect 3s multiplayer on speed, and the beta aspect of the game means that its constantly adding new things and getting better. just when you start to get tired of it, it implements new assets, features, gameplay mechanics etc., thanks to an incredible development crew behind it, who regurarly interact with the community.",4
"while not necessary your average mmorpg, warframe certaintly carries a unique perspective in its leveling-up systems, looting and customization (not to mention being very addictive) while slicing and shooting down enemies cooperatively with friends or amongst a variety of other players online. warframe definatley is a game that stands out from others like it and is definatley well worth the price.",1
"this is a amazinging game!!!! it says ninjas play free, and everyone kick . honestly this game will keep you entertained for ages. it is worth the wait, everyone should get it!!",4
"this game is a little hard to get into at first but once you do its really fun.",1
"very tight combat, decent lore, fast gameplay, clan wars and events. pretty good considering the game isnt finished yet. i know what ill be wasting my life with.",1
"fun to play. nice game play and story too! nice customizations, but i wish there would be more items we could buy with the common ingame golds.",1
">ninjas >space >lazer >boom >magic > >more magic 11/10 got explosions",5
"great game. allows you to get the full benefit of all upgrades without having to actually buy anything else with real money, its just slower. all information for parts online, super easy if youre looking to get a specific warframe. this is a good choice.",3
"pretty damn awesome game. the first game that made me a pc gamer.",5
"a pretty neat game, though the coolest weapons require an investment. you dont have to spend any money on the game, but remember this: a grindable item is only free if your time has no value. budget accordingly.",1
"pretty boring after a while. becomes a bit of a grindfest.",1
"this is the best game i have ever played while its in beta! its fun and its got good graphics. at some points its hard and challenging but that means that you have to bulk up! plus its free! whats not to like?",1
"alright so heres the deal as far as 3rd person multiplayer online shooters goes this is one of the best games ive ever played, and i was worried itd be pay to win, but more or less there is a point where it is pay to progress, however with incentives like log in bonus which can provide up to 75% off their in game currency spending $10-20 bucks really gets you far and gets you quite a bit. i normally dont like games where you have to pay to progress, but $25 bucks for a game that has given me 400+ hours of play isnt half bad. it may not be everyones cup of tea, but its f2p, give it a try.",4
"never liked this game just could never see the point in it",1
"yeah, yeah, cool game ... it took 450 hours of my life ( not played it on steam from the beginning ) ...",1
"pure badass really fast paced game not that easy the game is mostly about your a ninja and...in space..cant be more epic lol well you get deployed toward spaceships and planets many game mods i strongly recomend this game",1
"one of the best f2p games out there, there is a vast variety of classes that you can play as and hundreds of weapons. may be bad in the beginning, but once you get your hands on your first good weapon, whether it be the braton or strun, its a great game. 11/10",7
"lotta fun, sweet graphics, and i love how you can build all the different characters from in game collectables. not just pay to win either",1
"great game but i have many problems with crashing. i would recomend this game if it didnt crash so much.",1
"fast paced, just what you might ask for in a 3rd person shooter, i enjoy it as i play it on ps4 and pc",1
"this game absolutely amazing and extremely addicting! the graphics are awesome; the gameplay is fluid, and i, personally, experience very little lag, even though my computer is not that great and lags on most games i play or try to play. the character customization is also very good, even if you dont have any money since some extra colors are available to you for free. and, if you do have the money, the possibilites are nearly endless from changing what type of warframe you use to what body type it has to the decorative armor pieces that it wears, and the various color palletes give a vast aray of possible color combinations. the only thing id even think to complain about is how the maps tend to repeat, but, at the same time, i like how the maps are generated randomly from a specific set of rooms each time a mission is started, preventing the entire map for a mission being the same multiple times in a row. there are a couple glitches i have come across, though, but glitches are to be expected in pretty much any game, and the ones ive seen are nothing that really ruin the games fun and excitement. theres also that fact that there is no pvp, except in clan dojos, but that is so easy to overlook with how exciting everything else is. overall, this could perhaps be one of the best games, if not the best game, i have ever played. it is definitely worth the download, and you really have nothing to lose if you happen to not like it.",1
"this game is wonderfully made. i like the game because its fun, its easy to pick up on, easy to use, and you can make a clan, and take over!",3
"its taking my soul away. great game! getting more equip for your warframes has never been so rewarding. getting new characters maxing them out is pretty fun nor get boring. heads up! the first few levels will seem like a drag, but it does get better.",2
"very fun and so many things to discover but one things is the mission is too same",1
"really addictive game if your in too balanced grinding games. probably the best free to play game out on the market, with no doubt!",5
"this graphic on this game is great the co-op sectiion is really great you get to fight against monsters with friends.",1
"if this was a moba but with only the melee damn son but its still good and fun with friends (wich i dont have :| )",1
"the game is really cool! anyone with a lot of platnium can just be so op, and that is a good thing! you dont fight with others, rather just go through a stage with four of your friends or other people... the graphics is amazing and compared to blr, one of my favorite games, i got to say it is better! there are some flaws as in the sneaking mechanics, you are a ninja, you cant just assassinate or rather just pass through guards like a ninja? overall, i think this game derserves a good recommendation!",1
"its a pretty good game, its smooth, yet you can get lost easily, it has alot going for it in the player clan department like designing your own dojo is nice. ever sense i first started in update 3, so much has changed, its harder, and confusing. but easy to get the hang of, i reccomend using a controller to play this game. only flaw i truly see with this game is the fact it takes forever to build any of the gear in this game",1
"one of the best f2p games out there. easily get 400+ hours of entertainment.",8
"i can shoot my bow into a crowd of enemies and they all explode. 10/10 would do it again.",1
"6/10 certainly not the best game i have ever played. i played for a few hours and got bored. the missions tend to repeat themselves. it is a pay to win game. and the combat is somewhat confusing. i run in to battle with my rifle and i cant see anything beacause there are just fire and lightning bolts flying accross my screen. i cant level up beacause everyone killsteals. and if i play alone i am underlevel. so im forced to play for hours on the same mission just so i can level up a bit. there are a few mechanics and features in this game that i do find entertaining and fun. i love sci-fi games. but i just found this game a little off. im shure this comment will be outdated by the time anyone reads this. chances are they fixed the things im complaining about. this game has a bit of a learning curve and it doesent explain the lore very well. the game itself is quite the vicious cycle, and to get out of the cycle you need to pay money. real money. i know many games have shops (tf2) where you can buy cosmetics and weapons, but this game causes players just to become pay to wins. giving this game a try was a bit of a waste of time for me to be honest. apologies if i cause controversy.",1
"mlg space ninja parkour with absolutely no storyline and every mission is the same exact thing. 4/20",4
"awesome game first time playing it and i love it i reccomend this game to anyone who loves sifis and all that amazing stuff good job on making the game",1
"this game has dynamic movement controls allowing for fast paced game play or fast silent gameplay. the characters are adaptable to different play styles of first person shooter with a side arm, or swordplay. the third person view keeps you locked into the sci-fi setting by allowing you to see your warframe kick . it has the option to play solo, exclusively with friends, or online with a public lobby for each mission. drop-in games are usually successful and team work is commonplace. overall this game is a refreshing change to your first person shooter sci-fi action games. the storyline is interesting, and although i wont go into to detail, there could be more interaction. this is not an rpg, this is a mission oriented team play third person shooter. weapons are able to be modded for better efficiency, though it would be nice to see those mods change the physical appearance. a downside i have found is the difficulty to gain special currency for new warframes, and new gear. fantastic game, addictive as well - my husband now plays the game with me after only watching me play.",1
"ive tried to play, but the game keeps freezing in the launcher... ive tried downloading it straight from the website, and it gave an error login failed. check your info. i tried making a new account, deleting the certificates and re-installing them, all the known fixes, but to no avail. i am downloading it now, off steam again, and hopefully it wont freeze at the launcher.",1
"its a free, parkouring, 3rd person shooter (also has katanas). nough said!",1
"this game is a lot of fun. you get to go around to different planets as a robot(cyborg?) ninja and ninja many enemies to death. it is free to play, so no risk for you to give it a try. they did something very peculiar with the cash shop however. the punishment for earning new robot suits in the game versus buying them with real-world money is death. bear with me as i explain. there are two methods to get new robot suits(the standard issue ones anyways). 1) someone pays real-world cash for them. you or someone you traded your items too for platnium(the cash shop currency) laid down some money so you can get that shiney new warframe(robot suit). 2) you farmed the pieces in the game itself and then crafted the warframe. so you invested your time and the game makers did not get paid. at this point, everything is still on the up and up. however, what i didnt mention is this: if you employ method 2, you will most likely recieve a stalkers mark and the game will send a super-powerful npc to invade your game and kill you, which removes the mark. in summary... if you played the game to get new suits instead of just buying them with real money, expect to be punished by being ganked by the games cash shop enforcer. p.s. i still recommend playing this.",5
"its a fun team based game like left 4 dead but wit rpg eliments. its a third person shooter with parkor.",5
"to tell you the truth i cannot stand this game. like i see people saying its the best game ever and how its a landmark in free to play games. but all it does is just rehash all that is wrong in the genre. first off i will admit the game is ing pretty. the reflections and lighting especialy. but the gameplay feels bland and asks way to much from the player. some of the more advanced manuvers are just ridiculous. try pressing the control key while holding shift. and i hate games like this that dont scale the difficulty properly for single-player. i mean if i have no freinds dont penalize me. overall the game is just grindy. like its the whole point of the game. the idea of mastery levels are explained terribly. but hey if you like grinding one level over and over to get a certain material go ahead.",1
"this game has awesome graphics. the combat system is a bit confusing, but is (simply saying) another fps game. however, the third person is a bit frustrating, i would love to see an option to change view modes from third to first person.",1
"this game was awesome and its graphics are amazing and the gameplay is cool too",1
"i reccommend this game but i have one problem, these updates take way to damn long",1
"space ninjas with guns + coop + fps + leveling stuff = additive good time.",6
"i downloaded this game after seeing people talk about it on videos of the destiny alpha. i dont normally care for f2p games but this one is awesome!!! im addicted.lol",1
"this game is really fun and no item is overpowered and i enjoy myself it takes patience to collect all the resources you need to collect for what you need",2
"the combat and movement of this game is amazingly complex, detailed & fun. however, i dont recommend coming into this game without watching some begginer youtube videos, the tutorial system is no where near informant enough to explain this game. great game, 8/10",1
"its free you fools! its kinda pay-to-win, but your weapons do get more op as you use them. it has hours of content, and after that, more content. enjoy beating this one, folks.",1
"this game is basically trying to make yourself a better player in the game. its pratically a pve game. it can get repetative but i believe you would not focus on that being so at all.",4
"very fun and highly addicting. worth spending money into.",3
"warframe is unique. it is unique because all of the weapons and warframes are craftable and easy to obtain. most free-to-play games these days are pretty much pay to win and people who pay have an advantage over the people who dont pay. the game offers hours of fun and the satisfaction of building a new warframe is unbeatable. the enemy ai is alright and does have 1-2 bugs or glitches every so often. the wide range of guns and warframes offer more fun and playstyles to the game, be it charging head first into battle, taking a stealthy approach or using the op paris prime or synapse to decimate your foes. each warframe offers unique abilities such as absorbing damage and being nearly invincible while using the rhino, or using nova to completely kill everything in your path with her antimatter abilities. overall, the game is very fun and players are always willing to help you out, but with the ability of being a bit repetitive and sometimes boring with an op setup. i give this game 8/10. this game deserves a reccomendation.",2
"so hard to be good but its super fun and happy new year!",1
"fast paced, fun, shootem up with tcg like modifications for everything. great game!",4
"nice looking, frequent updates, a large assortment of weapons, and includes a trading system that allows being able to buy p2p items without actually using money. great game.",6
"were do i start.. oh i know the basics of the game are 1. what u can expect from the characters tanks 2 ninjas 2 squishy to many to count but if player right and modded right arent. guns if enough to get you through the game with a new one when you want 2. primes (rare better versions of things) they can make the game easy and make some bad weapons better or guns like hte op soma more op. 3. fun factore all in all a great game most people are off put by the fact its 3rd person but the game wouldnt be the same without it. final rating- 9/10",4
"i have to say, im a giant fan of warframe, sure there is a few glitches, but over al the gameplay is fantastic. the new updates have made it even simplier than before and is now extremely fun, easy and addicting. i highly recomend warframe. so what you waiting for? download warframe right now!",2
"never play the game because it always updating. after download the client i play the game and asking for update, its arround 596mb (from game launcher). and than im waiting to finish update. after that. its updating (again, from steam) arround 5.8gb, i update it. and ask update again 596mb. this is",1
"i cant even explain how much i love this game. it just doesnt get boring with all the different gear you can use and tasks you can do. if you like hack n slash / 3rd person shooters, this game is for you",8
"dont let the metascore fool you. its an amzing game with great gameplay. best of all its free! what do you got to lose?",1
"this game is alot of fun so far! my favorite free game so far, if you love being a ninja then you need to play this now! its like if deadspace and ninja gaiden were to have a baby this would be it! doctermax",1
"do i have to make things more clear? ninjas, super powers, swords and rocket launchers am i clear? get this... its free!!",4
"only played a few hours worth at this time of writing, but ive already learned that the community doesnt like new players. i spawned into a game earlier and promptly got cursed out for being new and being the kind of players that are holding back this game. the brief intro gives you the basic controls, but whenever you ask for more info ingame, you quickly get flak for it. overall a very fun game. im sticking to solo and youtube videos until i dont have to ask questions anymore. new players be warned.",4
"ninjas in space. granted, theres an assemble the component, and the blueprint, and then the blueprint for the finished object (in the case of a warframe), but for a f2p, its fun.",3
"not one of the best games out there but by far certainly not the worst. can be vey addicting if you get into in and farm up the credits. platnium speeds up the rate of which you obtain things but isnt required to enjoy the game.",8
"i have sunk far too much time into this game. far too much time. that being said, this game is quite fun, especially when you and your buddies discover how breakdance fighting works. nothing beats a good old fashioned breakdance fight tournement. lots of waiting and grind walls to be found here, but as far as fun goes, this game has it. i give it an 8.75 out of ten over, but for fun, i give it a tenno/ten. also, it is more likely than not the grineer.",7
"amazing game, a little bit of a grind though, but thats what makes it fun for me, just waiting to get the frame or weapon is pretty exciting to me. then comes he combat system. oh boy, i just love it, and especially he idea of different types of melee weapons. overall, one of the best games ive played. *note* for ninjas only ;)",1
"this is awesome co-op action! with a lot of in-depth customization, this games has been making me keep playing it for hours upon hours.",1
"great sci fi realistic game with action and adventure",1
"i have played this game day after day and love it. it is not a pay to play game its more egded towards pay to look good and speed up to be more efficient. 10/10 to play and i still play most days since i started in august last year.",7
"the best ftp game out atm. if you like 3rd person shooters then deff download this and give it a try.",3
"one of the best free to play fps games with a mix of cool skills and features.",2
"this game is great. i just hope it stays free to play and somehow explains the link bewteen dark sector and warframe",1
"after hardcore drilling this game with a few friends gets old fast.... 7/10",2
"fun, free to play, looks good. not much more is needed for a good game and this one has whatever is left.",1
"if you like multipler co-op games like mass effect 3s multiplayer or gears of wars horde mode, then youll like this. not to mention its free to play!",1
"space ninjas, hardcore space parkour, golden loots, and all sorts of farming. is also inextricably linked to dark sector (claimed by de themselves) if that interests you any.",7
"theres really nothing much you can lose by trying this game out. its f2p with a cash shop and if you dont like it, your not out any money. its definetly fun to play with friends and offers a good challenge as you progress in the game. there are a ton of levels and you can really choose how you want to play the game. one downside of the game is that it is all instances, which can get old. if your looking for a fun game to spend a few hours on when your bored of other games, this game will keep you occupied and provides enough to do that will keep you coming back. another downside to the game is the cash shop. a lot of the cooler stuff you need to spend real money. also, the amount of warframes that are free to try are very limited. if you want some of the more unique warframes, youll have to dish out the dough. with that said, id say the game is worth a try. 7.8/10 in my book!",1
"this is a great game to play with friends co-op i like the way you can pretty much play the game in your own style but complete the same objective as your friend for example your friend can go trigger happy but you can go stealth and hide in the shadows",1
"absolutly a game that needs to be tested. its free and very well made. it doesnt cost anything, so why not try it out??",1
"after days of playing this i can guarantee the fun that is in store for you. the learning curve on this is very linear and you feel the progress with every level you play. i definitely recommend this game!",1
"10/10 this game is my favorite free-to-play game, and it doesnt take much to get into it.",1
"if you like being a super powered ninja then this is the game for you! it features super suits that allow you to bend the elements (or the enemy) to your control, and gives you the ability to perform amazing stunts (like slash through 10 monsters at once). the only problem i can see is the time it takes out of your day to gain new items.",5
"great game, highly addictive, and still constantly evolving",10
"what can i say about this well it is fun dont get me wrong but at times it can feel like a big grind fest and at others it gets repeative but once you get past that this game opens up to a whole new world of fun with constant updates and the devs keeping hotfixes and things i recomend this to anyone that wants a new experence",3
"gravedigger fagus said it best: its a game about space ninjas destroying space nazis and futuristic ea representatives. i dont think i need to say any more here. you cant leave out the mutant zombie versions of said nazis and ea reps. its like this, you and your crew infiltrate ships and bases on various planets and   up (and thats just with the weapons)! when everything is done, your team rolls out like nothing happened. space nazis, what space nazis? exactly. seriously though, the game is extremely fun. you get your choice of primary, secondary and melee weapons, per loadout, from an assortment of weapons from each faction (with an option to go melee only). there are several warframes to choose from, each with unique abilities. you can customize the colors for pretty much everything! you aquire mods to make your weapons and warframes more powerful. you can have up to 3 different mod loadouts and color schemes for everything. practically every weapon and warframe can be attained through crafting. the game is updated fairly frequently, and most importantly, its free! so if youre like me and enjoy shooters, co-op, hack and slash, love ninjas and are flat broke, this is the game for you!",8
"you havent installed this yet?well then you arent a ninja!",1
"great game, especially for the ps4. it has great movment and the combat flows perfectly",1
"ninjas + space = space ninjas f**k yer! 10/10 best free game ever!",1
"good game, though ranking up is a bit of a hump to get over, considering you can do it once every 24 hours. still a nice game; one of the few shooters that i actually enjoy playing.",1
"badass characters and attacks, looks great graphics wise plenty of content to entertain for hours yes fun for a while, but takes way too much real money to progress your character at all. 75% of every game is a strait connection nightmare.",1
"yeah its alright, havent played that much of it :)",4
"i loved this game at first sight, now i finally have a pc that can run it. whatever you make must be crafted and bought. on top of that, you have to wait days for it. also, you have to wait a day to level after you get enough affinity, as you can probably tell im sick of waiting.its kind of a pay-to-have-fun-solo game, solo. this game is a blast and i kind of want to pay for dlc, while its on sale, regular prices are inane. download iiiiiiiiiiiiiiitttttttttttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!plz ;d",1
"probably the best free to play game out there, great fun and lots of content to keep the game original and make you want to come back for more. remember, ninjas play free, so download this game now",3
"if you take the time to build wps and other stuff you will enjoy this game. wont cost you money unless you wont to get things faster thats all money dose for ya.",5
"this game looks so amazing, my pc cannot even handle it #2gud4me",1
"play this game for 20 f*cking minutes and i insure youll enjoy it, and sh*t your pants because motion blur is murdurous",6
"can be a cit repetitive at times, but slicing a grineer in half is always satisfying.",1
"this game is the best game i ever played. almost every week theres new weapons! i got adicted to this game once i played it.",2
"cool shooting co-op game with bunch of items to be craft. totally like it b^.^d",3
"super space ninja shooting power skills. nice game.",5
"although heavily grind focused and lacking diverse content, the gameplay mechanics here are smooth and well designed. give it a try, its free to play and rewarding if youre looking for a co-op 3rd person shooter.",8
"amazing game for free. only hope is that they improve pvp.",1
"pros: -fun coop gameplay -gorgeous graphics -a wide variety of warframes and weapons to unlock -regular content update cons: -i personally dont like how the warframes,weapons etc unlocked.you need to collect resources from doing missions and buy blueprints to build warframes,weapons etc.some requires you to join a clan,researched it first before u can build them -the game feels like grinding to some people -it has some inventory restrictions,u can only have 2 warframes unless u spend ur platinum to unlock more warframe slots overall: warframe is a nice game.who doesnt like to play as space ninja fighting s(i hate those enemies after knowing their lore)with friends? 8/10",1
"warframe is a very good game. you could make all of the warframes characters without speding any real money. the mission are not the same, there are all different. ninga kicks and flying kicks are cool in this game. there are lots of weapons and melle weapons to choose from which is cool.",2
"awesome teamwork based game. youre basically space ninjas going around doing flips and cutting people in half. amazing customization with tons of weapons and classes (not to mention the colors). get to extraction!!!!",1
"awesome game play, and great fun online with friends.",4
"it is just plain awesome! lol... sorry im bad at making things like these.... >.<",1
"do you like grinding in a game that is fun to play but still alot of grinding? then get the game and try it out. do you hate grinding? then dont get this game. thats all you need to know to see if you will like it.",10
"this game... whew, where do i begin? i shall start with the technical elements. the graphics (on my 1920 x 1080 hd screen) are smooth and flawless. i have yet to see a graphical error, and i see these in almost every game. this game is one of the few truly free-to-play games on the market. all it takes is patience, friends, a plan, and an understanding of the concept of bugeting resources. it has one of the kindest playerbases i have ever had the pleasure of encountering, people who will let you jump right in to their tower iv defense and only give you a little crap for being a level 6 loki prime. this game is an unforgettable experience, with a storyline that i can only call epic, genius original ideas for most aspects of the game, and parkour system that flows so smoothly that i still cannot believe functions as well as it does. its a game for people who dont want to spend a dime, as well as one who loves to pump money ito videogames. the grinding can be frustrating and tedious, and some missions seem unnessecarily difficult, but with a group of friends and a little bit of time, these things cease to exist. in this game, you strive to build your own weapons and warframes, and though it takes longer, i have to say, its damn satisfying. 10/10. get in here, tenno. we need you.",1
"this game is pretty great. i enjoy the gameplay. it is a little difficult most of the time to solo missions although they start to get easier after progressing through some of the levels. i like the weapon/pet aspect. overall a very fun endless game. that is unless you spend a lot of money on platinum which then its probably pretty easy.",3
"great graphics, tons of weapons, suits, and companions, hundreds of missions; all for free. the vast majority of the in-game content can be accessed just by playing, but you can spend real money to speed things up or buy aesthetic upgrades. 10/10, will ruin your life.",3
"the game is great more better its free to play.. there are a lot great stuff, like mele combat shooting stile.. but there is something negative about it---the farming, you need a lot of timr to get what you need",3
"love it nomal play on steam but love game nu less it fast in your face fun",3
"it will make your  larger... yes, even if you are a girl.",3
"great game free to play! explore worlds, make new weapon and destroy a lot of enemies with your abilities! ninjas!!!! 10/10",5
"this game is very much a grindfest but as a free to play game its very fun and well worth the download.",2
"one of the best f2p games ive played so far. an excelent community and a really addictive game that despite being f2p is not pay to win! deffinitely a must-play! :)",3
"best free game i have ever played. if you put money into it thow, make sure you know how to spend it becasue this game has some very good ways of spending its currencys and some very very bad ways to spend its currencys",2
"awesome free game, became addicted way faster than i would like to admit",4
"okay, so barring the fact that this game is about being a wall-running, parkour-ing, shooty slicey backflippy freaking space ninja, lets look at what else makes it good. its free (beta). play however you want and still be able to succeed and have fun. its free. space ninjas! space ninja simulator 2014. score = yes/10",2
"pretty impressive for still being in beta, smooth gameplay in coop. excellent overall a must play for sure.",1
"like the game itself, upgrades seem to come slow, and alot of the people i meet through match making seem to either be rude or..very.......suicidal, but the game itself is very good, graphics, controls, story, concept gameplay all great",1
"running down one corridor 10 billion times never felt so good, most innovative corridor design of all time 10/10.",1
"i give a thumbs up for a free to play game still bugs but very fun",6
"endless enjoyment. theres so much that you can do in warframe, so many ways to costumize your play style, and there are always new weapons to master - not just in rank, but in unique skills needed to use them effectively. at points it tends to grind, and being part of a clan opens up a lot of the game thats otherwise locked away, but this is one free to pay that is definitely worth the time, and even a bit of scratch if you can get into it. space-ninja-robot-assassins forever!",2
"good for a free to play game with lots of depth and items that takes time and effort to acquire but it seems that the developers were low on resources due to frequently re-used areas so it can become fairly boring after too long.",1
"this game is very fun for me to play though the only drawback here is the ridicilous amount of farming you to to get all the blueprints and components of that one warframe or kurbow also the gameplay gets kind of repetedive eg.kill stuff,get parts,kil stuff,unlock planets,kill stuff get mastery,kill stuff,create a clan,kill stuff,advertise.advertise,advertise,advertise,kill stuff,build archwing,kill stuff in space.see where im going?also did i mention killing stuff? 8.5/10",1
"space ninjas with machine guns and parkour....need i say more. oh right! and now there is a flying during some missions. this game is soo much fun, it is the only free to play game that i have played that is not pay to win. you can have the best stuff in the game with out paying. i personally put money into this game because i wanted the shiney toys faster but i also crafted around 80% of my high end gear with out paying real money. that being said the game is amazing! it is the only game of its kind in my opinion very uniquie and it has kept my attention for over a year. most games get like 3 months at the most from me i have been playing this one since release",3
"would definitely recommend this game. fun to play with other people",1
"this game is awesome! after selling my xbox 360 and jumping onto the pc train, i was looking for a game that was similar to a game just recently released, destiny. like destiny, warframe has a system of co-op missions with a jump in/out style. i really like the storyline of this game so far, but im still a pretty low level. its got just enough challenge to keep me going. the only gripe i have with this game is the lack of gamepad support for the menus. the game feels right playing from my couch with my xbox 360 pad, but when i need to grab my mouse just for navigating through menus, it kind of breaks up the gameplay for me. i know the game is on ps4 and xbox one, and that it already works with the gamepad on those systems, so what is stopping it from working on pc? anyway, the game is great. the mechanics work, there are plenty of guns and weapons to suit anyones play style. congratulations digital extremes, you made a very solid f2p game. i look forward to playing it more countless hours to come.",1
"ninjas leaping around shooting and slashing everything that moves, whats not to like about that?!",3
"definitely one of the coolest games ive played online. worth a shot, if you like lots of action. :)",1
"sucn an amazing game, ive sunk over 100 hours on this game xd",9
"1st one hour i was hooked the combat and parkour is just amazing.",1
"nice, fun game. full of nice gameplay. cant really own more than one warframe without paying with real money d:",4
"pretty fun game. i play on max settings with 60fps constantly (my gpu is a radeon 270, so i play most games at max settings anyways).",1
"i am sam fisher. this game sucks jelly bean ballz. every map is almost the same because every object is same in the map and to many sfx. bunch of weapons and stuff that needs real money is standing there for lazy  reason. i do not recommend a game if your a eye killing type of human being. lag server lag i do not recomend a game for anyone this game should be thrown out and deleted.",1
"this games is a boss third person shooter. you are essentially a space ninja with guns. its free to play and one of the best free games ive ever played.",4
"i cant even explain words of how awesome this is!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"si-fi style shooter, i have never been that into si-fi type games before, but it was free and it turned out to be okay, 6/10",1
"this is a unique free game that is worth trying out. after all, its free!",1
"now if your like me and saw the trailer, you think this is a melee base game, but its so mcuh more than that. this is a game that puts parkor and fps in the same world. this game seems to run fine on my computer(i have all settings down, but it still loks good to me) and this game can be played with friends, and i think there is even a versus mode that i havent tried yet, but i will soon. the game has its own crafting system where you can but a bluprint or find one, and gather materials after you beat a level. certain planets have certain materials for crafting, it does take time and in-game money to create the items but it could be worth it in the long run(not to me though) and if you get a bluprint you dont want, you can sell it. and there are these things called mods that modify your guns, melee weapon, armor, and sentinel(whatever that is) and every tanno(i think thats what theyre called) have special abilities, and recently a new update ocurred, it added three new weapons and i think more warframes(your armor/character) but at this point im taking too much of your time, this game is free and good looking, just try it out and see how you feel.",1
"one of the best f2p games ever created. diverse and in-depth gameplay and storyline, amazing graphics, frequent new content, terrific devs and playerbase. a must have and must play!",8
"its a great game, but the only thing that sucks is that you cant earn all the characters for free.",1
"beautiful game with fluid fighting style only problem is that it gets boring without friends to play with",1
"this game is so nice.my favorite time is when i slice them on a part!",1
"great game, great mechanics, but there is one problem.... the leveling up system is .... sometimes it takes so much time to get something.... i tolerate grinding... most of the time, but when i play this game, im kinda stressed, but still, u can get everything.... i mean everything in this game (except the cosmetic stuff) just by playing the game, though it takes time, u can speed it up by buying parts or blueprints with real money. so yeah, thats my review, the game is still fun though.. if u cant stand the grind, then this game is not ur cup of tea",1
"space ninjaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!",9
"interesting, good graphics but blur is very trippy. recomended.",1
"this game is amazing! the graphics are fantastic, and you play as an outer space ninja with guns and swords. what more could someone want in a game!",2
"warframe allows you to select from one of many warframes to fight as, with mods and stances to enhance your weapons, warframe, and sentinels. plus there is a lot of customization available; however, if you want to customize, you will have to use platinum for most things like colors and armor, which means you have to fork over real money. it is free to play if you are happy with just a couple of warframes, but youll be too addicted and have to puchase additional warframe slots and weapon slots and this means real money. i still highly recommend this game. it has a bit of a learning curve, but once you get onto it, it becomes easy to understand. plus the community is a great aspect, there are in-game chat rooms for region (general chat in your geographic region), recruiting (where you can join other games or recruit for your clan), and trading (which allows users to buy, sell, or trade items). and the developers host numerous interactive events like primetime which puts two of the developers in a mission with real life players and other watch the feed on twitch, and the devstream which features several of the developers talking about the game and upcoming changes. both allow users to submit questions and win free platinum.",7
"levels are boring and uninspired. rehashing the same grey/brown levels (kinda) mission menu (star system screen) is a disaster. cannot join friends directly and thats with an 100mbit down and 100mbit up connection. frequent lag for no reason at all. but even with that, i kinda had fun playing it. but only with some friends that know where to find the right menu options and things like that. for someone who boots up the game and is a total newcomer its a disaster to get playing. grafics wise the game has for me the real meh/blegh factor. because the only colours that are used are grey and brown. level design is sometimes just straight out weird and the minimap.... oh god that ***** minimap, witch is no help to you at all.",1
"this is probably the best free to play out there, it doesnt get any better that parkouring your way around and cutting people clean in half, the only drawback is that i dont have a great computer to run it on...",3
"i really wish warframe could be played on mac. i have a macbook pro with nvidia geforce gt 650m graphics card, which is good enough to play this on high settings. i currently have it on my  pc that can barely run it. i could use dual boot or virtual machine on my mac, but who wants to put that messed up piece of crap windows on a perfectly fine laptop? is it worth the risk to destroy my laptop just so i can play an insanely awesome game without graphics lag?",7
"i recommend this game because it is fun to play with friends and the aspects of it are amazing. it has amazing graphics and a amazing battle style. its crafting system is bomb and you wish that the crafting never ends. if you want a game thats fun and complex i recommend this game to you individuals.",1
"this game is amazing from the incredible graphics to the 3rd person halo-like gameplay. the controls are easy to pick up and adapt to. the level design is great and i find myself replaying certain missions over and over with different limits placed on myself. this is defiantly a great free game to pick up, id recommend this to anyone who enjoys a fast paced shooter who like myself, doesnt enjoy tf2 or planetsides 2.",1
"well let us start off by saying i am bad at writing reviews. as i was beggining to write this i tried to come up with some cons about warframe, but i could not do so. i gave it about thirty minutes and not even a hint of a con appeared in my mind. i would like to share my opinion on waframe before i list any pros. my opinion being that warframe is a truly amazing game. i did not think i would ever end up where i was in this game. at first i despised the idea of it, but i gave it a try. now everyday is a day of wanting to play warframe, playing warframe, and thinking about playing warframe tomorrow. people will always text me and ask me to hangout but i always say i am working or i am busy. however, i made new friends, perhaps even a family. it feels as if i have another life, a place to escape to. if that does not tell you that i love this game my current 851.3 hours will ( which will certainly be increasing ;d ). well since warframe is nothing but pros i will just settle by spitting out the larger, more positive attributes. some pros being: +great community +amazing graphics +phenomenal customization in both modding and physical appearances +certainly not a pay to win +perfect mechanics +always new stuff and fixes +joyful gameplay there is far too many pros to list, in my opinion. if you give it a real try you will probably become addicted. be ready to abandon your social life. (:",9
"46 hours in and i see my future, it is a dark and terrifying future full of space mutants, swords, alot of bullets, and waiting on the god damn guns to finish crafting. so far great game if you are thinking of trying this game out be sure to check out the wiki, if that doesnt discourage you look around at your loved ones and think of how much they will miss you, if this also fails try some out door activities which you find enjoyable, if all else fails and you arent willing to destroy your computer to save your social life, please make sure to say farewell to any loved ones, feed your pets, gather a hefty supply of snacks and have the wiki open in the backround to help you figure things out. remember ordis loves you if no one else does.",1
"pretty fun game but gets pretty boring after the first couple missions",1
"i would totally love to give this a 9.5/10! what a great game :)",1

"very awesome game and the best grinding game i have played",3
"an exciting 3rd person ninja shooter based on sci-fi. explore respective warframes powers and master them!",5
"for the reason i dont know how to write the review",2

"whats not to like about space ninjaing all over the place? sure its free to play and has ingame currency you can buy, but its less grindy than many other free to play games. space! ninjas! in space! you can run on the walls and use your melee arsenal to cut and smash enemies.",4
"great f2p game. whats nice is that with a lot of hard work and dedication, you know you can get almost everything without having to use your hard-earned (hopefully) money.",2
"game has lots of bugs, which ruin gameplay. client crash when youre at the end of tough mission is normal, and all you earned during the fight is gone. save your nerves and dont play this game.",1
"fantastic! looking for that old school 2p console gamer feel without having to be near the person or having to pay any money? then this will be your new cocaine.",4
"this game is probably one of the best free to play games out there",1
"highly recommended : what more can we say about this game, that hasnt already been said ? its an amazing f2p, everything is obtainable through farming/grinding, even the real currency youd buy with real money. takes a bit of time and farming to actually get some decent stuff but its worth the trouble! graphics wise, its better than some $20-$30 games out there, and it keeps on getting better! sure, youll have glitches and bugs, thats because the game is still in beta, and many people seem to forget about it. glitches and bugs get fixed over time, the devs works hard for that. =)",8
"very thrillful and open upon builds we all can make up!!!",1

"as i read the description and saw some videos of this, i was a little interested,. so i downloaded it , not expecting much. this game has wowed me and if i had the choice between any new gen games, i would pick this. this game is more than just getiing new weapons and warframes, it is a game that has struck a cord in my expierence with games, and will always be on eof my favorites. with plenty of warframes, weapons, and equpiment, this game never gets boring. every mission is a new expierence and challenge, with or without friends or randoms. the clan system helps everyone, unlike most other games. with plenty of love/hate relationships with the bosses, this is a game for the ages.",1

"very fun game, but hopefully they release more in-game content. everything i wanted to do required real money. im not a stranger to f2p mmos with in game stores, but the actual in game content here is pretty limited. pretty much pay to win. as far as game play goes, melee range is kinda hard to judge at first, and the controls arent exactly friendly. you have 3 weapons, and f toggles them, however it only seems to toggle between 2 of them unless you hold it down to get the 3rd. when i finally had everything down, and was moving along, i joined my first co-op map, and the person i ran with sprinted to the end and bypassed all the good stuff between... then complained that i was going through, killing things and getting drops (ive read this is a common thing). this is supposedly still in open beta, but it has been for quite some time. i worry this is a game that will get strung along as is for a while and never be finished completely. id actually consider paying 60$ for this if i got access to the entire game. there appeares to be a lot of potential with this game, but its more worried about making money off of miniscule transaction than making a good game. i recommend checking it out, but its not going to change your world.",1

"its freemium done right. everything but cosmetics are obtainable through playing the game. as a freemium game there are wait times for when you are building things. at some times the game can be slightly grindy, however usually its still quite fun. there are lots of clans in the game that you can join and chat with the people in them. beware of the trade market, the benefit of the clans can help prevent you from getting tricked into selling something way cheaper than what is could be worth. in the end have fun",6

"ninjas in high tech suits killing (space nazis) and being bad asses i dont know what to say more then that i dont think there was ever a game that was free like that i mean with this kind of play there are better game sthat are free but thats one of the best ones if you arent having fun with it and you dont like it ok its ok for me some people have their own opinion but the game is nice so yeah i dont know what to say more.",1

"nice pretty easy at start game, but better play with friends. random ppl mostly just rush to end of mission without any fun.",1
"this game is fun, but like any other game, gets pretty repetitive. but unlike other games, this is a constantly updated game, meaning events, and alerts are there. one thing to keep mind is the amount of money youll invest in this game if you plan on going serious. they give you a few slots that can quickly get filled up, something that seems important.",1
"ninjas. aliens. tenno. clones. this game is now complete. oh yeah, theres also awesome ninja swords. and flamethrowers. and bows & arrows. yeah. its complete.",2
"this is a great game, but the costs for weapons and cosmetics are too high and forces us players to grind or pay. this artificailly increases the playtime. most of the weapons, tennos, weapon/tenno slots, and cosmetics cost platinum or a ludicrous amount of credits to buy. purchasing with platinum reduces the grind tremendously but the only way to get platinum is to purchase it or using the in-game trading system. i hope you move the platinum/ micro-transaction solely to the cosmetics, or at the very least, lower the credit costs. im not saying this is a bad game, i am just saying that there is a large amount of micro-transactions in this and most other free to play games.",1
"very fast paced a little hard to get used to at first but super ninja robot suits are well worth it. not enough in game instructions on the how too but dosnt take to long to find out where every thing is located in the menu. for a free game very worth it. of course has in game microtransactions if you would like to spend money.",1
"warframe is a great grind game with an enjoyable grind style. you play as tenno (space ninjas!) and run around doing repetitive missions. though the missions do burn you out, the combat and manuevers just flow really well. throughout these missions you pick up mods (which give boosts/unique abilities to your equipment) and resources (used for crafting new equipment) and credits (the free in-game currency). though there is a cash shop (platinum) none of the weapons or warframes are locked behind it. in fact, the only items that are exclusive to the cash shop are cosmetics and grinding boosters (exp multipliers, resource multipliers, credit multipliers, etc). overall warframe is a great f2p game and will go for hundreds of hours of play.",6
"one of the best // / // _/ / game i have ever play 5***** stars",1
"since i tend to ramble when i post ill be making this short. 1.this game is pay to win. pretty much everything is behind xp locks or paywalls. 2. a live system has been included. if you get your  kicked by mobs of enemies four times [easy to happen in the beginner levels] then you must wait a day or pay up. no 1-ups here unless you have dosh. 3.like pretty much all free mmos the community lean between complete trash and decent. 4. for some reason the devs of this game decided to make leveling up a real pain in the . after a certain amount of levels have been reached you must take a test to progress further. this translates to you getting dumped into a small arena where you must kill a blob of enemies on a time limit. if you fail you have to wait a day before you can try again. its not bad as free mmo goes but there are better games to spend your money on. ill give it a reluctent thumbs up.",1

"the game is okay but you guys have the ies client i have ever seen in my ing life and i will stop playing this game if the client keeps freezing and disconnecting me and ing up my computer for no apparent reason. so i really hope you guys do something about it",3
"space + ninjas. really cant ask for anything else.",3
"very entertaining and the action is adequately fast and gritty down to the core. spent a lot of hours on this one, and some cash too. totally worth it, but the warframe experience wouldnt be complete with some friends along. :) gets a little lonely sometimes.",3
"top game, i dont usually put more then 100 hours in a shooter before i get bored but with this one i have put in over 400 hours and still going strong",4
"gets kinda repetative but the combat is fun. good to play for a short time.",2
"awesome game.. at first i didnt think much of it when i saw gp trailers ect, but when i tried in myself, i was tossed away :d - its amazing :). and love the mods / wpns creations :) - and the time it takes to construc each wpn :) . just started out - so this is a noob review :) .",1

"warframe is an amazing free game, one of the best with great graphics and multiplayer and single player to have fun with. it also has a huge campaign with alot of planets with missions to adventure and they change nearly every time when you load the mission. so i definitly recommend it to everyone!",1
"nothing here except for a ninja third person shooter with a great story!!!! i can friend you on there and we can join forces.",1
"this is by far the best f2p mmo ive played so far, i recommend you all to play it or at least try it out!",2
"this game is one of the best games ive ever played. sure the story line isnt very good because its more focused on the gameplay mechanics, but holy hell is it fun. there are a lot of different weapons to choose from and the best thing is you actually earn them and dont just run around, get a bunch of money, then buy them like in other games. this game is not for people who just wanna be able to get the good stuff fast without spending real money, i highly reccomend this for people who want a game their gonna play for awhile before they earn all the stuff because ive played this game for 100+ hours and ive only had a few of the many weapons and characters in the game.",3
"great game, played for hours before realising it was on steam.",1
"solid 3rd person shooter and a really cool art design 10/10",2
"a pretty neat game, though the coolest weapons require an investment. you dont have to spend any money on the game, but remember this: a grindable item is only free if your time has no value. budget accordingly.",1
"pretty boring after a while. becomes a bit of a grindfest.",1
"this is the best game i have ever played while its in beta! its fun and its got good graphics. at some points its hard and challenging but that means that you have to bulk up! plus its free! whats not to like?",1
"alright so heres the deal as far as 3rd person multiplayer online shooters goes this is one of the best games ive ever played, and i was worried itd be pay to win, but more or less there is a point where it is pay to progress, however with incentives like log in bonus which can provide up to 75% off their in game currency spending $10-20 bucks really gets you far and gets you quite a bit. i normally dont like games where you have to pay to progress, but $25 bucks for a game that has given me 400+ hours of play isnt half bad. it may not be everyones cup of tea, but its f2p, give it a try.",4
"good pve content, not a pvp game. fair amount of grinding but enough regular content produced that it keeps you entertained.",5
"really aesthetic game. i mean, common. people have been saying this again and again. space. ninjas. lots of weapons. lots of character builds. lots of fun and flashy powers. its a top notch pve. but hey, its a total grindfest. thats the only problem i have. but being this game is perfect if youre weekend warrior. the game gets updated often so its a fresh experience every time you get on, in a way.",2
"great game, starting items are a bit rough but once you get ranked up and can afford new items. jesus the game becomes so much better. i use to not want to play it because i felt like i couldnt do anything. then i got new weapons and a warframe, man and i am loving it now.",1
"the crazyness this game inflicts apon you is as good as halo. a shooter done right.",1

"fastest, most stylish 3rd-person shooter ive seen in a while, love it!",3
"really good game the best f2p ive played. not complete pay to win you can farm for parts but it takes longer than buying the gun with real money",8
"in my opinion, the surroundings get a bit boring after a while, but warframe is a great game with loads of potential. warframe has a great variety of weapons and skills, there is something fitting for every playstyle. solo-playing is just as awesome as playing with other people. i would give it 80 out of 100 points.",1
"warframe is alot more than a just a shooter, with crafting ,armor, classes, enchanting, raids, looting makes it more like an rpg on the lines of fallout vegas or mass effect.",1
"a game where u play as a ninja... for freezies... do or die.",4
"if your geting it use this link it gives you bounus stuff",2
"really fun game showing great promise. since starting it has only grown and become better. its free too, so what is there to lose?",10
"so much fun a great game that will keep pulling you in!",6
"fairly fun game, but requires alot of grinding and farming.",1
"warframe is a very fun group based game. it takes a while to get into but once you get a hold of it it is worth it!",7

"if you havnt played this game yet you are missing out. it is me3 multiplayer meets ninjas, nuf said.",2
"i have been addicted to warframe and think it is very well put together. it is constantly getting updates and new things added to keep it fun. very good game and i reccomend it to everyone",3
"if u like fast paced games get this game like rpg shooters get this game. this game is known to be repitive at times but theres always new content coming out ex: events, guns, equipment. this game always has you doing something.",4
"great game, have had a bit of trouble with it sometimes, but its still a nice game.",1
"this game is one of the coolest games ive ever played in my life!",1
"even though many people seem to think this is a p2w game, so far, i only spent money on plat to buy more item/warframe slots. everything else i crafted myself by farming everything. just some time investment required only annoying fact is that p2w players dont care for loot at all during missions. missions end too fast and my killing rates tumble down...",4
"great game to play with friends, lots of weapons & characters to make. always something to due whether its farming, grinding or just being a stud.",5
"this game is amazing hands down, the only thing i noticed was that the cursor is a little bit slow and sometimes i click the wrong thing. getting that aside, everything else in the game is great from what ive seen. the graphics are good, the controls are good although you might have to change some of them e.g: crouch, i change it to c so i could reach it. anyways getting back on topic i would definetly recommend this game to who like third person shooters. in conclusion i would rate this game 5 stars, 10/10 great job on the game, keep it up!",1
"ive played much more then my profile says, but this game can get really repetetive. havent played in a while, but the devs love the community and keep adding more content. once you get in the hang of things, you cant stop, until the game gets repetetive again and you want to play another game.",4
"are you kidding?! the games awesome, you can loose yourself in this one! the only thing i hate is that theres no way to earn platinum. it either has to be bought or traded for. im not even seeing a free give away here. kind of frustrating, but then i cant blame you, would probably do the same thing to get back a return on my investment. and, certain blueprints are nearly impossible to find (ie, forma).",2
"what destiny should have been. mass effect with ninjas. 9000/10",1
"wishing i had tried this game alot sooner. i usually see ftp and think meh but i was bored so i gave it a shot...so glad i did. tons of variety and ways to customize your character and the gun play is to notch. basically its a pve fps with upgrading via loot drops as the main goal. you may farm areas alot but for some reason it never gets old/boring. its a challenge but a fun one...give it a shot.",1
"this game is so exiting. even after so many hours i enjoy it, because the developers keep on improving and adding new things to it. if you havent yet tried it out. do so!",5
"i played this game for an hour (followed by more) and i loved it. its a fun co-op game with tons of interesting stuff. it might be confusing at first, but in time, this game will show what it really has. good, fun stuff. also, its free, so why not?",1
"like everyone says, its basically ninjas in space. but instead of ninjas in space, its actually space ninjas with amnesia (the medical condition, not the game) in space",5
"it definitely involves plenty of grinding but its a god damn free-to-play game, you dont buy a cheeseburger and get surprised when theres cheese in there do you? ...thats all i got ^_^",5

"be an epic parkour space ninja and fight aliens with your friends!",1

"warframe is a very good game, platnium currency is earnable in game by selling mods to other players. lots of enjoyable time well spent. and who doesnt want to a be a tank on two legs, that moves like a ninja and has powers like a wizard.",3
"if you love free running like i do then be sure to pick up this game on your way out!",2
"great game with constant updates and improvements. the best thing is, its free!!",2
"been playing it since cbt and before it got onto steam. great fun at first but will get grindy near end game. the dev are working on improving the end game contents and adding new stuffs with every update so its worth a shot and they take players feedbacks seriously. gameplay: 7/10 graphics: 9/10 sound: 5/10 replayability: 8/10 community: 5/10 dev support: 10/10",1
"what more to say, it is free. this is one of those games that has a sbit of a learning curve (when it comes to the skills and ablilties) but overall, if very enjoyable. especially with a few friends.",1
"somehow i ust have enough farming this game good for first 30 hours, but become dull after repeat mission just to make some weapon or mod 7/10 for a action game, +1 for parktor",2
"remember the first trailer for dark sector that showed that the game was originally to take place in space and in the far future? well digital extremes decided to take the concept of that early version of dark sector and make a completely new and free to play third person action title out of it. and so warframe was created. you play as a member of the alien race known as the tenno, a slight nod to the protagonist in dark sector, who has been summoned from the dark reaches of space to the galaxy to fight the evil grineer who are out to take over the galaxy and also wipe out the tenno at the same time. but youre far from helpless in your struggle, you have a special battlesuit called a warframe, each one of them have unique abilities that can turn the tide of battle in your favor, a wide array of firearms and several types of melee weapons, all of which are powerful enough to cut an enemy apart with one single powerful swipe. and you will also be fighting alongside other tennos in your mission to rid the galaxy of the grineer as well as any other alien race that intend to wipe you out.",1
"great game and it was for free highly reccomend it !!",1
"this is a great game, full of different features, missions and is constantly evolving, bringing new types of mobs, warframes, guns and all sort of things. spent a great amount of time playing it and do not intend to stop doing so",1
"amazing game, new content added all the time. the new melee system transform the game from a standard over the shoulder platform shooter to something different and unique on the market. the credit and platinum system is definately good and allows that even if you dont decide to put money into the game, that you can aquire >95% of the inventory. though my only concern would be the price it is to buy platinum and the effective use out of it. 10 of platinium does not get you far, and for the new frames trying to unlock them via the free route can be time consuming at times. if you are prepared to put a little extra time in the game then everything is worth it. the community side is great and very much almost too friendly. the only things i would ask/improve it this was my own game would be more plat for you buck and the cross play the ps4 users (though both most likey not going to happen due to the natures of both cirumstances. tl:dr? get the game, its free and fun with mates. the game is beautiful and there far too much content in comparions to simlar free games on the market.",3
"a pretty fun game, if a horribly imbalanced and grindy one.",10
"10/10 farming simulator 2015 has really been keeping me occupied",2
"when i downloaded warframe, i didnt see myself playing it very much: f2p games dont tend to hold my attention for very long. im happy to say i was wrong. the addicting mod and leveling system will have you checking your inventory after evry battle, and egerly awaiting your next chance to prove your skilles for another rank. however the game almost requires you to be in a clan, and the customization is very limited without blowing a few bucks. overall, this game is a great free to play timekiller, but be prepared to spend money if you want to play seriously.",1
"fantastic beyond belief for a free game. i have logged a ridiculous amount of hours and would recommend this to anyone who like space ninjas.",4
"i love this game its so much fun. i think they should have more items to be purchased by credits not platinum!",1
"disregard metascore, this is actually a good game. refined mechanics, parkour, hitboxes, and constant updates makes this a very good f2p title.",4
"i love it, ive been glued to my computer for the past week",1
"this game has unique third party shooter/ action rpg elements, along with huge amounts of levels and youll always have something to build, yes build. making weapons and new characters (warframes or frames) costs materiala (found by doing missions) and money (found flipping everywhere), and this gives you a sense of satisfaction when you finish building whatever youre building. if you do get this game, my username is agentxshadow but people tend to just call me agent on warframe. one last thing, this game is free! no cost, no pay2win situations the whole thing can be played without any money, but you know, developers need to eat too.",6
"when i play warframe,iam like: iam a ninja.............from space!",1
"omg!! its like halo and assasins creed combined!",1
"free to play. and evil with it (well, some of the design is questionable, at least). apparently its far less evil than the vast majority of ftp games. which is lucky, i guess, since theres a slick, if actually slightly dumb, shooter here to overshadow that cash shop. worth noting is the fact that random number generators feature so heavy that its not uncommon to hear this one refered to as warfarm or grindframe. its addictive and has absolutely no respect for your time. i should hate it, but i (judging by my hours played) kinda love it.",4
"basically parkour in space. with guns. its really goooood.",3
"most fun ive had playing a shooter since cod: modern warfare! i love the mix between swords and guns also how you can use special abilities!",1
"this is something awesome! graphics are amazing, difficulty is challenging after few rounds. its really synoptic and gameplay is smooth even when you dont have some kind of super pc. :)",1
"this game is great if you dont mind farming for items to get better items so youre better at farming for even better items. actually its more fun than it sounds, and it can get kind of boring on your own. its free, so thats great. play with friends and youll have a great time. but dont get it on steam, the launcher and the game is really buggy, get it on the games website.",1
"its like you found that peice of venila cheese you were looking for and then you stuck it between your legs and sprouted wings and flew away on a bike to the moon",1
"its a great game ans really fun. its like being a pirate a ninja and a spaceman all in one!",6
"fun addicting and alot of elements to take into play while playing",1
"shooting stuff... looting stuff... upgrading stuff... then shooting stuff again... yes.",3
"warframe is a great free to play game plenty of stuff to do and get hours of enjoyment best played with others!",3
"fun f2p. the first couple planets are slow but once you have your first new weapon of warframe the pacing of the game picks up. be warned, grinding is the heart of the game. its enjoyable but can be tedious.",1
"coming from someone who has spent over 150$, and almost 150 hours on this game, id say its amazing. while somewhat repetitive, its best to take breaks. (and a word of advice, never trust metacritic. especially in this case, considering they only gave this a 66/100.) and the devs are constantly updating the game was well, which means new weapons, areas, bosses, tilesets, environments and warframes. its amazing, to say the least. and i wish i could put more time into it, if it werent for my laptop breaking down and my current pc being unable to run it reliably.",2
"if you like tps games this is for you! really smooth gameplay with increasing difficulty for each and every mission you play. it has really nice graphics aswell as a good story. this game delivers what it shows you! sound 7/10 graphics 8/10 gameplay 9/10 story 10/10 overall 9.5/10",4
"it was very fun at the start but it got quite repetetive. i still like it except some features in the game are locked until you buy them with real money. cant argue with that though if its a free to play game. fun to play with friends or just solo. 7/10",1
"i played most of my time on a ps4 so i dont have the hours to prove but if you get into the game it will take over your gaming options",1
"simple and fair free-to-play with decent replayabilty.",5
"not a bad game. 7/10 would get kicked from menu again. . .",1
"its a grind of a game, but its put together so well i dont mind. that and i dont feel bad for throwing a bit of money at them at all!.",3
"if youve ever played metal gear solid, its kinda like playing as raiden. co-op is fun and its a very unique game.",1
"want to play a game that all you do is kill guys, rank up, progress in missions, grind for items, pvp your friends, make so called groups, and parkour. yes this game can be rough at start so its recommended to play multiplayer or with friends. this game has alot of canvas to be painted on but the artist delays his masterpiece. yes this is typical for game but this is an issue needed to get attention (from a beginners prospective). i would give this a 8.3/10. in my opinion, a true game needs the player to have fun all the way till the player gets burnt out to be considerd a great game. i would suggest you to try it out.",1
"not to fast paced, good for someone who likes shooter games but isnt very good at fast paced ones.",1
"pretty fun for a few hours here and there when you have someone to play with otherwise its tiring and grindy",1
"warframe is a good game, the gameplay is very good and it cost nothing",1
"warframe is a good game, the gameplay is very good and it cost nothing",1
"i really didnt expect to have as much fun with warframe as i am now when i first saw it. the games setting and style wasnt much my type of game, but after playing it for a few hours i can appreciate just how beautiful and fun it really is. warframe is an extremely polished game, with plenty of customization, and many ways to play. it even has cool features such as a solo mode that you can play offline! a lot of the games customization lies behind either pay walls, or you can spend in game money to get blueprints and then grind for materials to be able to get the different characters and weapons. it also encourages you to join a clan for various benefits in new weapon types as well as more customization fun with the ability to design your dojo. i would definitely recommend this for people desiring a fun and quick co-op experience and who dont mind slow level progression.",1
"warframe is amazing the development team aswell are amazing people and hardworkers always pushing new updates out.",5
"its fun really fun, but every thing there is to buy you have to pay to get the credits for it.",1
"love the game! over 200 hours played. such fun, much grinding, wow!",3
"this game is fairly simple in appearance but complex enough to keep you coming back. it has a little bit of everything, rpg elements, fps, hack-n-slash, collecting, crafting and even pets! i mean seriously a little bit of every thing. that being said it can get grindy, but you can take a break and come back weeks later and pick it right up.",2
"this game has to be one of my favorites, due to the constant updates, immersive gameplay, and endless hours of content. 9/10",10
"all time favorite game so far. i love how you could play a hundred missions in a row and still not get bored. the craving for better weapons gets the best of you and you keep playing and playing and playing till you drop. amazing graphics with fun gameplay makes this game my favorite so far. keep up the good work de. oh and the best part about it is: its free. all of it. you could unlock everything in the game for free given you were motivated enough. highly recommend this game.",4
"so much fun a great game that will keep pulling you in!",6
"fairly fun game, but requires alot of grinding and farming.",1
"warframe is a very fun group based game. it takes a while to get into but once you get a hold of it it is worth it!",7
"this game has all the needs to become to something very different and original from other projects",7
"if you havnt played this game yet you are missing out. it is me3 multiplayer meets ninjas, nuf said.",2
"i have been addicted to warframe and think it is very well put together. it is constantly getting updates and new things added to keep it fun. very good game and i reccomend it to everyone",3
"warframe is a gem. it is free to play, and the only things that are not available for free players are cosmetic items like skins. warframe is a coop action game featuring robot ninjas with space magic. high quality textures and animations for a free to play game still in beta (although it is in the later stages of said beta) the update 11 damage rework has revamped the game as well, so if you are totally new to it, give it a go, iits free. for those of you who might have played once or twice, give it another shot, a lot has changed for the better.",5
"so far the best free-to-play pc game ive ever played, surpassing even tf2. cool, complex, concepts and near-endless possiblities in tactical, strategic, and powerful combat options create an experience i dont believe you would find anywhere else. 10/10 good times, best times",1
"10/10 would cut all my enemies in half with ninja space magic again.",2
"cyborg gun-fu ninjas in space. what more do you want!?",3
"fun time sync with amazing graphics and excellent mechanics. worth a try if you like space...and ninjas!",4
"best hack and slash game at the date hands down. the soundtrack needs polishing, but the gameplay, the bosses, the ambience, the weapons and everything is just perfect. it creates not only strong teamplay but also offers the best weapon and loadout customization ive ever seen in a mmo. i dont regret a single hour ive spent playing this game, and it still is a lot of fun, always hyped about new updates and incoming stuff! also, de (digital extremes), its developers, are literally awesome. all they do is get closer to fans every day, do streams with some cool gameplay, awesome mechanics, rewards, about what they are doing and what they plan to do, etcetera. i would really appreciate some lore, as everyone else, but thats not what you come looking for at a third person shooter-ish game, mostly with all the extra stuff it has. rock solid 9/10 considering flaws and trying to be as objective as possible, comparing with other online and non online actual games.",10
"this game was tricky to figure out but once you get around the ui its an awesome game",1
"this game is surprisingly addictive, and its pretty incredible the amount of content you get for free. you can play as a number of different warframes and build so many items. lots of mods allow you to enhance your build even further, such as being able to add elemental damage to weapons. overall, a great game to play with friends or online!",5
"grind/10 volt+speed+fury+other speed =pretty fun game though.",2
"i recommend this game cause its fun and addicting and ninjas play for free lol",2
"its an mmotps and is mostly pve coop with teams of up to 4 people. you pretty much play as a species of super space ninjas called tenno and go into different space stations and planets to f**k  up. lots of action, kind of like a shoot-em-up at points. you have abilities, weapons, and a lot of customization options. its in open beta at the moment, so there are a couple kinks here and there. its a graphically demanding game, though, so computers with low specs are going to have a little trouble. if you can run league or any popular mmos you shouldnt have an issue. truly a god among games.",6
"great f2p game with lots of depth, customization options and missions.",1
"a bunch of ninja robots kicking . best free to play game besides tf2. 10/10",1
"totaly addictive gameplay, awesome co-op and loads of ways to mod your warframe and weapons plus usefull login bonus for every day, everyone should try this",3
"good game, plenty of fun and things to do. though light on the in game content, still very enjoyable.",7
"not a bad game killing time, lots of events and updates, good for both people who dont usually have lots of free time and people who is hardcore on gaming!",6
"you can be a space ninja. what more do you want me to say? 10/10",3
"its a great game, but it suffers the fate of rng problems and grinding that many other games suffer from......",9
"its free give it a go. its made by digital extremes, that alone is enough to play this game.",10
"this game has changed the way i look at third person shooters. i love the constant additions and improvements as well as quests given by the generous amount of updates and i hope to see this game get even bigger in the future.",1
"this game is essentially ninja gaiden mixed with mass effect without the storyline from either. fun to get with your friends and chew through a bunch of grinding quests, but other than that its pretty limited. looks pretty too, which is nice.",1
"i think this game is a step into the future. this is a gateway game. if you are new to the steam community,i really think you should play this. a futuristic ninja game......its briliant! there should be more games just as great as this one. my first 10 minutes of this game was the greatest 10 minutes ive ever had. if you love fast paced ninja stealth games,you will love this.",1
"this game is fun. i like free and i like good graphics. 10/10. would play again.",1
"this is a good game if you want some ninja skills and abilities mixed with a splinter cell type game!",1
"so far i had a great time with warframe. i did two missions. i cant wait to put more hours in and see what mission i get next. this game is wild and seriously sci-fi. i had a great time. repetetive but super fun! i am having such a good time with the beautiful graphics. i hear you can craft anything later so money does not need to be spent. i picked a bo staff in the beginning and i wish i picked a machine gun but oh well it was fun anyway! it payed very well on my mac dual boot with windows 8.2. beautiful graphic and smooth grinding and lots of cool effect like i can run across walls. so far i can see myself playing for hours on end. cant wait to play again tomorrow!",1
"absolutely amazing game - suffers from somewhat lack end-game content that can reduce the game to a grindfest, but can easily get you 80+ hours of gameplay without feeling repetetive.",7
"one of the the best f2p games and my favourite so far",3
"free multiplayer, still in development so a lot of things get changed and you get to be part of the process. in the beginning opportunities where kinda limited but the game has gotten a lot of great features. missions are medium long so you can very flexibly decide how long you want to play. i recommend an alarm-app for the mission-alarms that give you extra items or credits. you may help yourself to more warframes or weapons with a little platinum, which is the currency you exchange for many, however, you dont need to! but i and my friends all invested some money into the game. i think thats still fair because i would have payed the same amount in store for a game i would play that much.",4
"too bad you cant link your ps4 account to pc. i had a lot of stuff on there",1
"game is amazing nothing i dislike about it. 5 stars.",4
"very fun, its a bit of a grind but killing hordes of enemys with cool guns and powers make up for it imo",7
"this game is very big and requires dozens of hours to complete,even tough the quests are repetitive ,the combat and movement style of these game will make you think on many solutions to best your enemies and graphical content are superb.",1
"it is a pretty awesome game. must say, it blew my mind. but the only bad part is that you need a very smooth computer to play it. lag is dangerous for a game like that.",1
"although ive never played warframe on pc i played hundreds of hours on the ps4 (i hope theres no real differnce) and i must say for a free game warframe is amazing you will spend countless hours even alone on this game something this game did very well was how many things you can do you can work on making a warframe, weapon, something for the clan, etc. all in all this is my first review so its  and short but at least i tried",1
"so, youre a space ninja armed with a gun/bow/grenade launcher/weird alien tech weapon and a sword/hammer/fists/mace and wielding crazy powers to destroy/stun/confuse/decimate your enemies? why have i never heard of this game before??? seriously, this game is phenomenal, the graphics are amazing, the weapons are fun, the powers are cool, the devs are constantly fixing and improving the experience, i cannot find a fault with this free game! i dont have a lot of time to play games, but warframe doesnt require that much dedication to enjoy it at all. the action is fast-paced, the plot is light, the requirements are minimal, the game is ever-evolving giving you new things to do, the tech options (in the form of mod cards) are immense. i highly recommend everyone to try it! what have you got to lose? its free!!!",2
"awesome fastpaced 3rd person shooter also ............ninja play free.",2
"fun until you realise that there are many potatos to choose from and the game wants your platinum.",1
"warframe is a free-to-play shooter with, basically, exo-skeleton soldiers that have different powers and abilities. at heart, the game is as shooter as any other game youd play on the market, but, throw in the unique powers with each warframe, the customizablilty of the guns and gear with their mod system, the diverse spectrum of weapons, unique movement system... and a free tag on it? you cant beat it, for what youre paying. there is a cash shop that you can use, which supports the games funding, via platnium that you can buy in packages. in some cases, you can pay-to-win the game to death, buying everything in the store with real-life cash, if you wanted. however, that takes all the fun out of the game, considering half the fun of it is gathering the pieces and materials to create something new and impressive that youve worked for. and constant, free updates? you cant beat that. all in all, a really great game that id totally recommend you pick up, even if youre not a huge fan of shooters.",1
"one of the first things i noticed in-game, was the striking similarities between the look of the warframe and that of eva 01. that counts for a big deal in my book, ill keep playing this one ;)",2
"if you like space ninja 4-player co-op then this is the game for you! getting platinum is kinda bogus seeing how expensive it is, so just save up your credits and just look for blueprints and parts. each warframe is unique in its own way and you can either buy it for a stupidly large price or save up a bunch of credits and scout around the solar system looking for parts and other junk. its also really fun and fast paced. 9/10- have fun!",1
"i have played this game for way too long but am still enjoying the game. although missions can be repetitive and a little grindy playing with friends really make the game a whole lot more fun.",6
"awesome free to play game. a lot of weapons and warframe combo possibility.",4
"this looks and plays far better than a free game has any right to be. all the designs for players and enemies alike are absolutly fantastic with a very organic look and feel to them that ive not seen in a sci-fi setting before which really adds a unique look and feel to the game. its sort of repettitive but the randomly generated maps and solid gameplay make it fun to play never the less, and you can easily spend just 10 minutes on a game or 8 hours. they support this game with regular updates so theres always something new. even though it runs off of micro-transactions its not so much a pay to win game as you can unlock and build most of the weapons and warframes just by playing the game. i feel its more fun and rewarding to build it yourself instead of buying it, but i tossed them $5 because i figure this game has given me at least 5 dollars worth of fun :p",2
"great game, can get a little boring sometimes however the overall quality of the game is amazing, i recommend this a lot!",3
"do you like space? do you like ninjas? then go play this beast of a 3rd person (over the shoulders) space ninja game: includes platforming, wall running, jumpkicks, floor sliding, guns and levels for your ninjas: go kick some !",3
"good game; great replayability. constant updates. lots of time wasted",7
"great game. can get repetitive at times however. business model as f2p game is fair but hard.",3
"what surprised me about this game is that you dont need a realy good machine to run it with good graphics. there are many different tipes of missions and you can move and jump around in many different and awesome ways if you take the time to learn more complex controls, like sliding and jumping with a flip then running in a wall in a single fluid motion.",2
"very fun game lots of content and tons of constant updates. they also stay connected with the community and their ideas. :d",1
"i love this game, the mechanics are truly beautiful and amazing, and ive been waiting for a game like this for a long time. there are two bad things about this game though: 1. it takes absolutely forever to unlock new weapons because you have to get materials that are a long ways away from you. i dont know, i just feel like it takes too long. 2. i cant find anyone to help me with the current missions that i am stuck on and i cant pass the current stage alone, so if more people played this amazing game then that problem would be eliminated.",1
"awesome game! wish there were more free features though :/",1
"awesome game! its so fun.. and theres no boring beginning! i love it.",1
"free, online warfare in space and on land between several diffent factions...what more could you want?",2
"great game! so much to do! a little hard to earn orokin catalysts and reactors but oh well! would recommend this game to all!",2
"play this game on the ps4 its heaps fun high reommend it :)",1
"epic ftp that for some reason is still called a beta, not really sure why, its feeling pretty polished to me.",5
"really great game and nice to play with either friends or solo. in fact i enjoyed competing with my friend on who gets the most kills in a mission. also nice mechanics on boss fights, earlier bosses are easier to solo for new players. as far as missions go they are a little repetitive but i still enjoyed the headshots each and every time.",4
"a very good hack and slash action rpg that deserves better from what was mentioned at the gameing press. all in all, i find the in-depth game machanics and multitudinous customization to be most enjoyable. recommended.",3
"you are a ninja in space shooting and slashing up full metal jacket soldiers and zombie aliens. there is also special powers you can have for each warframe (armor) you wear. you first choose between three of them, a female warframe, a male warframe, and just an overall badass warframe called excalibur. the powers can be from explosions to a higher then normal jump. i think this is obviusly one of the best f2p fps games there is. the sentence for this game is.......space ninja freerunning full metall gunslingers! 7 out of 10 playing solo, and 10 out of 10 playing with a/your friend(s)!",1
"i cannot praise this game high enough.... welll maybe if i wasnt busy playing it! space ninjas for the win!",2
"great visuals, runs well on modest computer builds, and yes; its based on grinding.",2
"this game is really fun, has a lot of content. a bit grindy, though. updated almost every week.",8
"a free mmo about space ninjas. a bit grindy at times but it usually doesnt feel like youre grinding. all the cash shop exclusive items are cosmetic only, you can buy weapons through the $hop but you can also make them yourself. a really fun game thats still seeing significant improvement even though it has been soft launched (aka completely open beta for as long as is needed)",2
"given the cost of entry, warframes well worth a try if youre in the mood for something different. it has a great mix of shooter/melee type offense. whenever i play this game i feel like a ninja. this game is in alpha so it will have its issues; but, overall its a free fun game why not give it a try?",1
"this game makes me so angry. 10/10. would recommend",1
"yes fun game. really worth it considering it is free to play",1
"pretty slick 3rd person shooter. definitely worth the money ;p, but the grind is a bit much for me, but might be right for you. i really enjoyed leveling up my first mech/warframe, and i enjoyed leveling up my next one, but after that man it was like realzzzzzz",1
"even if it is a bit of a grind, it is so much fun after the initial hour or two",2
"game is constant grinding right after beating venus. repetitive gameplay and pvp is broken beyond repair. 9/10 i dont know why its so fun.",1
"its awesome. whats not to like about space ninjas/samurai",3
"very great visuals for a start. the gameplay is awesome as well. try it if you have the time.",2
"the only game i still play. overly attached to it now. just like with halo.",10
"the hours you put in can come out by buying items and selling them for more money",2
"this is an awesome first person hack and slash type game.",1
"great game, amazing graphics (like everything on pc should have) insane gameplay (parkour it out) awesome weapons(mainly the bow) and i love the design and over-all flow of the game",3
"so many things to collect... so many ways to play... wish i could resume after getting disconnected.",3
"fast paced co-op shoooter, with a fantastic community, awesome weapons, and melee or gun-fu. what more could you want other than naked sexy people?",3
"its fun for a while, then the endless grinding eventually wears on you. may revisit it again after some time away. being as its free to play, i would recommend it, especially if you know others that will play with as well.",2
"space ninjas. how much more indepth do i need to go? ton of weapons, massive waves of enemies, nearly endless customization possiblities, robots, infected, and soldiers that look like a disturbing love children of humans and gyroscopes. warframe can either make you feel like an all powerful space ninja badass or a quivering 10 year old girl about to be eaten by walkers, blasted into a million pieces, or diced into sashimi. dont forget the pissed off companion cube of deth.",4
"gameplay: throughly enjoyable with numerous weapons although it can be a grind story: stale graohics: very pleasing great level design",2
"good nice game with pretty cool graphic for an online free-game variety of playable frames, weapons, and upgrades. approved!!",4
"awesome players vs horde mode monsters gameplay! and its free. the guns and weapons feel amazing, it looks really good. just dont put too much time towards a grind because it can get pretty boring with solo play. if you really love the ninja theme and horde coop gameplay (with a good crafting and equipment system) then give this a try.",1
"this game is great if you like wave-style combat missions. while there are bugs this game is in a growing delevopement stage and is worth sticking around to see the outcomes. the devs are always hard at work trying to make a new and positive experience for all players old or new and have a good sense of humor and takes into account good community feedback. combat has gotten a big improvement with the new melee system and brings a better flow to the whole space ninja experience. the warframes have become numerous enough now that there should be no probles finding what frame is best for you. all in all i say this game is worth the download, i mean its free so if you dont like you can always reclaim that hard drive space! i recommend this to anyone that loves ninjas!",5
"if you have a couple of friends to play this game with you will lose countless hours.",2
"fun game to play with friends! i like to think of it like halo on steroids!",1
"even though, its a f2p, warframe sure does a good job on the gameplay and graphic. it might not fit your style, but it wouldnt hurt to give it a try.",6
"third person parkour level based stealth game, fun and replayable",3
"a worthwhile f2p game. updates and new functions are always coming, too!",4
"fuuuuuuunnnn only if your computer can handle tho!",3
"great game and by far favourite free to play game with fun fast paced combat",1
"one of the best free to play online shooters ive seen so far graphics are great you dont have to pay yea it helps if you do but you can still build the stuff missions are fun i like everything about it",1
"cool gameplay. wallrunning, killing enemies while sliding etc. stylish visuals.",1
"my character has a wind-up key on his back, shiny gold skin, and a large attachment. recommended.",1
"i will ing recommend this game for awesome purposes.",1
"insanely amazing well built cant wait to see what comes in the next few years",1
"hello there everybody, my name is norace pid and i will be your reccomender. this game is sex, not the rough kind, the gentle. but not too gentle, like...like you are in a rush but you want to do this right so you bite your lip and hold on a few more minutes, but then you realize its been an hour and you havent even showered yet. youre going to be late, and this  kept you there too long! you strike her hard, what kind of twisted turn of events led from passionate love to bruises and beatings? warframe did. get it today.",3
"one question.. do you wanna build a snowman? well then you are in luck my friend because there is a warframe for just that purpose (well not exactly but hey snow globes are the next best thing) in fact there are several other warfreames with different abilities to choose from. have you ever wanted to bring back the dead? well my friend you are once again in luck! all i can say is if you wanna feel like a boss you have to play this game.",2
"want to have a  while a kitten licks your face and a ninja dose awsome stuff? well the ninja part has a big presence here so i say play it!",2
"it is a fun game to play with people,and if you want a challange solo",1
"where to start, this game is amazing. who dosent love futuristic ninjas with a large asortment of weaponry and warframes. you (and your sqaud if you chose) are a thought to be a long extinct race called the tenno. you (and your squad) are sent on challenging missions such as raid, capture, assassination and more. with unique maps and randomly generated scenarios, this game is hard to beat comparied to the other free to play games. it plays well and it is well polished. its flaws are the currency for ingame money called platinum, $5.00 = 75 platinum in which a warframe cost 375 platinum (depending on the warframe). another flaw is the building system, you go all over the solar system collecting various resurces and materials to build weapons, warframes, ect. but the warframes require a s**t ton of material and some of them you cannot get in one go. you may have the bluprints for the warframe ect. but you nedd to work for it. once you have all of the materials you can build the warfraem, weapon, ect. but it will take 12hrs for weapons, warframe parts 24hrs, warframes them selves will take 3days. but, this games goods over shadow the bads with f-u-n. so if you like space ninjas, badass weapons, cool looking warframes with unique powers this is for you. (9.3/10)",3
"warframe is the single most fun ive had wasting all of my time.",2
"the best free to play game i have ever tried it is amazing, if your looking for a free game to play and bored definetly give warframe a try.",4
"a fast-paced third-person cooperative shooter with light rpg elements, with ninjas in robotic suits fighting evil factions across the galaxy. if that doesnt make you play this game, as its free as long as you stick to using credits instead of platinum ( to purchase things immediately) then i dont know what will. the only down side to warframe is the ai is poor (sometimes they would see me and then run behind boxes ignoring me and my teamates until i attacked them) and although the game randomly generates environments (enemy ships and sometimes planets surfaces) it most of the time just makes you feel like you are playing a level that you completed earlier, with slightly different tweaks. but dont let those flaws prevent you from play this awesome, awesome game.",1
"this game is actually light on microtransactions, really fun. its worth trying, and you only have your time to lose. and we all have plenty of that, right?",1
"just your casual futuristic hacknslash, ninja, third person shooting rpg....",1
"i would have to say that this is my favorite ftp of all time. next to no lag, there are always updates with new content, and an emersive clan dojo feature where you can help your friends built a clan house however you choose. 9/10",2
"if your a fan of fps then youll enjoy this game. the options are almost endless, ok maybe not endless but there is alot of choices. between the look of your frame and weapons to what you attach to said frame and weapons its just amazing. granted at first it takes some getting use too but if you give it time and just play the game and take stuff in i am sure youll enjoy it.",2
"warframe, a great game with an interesting ancient japanese theme. play in 3rd person using a mix of gunplay and old style weapons like swords and kunai to war between 4 factions! corpus, grineer, infested, and the tenno (you). update 13 gave us melee 2.0 greatly improving the swordplay and making this something really worth revisiting if you havent seen the new system.",2
"warframe is a great game for someone looking for a free title that doesnt force you to spend real money. awesome fast action and if you have friends to play with its even better.",1
"warframe is a game that looks great, has some amazing gun play, and some amazing parkour. what i hate about this game is the amount of microtransactions put into it in order to make you pay to customize anything you have.",1
"this game is one of the most awesome co-op game that ive ever played, its just freaking amazing and the fact that its free to play makes it even better.",1
"this was a great game if you like farming for better stuff. its basically hack/slash with good graphics. just kill spend get better stuff. rinse repeat.",1
"played a long time and its fun with friends but play alone its really not play able so try it and see how awesome this game is.",6
"gameplay is great fun. the grinding for new warframes, not so much. luckily, the in-game real world cash market isnt as invasive as some other games. almost everything can be purchased with credits. colors, aesthetic changes, and a few early unlocks can be purchased at a usd price. otherwise, the game is fun and has a lot of playability.",1
"i recommend this game as a time waster. look at all the negative reviews first of all. do you see how much time theyve all spent playing this game and they gave it a dont recommend.i just started playing and the first 5 games i played were tons of fun with people. if you play this alone however it gets very lonely and that gun of yours looks really friendly. all jokes aside its a fun game at first then youll be bored to hell is what im guessing because there are people with 2.000 hours on record that play this game and give it a negative review. i will say that this is mostly pay to win from the get go because most if not all items in the shop need platinum to buy, but that really doesnt hinder youre experience that much since most items are cosmetics. yeah not really most weapons need platinum to buy and the weapons you can buy are locked with an xp something. im guessing you need to go to a certain level. i have just started playing it and its fun for me and i hope that itll be fun for you too. remember its ffffffffrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so theres really no reason to complain. if you dont like it give it a negative and tell us why, but if i catch you with over 24 hours of game time then i know yo enjoyed it for the most part.",1
"while its action is impressive and fun, especially with the more recent updates, i find myself wanting a slightly more in depth story that better explains the mythos and characters of this game, because it certainly has the potential to be an epic",1
"if i could type sounds thats how youd feel right now",1
"its a really fun game that i would recomend to anyone. it has a great feel to it and the game overall is very well made.",1
"warframe is a grind game, to truely enjoy it you have to set your own goals. since its still bieng updated regulary new things and changed to old systems are expected and this is quite enjoyable.",6
"whats cooler than frggn space ninjas yering aliens and multiplayer. just wish the performance was a little better,the sensitivity is really high and its very hard to see anything thats going on while looking around.overall... prestty good game.:3",1
"i highly recommend this game. easily the most fun i have had playing any game. ever.",1
"warframe, for a free game in open beta, is very well-done and includes an intricate upgrade and leveling system. the game is multiplayer-friendly when there are no connection problems, and the different warframes, weapons, and abilities make for fun and dynamic playstyles. my favorite aspect of the game is that it makes you feel like a total badass.",1
"this game is a very fast paced shooter/sword fighting game yet when not hacking your way through enemies it has a well done crafting mechanism though it does take a lot of time to build items this doesnt really matter if your willing to put a bit of time into this game if i were to rate this game it would be a 8/10 because it is hands down one of the best free games ive ever played or the best maybe the only thing negative about this is that there are still a bunch of bugs in the game but otherwise this game is awsome everyone should try it!",2
"awesome game although i would add a few more weapons.",1
"im recommending this but not passionately, pros and cons are my opinion pros: + nice optimization, not so high system requirements for amazing graphics + gear modding isnt actually a pain but fun + nice fast paced action + good variety of warfames and weapons cons: (remember these are my opinion) - especially least in lower levels game should someway give you some starter < x < medium level blueprints because i had no idea which weapon i could or should craft, i ended up buying many blueprints i cant make or i dont want - i often just got carried by a higher level player and missions are impossible to do alone - i got lost, not knowing what to do, game doesnt seem to have a progressive quest system or any missions of any kind after first short quest - i got stuck with same weapon for ages",1
"this game is awesome. i enjoy every moments inside the game. you feel like a hero that can do everything in your fingertips. thumbs up !!",1
"huge respect for digital extremes, for making a aaa game and give it to us for free. if some money-whoring game companies made a game with quality like this, im sure theyll put $99 for the price. the graphics are outstanding. it runs smoothly on my laptop when other games with worse graphic quality cant even run 30 fps on very low settings. the movements and effects were so beautifully rendered, sometimes i wonder if its really free. my first 4 hours of gameplay was interesting. i didnt explore much at this point, so im gonna say its good enough. the premium item system is quite balanced. half of it was cosmetics, and its not to gamebreaking. another respect for the developers for not using pay2win way. play it. its worth your time.",1
"if you dont enjoy grinding for every element of the game, this game isnt for you.",2
"grindfest... but god is it addictive or what. action game but you choose your playstyle. stealth, shoot, melee, group or solo. i dont like 3rd person games but i will make an exception for this. oh, and ninja like abilities are definitely a bonus",1
"one of the few games where you can run on walls while throwing lightning and stabbing peoples faces, and shooting them. while your friends are shooting them, and running on walls and stabbing things and using super powers. basically super space ninjas in space.",3
"we need it on mac really please make it on mac would be an pleasure or anybody knows how to get it on mac?",1
"probably one of the best free to play games out right now. and those graphics! they are amazing. good work.",1
"this game is stupid, dont listen to wortheyboii2245, he is wrong about this game.",1
"this game is abosulotly the best game in the the free section with all of its motion blurness and running around, do not listin to nobelsolider98 he is just stupid and gay",1
"not enough story in warframe for me, but if that isnt and issue for you then this is a very smooth, stylish shooter with a good upgrade system all for the low low price of 0",1
"its an easy to learn, fast paced halo-type mmo amalgation of awesomeness. the story is a bit hard to understand at first, but players can quickly pick up the skills to win either online or off.",1
"i love this game if you enjoy grinding and getting to feel like you got an awsome reward for that farming then this is your game if you keep up a fast pace and go like the ninja way you can kill every one. the mod are plenty i have been playing for almost 500 hours and you start to see that they put in some filler. if you put the game on ultra for the graphics it looks like your playing a future type tv movie. the lore is lacking but they have said that they may put in some more into it.when they make an update like for version 14,15 exc it always has somthing amazing to offer. the old tutorial is crap compared to the exclent one now for example you can get to chose your own guns and weapons insead of having the crap mk-1 braton,skana, but the lato was good. the mission and events make it so that you cant get bored and when you play void survival it feel like a battle to the death and your fighting and endless wave of enimes. the defense is a bit less then the survival but you have a less priority of caring for your life. the weapon selection is huge i want to try and make all the guns but i have only schratched the surface. the warframe make it so you can adapte to any situation. i recomend if you do get platinum you should save it either to get parts resouces or getting some stuff from the trade tab.i recomend fully that you get this game and even though your bored from farming just for a bit the reward after is the best thing you can get",6
"warframe is an awesome 3rd person shooter action game, many hours of gameplay, some may be repetitive but to play something like this with all the abilities makes it fun, what makes it even more fun is playing with your friends that you can talk to, be it skype etc... there are downsides of course, sometimes server lags and/or glitches within the game that could be fixed, other than that its just an awesome game all the way through. i hope you ladies and gents have fun with this awesome game :d 9/10!",1
"awesome game requires a good computer to handle graphics thou 10/10",1
"this is game is amazing! i have never had so much fun since i found dragon age. if you like the fps genere this is your game!",1
"in my opinion this is a pretty good game. it kinda reminds me of destiny and its got decent graphics, especially considering this is a free to play game. overall this game has hours of bow sniping awesomeness to offer.",1
"i like going right to multiplayer i just dont like singleplayer missions, thats just me but i do like the game it has nice graphics and good customizable characters even the guns too.",1
"pretty good was expecting a fps shooter with perks and killcam",1
"its like a chimera made up of left 4 dead, diablo, and mass effect. and it keeps getting better as the beta rolls on. expect even more improvements now that its going to be a ps4 launch title, and hopefully we can get some cross-platform action.",6
"to be honest, this is one of the best games ive ever played 10/10",1
"if you like co-op shooters then this game is for you. the fact that its free makes it a must play for any gamer. definitely one of the best f2p available right now. not your typical f2p game, it is based on co-op not pvp. this game is play to win, not pay to win. you can buy all the materials to make new gear for prices that i can only describe as extortion. if you put some good time into this game, you can find all of the materials you need to craft the different items and not end up spending 200$ on platinum which is the games paid currency. if you can get a few of your buddies or some good online teammates you are guranteed to have a good time playing this game. its free, its fun. try it. period.",1
"it needs team death matches , but is very sweet , great control and hd graphics",1
"this is awesome game for gamers who like aliens to kill its online too when you group with other players to kill aliens-enemies. i love to play that game it looks like halo",1
"why does it lagg so much like when i move it it moves in 3 seconds",1
"amazing game, i fell in love with it as soon as i started playing, i mean space ninjas with all kinds of different warframes. its great, a must play!",1
"this is really good, i am new to computer gaming, especially shooting games, but this is really really good, and there is no need to setup a controller, my xbox controller works just fine, without setting it up. 10/10 from me so far.",1
"if you like space ninjas and using samurai swords to forcibly dis-arm enemies, this is the game for you.",1
"this game has reached the highest level of bad@ssery, but it can go furthur. its also fun if you have a friend to play along with",1
"this game is very fast paced and very fun.get the game and youll see what i mean.",1
"this is an excellent game. lots of free running and shooting. probably one of my avorite games to date. you can look at my full review here:",2
"space ninjas, if those two words dont make you want you to play this game. this game is not for you.",1
"this game is so cool i never stop playing it i play for like 4 hr",7
"the best non pvp shooter i have ever played. keeps me on the edge of my seat. im usually not into 3rd person shooters but this game keeps me coming back for more alien  kicking. interface is beautiful, combat is steady and fun, loadouts and weapon upgrades/customization couldnt be any better. all in all, if you arent playing this game, you should be.",1
"this game is so much fun better then i expectied cant wait to get my hek maxed out and show that stalker who the real tenno is",6
"i cant believe this game is a free 2 play, it so cool",8
"this game i cannot lie is amazing, you can litterally do everything without paying money into it but just takes time. the ingame currency seems like it is very highpriced at least it did to me but it goes a long way for the money you spend.",2
"not much variety but its isnt a bad free to play game. you dont need to pay real world money to have fun but it will take longer to get stuff if you dont",1
"excellent game, great graphics, amazing team play and single player features, an all rounder.",5
"great game, loses most value after about 200 hours with repative missions. if you like grinding for gear and space ninjas this game is for you.",1
"umm when i log on to play this game the walls are glitchey and i cant see anything my account is tyman07 someone pls help me fix this issue, p.s i dont recomend this game for computers using windows vista or lower.",1
"its fun, fast, and challenging at times. this game is well worth it",6
"its a fun game but it crashes way too much, it happens about every 30 minutes or so for me.",1
"advantages: space ninjas regular heavy content updates events almost constantly weapons for days lots of game modes good community good customization options looks great no hackers disadvantages: steep (but short) learning curve for new players. heavy grinding for endgame-tier gear frequent updates cuase bugs overall its a great game if you have a fair amount of time to kill grinding for stuff.",1
"i had lots of fun, it can hold its own against many games that make you buy first. although its difficult to get really in depth without purchaces.",1
"an amazing game with matching graphics. however, solo is just as hard as playing with 4 people. other than that i highly recomen this game.",1
"this is honestly one of my favorite shooters out right now, despite it being free ive sunk more money into this game than most paid games. its like game crack!",1
"my friend told me this game would look dreadful in 3d because of the motion blur, but he also have another 3d technology than i have. something with a samsung monitor with built-in 2d to 3d converter, but it is not as good as nvidias solution. the game looks cool with nvidia 3d and i can recommend this game, even though it makes my pc sleep :p nvidia physx also looks good hehe. i like the missions too and the play style of this game.",1
"amazing game with great graphics if you like third-person shooters and mmos this is your game!",1
"this game is incredible. its an awesome co-op and also f2p. i highly recommend it",1
"great game, however its p2p server hosting system is absolutely terrible, however i still recommend this game as it is well worth playing, id give it a good 9/10 if it wasnt for constant p2p issues.",3
"like mass effect, except with parkour. great game to play with friends, or even solo jsut to screw around. there is a lot of grinding to be done in order to fully enjoy the game, but it does have its benefits.",4
"its a very well polished game, especially for free-to-play.",1
"get this game got no money but want a epic game look no further :d",1
"its an awesome game to play with your friends/family alot of blood though so only 13 and up",1
"very unique mmo. like playing a bad  coop verion of mass effect where each player controls an acrobatic terminator with guns and blades. theres not much i can say that hasnt been said about this game already but its atleast worth a try. i really like the game and like the idea of instance based mmos and this one is one of the coolest in style and gameplay. its also very fast paced and fun with friends or by yourself. you could even speedrun instances which is something most open world mmos dont have available.",1
"awesome game looks nice for a free-2-play but it is 90% pay to win type of game. the game it self is still amazing.",1
"for a free to play game, warframe certainly gets quite a few things right: the graphics are gorgeous, the game mechanics are simple, & the frames (characters) are unique, and stand out with personalities even though they dont have dialouge. as a bonus, the developers are very involved in the community; adding new weapons and items, as well as implementing new game modes and events with detailed backgrounds on a regular basis. the weapons and frames are so diverse and numerous, & its really fun to experiment and find a combination that you call your own. the only problem i have with the games structure is that you get very few weapon and frame slots to start with, and you can only get more through buying platinum (cash). there are so many weapons and frames i feel that they need to add a few more slots, because new players might not have the information they need to sink some money into the game if they cant experiment with more than 2 frames or 4 weapons. and, unfortunately, the starting weapons suck to the maximum, but that should be expected since you need to work your way up. i would definitely reccommend this game to anyone who wants an action / brawler game, because the melee / ninja-acrobatic side is stronger than the shooter side.",9
"im enjoying this game quite a bit but ive been stuck on the eurasia mission on earth for 2-3 days now. i would like to continue playing but im afraid that this one mission might just stop me. very much do i enjoy challenges but for being so early on, i feel that this mission is too much. ive even played with several different groups and it all ends the same. failed. this mission is too over-powering. i feel that the creators of this game should fix this and make it a tad easier like how it used to be before. other than that i would totally recommend this game to other video gamers!",1
"im not usually a fan of fps games, but ive really enjoyed playing warframe. i think it may be that its cooperative instead of competitive, so my lack of quick motor reflexts isnt as big of a deal.",1
"awesome gameplay ! great game for time pass :) lots of fun playing it!!",1
"very fun when you get used to the grind, although the combat system is un-usually satisfying so it isnt that bad.",3
"a bit repetative, but if youre a fan of leveling up and gaining new skills/abilities and whatnot, there is enough here to hold your interest for a good chunk of time. the devs are very active, always adding new stuff. for a free to play game, it has a lot to offer.",2
"warframe is a fast paced third person shooter that includes a perfect combination of gunplay, and melee combat, plus a whole arsenal of various weapons to try out and master. it is a bit grindy at times, but it is possible to play the game 100% free and still have fun, and it is also viable for low end computers but still looks very good if you crank it up. i suggest this game if you like fast paced action games, and third person shooters. oh, i forgot to tell you that this game has space ninjas, can you name other games that have space ninjas? ... thats what i thought.",1
"it gets a bit repeative when grinding but de always creates new fun events to participate in withe exlusive rewards. this is one of my favorite games on steam.",7
"great game, lots of things to do, however gets repetitive really fast.",1
"whilst not incredibly impressive if taken at surface value, warframe has many, many hidden layers. the lore and backstory is hidden behind so much secrecy put out by the developers. however, if you play it for long enough, realise just enough, you will work it out eventually. with such a rich and still debated backstory, theres not much not to love. the gameplay is also smooth, but far from being its best feature; bugs and glitches do feature prominently in this game but do get fixed regularly. theres regular content updates and events to do, and the combat is reasonably smooth. not the best game ive ever played, but for free, its definitely worth it.",6
"a space-aged, ninja fantasy with guns, powers, and laying waste to the enemy. the development team is countable and appear to bring more to the table yearly than most multiplayer games. its worth a shot if youre questioning it.",3
"this game is awsome!!!! beside the t that the craphics are too good for a free game, the game also worck with an xbox controller and it works really good!!!!!",1
"so addicting and one of the best games ive ever played :d (and one of the games im really good at xd) 5 star",1
"magic robo-ninjas with guns. what do you want? plot? shut up and look awesome while you kill things.",1
"you either love or hate this game. me, i ended up uninstalling it, but its not bad, actually quite good compared to others, and worth a try to anyone, plus its free. in short, the game has so many things it does right, yet so many things it does wrong, at least in my opinion. you might enjoy the combat, the variety of mission types, the possiblities of all those weapons and warframes, and the (now) streamlined hud/interface, along with endless replayiblity and decent netcode, with the games amazing optimization and graphics topping it off. or, you could be annoyed by the excessive grindiness, the monotony of missions, the (at times) brutal unfairness of the enemies, the awful parkour and melee, among other things. i more commonly encountered the latter, the reason why i uninstalled the game, but to be honest, like i said, the game has some pretty awesome things about it. i believe a lot of people exaggerate the bad points - the stuff i mentioned is bad, but not that bad. i ended up very mixed about this game, somewhat actually in between. i would recommend just giving this game a try, seeing if, whether to you, the good things surpass the bad, or vice versa. after all, its free - what have you got to lose?",1
"this is by far one of the coolest, addicting, well made games i have ever played. it is continually updated with patches and new content. and its free!",6
"the co-op ideal of this game is very well done. although it is a time or money game, it it worth the time, and money.",1
"i shot an arrow at a guy, he flew back and killed all his teammates. 10/10 i mean, i love this game, down to the heart i cant let warframe go, sadly the game gets really old. after having played 260+ hours, i can easily tell you im not able, willing, or needingly gonna dump a single more hour into this game until it has undergone some serious updating. all good things must come to an end, then you make way for new good things. for me, warframes depot of good things is depleted, now they need to fill it up agian with a stack of updates before im gonna even touch this agian.",3
"wasnt so into it at first,but its really good since update 7.outstanding game.",3
"this game is g r e a t amazing agreeable pleasing any other word that you can use instead of great. join omega brute today! (you can join as long as you remember these words: brute is our name ripping guts out is our game!) *my name is trollman118*",1
"this game is so much fun i have a blast its a litle like gears of war there is alot of taking cover if you are by yourself buuuuuuut if there us alot of you its a blast!!!",1
"this game takes free-to-play to a whole new level! feels like i should pay for it.",4
"this game is a solid game to say its free to play, with its immaculate graphics, cut throat combat and amazing story lines (the few that exist) it is easy to see why it is so popular. as ever this game has minor flaws here are the few i can find, for a free to play game they put allot of things under platinum (which is fine as they need to make money) but 75 platinum for a colour scheme seems slightly extortionate to say the least. so for this reason i would have to grade it a 3/5.",1
"at the beginning, you get some . you use that  to kill  to get more . its free and its awesome.",2
"this game actually is very cool. the graphics of this game are just unbelievable! i would recommend thsi game to everyone who likes shooting and enjoying good graphics.",1
"absolutely amazing havent played a game this good in ages",1
"this game is pretty good. it needs some work, but its free to play so its definetly worth playing. i like the co-op game play, but a few things to fix: -sometimes the achievements dont work -personally, i think the melee button is in a bad place -make the waypoints less confusing",1
"a great game to play if you want a relatively cruisey third person shooter. unfortunately, higher levels tend to lots of grinding/farming, but plenty of content before that plateau is reached.",8
"in warframe, you get to collect mods for your warriors, and this upgrades their skills. you also get to customize your player/warrior. the gameplay is very simple and user-friendly, and you get to play solo or with others to complete missions. you even get to have an epic storyline along with it. it is worth your time to try out!!",1
"if u want a good games where u can shoot things and have a nice campaign while eating beef jerkey, get some other thing but this one is freeee!!!",1
"this game to damn god, third person shooter with parkour gameplay, the character or warframes so badass, u can choose ur gameplay, for example :, u can choose stealth gameplay , or hardcore with u r friend. this game is so interesting. 8.7/10",1
"what the hell last minutes u come to update after i get the alert mission reward vigor ,u just send a message that update come my progress cannot save .how come like this",8
"man is this game addicting! whats even better is that everything bought with real money can also be farmed and crafted without it, you can also trade for platinum (real money currency).",2
"if you have a lot of friends to play with, go for it, its a lot of fun. but beware, it may get repetitive, the missions and maps you play in.",1
"so grindy not even tony hawk can pull off a rail like that. 4/10",2
"it was fun at first but since i didnt want to pay money it got way to hard",1
"this has been good times. i think im enjoying it more than borderlands.",2
"its so good, it made me forget my mac and chess in the microwave for 2 hours.",1
"a free to play game with the content, gameplay and graphics of a $40 game, even in the beta stage its in now. it is by no means pay-to-win, 97% of everything can be obtained without paying real money.",6
"guys you need to give as choice to creat game not do random hosts because after u play one level 3 hours .. and now i dont know why i cant update my warframe game at a bigining when i click on it",1
"one of the best games i have played i have over 1k hrs of game play have been playing it b4 setam had it",2
"this game is ace! loving the fast pace of the missions",1
"space ninjas that can do freaking majic. what else has to be said?",1
"its a very fun game. can be played like a single-player game, but if you have a friend (or 3) who are willing to play with you, then youre going to have a blast!",1
"game modes from assasination to defense, offline and online, not to mention tons of power up cards to enchance your arsenal, a worthy game to spend my time on. though its not the best, but definitely in my approved list.",6
"really fun game, its a nice game to play with your friends and its good to play with other people. i love how nothing in the store is over priced and everything you get in-game is faatastic. epic game.",1
"amazing dungeon crawler, probably one of, if not the, best free to plays avaliable. dlc is expensive, but gameplay is priceless.",1
"this game is fast, responsive, and engaging it feels like a more fleshed out mass effect 3 multiplayer mode with a better rewards system and less obtrusive cash shop. fully recommend",1
"i do recommend this title, it is an interesting concept and the execution is really well done in my opinion. however, personally i have already quit playing it by now. i have no intention of spending serious money on progressing to the more awesome things to be found in warframe and doing it f2p is just too long of a grind. i dont mind grinding but warframe is taking the whole idea of grinding to a whole new level, one i am not willing to submit to. but still, the gameplay is good, the graphics are good, the pace is absolutely amazing. as long as you are either willing to pay money or willing to tolerate the grind, you could probably enjoy warframe for quite some time.",1
"never played it... everyones giving it a thumbs so... why shouldnt i?",1
"completely amazing. not only does it have quite a unique feel and game-play aspect, but this game has one of those no need for story to be awesome feelings. probably the best 3rd person mmo out there.",1
"warframe provides an easy to learn, third person shooter with some minor roleplaying abilities. the game excels at providing quick missions to pass the time, or longer missions with a squad to level and grab new gear. the game centers around tenno, an elite group of warriors. these warriors are masters with several types of weapons, such as assault rifles, shotguns, lasers, or poison blob launchers. however, it can also be effectively played with the melee weapons in the game; they range from large axes and hammers, to dual wielded daggers and specialty items. overall, the game is quite an enjoyable experience. the main drawback is the time it takes to build items. a new warframe, which is similar to classes in other games, will generally take ~3.5 days to build, unless platinum is spent on it (the purchaseable in-game currency). with patience, and plenty of weapons, there are many bad guys to exterminate while waiting.",3
"grind , grind , grind for good weapons & warframes (primes). if u got da money , 2 ez 4 u my friend.",1
"good game good physics community pretty good. good graphics as well love the furturisticness",1
"great f2p game dont belive it that it is a p2p game no no you can craft every single item in the game just be ready for the wait times like warframes needing 3 days to craft but remember this game is still a baby sure its in its u15 but it still needs time to be fully releashed gameplay is fun heck i got in to it with the grinding but know this dont get in to pvp. pvp in this game is really one sided also for the new players reading this and just got in to warframe do vors prise to get the market get the foundry get the codex and get the mod thingy also veterans like myself will miss the simpleness of u1 anyway stay true tenno",7
"feel like having fun for a few hours? how about trying out cool magic junk and shoot em up guns? maybe even a sword or a pet demon dog? no? okay but this game is a wonderful timewaster and sometimes a money pit as well. worth the time but watch your bank account.",2
"i admire this game for its ambitions as a great, coop space shooter, and all though the mssions and story fall apart and are repetitive, the gameplay is great and with friends this can be a blast. not an absolute must play, but a great game to play.",1
"free game with high production value functioning mechanics and little to no bugs no complaints",2
"a fast-pace third-person shooter with an easy learning. it is not pay-to-win so you can enjoy the gameplay normally. recommended",1
"cool game ! co-op is very fun !! come and play with me!! :d",1
"best free game i played. it has realy good graphics and the best part is you get a sword and a gun.....i damn near unstopable now.",1
"very fun game. being able to choose between singleplayer, or coop with your friends makes it a very enjoyable game. recommend this one to anybody that likes shooters, mmo style games, or games you can freely choose between single and multiplayer.",1
"its a good game with intense graphics and an insane story",1
"this game is soo damn fun, one of my absolute favorites, and its not even in the final product yet. just stay away from the pvp because it is terribly unbalanced, somebody using a rhino warframe will stomp the ground and everybody in the area dies. this game takes sometime to get used to and it takes a ton of grinding to get new weapons and warframes (unless you want to use real money). this game is just to damn fun.",3
"great idea. lots of different game styles combined into a bit darker masseffect-like sci fi action. unfortunately the fact that the game is for free is very obvious. not well optimized, lots of glitches, non-clear interface. a lot of potential but needs better code and a director which will intrigue players with some better story - its not very interesting.",1
"started playing for the ninja acrobatics. continued because it has fun progression :p",1
"it is awwsooomeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)",1
"huuuuuuge game, i love the randomization and openness of it. its kind of a grindfest, but it doesnt hand you good gear like every other game. combat makes you feel badass. beautiful artstyle. some levels are really hard unless you have a friend to join you.",1
"so much fun !!!!! i started playing about two weeks and the game is amazing! the graphics are great and the different weapons and warframes with their unique abilities is just so cool. i reccommend this game for all sci-fi and shooter lovers!",1
"good game grinding is a bit over the top. but the fact that you can build pretty much everything thats in the premium store, and theres no real p2w...just p2sleep",1
"the most awesome game in mulitplayer i had played before. this game need time to play, and the skill is very good. it used statergy and skill to play. i hope they create more sentinel and sentinel weapon for them may support warframe and new enemy.",2
"i love the game but is their a way to grind faster?",2
"awesome co-op-magical-ninjas-in-space game. almost everything that you have to pay for, you can also craft for ingame money. requires a good bit of grinding but well made, fun grinding.",5
"highly recommended if you want a shooter with a challenge",1
"i run the game then this game crash. i need some help!",7
"alone its fun, with a friend or 2, its awesome. a lot of it consists of looting to find the stuff you need to make the things you need, but the core gameplay is awesome, so it never feels like a drag. seeing the awesome animation in motion while cutting and shooting you foes is amazing. play it with friends, and you will have one heck of a fun time.",1
"this game no doubt, is absolutely amazing, it never got boring and i have loved all the missions so far, overall if i had to give it a rating it would be 4.5/5",1
"great game would play it but i should be for mac my freinds whatn to play with me on missons so if the creaters are reading this ples update for mac so my frends can co op with me",2
"pretty sweet so far. great looking, smooth gameplay. not bad for a f2p",1
"bloody cool. can be a prick of a job finding players, but still, bloody cool. like an army of jedi assassin ninja viking pirate robots cool. and i dont mean the force-bothering-robe-wearing kind.",1
"this is basically pay to win, with all the limitations to inventory, weapons and warframes for you to use. despite that, the mechanics dont necessarily mean that it punished f2p people. all items can be gained in time,all warframes are easy to acquire if you got time and the mechanics and free updates are sweet. slightly repetative, but new updates ensure that we wont necessarily be bored with it for a long time. not for everyone, but i recommend this for people who like something new and fresh.",8
"its a great game but it kinda gets really repetative",1
"on this monumentous hour which steam should have given me an award for ill have a smoke and reflect on four hundred twenty hours of third person shooting with a curvy alien ninjas shooting the different types of enemies and running away running like a ***** cmon shields hurry up and fill up!! even just single player im playing it onmy one day off. fun for free ninety nine!",5
"nice and unique game. weapons, characters, missions make the game worth to play until you encounter with a bug. game has so many bugs. my advice play only for fun dont waste your time.",5
"a very entertaining game. i would 100% recomend it!!!",1
"i played this some before and without having a lot of hours onto the game i can say it looks promising i know people who have played this to much for their own good. also i like the fact that unlike most mmorpgs where you do not really become badass untill you played for a long time here you are a flippin ninja from the start! cons: it is still an mmorpg which means it includes grinding which i am not a big fan of it can sometimes be unclear with where you need to go as with all games where you can fly around (not literary fly) you will get stuck. in general though i recommend atleast trying it :d",1
"do you think being a ninja is awesome? how about being an alien? well, what if i said you were both an alien and a ninja? thats how awesome this game is. for a free-to-play game its very well made and allows co-op for those difficult missions. i have been playing this game for a while and i know that its one of the best games i have played. if i were you, i would download this.",2
"play this if you like running, gunning, swinging a weapon, doing flips, and using special powers warframe might fill the void. while the gamplay is fun it is definitly a freenium, you can work for a $5 dollar item by continously grounding for hours and some times days, then wait for hours to days for the item to be constructed. its only a shame when you done this work for a sub-par machine gun or a frame you arent particulary fond of so i reccomend looking up what thing does what. levels/enivoronments look nice and rooms are randomly generated so youll start to see the same environments after awhile. while the bosses are varied and vary in terms of annoyance, enemy types are few inbetween with gun guys and melee guys and robots. despite some of those issues you can have fun without spending a dime. it is especially fun, and in some casses neccessary to have a friend(s) to tag along on missions depending on what frame you/they are using. i played significantly less on account of the endless grinding and me being satisfied with the weapon/frame i already have but it was fun little distraction that is free to play while it lasted.",1
"a great combination of ninja and science fiction i love it alot.",1
"if you like parkour, ninjas, space, shooting, , and  like things hanging off the back of players heads then this game is for you. it ruins friendships. but its fun.",1
"its fun but if you fall out of the map or off a bridge and land on a pipe or in a hole you are trapped and have to restart",1
"i did not have high expectations for this game. how ever the visuals are nice if your running a nvidia and can turn the particles on.",4
"really good game if u know how to play it and this game is a true free to play everything that can be bought by real money can also be crafted ingame",1
"nice game,but requres the mouse button in order to revive character,should be able to revive with game controller aswell! best graphics for a 3rd person shooter,but its missing something",1
"i enjoy this game very much but there is still lots ot work out for game play wise. it is a very free base system in my mind. meaning that the direction isnt there really but i like that about it. it dosent matter how you gt your self through the missions as long as you do the steps needed. you can go back and forthe from the start of a level and back agian with out any problems. its fun but needs more of a story or maybe just a little more gam play depth. its a great shell but i feel its lacking. over all i love it and will continue to play. cant wait forthe updated later versions.",1
"this game is amazing. i am a huge fan of anime, japanese cartoons and it has tha feel to it. but, with amazing graphics. in the graphics department it reminds me a lot of timeshift, which is a plus in my book. love this game. my wife and i are going nuts over this game.",1
"this game was my #1 f2p of 2013 and so far still is. as for being a f2p game, it is being treated like a p2p mmo with its constant updates while it continues to evolve. not to mention des awesome involvement with the community it has accumulated ovver the past year. warframe has enormous potential and is heading in the right direction. if youre looking for an action packed shooter with a large amount of rpg elements, this game offers that and then some. dont be scured! ninjas play free!",5
"this is a free mmo fpshooter game with a lot of action and extreme fantasy ... join now ... youll like it ...",5
"from the makers of unreal and unreal tournament, incredibly fun, if flawed in some places. dont let the metacritic rating deceive you. while most of the criticism is well-earned, it belies the fact that there is a very solid, entertaining core here. the gameplay reminds me a bit of hellgate or borderlands, in terms of its fps-rpg play. the weapon variety, however, is more interesting along with a crafting system that keeps you coming back day in and day out. you wont find a gripping story here, but you will find yourself curious to explore the possibilities, balancing effectiveness with a style that suits you. this is a game that makes farming fun!",4
"one of the best f2p games ive ever played! u have to try it! its free!",1
"nice game but u will resolve the crash display driver has stop working..",1
"just installed this game and made a video and, bam its a very nice game and now really one of my favorites immediatly :) i recommend this game because of the graphics and gameplay and its f2p so that makes it even better ! try the game :)",1
"this game has been epic since i got it in the open beta all im goin to say is look at the hours i have played doesnt mean i sit here all day everyday playing this game what i mean is i have been able to sit here play the game for a few days put it down and come back to it and still enjoy it ive never got bored of this game i just wish that would make alot more like this. its also very social despite running in a four man team so people are always willing to help you newbies out. the level system is great as well becuase you can master everything build everything then reset the mastery and do it all agen only you can upgrade it at restarting the mastery so you actually gain somthing from it there were a few little glitches at first but you know what game doesnt ether way i recomend this game if you like games like gears of war halo this game is defianatly perfict for you if you have problem coming back to games later on like myself which i was very suprised with this game love it. keep up the good work guys and i shall come back soon im just starting my own side project for somthing simular 10/10 gamplay 10/10 weapons (when i downloaded this game at the start of open beta there were not many to choose from but know there are loads) 10/10 socialy this game is one of the best i found 10/10 in general chucky",5
"an awesome action game jam packed with ninjas in space",1
"warframe is ninjas in space litereally. you run around shooting stuff and if you get in a pinch you slash it. pros 1. decent shooter with swords (though they become useless at higher levels) 2. enought weapons and gear to keep someone interested for a few months 3. decent missions. cons 1. everything wants platinum or you have to build it which can take some time. 2. the free storage slots are pretty restricting even if you do decide to build lots of things. 3. feels a bit grindy for a shooter",1
"absolutely brilliant game, full of action, suspension and tension. hours of enjoyable gameplay that will never get old, this is a remarkable game .the graphics of this game are truly incredible i will most definately recommend this game to everyone that i know.",1
"great graphics, smooth gameplay and extremely addicting with tons of gameplay to play. sometimes does get boring grinding levels but all around a great game!",2
"i like the game, but i dont like the way you can get stuck while walljumping. what should be added: is a button that auto-unstucks the player, returning them to spawnpoint. 10 sec cast, getting injured interrupts, can only be used from the escape menu.",2
"although is a bit buggy or lacking in some very small areas, it si still in beta, and the developers are very passionate and constantly adding new stuff. early on it might be hard to get going, but with just a bit of time invested, this game can be so fun. the multiplayer system is also quite unique, as there are no servers but instead a host in every group of players, which can be very beneficial when playing with friends close by. this game can also be a bit hard on your computer, but it is written very well as far as i can tell, and loads very fast. i do recommend that you try this out, and if you dont like it the first time, come check it out later because it will most definitely have new content.",9
"simple third person shooter that is great as a pass time. really not much to say about it other than it is a space ninja game with a story that is a work in progress and a good devoted team of devs that add content frequently.",10
"amazing! great animations, amazing characters, and more! you know what, im not gonna spoil it, get it for yourself and see for yourself! trust me, you wont regret it. =3",1
"insanely fun, had me hooked after the first few battles. keeps me coming back to build my frame.",1
"fun as , plenty to do, and you can do everything in game with just time and deication, no money needed to be spent.",2
"this game has a great start waiting to see where it will go in its time this game could last for years that all depend on the team well see .......",7
"this game is effin awesome brah. but it needs pvp. :[",1
"fast paced and acrobatic cyber ninja combat with gun swords and sweet powers.",8
"amazing 3rd person shooter, definatly play it... nowwwww",1
"this game is shamazing, it has everything i want. i love the mechanics and endless customizations, but sadly i play on a really bad pc and to get 60 fps non-stop i havge to put the graphics settings on really low. at least i could play, but during update 15 i keep getting lag spikes even at low settings and 60 fps. basically it sucks. one of my absolute favourite games but now i cant play it anymore. if you buy a new pc to suite this then what happens when they release another update and another and another. money wasted when the game was amazing as it was. :)",1
"fun and bloody. also... your in spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"this is a game about space ninjas. nuff said, 10/10",1
"though it has its bugs and glitches, this game is incredible. ive always liked ninja-introduced games, and this is one has proved its self to me. pros 1. kurbows: these mutant dog-like creatures may attack you when untamed but when you destroy a kurbow nest to get an egg (i dont know the logic in that.) you have a chance of getting your own companion. though i like primes as well. 2. good surplus weapon arsenal: some games dont have many weapons for you to choose from, but warframe does indeed. going from a sword and shield to a nice shotgun, warframe keeps providing weapons for even the stealthiest of volts. 3. plenty of warframes to buy and choose from: most games say: once you choose this character you will stay as that one forever. well, some of them do. though it cost lots of platinum to buy them, its worth it for me to test out the others. cons 1. constant control glitching: i found this to be a real nips twister. on an obstacle course i was half-way there when i needed to wallrun and wallclimb at once. i cant tell you how many time ive dealt with the controls bugging out on me. 2. platinum. all the damn time.: youd basically need platinum for most of the stuff you buy. you wouldve thought theyd cut you some slack and make that low priced too since its hard to earn platinum other than the common way, buying it. im not being greedy, i just think you should be able to buy more things with credits. overall, the game is good, but some major patches are needed.",1
"like a poor mans destiny, but has its own flavour... me likey 10/10",1
"the game is pretty much an endless grind to get better items... but i keep coming back to it.",1
"totally the best free-to-play sci-fi mmorpg gmae i have ever played! there is a lot of content and is not really a pay-to-win game. this game gives so many boners just by looking at the smoothe graphics!",1
"stopped playing it a while ago, but its pretty good!",1
"amazing gameplay fun combat system and sweet character growth with flawless multi-player!!!",1
"very fun and addictive. this game boasts tons of collectables to enhance your playthrough, and gameplay immesnly. although at times, warframe may feel like a grind to get that item you really really need for crafting, if you got your friends to back you up, your pretty much unstoppable! i would reccomend warframe to people who like -rpgs -third/first person shooter games.",1
"one of the greatest games i have ever played, you will get hooked on it for weeks at a time.",4
"it is a game developed for players who like sci-fi, cooperative missions, ninjas, and cool graphics all mashed up to form warframe. the game itself is excellent, but the parkour actions are kind of sloppy, if the sloppiness is fixed, then the game would be great!",1
"imagine this as halo 3, but with more customization and in 3rd person.",2
"freakin awesome game! if you like freakin awesome games, this is one to play.",1
"i thuroughly enjoyed ever minute i have played and will play. the only thing i look forward to is the possibility of new characters which i think would be amazing to add more with an already adverse set. hope to see more great things from these artists and their game",3
"simply brillant fun as hell! grafx are off the charts!!! ++++++++++ free to play not pay to play lots of crafting grinding missions is still fun lots of custumizing best community i have ever played with -------------- pay for inventory slots (go figure) drop rate on some items are not just rare but very very very rare hard to get a game going off of the main branch ( i blame the players tho) grafics 9 gameplay 9 control 8 community 8 funfactor 10",8
"warframe is fun. pretty graphics, fun shooting, interesting class ablities. monetization seems fair, though it is kinda pay to win, i can earn anything gameplay related with time",7
"great game! takes a little getting used to controlls but once you do you realise that they are fluid and make the game that much more enjoyable.",1
"pros: -smooth third person shooter -stunning graphics -various ways to approach objectives -maintains the mmo identity by having diffrent classes support each other -tons of customisation cons: -freemium game. pay to win -if you are not investing a lot of time to this game, youre not going to get cool stuff fast this is basically mass effect with less skills and no apparent storyline. other than that, this is one heck of a shooter",1
"a game worth to be recommend... start farming and happy hunting tenno... the patch is fast... and the most and most important... free to play...",6
"if you dont want to be addicted at this game then dont play it.. once you get to the middle of game u will never stop playing this game trust me. its non stop fun. and all weapons can get buy not buying cash. and never buy prime access. because some of them are not worthed trust me. and u can get 25/50/75% discount platinum so dont ever buy pack in steam. its not worthed. first week: this game guns is hard to get. second week: okay, it;s really easy to get guns. third week: hard to get character four week: get the hang of it five week: ohh 75% discount 4,1k here i come. six week: yea prime items seven week: orokin so much fun. trust me you cant stop playing this game once you play it. its really damn   fun.. sorry for swearing lolol trust me go play this game instead of tf2 no offense. tf2 get bored easily and its not a fun f2p game. this is the best f2p game ever. ninja be freestyle .. 69 style oh yeaa",2
"want to play more but the launcher is horrible. first time? worked. second to 50th time? failed. renstal to play. i mean the game is good, but the launcher is bad, i will try the none steam version.",1
"the game offers more then alot of content for a free to play, the melee and ranged combat are stylishly combined and the randomly rearranged levels, bosses and random events makes the game maintain my attention for the long hours, you can join a clan for even more features but i will admit i had to spend money to keep my interest in the game but after the awesome space ninja combat fun i had with the game for 30 or so hours i felt like the game deserved my money. this game will be fun for you it is just up to you if you will take advantage of all that it offers (for free) that will determine how long it keeps you interested, the best way to play is with friends but the online co-op works well enough. update: its been a few updates since i played, the new content is very cool and the ship hub is a great system but once you have made it to the point in the game where you have rank 30 (max) gear the game does become a massive grind for mods, money and resources that being said you only reach that point after many hours of a fun great free to play and there is still plenty of content to explore. positives: great gameplay, mixture of melee and shooting, parkour and abilities many locations, mission types and randomized maps customization of all of your stuff negatives: mod system is still a headache at first grind gaming after a while",2
"i like this game. its best free to play game. i recommended it.",1
"a really good game, the only thing it needs more planets and missions, and they should made golem the infested assasain.",2
"this is a f2p run and gun in 3rd person...it has tons of customization and aaa graphics. a must play for a free game.",1
"games really fun and cool but if you dont want to spend real money on new weapons and warframes, be prepared to play for a looooong time",1
"this game is very good. a lot like mass effect 3s online coop...",3
"this game is just awesome.you can make own warframe.",3
"i would love to play this game......but it just wont start -_-",1
"[before i start, id like to say that i understand that this game is in alpha stage.] there are a few bugs that annoy me, but when i can load it, oh is it fun! [p.s optimal system settings? its real hard to change settings]",1
"amazing game online and single player, you can play campain missions with your friends and other online people, but you cant play against them but hopefully in future updates itll change maybe",9
"its a blast and i hope it evolves into something bigger",1
"an easy explaination of this game would be robot ninjas in space. even though it is still in beta it is a surprisingly solid 3rd person shooter rpg. the skills, suits, and weapons are widly varied and has a little bit for everyone to build a style all of their own. the maximum in a squad is 4 making it very easy to find a group to play any game content with unlike some mmos where many areas require 6 or more just to think about going to. add to that the fact that new content is coming out almost every week and this is definatly a game to keep your eye on.",3
"fun game to play, a little more if with a few friends pay to win is kinda still there but to be expected of a f2p game, almost everything can be earned without paying for it buy takes so much time. crafting new items like weapons or new frames takes ages to find the materials for,save up enough credits and then the build time can be at least a few days, perhaps the devs could shorten these build times to make it more enjoable for people playing free. other than what i said before still great fun to grind through.",2
"free to play shooter, great leveling system all items unlockable in game",1
"linear, but fun. game is easy to understand, better with friends, and has a pretty cool upgrade system. i havent paid a dime and i do not feel obligated to.",1
"space ninjas that have guns and swords. what more can you want in a game. 10/10 download it now.",1
"its all about the platinum baby! thats what benjamin franklin would say if he played warframe. this fast pasted co-operative shooter is loads of fun, but very addictive. play as any of over a dozen supersoliders (warframes) and defend our solar system from threats. this mission based game is free-to-play, but will require a bit of cash to access all the features.",1
"i would rate this game 9/10..................... if you were able to get good hosts. otherwise 6/10, just because bad hosts ruin the core gameplay of this game. the game is great, just lack of dedicated servers makes this game frustrating and annoying to play.",4
"fun game for several days then the reptitive missions start getting to you. i recommend the game if you need something to kill time with. other then that, prepare to grind.... alot",1
"at first glimpse, this is a good looking game. however, after playing it for hours without spending any cash at all, i have bought only a couple of gears. its not bad, just too f*****g hard to make money, gain exp. other than that, youll spend a lotta time in this game.",1
"great game, different, but a new style to shooters",3
"this game soo fun but it crashed too much and thats not good",1
"great free to play game. love how much it has to offer.",3
"this game is awesome, great for co-op with friends. and amazing graphics for only 1gb download!",1
"this game is about runnning up walls and shooting arrows at aliens faces... what els do you need ?",2
"love this game been playing for a long time and its not a pay to win type game as you can make most of the weapons or sell ingame items to other players to make platnum. graphics are great and the gameplay is smooth. give it a shot!!",1
"while im not a big fan of most free to play games, warframe is one that i could come back to and have some fun with. with a lot of stuff to get, fun gunplay, and a rich and vibrant community, warframe is definitely a free to play game you should at least give a shot.",1
"really nice game. graphic level - animation, textures and models are wonderful. battle system is easy and interesting, setting is not pretentious and enjoyable. everything which affects gameplay can be farmed or crafted. a bit boring and monotonous, but really gives joy. try it out and form your own opinion!",1
"warframe is... an ok game. i wouldnt go as far as to say its a good game or its better than red faction armageddon with the download corrupted and a zip bomb inside the download. (if you dont know what a zip file bomb is, google it) anyway... so you play as a robotic alien... robot called a warframe you have to complete missions on different planets with a wide range of people from around your set area. all the levels look like blatant rip offs of the previous level the only difference is that the colour has gone from dark green to dark blue. you can customise your warframe, well, to an extent. at first you can only customise your warframes colour which doesnt make any difference seeing as you only start off with 5 colours of the rainbow that even van gogh wouldnt touch. you get upgrades for your weapons (though i cant tell the difference). the final verdict: id rate this game a 4/10 due to the repetitive levels, tedious plot and the god awful character customisation system. where it says do you recommend this game, steam should have a third option from yes and no it should be labelled meh.",1
"fun fun fun. if u like mass effect 3 muliplayer this game is a must for you. everything in game that cost money can be gotten in game from playing it and getting parts, blueprints, etc. if there ever a game you should try if u like 3rd person shooters, with hackand slash features. also the game is in the beta and they are trying out a stealth approch system to the game, for those of you that like to sneak or stealth about. a must try game cant wait to see the final product",2
"very, very, very fun co op game. even when the enemys are very strange looking",1
"great game love the animations of the dive shot runing on walls and backflipping",1
"this game right here is a prime example of what game are in the end: an entertainment medium. surely it is fun it be inside a story driven rpg, taking a role of a fabled hero in the quest to save the world, but sometimes you just want to have fun. space ninjas, swords, and explosions have to be at least a bit fun",5
"friend speaks highly of it so giving it a try. looks really cool so far tho, im excited",1
"fast paced over the shoulder space shooter. very fun when it gets wild",1
"amazing only thing is my pc sucks so i can hardly play",1
"fun game thats not your average run of the mill free to play,very fun.",1
"i love this game its fun playing with your friends. building some stuff takes a little bit of farming but its not a bother to me. other than that theres nothing elts to the game",6
"yolo swaggins the third is in this games core! :d",1
"this game is pretty fun. at first when i saw gameplay of it on youtube, i thought to myself that this wouldnt be a game for me, but here i am playing it and having fun. you should have some fun and download this game.",1
"as someone whos played a lot of the game (225 hours as of when im writing this), i can say its overall a pretty good game, and its all but boring. it is, however, fairly repititive in its play, and you have to either a) get used to a lot of grinding and waiting, or b) spend money to get things quickly and the way you want them. it is pay-to-win in a few senses, but everything you can get by spending real money, you can get by waiting for in-game time-limited, occasional alerts, which give the same things out. as far as grinding, its like every other game with an rng that tends to hate or love certain players. it has a fairly balanced player market, in which you can sell these *rare* items you get from the rng to other players for platinum, the credits you spend actual money for. so, in a sense, spend time on this game and you can convert it into practical real money. over all, this game is pretty well-done, especially as far as graphics go, and id recommend it to anyone who likes mmos in general, even though the themes and genre may not please others, along with the lack of lore. either way, its a solid game.",3
"chop,chop,chop,space ninjas aaannnnddd more chopping totally awesome",2
"this is a really fun game if you are the type of guy/girl who likes grinding.this is so much better with friends but also fun playing alone or with strangers and the best part it is free.",1
"a really nice game to play with action and many missions to finish.",1
"get this game now unless you dont like sifi ninjas with cool powers and wepons saving the galaxy",2
"old review of apr 2013: team or solo based sci-fi third person shooter, quite fun! new review of sept 2014: be wary, as perfect world entertainment has their gritty claws on the title and i fear this game would become even more grindier than it is now. newer review of oct 2014: it is an ok game, good for wasting a couple hours of co-op fun but there is one glaring flaw with this game is the lack of new map content. seeing the same map chunks used in levels will get tiresome and tedious, especially when grinding to get those rare resources you need to make a new frame or weapon. build time for weapons and frames are unacceptable, do you really want to wait 12 hours for your new weapon or 36 hours to play with your new frame? i sure dont. also the ui as of update 14 is intrusive, clunky and screams console friendly. your ships ai is annoying but thankfully you can mute him. some rank tests are obnoxious, particularly if you are no good with such skill. i am still stuck at rank 8 because i am god awful at mandatory stealth and refuse to rank up. however, i do like the weapon and enemy designs of the factions as well as the lore and history injected into them, which can be read in-game via the codex. the game has a lot of potential, but it needs more map content, a lot more to keep somebody who loves procedural generation in video games.",5
"this game fun. and the main feture is. can co-op with everyone. i love this game.warframe",1
"this is the best game that i have ever played. i cant believe it can possibly be free to play, but there is one problem, the updating. the launcher is horrible which is such a shame, but still get the game!",2
"its like borderlands, but less focused on the story and more focused on the coop gameplay, and a lot grindier. you grow your warframe to be powerful enough to wipe huge hoards of enemies and blow  up. pros: - tons of different guns (and my favourite: bows) and melee weapons and even more mods to modify them - fun and satisfying gunplay / gameplay - many warframes (each warfame has different abillities) - very fair free to play model - endgame and many events cons: - grindy - can become repetitve - its like cocaine but in the end you are still a badass bloodthirsty alien god.",1
"yet another hack-and-slash rpg. unoriginal, yet somehow fresh. warframe combines standard shooting with hack-and-slash gameplay for a familiar, yet new experience. the basics are simple: you have your suit, your sword, and your guns. now go kill stuff. mindless yet attention-keeping, while at the same time testing your ability to adapt to a new situation. the game is riddled with environmental hazards and enemies of increasing strength. from the hideous grineer to the scavenger race corpus, you will never have a dull moment. that is... until the fps starts to tank. for some reason, this game has horrible fps issues, to the point that some have nicknamed it warframe-rate-drop. the devs are continuously figuring ways to make the experience less of a pain, however. i would at least pick it up, if you like hack-and-slash games. dont worry about lag, as you dont have to play online. you can go it alone, or go with up to three buddies, or if youre feeling adventurous, three completely-random-people-you-found-in-chat. have fun!",1
"would be perfect if it had a single player/campain option",1
"i love this game, i will be honest the constant need for platinum is irritating (if you want to good stuff without the long grind) but the gameplay is smooth, the weapons can be amazing when modded to your liking, and the maps are beautifully done. i cant recommend this enough, not everyone likes it but hell - i love it.",9
"great game. it costs money for xbox one, so to a next gen console game for free on pc is awesome.",1
"great game! good gameplay and its quick and easy to get the hang of.",1
"excellent graphics for a free game. rpg format 3rd person shooter. most items in-game can be bought with credits earned from missions or the blueprints to create them via farming materials so you really dont need to spend $$ on platinum, unless youre impatient. love the set up. a lot of fun. the missions maps are randomly generated, too. makes it interesting.",1
"this game is super fun if you like a samurai based gamestyle with guns, explosions, and powers. ratatatata boom boom boom",1
"great game, really and truly. the gameplay is great, the graphics are top notch, the lighting is very interesting as well. the fluidity of the combat, from the gunplay to the sword play is very nice. there are also unique ways of getting around the maps: wallrunning, sliding, super-jumping, ziplining, etc. once you play the game for a while you start to get the hang of it and learn the tips and tricks, it really is alot of fun. this game isnt without flaws however. the crafting system is a bit tedious, sometimes taking hours to compile all the materials required for something. gaining money/experience also takes a sufficient amount of time. all in all, this game is very fun, very entertaining, and can keep you locked in for a while. beware: your pinky finger will want to fall off from holding ctrl for so long...",1
"is a good and fun game to play with other but is too hard to get good gear and after a while it gets very repeating the alert mission and coop missions",5
"the most awsome game ive ever played! play it and youll be attached forever! lol",7
"not so much pay to win as much as pay to not grind as much... overall definately worth a play.",1
"they say that the first step is admitting you have a problem... well im admitting that im flat out addicted to this game",2
"naturally i recommend this game to anyone who loves to run around a space ship killing the bad guys while being a super awesome wicked space ninja!! also missions on planets. obviously. online co-op, third person sex all in one!! and its rare for me to like any kinds of these games o.o",9
"this game is very intruging, there are so many diffrent styles of getting through each wave.",2
"i give this a 5/10 because it crashes way to much for me... but it is still a great game. it looks great the gameplay is perfect i love it... so i recommend that you play this badass game... really... play it now... also it is one of my most faveorite f2p games ever.",1
"almost 200 hours and this game has more bugs than an f rated resturaunt... but...200 hours...",2
"this, no doubt i recommend. it is so great, and its co-op, so you can play with your friends, and it is just fun after you get the hang of it. trust me, play for more then a day, and youll love it.",1
"this is pumped up with lots of action keeps your mind so foucsed you cant tell what time it is so fun!",2
"really is a good game, but the updates take foorever to download and install. and its very frequently updated too which makes it a pain in the . 7/10.",1
"awesome game very rewarding apsolotly free every thing can be earnd your a space ninja warframe is a must play",5
"its a very nice game have funny style of playing nice gore effects unboring levels and nice weapons, but there is one thing it wants too much system requiments for a free too play game (it has nice graphics but thanks to my wooden pc its lagging even in minimum)",1
"the fast paced gameplay of gunz mixed with the graphics of mass effect and a dark scifi setting makes this game highly addictive and beyond what youll expect from a f2p game.",1
"alien cyborg ninjas in space - i think thats all you need to know.",1
"my newest shooter addiction. so far liking the game, just looking forward to more story driven playing. the missions so far dont feel driven, just random. but awesome non the less. graphics are great, sound is great, controls are easy to learn and understand.",1
"this fun game is probably one of the best games on steam, there are many different types if weapons you can use as well as characters. this game is worth downloading, its also free!",2
"warfrane is a pretty fun game. each mission can last a while, granting you several hours of a gameplay. it is best played with multiple people.",1
"awesome game! :) i enjoy it. did not like it at first but once i got playing it, i got into it. if you need someone to play with just let me know",2
"this game is great i like the gameplay but i think games that are free to play try to make you buy things or it makes it harder for you too play untill you buy stuff that will help that is anoying but other then that its a good game",1
"pretty good game, lots of options for various play styles, slow to start, but once you get the ball rolling, you learn it all quickly.",4
"great game but i would recommend you get platnium for completing planets but you get about 50 platnium so you can buy it also but if you complete a planet you also get",1
"brilliant game. lots of fun. start playing everyone! we have a clan with a dojo you are mor than welcome to join :d",4
"very fun game way to much grinding for me (pay to sleep), if you have the time or cash this is a very addictive game",1
"getting back into it after like 4 months not playing. oh god its so weird feeling",1
"this game is alright for f2p would recommend for new users to steam not a bad start for 3rd person shooters. not too much expierence is needed which i like it flows pretty easily throughout most of the gameplay. i would only say that it has minor perks when it comes to the movement and controls if your like me who didnt watch the tutorial, good luck trying to figure out what to do but once learned its straight foward from there. so in conclusion on a scale of poop, 1 being tt, 12 being dog  its like a 4/10",3
"yo the ember chick is really a dude im just saying",1
"highly recommended, especially if you can make small cash purchases. de iis an awesome company, and i love this game immensely.",3
"great game, fleshed out mechanics and fun parkour make it a great and fun romp in the outerspace countryside",6
"probably the best free to play game out there, its a co op third person shooter instead of the endless tide of wow clones out there. has a slightly obtrusive micro transaction system, but considering its a free to play, theres not much to complain about.",1
"warframe is a game that i can say has made me a much bigger fan of the third peasron shooter form of games and not only shooters ,but the haack and slash as well. cause of the mechanics that the game devs have took time to put into the game it shows up in the probuct and i do say that is game is at bare min 8/10 but if you love being a space ninja rambo man then this is the game for you. now dont get discuraged by the limited inventory they give you some plat to get some more space if you go for it at the begging 10/10",4
"a great third-person shooter.i really reccomended it even dough the metascore is 67.the levels might get repetitive but its just fun that you forget about the repetitivity.and thats why out of 10 i would give it an 8",1
"its easy to play and master some the weapons,apart of the tedious time needed to learn some of them.but thats what makes this game ticks.....",2
"i love this game so much. there is so much to do in warframe",5
"really interesting game for the first 30 minutes then you realize it has no end game and youre basically doing the same thing over and over and over.. over and over and over and over and over and holy  this is borring why are we still playing this",1
"amazing third person game. it does require a speperate account then your steam account, but it is super simple compared to other games. amazing costumbility and combat system. if you are looking for a game to play for hours on end this is your game. online multiplayer is buggy, if a match ends the game freezes on the loading of the menu, but minor bugs like that are to be expected in an open beta. amazing game. if they got rid of the in game crystals, which is in game currenct that you have to pay for, and charged about 15-20 dollars for the game i would still buy it. amazing game. i give it a 11/10",1
"en: for me warframe is one of the best f2p-titles on the market. awesome visual style and effects, fast-paced coop gameplay and really fair free-2-play. if you like thrid-person-shooter you should definitely take a look! de: fr mich ist warframe einer der besten f2p-titel berhaupt. top grafik, schnelles coop-gameplay und faires free2play. wer third-person-shooter mag sollte unbedingt einen blick riskieren!",2
"f2p rpg moe pvp 3ps! how many more acronyms do you need to realise this game is insane?!",1
"it has combat and upgrades similiar to mass effect along with a parkour movement system and cooperative gameplay. its free to play but youll probably spend some money on it for slots if nothing else.",1
"one of the more unique games ive played in recent memory: loot grinding space ninja co-op rpg shooter. going from planet to planet, clearing out all the zones and getting good loot, and upgrading said loot, is some of the very fun. think borderlands but with a mission list on a solar map, good if you just want to do one match at a time or hunker down for a long night of gaming. this game can be a bit difficult to figure out at times, the movement and melee feel odd at first and many of the rpg mechanics have a sizable learning curve, but once i figured them out i found it very enjoyable and rewarding to play. the free to play model works well for this game, putting money into the game is more a way of saving time than becoming overpowered. having said that ive put over $100 in to this game (counting the ps4 version as well). i havent done much soloing in the game but it is an option if you prefer, however i find the co-op mechanics very unobtrusive and as long as you stay within an appropriate level range you wont have any trouble with other players. thats beside the point that the co-op is an intrinsic part of the game and more importantly is quite fun. a very fun and addictive co-op rpg shooter.",1
"i just want more weapons to be free! jeez just only one its free and its barely good than the original!",1
"really fun game when i first took a look i really didnt like it but then my friend got me playing it and learning about it.",1
"its a pretty addictive game but its best played with other people. if you try to solo the missions you will be quickly overwhelmed at the difficulty. you tend to run out of ammo quickly and the melee is difficult to pull off with so many mobs. finding friends to play with or joining others will make your experience much smoother in this free to play game. you dont have to spend any money at all!",1
"an amazing co-op game, even being f2p its still triple-a standards. its easily one of the best f2p games ive ever played, very addictive and very fun gameplay that never gets old.",2
"despite the confusing menu and mods, its highly action packed and worth playing co-op. awesome graphics. levels are repetitive",1
"this game is really fun and best of all free and it is now on ps4",1
"ive played warframe for quite some time now and its verry well made, the developers update every wednessday, perform a live-stream every friday, and on thursdays the deves releace videos of what they refer to as prime time durring wich they record and upload videos of there own playthroughs of the game. its encouraging to know that they are so involved with the community and are so generious with there promotional givaways. its free to play so the only question left is, what do you have to lose?",3
"its pretty good... but i eventually stopped playing. you need friends to play this with you for it to be more fun, but that is just how it is with online games. the good -it looks good, it runs fine. nice action and game mechanics. challanging in a good way. fun combat, nice customisation. the bad -can be boring, dependant on other players, takes days to get the good gear, tons of updates, going solo just doesnt work, you have to pay to get the fun stuff if you dont want to wait for days of playing. the ugly - man some of those enemies needs some plastic surgery, they look like someone beat the crap out of them. i would reccomend the game to people who have friends that are willing to play this and have fun with you. otherwise i dont think you would have such a great experiance, but it is one of the greater f4p games out there. so atleast give at try and see what you think.",1
"its fun but if you have a laptop with a grapics card 1696 mb or less you cant play it i never did but im jealous of those who can play it",1
"very fun game. it takes a little while to upgrade your character at first, but gets better with a little time and perserverence.",1
"game is fantastic! loot based mission structure that rewards you for how well you play similar to monster hunter, torchlight or boarderlands. extremely fun multiplayer tactics avalible and the game has a very high skill ceiling. early game is a bit of a grind though, you may find higher levels extremely difficult without a close nit team and the public team joining service is not totally realiable. also- dont get the steam version! steam sucks! get the stand alone game at",1
"i played this game since closed beta and watched this game just get better and more fun for me -can get a little grindy though- but its free! so try it! pick loki as starting class you wont regret it.",2
"lots of character customization available and super fun to play with friends.",3
"i totally love dis game, but one thing is, it needs to hold down on the prices for somethings, but otherwise, its a great game! be a ninja! kick ! like my everyday life on it! i give this game a full 8.9/10 on this! its just wonderful! now stop reading my stupid review and go try it out!!!",1
"sci fi co op shooter with phat lewtz! kinda borderlandish",1
"a well put together game that is fun both solo or in a team, it conveys well the concept of being a space ninja in the future. the controls do have a learning curb, but are mostly simple and intuitive, though take time to master. in the end a very good game.",7
"this game is my current favorite pc pastime. i heard about this game in the summer of last year, but i was not impressed by many of the things that were said about it. i also had doubts about its controls as a third person shooter is not a standard for pc. all of this plus a strong love for star wars: the old republic kept me from investing any time to many other games. however, the fast paced action and parkour of this game have made me fall in love with this masterpiece. its no wonder as de helped create my all time favorite multiplayer fps the unreal tournament series. try it people. youll love it for the gameplay.",4
"i spotted this game shortly before it came along on steam, and considered trying it out. i never got around to it, until it ended up on the front page of the steam store. the game is built on randomly generated levels, and allows a huge amount of customization for your playstyle. like running around wacking things? like teleporting around the battlefield? like picking off your enemies from afar? this game is for you. if youve got a few minutes, just download it and give it a shot. its easy to get into, and gives a lot of gameplay. the only downside ive found, if you can call it one, is that not all of the movements and special skills/attacks are described in the tutorial. i personally find this gives the player some things to experiment with, and grows the experience of working on getting some skill in the game. its free. itll run playably on my centrino 2 processor laptop. its less than two (2) gigabytes, and its about god damn space ninjas. why the hell have you not tryed it out yet?",4
"i love this game! seruuuu abis! xd its race, or we called it, warframe... its power... the alien... and of course... the graphic... warframe graphic is so amazing! cool! game with 4 gb have this beautiful graphic? come on, this is amazing! love this game!",1
"i have been playing for 2 weeks now and so far have 216 hours in, i cant stop playing this game. it is a fast paced 3rd person shooter with decent graphics and great gameplay. the movements can awkward at times and the melee feels a bit sluggish but other than that i have no complaints. you build and research your own weapons from materials and blueprints you find through out your journey. you can also build sentinals, new warframes, equipment or take on a master challenge like me of building your own dojo. the game has a great and helpful player base that is seemingly always willing to answer questions to the best of their capacity. it has a pay to save time system rather than pay to win, in other words if u can buy it, you can farm it. it should be noted however that the best items are earned and can not be purchased. this game has tons of content to always offer you a new challenge and hours fun gameplay while you grind out and learn new tricks to survive. i highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys shooters and grinding/farming games. if you decide to give it a play im always looking for new friends to run with so send me a msg, gamertag dreoyast.",3
"cant really go wrong, its a free to play action mmo. a lot of fun but abit grindy for weapons and warframes (characters) but very rewarding. they are also constantly adding new content. have fun!",7
"amazing game, amazing graphics, great plot,very fun to play with friends,cross platform, a new great idea for a game and all this.....for free so yea i recommend it.",1
"its nice and decent game, if u feel bored of tf2 just join here",2
"fun game when you get to play with other people! works well and quite pretty on low-end computer like mine!",1
"this is the best f2p 3rd person shooter iv played on steam and the best looking. 9/10",1
"for high level its boring -_- dunno what to do anymore :(",2
"ugh, boring. reused level layouts, unneccessary grinding, crafting that takes ages, not to mention the pay-to-win items, such as the other version of excalibur. the mobs are unvaried and get boring to kill after the 1000th time to grind the kills for some stupid item.",1
"while the game has it share of problems (slow to start, absolutely no indication on what to do/how to proceed or even a simple explanation of many of the games various mechanics). if you stick with it past those few tough hours. warframe begins to open up and with it fun (the reason we ultimately play videogames). warframe offers a few variations on the standard kill stuff approach, but ultimately repitition will still set in. this is mostly due to the limited environments and enemy types. however do not let those words steer you away from warframe. at its core, warframe is the poster boy for amazing in small dosages. logging in and killing enemies with other random players might not sound fun; but i assure you it is very much so. the amazing thing that keeps you coming back is the crafting and leveling system. you run into games with people with different warframes and amazing weapons completely dominating the enemy, and that in turn makes you want to acquire new weapons and increase your warframes power. warframe is one of the few f2p games that gets it right. every single thing that is available for purchase can be found as drop items within the game; how much time you put into warframe has a direct effect on how much gear and items youll get out of it for your character.",1
"nice game , awesome graphic , very good co op , cool hero and free 2 play recommended to play with you friend",2
"a game worth the hours. rewarding and very well put together even though its still in its beta stage",5
"awesome game, playeda few hours and im hooked, its f2p and not really pay to win, they really support the f2p side and have awesome content coming out regularly. the gamplay is addictive and getting new warframes is the best!",1
"is very enjoyable when played with others. difficult to earn new items.",1
"absolutely fun game considering the price of free. though, as with all f2p games, convenience of getting things right away (and spoiling all the fun grinding for them) will cost you a pretty penny. cooperative pve game. definitely not pay 2 win. best enjoyed with friends in a private group - unless you want to rush through the missions faster than the speed of light. challenging for solo players (not everything can be soloed!)",3
"good graphic , challenging , cool . totally recommend",3
"the developers are jews but i cant stop playing. :^) 10/10 its pretty good.",1
"awesome game played 85+ hours no its not a lot compared to other people but for me thats a fair amount definitely recommend this game.",1
"my opinion of warframe is biased towards how i find enjoyment (i like grinding in games, no matter how trivial or boring). the gameplay is enjoyable, fun to parkour though there wasnt many places that used it until update 9. the weapons and warframes themselves are quite varied, although serious investment is needed to get the top tier equipment. as of now, the game is still in beta but despite the bugs its a highly decent free to play game. nearly everything in the game you can aquire without any payment, it just takes time. so how much youre willing to spend is how much time you save with the game. you do need a lot of time though, some drops are very low and get lower if youre a collecter of items like me. overall; if you have a lot of time, this is a great game to spend it, especially with friends. if you want to have some money free, you can wait for a log-in reward of a platinum discount (ingame premium currency) and buy some gear. otherwise, if you just want to have fun for a while with little investment, start as an excaliber and slash dash your way to victory one grineer squad at a time.",5
"so yeah, didnt think this would be good. i mean cyber ninjas? yeah....turns out i now have 250 plus hours on it. my favorite game to play on steam now :)",5
"bio-tech space ninjas if john woo made the guyver, this would be the videogame tie in did i mention...space ninjas?",2
"this is a fun and fast paced sci-fi shooter with excellent gameplay. with a variety of weapons, classes and a unique level/ ranking system, its a good free-to-play time sink. micro-transactions can get a bit pricey, but taking advantage of sales as well as in game coupon rewards shouldnt make it a problem. everything that isnt cosmetic or an inventory slot can be obtained without dropping a penny but luck and being online at the right times plays a big part in getting some of the rarer items. overall a swell f2p shooter with good mechanics that is definitely worth anyones time. also space ninjas!",8
"fantastic game, just dont know why the metascore is relatively low. but in my opinion, its a gorgeous game with really high graphics. i especially love this kind of co-op shooter which emphasis on teamwork. in a nutshell, this is a really amazing and definitely one of the most awesome free-to-play games out there. rating: 8.5/10",1
"really nice game! playing with friends, and killing some bots! you should try it ^^",1
"1 of the best free game awesome graphics and easy to understand game",1
"this is a great game, i suggest getting this game, since its free and it has great graphics. i wouldnt suggest buying the packs, but other than that its awesome.",1
"awesome game love that i get a bow to do headshots with!!",3
"warframe is a fun game. it makes me feel like a badass running through a level liking all, or sneaking in and assassinating. trust me its awesome",1
"this game is fun, dont get me wrong. but takes a long time to acumulate any descent goods.",7
"bcoz its really good and ._. the gameplay was soooo ! fun :) and adventure..... dont worry when start u have nothing....the community got some nice people ;) soo dont be all lonely and try to speak out :d",1
"for a free game warframe is amazing. i heard its supposed to be really good for consoles. everyone shoud get it",1
"this game is amazing i love it so much. highly reccomnend it",1
"great graphic, good variety in ennemy type and weapon. all in all, this is a great game",2
"warframe, for me, has been the game that keeps on giving. it is incredibly action packed, the combat system is smooth and customizable, and the graphics are just beautiful for a free to play. while there are some set backs such as need/terrible pricing of platinum, this game is one of the best ftps out there.",1
"i dont like warframe a little cuse i waited 12 hours and after waiting 12 hours thre was an update so havent played it yet",1
"i was in this game for beta, so im not sure how the standard player feels about this game, but the steps its taken all the way up were satisfying and interesting every step that i could play in. while the original mod setup was fun, the trading card aspect makes it a more social kind of feel. missions are randomly generated around common tileset, positive or negative, its a feature that it is well suited to. tenno (the players class essentially) are an ancient warrior race in organic-looking powered armor, fighting a crumbling military structure and an intergalactic corporation... its actually an okay overarching theme to the third person shooter market. while the four revives thing sounds terrible, if youre playing online there will be tons of squads. teamwork is vital to solid gameplay, so lone wolves may need to spend a little time slumming it before finding a solid loadout. overall, i like this game, and definitely plan on playing it more. solid combat with simple controls at its core with a visually interesting thematic for the rest of the game. some sets are a little repetitive, but the sheer combinations of setpieces theyre putting together is staggering, and theyre always improving. play it or dont, ive said my piece on it, enjoy.",2
"amazing game, awsome engine, a mix of dead space and mass effect recommended!",1
"although this game is still constantly changing, i find that there remains one constant: fun. i know, i know. the missions all start to blur together and we all hate that dreaded escort mission where the prisoner goes full  and dives into a group of grineer, but truly this gamme continues to bring the fun. day in, day out. it gets a little negative hype with the possibility of pay to win, but whether you spend $1 or $100 on this game, you still end up having an absolute blast with it. i definitely recommend this game...especially if you have friends to play it with.",2
"warframe is essentially like john woo and uma thurman combined.",1
"this is a great game!!!! although it is in beta it is epic!!! get it!!!",1
"this game has some pretty sick graphics. all though, if you have a crappy computer you might wanna turn down the settings.. by alot. the combat system is a bit difficult to get used to but when you do you feel like a total ninja bad***. in all, i really like this game and its amazing that a game this cool is free to play. try it out.",1
"okay lets get this straight, this game at the time is still in beta. so many things are bound to change. i havent found a co-op game as fun as warframe in a very long time from games like borderlands. the visuals are completely amazing ranging from tiny particles to them dramatic explosions to amazingly designed maps and scenery. the gameplay is ing awesome. i mean you get to be a space ninja, parkouring everywhere and blasting enemies in the face with various weapons. the community is also pretty awesome and is always growing. that about sums it up. im not a good writer so dont expect much. overall its an awesome experience that got my eye the instant i saw it. although stuff might not make sense to you if youre new to the game, so i highly suggest a stop at the warframe wiki or the forums for advice.",5
"great game! hard to stop playing it, once you finnaly figure out what it is your doing! :d",7
"youre a space ninja praying to rngesus in hopes of getting the phat loots. its diablo meets gunz (if you can remember that !)--its borderlands without the gun customization and talent trees, and instead a new layer of grind bound to mods which allow for an extensive and delightful amount of customization one rarely sees in games such as this.",2
"can honestly feel pretty addicting sometimes. they fixed the issue of feeling like you never had enough money (by letting you earn lots of money in randomly spawned events). the guns and melee weapons are fun, if annoying to find a combination that actually works well. progression can feel slow at times, which can be aleviated with an injection of cash, but damn near everything can be aquired through game play alone (if incredibly difficult due to randomness and availability of certain random items) the most frustrating part is how long new warframes take to aquire. you have to farm/buy 4 different blueprints that take 12 hours (three of them can be crafted simultaniously) and then you need to combine those three parts in a 3 day (physical days that is) for your warframe to complete. and even then a free account is only given two slots for warframes at any given time. this is odd as theres ample slots for weapons, but not even enough to let you experiment a bit. but dont let my nagging fool you, it really is a fun game for the most part. definately worth the free cost if youre willing to invest the time. plus, you get to be a friggen gun toting",2
"really smooth. clean, epic third person game that is worth i being free. as a compudder that isnt that much of a video game comepudder, it runs pretty darn smooth. 5 outta 5.",1
"really good fps ! everything is buyable with ingame credits, no need to pay, just farm. sometimes bluescreen happen, but this will be corriged, its a beta ! i play with my friends and its really cool, we can create unique warframe by using mods, and its the same for weapons. get it and play !",1
"not bad for a free game, but has a lot of recycled tilesets, grindy gameplay and just gets repetitive after awhile. 6/10",1
"a huge thumbs up for it...its an aweseom fun game",1
"awesome game i like how it is but it seems glitchy to me",1
"its a great game featuring three different tiers of enemies you fight through and on the way you encounter new people and things such as clans where you can build new and awesome weapon and new frames. overall i find this a great game and it brings a new kind of element as its in third person view :d",2
"the most improving free to play title so far. no real endgame content yet just pokemon syndrome, gotta collect them all. but that doesnt mean it cant be fun on the way does it?",10
"great game but make sure you spend begining platinum on warframe slots",1
"fast, simple and fun co-op action. the control-scheme is particularly impressive, streamlined to make you feel like you look like you know what your doing at all time. less cowering behind low walls, more sliding along the floor in 3rd-person shooters, thanks.",3
"this game is the most fun game i have played in a wile. i recomend this to any one who enjoys a saints row feel and a space shooter mix.",2
"where do i begin with this game? its mechanics are fantastic, its fast paced third person shooter goodness, it looks good and plays good at the same time. sometimes there are little bugs but im pretty sure its still in beta so i forgive them. its still a whole lot of fun!!",4
"this game is really fun and addicting and i really recommend this game to people who like ninjas, freerunning and fast paced combat.",3
"its so awsome for a free game. the graphic are so sweet and the animation too.",1
"warframe is a sci-fi ninja action game. it gives you the thrill of a assassins creed and futuristic starwars skill game. in my opinion it is awesome. there are added features of character customisation and special abilities that you can use to over power you oponent. it also has an exiting speed up multiplayer feature where you and some friends can complete levels together.",1
"love this game never gets boring awsome graphics and epic gameplay love it and best of all its free. if you like fps games then this is a definite try this game should be one of the greats in mmorpg games its amazing from its intriging gameplay and mod customizations the possibilities are endless in the way you can crush you foes with your primary, seconday and melee weapons is defintly one of the best games ive played so far. this far surpasses other games such as skyrim, final fantasy and many others hope this was helpful to all who wish to play have fun",3
"i have no words to describe how frickin awesome this game is!!!!!!!!! a must play game for a fan of the sci fi genre!!!!!",1
"can someone please help me i got a ultimate game card and when i enter the number in the promo box it said its invailed also when i cant see any other way to enter it because the only box i see is the steam box with the options for 3.99 ect, please someone help...",1
"crazy fun shooter with rpg background. lots of upgrades, guild system etc...",1
"in this game, youre a badass space ninja doing badass space ninja things who has guns. 10/10 its k i guess -ign",1
"extremely well done for a hack an slash. would be nice if they add a pvp feature or expand on map layouts, but given its beta status, im quite happy with where its at right now. even spent money on it :o thumbs up for sure!",2
"a game about space ninjas killing decaying clones and corportae , whats not to like? also, did i mention that the different warframes (characters) can  up  in alot of different ways? well, now you know.",4
"my review of this game is it is just awsome and i would recoment it to every one",1
"for a f2p this game is legen-wait for it-dairy. warframe has fantastic graphics with an excellent third person over the shoulder combat view remaniscant of mass effect, granted there is no cover system not that it is need with the fast paced action death machines the player inhabbits. sum this game in one word......... awesoooooooooooome.",5

"amazing! why is this free to play?!?! oh well, thank you warframe developers for being soooo amazing makeing such a game! its exactly what i wanted in a game! dungen crawling to an extent and then missions with customable powers and characters in a perfect 3d effects land of bad  guns and gorez!",1
"warframe is a great game with alot of different yet intersting classes to play as. the level based nature of the game makes you feel proud once youve beaten a hard boss or created a new warframe. it does a great job of balancing the ability to make things in the game versus buying them. the game is also graphically impressive, yet not intense on your system, making it perfrect for almost anyone. 10/10",7
"ninjas + space/sci-fi + epic weapons + magic powers + zombies + robots + cyborgs + explosions + a ton of gamemodes = ing amazing, gg, de (digital extremes), whoo!",8
"a cross between monster hunter, tenchu, left 4 dead and halo. brilliant!",1
"very good game, a lot of fast breathtaking action nad excellent graphics :) i hope they will make more classes and add few new enemies.",3
"interesting f2p game about being a space-ninja called a tenno. the gameplay reminds me of mass effect 3s multiplayer where you run around 3rd person camera and shoot stuff while using four powers based on your class. your class and weapons can all be modded with cards that you pick up by killing enemies, but you also need to level your gear to gain points to use to equip the mods. the crafting system takes extensive real-time (12 hours for most pieces of gear and 72 hours to craft a new warframe which are the different classes.) i enjoyed the game, but i dont like the restrictions on f2p characters. you are limited to only having 2 warframes unless you pay real money to unlock additional frames. perhaps this is fair, but the only other option is to sell the warframe you spent so much time leveling in order to try out a new one. do you get a lot of money for selling your old friend? no, you dont. if you decide that you actually liked the older frame more you have to gather materials and wait 72 hours to recraft and then relevel it. not fun.",1
"this game is amazing, really is. runs on many graphics cards and everything. i got one problem tho, for some reason steam wont say i havve any hours or achievements even though i have over 200 hours... anyway this game is great 2 thumbs up!",1
"with a great assortment of weapons and warframes to choose from warframe can certainly give you a lot of playtime as you explore the solar system. it was the first game i have ever played which made me want to spend the money on it rather than finding ways to wring it out of my pockets. the development teams is great but after having invested over 400 hours of fun gameplay you do tend to lose interest. overall a wonderful free to play game, definately worth your time to try. it does have a steep learning curve so bring a friend who knows or look at the wiki, that is being worked on but for the moment its your best friend.",9
"this game is definitly worth playing, even though pvp is lacking but hey its still beta",2
"this game is by far one of the best games ive ever played. it can be hard to start playing, but once you get past that, its the most action packed and intense game. with different variants of powers, weapons and movement, this game could easily consume hundreds hours of your life.",10
"fun game if you like doing backflips, wall climbing, and lots of par-core. on top of a space shooter. so basicly your a freaking space ninja!!!",2
"if you enjoy tps or fps or basically any shooter with amazing graphics, skills, mods, etc play this. i played this since closed beta and its amazing. they continue to add more improvements and the game itself is beautiful. you can unlock basically everything through experience and effort. you dont have to cash out to get powerful weapons or mods. play this damn game! oh and the staff are awesome as well!",1
"free, is a big thing with this game. either you can grind out getting weapons. or you can buy things for real life money, or u can make them with things you will find on your missions.",1
"honestly i like this game and its a great play. except you have to test your abilities to level up. and you can only do it once every 24 hours and only one chance. i have tryed 3 days running and it just makes me more made each day. especially when you have the last enemy almost dead.",1
"its really fun if you have freinds other wise its a ;ittle hard but that might just be me.",1
"great game, but would be nice if there was a daily reward of platinum instead of having to buy every time.",1
"warframe is absolutely stunning! not only is the game beautiful, but the story is deep, and the gameplay is fluid. its an amazing game, and its totally free. i hugely recommend this game. one side note, there is less lag if you turn bloom off, in the graphics options.",2
"infinity blade meets metal gear rising....whats not to love? i havent played this game long and i know its still in production beta but just playing the tutorial got me hooked, the animation is stunnig(if a little choppy so far) hard not to feel cool while playing it!!!!!!",2
"this game is excellent. i started off skeptical, but soon fell in love with it. its got a unique playing style and a great system for personal development and cooperational playing styles. its very fast-paced and requires brilliant tactics and skillful technique, but is easy for even the most basic of players to grasp. while it is excellent, it is also a bit boring at times, and can often leave one wondering whether or not it was even worth the gigs of memory and time spent on it. one concludes yes, but constantly doubts the aforementioned conclusion and begins questioning other life decisions such as, but not limited to: -marriage -career choice -college 8.5/10- would recommend.",1
"one of the best free games that i have ever played",1
"action shooter games arent normally my style, but this one snagged my attention in a good way, im pretty hooked.",10
"the game is absolutely epic! the modding and customizations make the game highly dynamic. i recommend this game highly. also you can trade your souls for platinum. i got a syndana :3",4
"warframe is awsome with a capital a!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2
"be the ninja. feel his chop-chop-being-everywhere-killing-everything skills course through your computer! you will not regret it. not a moment of it. best co-operative third person shooter i have ever played(they are not numerous, but i will never move to another tps now!) best thing is: its free!!! get it naow! asap! the likes of it! :d see you in-game!",4
"coop experience is great! without teamwork you are sure to loose. the random mission system is cool too knowing that you wont be playing the same objectives when you replay a mission. most of all i gotta say the optimizations in this game are amazing... my weak pc could run it at 30+ fps. i was astonished on how smoothly it ran. this is the game for you if you like coop and have a weak pc. (now make sure your pc isnt that weak.. lol...)",6
"warframe is a great f2p 3rd person shooter, after the tutorial you get a choice out of 3 warframes. loki which has great support and is the fastest warframe, excalibur which has powerful offense skills, and mag which has amazing magnetics powers. all of which can be unlocked over time for free by killing the specific boss that drops their parts. it has a very indepth customization and sort of a rock paper scissors with the new damage formula. grinner are weak to puncture, corpus are weak to impact, infested are weak to slashing. to make this game really great you need to have friends to play with, pugs are doable but if you have 3 friends in differnt warframes with differnt equipment sets you feel really badass as you rip through enemy forces effortlessly. this kind of game you ether love or you hate, and since it is f2p why not give it a couple of hours to decide its well worth it.",6
"really fun, great features, very nice game, only problem is for some users graphics may cause lag",1
"its a 3-d 3rd person shooter that allows players to fight with other players or by them selves it also has an amazing arsenal of weponry and can allow many different play styles.",1
"warframes a pretty good game to play with a bunch of friends. cooperative play is a must, yet solo is satisfying as well when you play solo missions. i would recommend this game to those of you looking for a game to play with others at a lan party!",6
"great game, you can virtually unlock anything via blueprints which can be found/bought at the store for normal credits. enjoyed this game quite a bit, can get a bit repetitve but its new playstyles really do help. protip : you should always be working towards new warframes.",4
"im addicted to this game. its f2p on pc and ps4 so if you have a ps4 play it there so you can be 100% garanteed some amazing combat visuals. i got my starter warframe to rank 30 (cap) already and my 2nd warframe is almost finished constructing. its mostly pve, only pvp is combat arenas inside clan dojos.",4
"excellent game. i dont think i will get bored witht his one anytime soon.",1
"fantastic graphics, smooth gamplay. i cannot believe this is a free-to-play game. just got done with borderlands 2 and this easily rivals in co-op. mode. tiles might get repetative, but ai scaling is precise. you want challanging gameplay, its got it. you want fast paced action, its got it. you want to keep coming back night after night and researching whats next during the day, this game will do it.",3
"anyone who says this game is not a blast has not played long enough. while i have not offically beaten the game, i enjoy the game immensly. the vast array of missions while feeling boring change drasticly when you simply change your warframe. stail play is only the result of refusing to change the weapons/warframe your currently using. the variety of warframes and weapons, and teh designers constant desire to put out new weapons and warframes makes a highly appealing game only that much more appealing. as they say, its freaking ninjas with guns!",4
"one of the best game ever. finally able to have a game with great update, great contents and all for free",4
"kill things, get materials, make better weapons, kill bigger things. what more do you want? 11/10",1
"i love this game but it crashes for me whenever i press e to strike or shoot so i cant play and get the full experience, anyone who knows how to fix this problem please show it.",9
"a lot of running good combat animations alot of hack and slash in 3rd person mode. remembers me a game named oni i played like 10 or 12 years ago maybe..",1
"i like this game because it have so much eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeew moments in it and i also like it because it had a very high level of blood thanks for reading blood",1
"best free to play game out there with its shooting mechanices. the co-op well put in this game with you working togther alot. the best it the clan options with making a clan and bluiding it up.",1
"this game is great and the graphics are amazing along with the gameplay",2
"warframe is set in a universe where the solar system is locked in unending conflict between the tenno, the corpus, and the grineer, while the infestation threat looms over all three. you can carry out a number of different mission types to collect materials, credits, blueprints, and simply prove your skills while culling the unending threat. warframe is a game about farming at its core. you collect materials to make more weapons, warframes, and companions, eventually switching to new ones while customizing abilities and stats to suit your play-style. and while the game is in essence about farming, the combat, power, and movement systems allow one to create a very entertaining spectacle of flashing steel and lead. run on a wall, jump off, spin like a helicopter, and decapitate a grineer soldier, then top off the display by landing into a graceful slide followed immediately by another instantaneous guillotine slash from your weapon. learning to carry out movement combinations and power uses all while using firearms and blades of all sort is what makes this game really enjoyable. but, you might eventually get tired of the farming and look for a different experience.",4
"this game is a awesome 4 man squad shooter. the missions can get a little repetitive but it is fun if you play them in different styles :)",4
"7/10 best farming simulator ive ever played. lacks in lore and end-game mechanics, but its still open-beta, and digital extreme adds to it usually once a week. definately worth someones time.",7
"a hot game full of dismemberment and gore and awesome character models. fun to play with not to eat.",2
"i love this game. i have been playing this game for the past 2 weeks and it is one of the best games i have ever played. it is like a cross between assassins creed and halo or a space ninja simulator. with many diffirent characters and weapons to choose from as well as hundreds of upgrades for equipment this game has a massive amount of customization.",2
"warframe is a different kind of free to play game. instead of barraging you with ads, or forcing you to buy things you dont want, it completely keeps the aspect of a regular month-to-month or one time pay type of game. while some could fight and say its , pay to win, i beg to differ. while you can use platinum, the games currency for real money to game transactions to purchase already made weapons or new characters, youre not limited to having to use your money. instead you create the items, making the game that much better, thus the games fun lies within the aspect of creating and gathering materials for items and trying to be the fastest or the strongest tenno the solar system has ever seen. anything you can buy, you can create. it may take a few hours of fighting but then where would the fun in the game be then? in summary, warframe is a new twist on the f2p game industry, by one single characteristic that makes warframe collect most likely the most revenue of any free to play and that is they do not force you to purchase items. no one likes being forced into anything , especially not a game, and this game, one where the devs listen intentively to the players, patch things accordingly, and make the game all around enjoyable by not making you pay for a monthly subscription or limiting your activites by not paying, derserves more respect than it can ever obtain. plus: ******* space ninjas. 11/10",2
"combines the best o sword fighting games and third-person shooters into one, its purely amazing",1
"i feel like a ninja now... thanks to warframe. ... hell, thats all i should write on this review. lol play it!",1
"warframe takes a while to really pick up with regards to both plot and gameplay but the awkward start definitely pays off.",1
"dont rush through the maps. take your time and explore every nook and cranny. its worth it.",1
"good for few hours - you select a mission gun trough it and repeat, nothing more - 10/10 would not bang",1
"graphics and gameplay are both really good , micro transactions are a little expensive though.",1
"i liked it so much i became a hunter level founding member. seriously, this game is impacting my time on other games, its just that good. its ftp... what are you waiting for?",10
"ninjas in space. not a bad game, really repetitive. and lets not forget lots of grinding. concept is great along with graphics. still needs some work but is going in the right direction. 6 out of 10.",1
"awesome. i recomend that they make more out door missions though. and perhaps usable turrets and vihicles for the out door missions",1
"i only reccomend it if you really enjoy grinding i love to grinding because im an idiot. all the varity in weapons and frames make it pretty fun",3
"its fun. ive played over 525 hours. its a f2p i spent money on. what better recommendation can i give? play it.",8
"this game is beyond awesome. it is completely free, not pay to win, and has many options for battle and customozation. in this game you play the tenno, and the enemy soldiers are hunting you down. you complete several missions. great maps, pvp is great, and awesome animation. play this game!",1
"fast pace game blending hack and slash with shooting and a tinge of parkour. step into the shoes of a tenno, a space ninja with an assortment of powers. define what that means. be as stealthy, as powerful, or as cooperative as you must be to fight against the remains of our solar system long after war and greed ravaged it.",3
"so far the best free to play fps i can find on steam amazing graphics actual strategy in stuff never boring cause the levels are never the same exactly. not one of those easy to beat games nor is it a impossibly hard game its just... i dont know how to say this in words",2
"the gameplay itself is very smooth, with combat and objective-completion meshing seamlessly. for those who like mission-style gameplay, the map and world progression are well-paced. stealth gameplay is not as overpowered as in other similar games, with tanking and dps being equally viable.",2
"even though this game is extemely boring, takes forever to accomplish things, derives you from your money. its still a pretty fun game once you are at a high sequence in the game.",1
"really enjoyable to play and im not sure why we have to get a key to be in our clan",1
"fun, but takes a decent amount of grinding to level up weapons and warframes and they want money for a lot of items with no other way to attain them.",2
"games pretty good only been playing for 3 months and im impressed with what is has to offer. have any questions about it ask. dont know how to say it but parkour like assassians creed. mixed with mass effect i would say.",2
"warframe is one of the best f2p i ever played and one of the best right now. all the pepole say its pay 2 win and that its takes too much time to get something is wrooong. you just need to know where to farm and have good teamats. you can acautally sell your rares in game for platinum. the gameplay is pure fun,tons of guns,warframes and alot of options. you can mod your gun to your like and make it like you want. the game keep getting updated with tons of new contact. i recommned trying this game,its free. i would recommend use your starting platinum on warframes and wepons slots and join to a good clan(no need for the big 1000 ones). the players there will help you get all the cool gear and help you get started.",3
"i love this game, you are a space ninja, what more is there to say? 10/10 would space ninja again.",1
"i highly reccommend this game because it is fun to play and easy on your system for the people who dont have $1000 computers and the way it is set up is great and i enjoy every second and the daily events are great fo those little bonues and you get to meet new players that way :) overall 5 out of 5 for me",1
"its a good game , just has some bugs such as weird bomb outs and lag over other servers on public , also there are no s.a server that would make it better",4
"this is an epic game based in the distant future where clans fight against each other in endelss combat to control space",1
"amazing. it has a few bugs and glitches. also a lot of server issues. overall it isnt pay to win. recommended.",2
"if you dont like ninjas in space then well, id learn to. warframe is a fast paced extremely costomizable, over the should experiance. i have not played a game as interesting and engrosing as this one in a long time.",1
"the first and probably only free to play game ill ever pay money for. beautiful.",3
"for an fps, this really has a neat story to it. i like the action, even plays well on a laptop. (although the default video settings were way to high; whatever happened to autodetect?) for free, this really is quite good - so far i dont get that gimme money, you stupid little monkeys! vibe as seen in so many free android/ios games where that is rampant. smooth action and highly detailed models. ton of customizations (when purchased or unlocked). * <2 hr in-game so far",1
"yes - very worth while f2p - download and play a few hours",2
"this a very good third person mmorpg and whoever doesnt think it would be good then try it you will get hooked",1
"best 3rd person shooter yet with some knife action",1
"if want good graphics and good gameplay you should really play this game",1
"the odd and unique art style can initially be a turn off, but once you try the gameplay it is fun and engaging. its a fluid and fast paced third person shooter with some neat melee, parkour, and stealth gimmicks. its great for playing with friends and offers some nice variety in ways to play. but there are some negative aspects to it as well, first and foremost is the huge emphasis on grinding, everything has to be leveled up, characters, pets, and weapons - and after applying upgrades, must be leveled up again. grinding is the only way to acquire parts for crafting new items without spending real money, and crafting takes a considerable amount of real world time (days usually) to encourage spending money again. three enemy types, and a limited amount of tilesets that make the randomly generated levels also do not help when you find yourself doing the same thing over and over just for some self imposed quest for slightly better gear. it is fun, but i found that it generally overstays it welcome and becomes more and more of a chore as you progress.",3
"a great game to play with friends, a full party always works best. its likely going to feel a bit strange at first because of the menu setup and such, but stick with it and it gets really fun, really fast.",1
"a very fun and interactive gameplay,good playtime is possible without micro-transactions,but its not going to be nearly as easy and at some times might be frustrating...",1
"fun, but repetative, dont even bother playing it solo because youll get bored within 3-4 missions. however, if you have a group of 3-4 then it can be really fun.",1
"this game, due to its free-to-play nature, does become a bit grindy after the first few levels, if you wish to hold on to your money. this is of little importance, however, since the gameplay is so fun. when i play, im rarely farming enemies or bosses to work toward that next level up or new weapon, instead, im just playing to have fun. its easy to lose hours of your life in this shooter.",1
"itll change the way you see in a 3rd-person shooter game...",8
"highly enjoyable, immersive game with intense, quasi-realistic graphics. if you have a high-end graphics card, your experience will be reminiscent of a 3d cgi movie. very high quality. to sum up the game? space ninjas. that is all you need to know to find this game awesome. easy to use basic controls, more advanced mobility including wall running, long distance jumps, slides and flips to make you feel like a real ninja. plus, the co-operative element is important. every member of a squad is essential. dont let anyone tell you otherwise.",4
"i love this game its awesome have alot of updates and always fun with friends :d",7
"great game, good graphics for a free to play, lots of depth if you want to get into it.",1
"loved ir , im not a big fan of this type of games but this one blew my mind ! fast paced heath beating adrenaline boosting tps. recommended a lot",1
"you dont have to spend money on this game. thank god. 8/10",1
"it was really fun playing with friends. if you dont have a core group to play with, random encounters can get broing fast.",1
"its a free to play and its my fav free to play on the market!",1
"what can i say this game is fun lots of different options for weapons what frame you use what mods you use its really fun and its free so you cant really go wrong",1
"first played this just over a year ago and im not going to lie, i really didnt enjoy it. i picked it up again about a month ago and so much has changed. the game has now hooked me and im gonna admit im addicted. the missions are fun with friends and the in game crafting system doesnt feel like too much of a grind. i found it a bit hard to set an active clan up but other then that its a pretty decent game especially as its free to play!",1
"i just love the atmosphere the feeling and the gameplay. even when you repeat the same stages 20x a day its okay. i just love it :d and btw it looks fkin amazing",1
"visually impressive game, with great gameplay. 8/10",1
"awesome game! many bugs but the dev team is the best i have ever seen. many bugs are fixed with every update. i love this game!",1
"alot like the console game destiny only that its a tps and not fps. the thing i like most is that it has alot of game content and that it also has a singleplayer mode also in which there are public events! so if a person cant finish a level by himself he can contact a friend and they can do the misiion together!",6
"easy to get your moneys worth out of. looks good, surprisingly compelling combat and hard to put away. you live in space, gather potatoes and shoot the boxheads and blowup dolls. best enjoyed with friends.",4
"this is amazing. graphics are great, the overall skill set was fine and the missions seemed entertaining. good job :d",1
"great game graphics are perfection and ht eover all mobility in the game is great i like how its controls are easy adn it gives the option to go solo or co-op",1
"i havent played for very long, but i like what i see. impressive visuals, perhaps a bit cluttered. exessive motion blur makes you seem that much faster and adds a different, but cool feel to movement. items are not easily obtained, but most can be earned without real money. if you do decide to pay, its a lot of cash for not many credits. my biggest (one of very few) issue is that the warframes (classes) are gender-specific and do not have boy/girl models. overall, a fun game thats definitely worth a try. use it as a nice change of scenery or make it your newest ethusiast obession.",1
"cyborg-space-ninjas fighting aliens, robots and zombie-aliens. where can you go wrong?",1
"its a good game with ninja-like graphic. i know ninja because im asian. :d",1
"this is a great game blending the two worlds of customizable characters to fit your personal play style and the classic third-person shooter",1
"this game took me by surprise. i havent played a game like this ever espically for free so i think everyone should give it a shot this game rocks.",1
"one of the best co-op game i have ever played. a futuristic awesome game. splendid graphics. having missions all around the solar planet and defeating each boss and taking control of the planet. very nice range of weapons and characters/warframes and sentinels. a third person awesome game.",1
"this is a really good game,it is relly really fun u guys all need to try it",3
"very good game, i cant say much more because i pratically have no words for the amaze and epicness i had in some runs, i recommend it 100%.",1
"pros: -great multiplayer -frequent updates -different charicters cons: there are a few game breaking glitches in warframe most going out the map or going through a locked door. but if your a simple minded person and wouldnt give a damn about that youve got yourself a great 3rd person shooter!",4
"awesome game, get it. whats not to like, its brilliant and its free",1
"a fun sci-fi grind game where you fight enemies, get matierials, and make better weapons. sci-fi ninjas, nuff said.",2
"its too badass with the sliceing and diceing and the shooting 9/10 for me",1
"brilliant game for those who like the whole android samurai third person shooter type games in space going from planet to planet lvling up and upgrading personally i love this game.",1
"space ninjas or as the people want it to be space vikings in ninja suits",8
"played alot of games of all types.the graphics ,illistration,the all around make up of the game in my opinoin is awesome .make sure you get a good video graphics card you will need it.alot of detai, and work in this game .good job digital extremes nicely done!!!!",1
"clean design, fast-paced environment, and loads of content to immerse yourself in. definitely worth a try to say the bare minimum.",1
"really fun game cant wait to try out all the new goodies",1
"amazing, extremely fun, i dont think i can put down this game in any way other than why is it free?. if anyone sees how fun this game is and doesnt download it, i will come to their house, slap them, download it and force them to play it.",1
"tons of fun for a free to play.....as terrible and unquoteworthy as that is",2
"though i dont play this on pc, that is only because my pc cant run it, i do however play this on ps4 and i can tell you that this is an amazing game. the tutorial is not that helpful and it is confusing at the start and many people are put off by that, but if you can understand it, it is a unique gaming expirience",1
"i do have to say this game rock!!!!!!love it, coming from xbox 360 fan.",1
"this game may seem complicated at first but once u start playing its ing awesome",6
"this game is really good but it takes a little while and dedication to get really good stuff",2
"ninjas in space. that is basically the premise of this game. it also involves a lot of grinding and such but is completely free to play and you can get everything (less a few cosmetic items) by simply playing...which is pretty cool imo. also ninjas. inspace.",3
"i have a quad core 3.5ghz 6gb ram and 1gb hd graphics and i cant play it in full hd",1
"space ninja 3rd person shooter what could be better",4
"ive only played this game for....not that long, and its already amazing! i recommend playing this game!",1
"thoroughly recommended with the constant updates from the development team, becomes more intricate every day.",5
"this is one of the most promising betas ive ever played. the developers excitedly add additional content regularly, and have huge things planned for the future. a+ 10/10 would play again. theres literally no reason not to at least play this game every once in awhile.",4
"fun game, its free, its awesome. get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"so much fun, and while you dont need to buy platinum to have said fun, it really helps. i find the prices pretty damn steep though. at half price they are what youd expect to pay for the amount.",1
"great game i feel that there needs to be more of a storyline (in your face) where i feel like a im playing for a reason i get it but it just dosent feel like a story in a way but besides that fliping awesome ninja aliens! great i deffinetly say you should get this game plus its free",1
"a fun third-person co-op shooter. great quality despite being free to play and on beta. best played with friends. in-game purchases via micro (or macro) transactions is possible, but more as a convinience rather than as a way to get otherwise unattainable weapons, of which some of the best are only available through crafting and active participation in the community (joining clans etc.) all-in-all a very fun game to play, with lots of options and flexibility. and if youre skeptical, just get some friends, download the game for free, and give it a try, aright?",2
"free to play sci-fi mmo third person shooter that happens in space and ninjas? if youre not playing warframe, youre doing your life wrong",2
"my addiction to this game has given me anorexia; so five stars.",3
"this game should be ported to linux... asap... like now..",1
"you should play this game cos the warframe character are highly strong and u get 5 revivants each time u die",1
"very fun game once you know what to do. you have to play it for a little while to really understand.",2
"this is the best space ninja simulator on the market right now.",1
"lots of action and killing, and slashing, and shooting... and jumping :d",1
"this game is simply amazing! the storyline and gameplay is just addicting! the graphics are also insane, but only if you have a good computer, but even with my computer, which is crap, i can run at a solid 30 fps with the game still looking great!",7
"warframe follows a simple, a-b-c premise. a is one to four cyborg alien space ninjas from space. c is where they need to be. b is fifty to two hundred evil space fascist clones, evil space tech cultist blue collar workers, or evil space zombies. if that doesnt tell you everything you need to know, its still worth a try!",2
"for a free game. this takes the cake. yes i absolutely recommend this game! it has a good story and has infinate things to do.",5
"do you like ninjas? good. do you like space? good. that means you like space ninjas with magical powers. i highly urge you to get this game, and join the tenno cause.",1
"for people who like shooting games and ninja aliens. its great for multyplayer and very fun.",1
"i left this game for some months and came back to feel the awesomeness again, started over with a new account, and i had a lot of fun seeing all of these new changes like the cutscenes and the badass intro, the dynamic weapon selection that allows you to choose unlike before, and the characters look very cool and have a lot of unique abilities.",2
"it was a great game got a little boaring with the farming idea but it was very fun",1
"if youre into the sci-fi genre video games, then this is the game for you. i downloaded this game despite the skeptisism from other reviews and i definitely do not regret it. it took a minute or two to get used to the different types of weapons and features the game offered but once you get the flow of the game you just cant find yourself to get away from it. what more could you want in a sci-fi co op slasher game, your a space ninja that basically recks house with a whole ninja aresenal and badass space ninja wizard powers. your basically goku and thor mashed together into one badass dude that s people up because hes so badass!",1

"an exciting 3rd person shooter with easy to use controls. although there is a backstory to it, there isnt much plot based action. the gunplay can be a bit slow and needs getting used to if its your first time playing but after a few missions itll feel natural. as you start of the choices of weapons are scarce and when you want to buy them, you often need micro transactions to add more premium currency to your account so that you can buy them. the graphics are fancy and colourful even in space, controls easy to use and simple, gameplay is wonderfully smooth but can get repetitive. overall a great game that earns its place as 3rd on the most popular f2p section.",1
"awsome game, i hope i have friend from indonesia and play together :)",1
"what this game does have is upgradable characters, good looking skills, models, textures and runs smoothly. the camera can bug out once in a while ive noticed (nothing major) but is otherwise very good. however, i find it lacks variety, and while it was fun for a while, it did become repetitive and fairly boring. for me it was too much of a grind, even though it honestly isnt that bad. finding specific materials might get on your nerves though. it does have a slight pay2win element, but is much more fair than other games where you can buy resources. still, dont spend any money on this game unless you really enjoy it. this game is still something id recommend you try though, in case you like 3rd person brawler/shooter with cooperative gameplay, though can be played solo if wanted. it is free to play, so theres is no investment to be made. however, ill say this again, dont spend money on this game unless you really like it and will keep playing.",1

"i will open this game with the fact that everything in this game takes one of two things: patience or money. almost everything in this game can be earned for free if you are luck enough to find it or see the alert mission in the hour it is up. people say this game is pay to win. paying is a definate advantage, but it isnt everything. if you dont mind working for your success, this game may be for you. warframe is a third-person shooter based on high mobility combat and a high variety of weapons and abilities. from invincibility to massive anti-matter explosions, this game may have everything wanted in a primarily cooperative shooter. you play as a tenno, effectively a space ninja set out to maintain the balance of our galaxy in the distant future. you start from the center (mercury) and move outword while gaining power and money. everything from your warframe (your ninja suit of armor that gives you four abilities) to your weapons upgrade by killing enemies and completing missions. at the time of this post, i have logged almost 300 hours into this game. i have tried loads of weapons and watched as the developers release patch after patch improving this game as it is still in beta. the enemies are challenging and weapons are very dependent on farming credits and mods to improve them. if you want a game that has one of the best communities in a free to play games that i have seen, the variety in this game will not let you down.",6

"the game got an interface redo which is targeted at the playstation 4 players who total out at about 20% of the playerbase. this redo made the game unplayable by inducing motion sickness, hiding vital options somewhere 4-6 klicks deep which you have to access over and over again, removing the starmap for some sort of planet spin wheel including a mission spin wheel, implementing senseless color codes, hiding important info behind your character model, removing the option to change your loadout quickly before a mission launches, screwing with the mod interface so that you have to memorize dozens if not hundreds of your mods by name now. i easily put 100 into the game and was really into it but this ui update flat out killed it.",5

"a fun third person fps [so long as youre playing with friends]. there is depth to the game, but not enough to make it feel overwhelming. wall running and using abilities on warframes make you feel invincible and makes time start to flow, but at its core it is still a shooter genre and will eventually revert to that. i would suggest this to any hardcore shooter fan, and anyone looking to mess around in a game to have fun (because the early levels deff. supply that urge!)",1
"awesome first person shooter! fun to roll and shoot and wall jump and slice up people with your luminescent sword.",1

"your a in space ninja with unique individual powers. oh and did i mention you can do parkour?! wall running, wall hanging, all kinds flips. and thats not all, the weapons you use are just as cool. you got big swords, little swords, katanas, two handed swords, daggers, daggers with swords, two daggers. the guns range from the classical shoot with bullets, or ones that have a rediculous amount of fire power, some shoot saws, others shoot sticky white things that explode (kinky developers? i think not!) and shotguns. as well as secondaries, but i cant name them all as to my hands for being tired of typing all of this. anywho, give this game a try, i fell in love with it the moment it was teasered i believe in january? yes its still in beta, but the full version will be free either way. this game is far from being completed, but even farther from being boring. exuce me, my tf2 has finally downloaded.",1

"this game is so cool and i want the play it with as many people as i can i recommened this to skilled first-shooter players! 8.5/10.0 (there is now vehicles)(yet!) 4 star",1
"there are so many good things about this game.....but theres also one big downside. lets start with the good things, for starters the game is free so you can easily hop in and play.also, combat is rather fun and you can choose to play stealthy or simply all out.but i mean really, who dafuq never dreamt of being a flippin space ninja? its genius! now for the downside.....the grind. yup, theres so much grind in this game that the only way not to get bored of it is to either play the game once a month or using the help of a little friend we call wallet. :/ the game has so much potential but unless they find a way to stop the game from getting repetitive then i dont know what will save this game. the reason im gonna recommend it is cause its free and its definetly a good f2p game, but yeah, im not so sure if its a good game in general.",1
"wicked awesome, easy to handle with controller too!",1
"warframe has changed so much since the release on steam. when it was first released to the public, it was fun being a space ninja, but the missions and battles were pretty repetitive. over time, warframe has went through sooooo many changes. some good. some bad. but heres the thing, the developers actually communicate with the players and ask what they want in the game. i have so much respect for them. everyone should atleast give this game a try. i mean, it is free.",2
"good action game, that evolves with every update. at the beginning it is a little lame, to have your wallet tortured, becuase you need money, to buy slots for your items. otherwise you would only have space for two weapons, and this is annoying, if you dont want to spend real money so fast... however, the game is good, but lacks of a great story... just the same missions all the time, but the progressing factor makes the game really enjoyable and it is the best game, for a long co-op session with up to three friends. the different powers of your characters makes teamwork be a quite good and fun making experience. however, after 750hours the game made me rethink the concept of the developers. the game is in beta status and instead of developming a release, the guys release a beta to other systems like ps4 and xbox one.... and the only thing that evolves is the money making updates of cosmetics and new weapons, or chars... and this sucks.... instead of developing the game, the creators develop updates with much more new bugs.... with the saying.. hey, we are in a beta... but why do they create new stuff, instead fixing the good old... after update 14 ive stopped playing, since i feel fooled by the developers.",6
"i love this game, its the best game to play when your bored",3
"its alot of fun easy to play even looks good on my older computer",1
"amazing game here. its primairly aimed at people who like collecting loot as the gameplay, while fast paced and very fun, is a little repetitive after a while. its got a real slow start to it, but once you get into the meat of the game and have a couple warframes to switch between things really get rolling. its completely playable without ever having to give over any money, but if you get the discount as your sign-in bonus you should go ahead and throw some money their way. its a great game and spending just $5 with the 75% discount can get you a new color palette to use for customization, and some extra slots to keep more warframes and weapons. dont bother buying weapons or warframes with platinum unless youre really impatient or just have lots of money to throw around though as everything can be unlocked for free with enough effort put into the game, and playing them is kind of the point of games anyway. overall you have no reason to not give this game a shot if you play shooters, which these days basically means everyone should at least try this game. i mean, its free to play, looks great, is a blast to play, and isnt going to nag you 24/7 to throw hundreds of dollars at it.",1
"this game is pretty fun once you get past the initial stages of gameplay and learning how to move. the stock weapons are absolute garbage after a few missions, so buying some more gear is a good thing, however most of the weapons, and all of the other warframes cost platinum to aquire, so if you want to play something other then the excalibur warframe, be prepared to shell out some of that hard earned money! otherwise the game is solid, no bugs as far as ive seen aside from odd ragdolling here and there, solid co-op. overall, a great game.",5
"ignore ign on this one, they werent bribed. warframe is an addictive shooter set in an evolving sci-fi world. you play as the tenno, or... no. your a space ninjah! everyone goes on about the cash shop, or all the reviews ive seen do. i just write in the comments lul you nubcake everything in the game is free!!!. because it is. put in the time and effort and you can get",1

"thrust me, hours feel like seconds while playing this game.",3
"it adds life and ecxitement.. wich is lost in most games it just makes you addicted because the feel of action never stops you can just keep going... and it aslo provides tons of choices for character creation wich makes it even more awesome.",1
"hands down scond best game in my opinions second only to dark sector.",2
"i was kinda skeptical on getting this game at first becuse my expierances with free to play games usually were not that good affter playing this game for a little bit on the online mode it is probably me second top online game! its so satisfying getting kills and such and the player base is really good 9.9/10 dude to the fact that it doesnt have a first person mode (that i know of)",1
"this game is quiet fun and i would recommend it to others but if any one who is looking to add an extra friend am available over all its an interesting game",1
"third person action rpg co-op space ninja robots? fun, fast paced...a little lacking on the directions/information early on. but all in all cool concept and fun gameplay.",1
"warframe is the epitome of a sci-fi game. it is extremely fun, and it runs silky smooth. i even tried playing it on my 2 yr. old computer and it ran decently. i highly recommend this game. the combat is very fun, intuitive, and intense. the upgrade system is genius. the game has micro transactions, but for the most part the standard weapons function very efficiently. the story, albeit cliche, has a halo-esc feel. the design and graphics are amazing. oh. and it has less glitches than battlefield 4. just saying. its a beta. and...it has less glitches. just saying. being informative, thats all *wink wink*.",1
"one of the best co-operative games out there, hands down. there is a noticable lack of progress as you start off in the game with your first warframe but as you start to expand the tenno campaign against the grineer, corpus and infested (the funnest of the three to fight), you will find that upgrades become easier and easier to get. the collection of mods, weapons, blueprints, rare materials is truely addicting. the downside? the lopsided micro-transactions. do not let the slow-going at the start fool you into sinking money into this necessarily. nearly everything can be collected through gameplay, alerts, operations, etc. patience perseveres in this. as for me, i sunk some cash into this because i wanted to support the developer of the game. theyve really crafted a fantastic product here that is easy to jump into but also has the depth that hardcore players crave. unconditional recommendation!",1
"this is by far the best game i have seen in quite a while. so much to do and endless amounts of things to modify. the graphics are amazing, but do not really tax your system. also i am able to play with others on a slow connection. one of the only complete free games that you dont actually have to pay to buy necessary items. if you do spend a bit it is easy to customize or start with weapons you would prefer not to wait for.",3
"robotic space ninjas with powers, i would think thats enough to say but i need to say more. it is a very addictive game very conveniant that most items you can earn or find in the various levels, bosses are unique and enjoyable, weapons range from unique to just bizarre but all are good in their own way. recommended to play with a friend for more fun and explosive mayhem.",1
"this game doesnt appeal in the start. buttttt, as you slowly understand more about the game, you start to get really into it",3
"very good game , pay ingame to be the best sharp and stunning graphics.",1
"whats not to love about power ranger space ninjas? pros: 1. fun, engaging combat with lots of unique classes and playstyles. 2. great customization. 3. beautiful graphics. 4. really fun with friends. 5. the acrobatics (running, climbing walls, backflipping, etc) are very well done. cons: 1. its extremely easy 98% of the time and the other 2% of the time its mind-numbingly frustratingly difficult.] 2. the dialogue is terrible as is the voice for the robot girl who tells you whats going on. its also annoying after a while when she tells you there are life signs heading towards you and then says, its the grineer! in surprise... of course its the damn grineer. its always the grineer. why does she need to say that every time? we know its the grineer.",1
"this game offers a fast pace, amazing graphics/effects, unique fighting style, customization, and much more. if you do not mind raiding stages (that can be similar at times) over and over again, then this game will be fun.",1
"hours of entertainment can be squeezed out of this game for free. its never too repetitive and there are plenty of ways to create your own unique warframe.",1
"pretty good game, worth the download. past the terms and customisation, the plot and missions are pretty good. and the other thing, its free, so why not?",1
"warframe is an excellent game, and its free! you are a murderous cybernetic power suit space ninja dude going around slaughtering various evil factions to help bring balance to the origin solar system. the combat in the game is satisfying, offering high diversity of loadout choices with so many different weapons and mods that can drastically change the way you use them. the movement is top notch, with a well implemented parkour system (sometimes it can be a bit wonky, but thats mostly just funny) that makes the game very high mobility in a refreshing way. the story is not really yet developed, though the placeholders for one are definitely in place. warframe is a constantly evolving game, and will have something quite different basically each few months that youre playing! the sooner you get in on this, the better!",4
"you are a ninja. in a space. kicking a**es. just play it.",1
"i like the models in the game. they have some really nice polygons, sometimes im just staring at that rather than the actual game. those sweet, hi-def polygons.",1
"this game is confusing at first but once you learn your way around its pretty intricate. it has so many details but not overwhelming. the graphics are good but not great. and the free running and movements in-game are so smooth. this is a free game so you dont have anything to lose.",1
"fantastic game, great to play with friends, up to a year of playtime, if not more. great game to play when youre bored, and an interesting storyline.",1
"this game is freakin awesome!!! the graphics and intensity are unbelievable for a free game. downsides are tricky user interfaces, and lighting errors for non-gaming purposed machines, otherwise, totally enjoyable.",1
"one of the coolest and best f2ps out there. definitley worth the try.",1
"yes, yes, and more yes. the words no and bad dont exist when associated with this game.",1
"this game is really great. the only thing that could be upsetting is that at times you may want more power with your weapons and you just will not get it unless you mod your weapons or find all the parts for your blue prints. it can be very challenging. i feel almost like i cannot avoid taking damage, but you can definitely deal damage. all in all, i do enjoy this game and it is holding my interest. also, it is a plus that you can pve in it unlike some other free-to-play action games.",1
"if you think ninjas are about swords and throwing stars, think again! we got flamethrowers, miniguns, shrapnel cannons, grenade launchers, and some dude named rhino...oh, and if ninjas are stealthy, warframes are freaking rambo on drugs.",4
"unique mmorpg coupled with fps plus free style hack and slash, and on top of that, you get to customize your equipments, skills and progression of your characters just as you would in a mmorpg. great!",1
"great graphics and game play. good fun for groups and solo. so many options to play.",9
"are you interested in quick paced, rpg, 3rd person, zombie, ninja, robot shooters? you simply need to try this out then even if you dont, since its also free with no pay2win methods because its co-op as well! there are tons of weapons, warframes, and mods to use, the sounds and graphics are stunning and the story well.. i really didnt care for since i just wanted to kill stuff. negatives: gets really and i mean really grindy, why? well... the main goal in this game is just to rank up your mastery which requires you to craft everything and lvl them up fully. which makes it really repetitive so you may want to farm with your friends so you can keep on doing so. i got addicted whenever i made a new frame, sentinel, or weapon wanting me to max it out making it more powerful with w/e mods i decided to place which is satisfying. its well worth trying but is it worth staying? well... go in and find out on what you think.",2
"just an absolutly overall lovely game. the frame rates and glitches in people are crazy but thats no matter. this game is one of the best i have seen for the free to plays. i hope everyone else enjoys the game as much as i am!",1
"8/10 - fun and challanging but quite repetetive at times. still worth getting tho.",1
"what can i say your a freakn space ninja with a dog that has elf ears and a bat nose. it is one of the best free to play games with microtransactions in it imo they implemented it in such a way where you absolutely do not need to buy anything with real money. the trading system needs to be in more games also the way you rank up through the mastery ranks, it makes you use everything until its fully leveled, not just get it and you dont like it so you sell it . gg 8/10 would play again",5
"such a legend game! space ninjas! and parkour! woop!",7
"good game for play 100 hours max. then it is getting boring",2
"i love fast paced action games, but never liked shooters. im more comfortable with melee combat. but with this game its a mixture of both melee and guns. the combat is so smooth and fluid i actually liked pulling out my hand gun and shoot a few grineers while wall running, sliding across the floor past a horde, or in mid-air after a high leap. this is by far my most favorite action game that i can just hop into and go ninja... with a gun.",1
"really fun while i was able to play it...played for 2 hours but now whenever i play for more than 10 minutes it always says evolution engine has stopped working.hopefully they are able to fix this problem cause it seems like alot of people have this problem too",1

"warframe ing sucks when i installed the update it failed no one shoiuld install this ing game",1
"i love ths game so far its the first free game i have seen with a campaign and it includes parkour 3rd person shooters stealth and up close and far away action. this game is awesome for the looters and the parkourists out there. get this game! its so great that i spent money on it. i rarely spend money on anything, its that good! get it and pley wit meh!!!",1
"warframe, one of the best free coop online shooters out there. they gameplay is kinda routine u kill enemies and complete tasks, this can get boring (especially if u dont play with friends) but if u continue u will be rewarded! (ull need to grind a lot) the high variety of weopons, warframe and mods (upgrades for weopons/warframes) could make every session different u can adjust ur play style to the warframe u play with so it always stay different. also the events are always fun to do en they show up frequently wich makes u wanna play even after u said that u would stop (it happend to me) i hope this inspires u to give it a try and remember never give up and keep grinding!",3
"very much a grinding game, but in the third person style. before i get deeper into anything id like to say that this is a good time passer, as defense and survival missions (endless until you want to leave) can take an hour (plus) depending on your group. all of the weapons (except a few that were for founders only) are all available in game, purchasable with the credits you earn fighting or by their platinum (real money). using in game currency you have to purchase the blueprints through the store (they dont cost platinum) then you have to grind for the materials. and i mean grind, look at what is available where before you purchase, because itll take you a while to get to the next location and time to farm the materials in that sector, then it takes 12 hours (yes, realtime) to complete it, then you have to level it up to add mods. basically rinse and repeat that cycle of buying, farming, building, and you have warframe. some people hate games like this (usually myself), but given its allotted me the ability to kill an hour here, an hour there, it works for what it is.",1
"if you like borderlands, mass effect 3, and ninjas this is the game to play. it is free and even more fun if played with friends. you and your friends play through missions together against enemy ai. hey it is free so give it a shot and you get to be a space ninja.",1
"i tried playing this before but was too laggy i upgraded my ram should i try again",1
"there is nothing to say about this game except that its free and its amazing. download it now.",2

"epic game! so much content and goals in it already, with many mroe on the way. warframe is a great free to play game.",4
"pretty good game, very fun for us old skool shooter types, reminds me of the fps games like the quake engine games",1
"in my opinion, this is the best free to play currently out there. gameplay is smooth, end game is good, and its a ton of fun with friends. the clan dojo adds something most games lack, and that is a feeling of helping the clan make your own home the way you want it. highly recommended.",2
"the game will not work it shows that have not got the pack 3",1
"basically you control a futuristic ninja of space hell bent on saving the galaxy from a bunch of a-holes. pretty legit.",1
"game was just okay until some updates made it awesome. third person sci-fi with shooter and melee elements combined with a versatile character that looks badass, just perfect. plus, its free.",2
"can simply putting your time in it. the graphic is magnifique!! approve ps. the crafting time is too much i think :p",1
"space ninjas. if that doesnt sell it, the freerunning might. not for intense play- otherwise boredom might set in.",1
"very enjoyable free-to-play game. doesnt even require any money to be enjoyed, unless you absolutely hate grinding because this game has a lot of it. definitely worth trying out.",1
"loved it just brilliant when i had it redownloading it soon amazing design",1
"a fun game if you like shooters, can get repetitive, but there is always something to have fun with.",4
"at sight is the best free to play game i ever play. excelent experience.",4
"although the story is really weird and hard to follow it stays fun from the action packed combat. the slow upgrading keeps you engaged and gives you a goal to work towards while you kill a mulitude of enemies with your array of weaponry, which ranges from pistols to snipers and even throws in a sword giving the player a sort of ninja-james bond feel. all in all what the game lackes in story it makes up in actual gameplay. id give 7.5/10",1
"this game is so good its awsomeness will explode the unpripairds brains",1
"very fun games with friends and you dont need to buy weapons for the best. very enjoyable with new quests daily and different guns and mods for each weapon. if you love playing with friends then this game is for you :d",1

"very cool and highy addictive game to play. warframe is so vast and huge its seems endless which is great for a game becasue it means its gonna be a while before completing it.",4
"a brilliant third-person shooter that really makes you enjoy parkour and gun&sword-play",1
"a fun game to play with friends. what is even better its free.",4
"played this game over 100 hours. fast gameplay and constantly tweaked and updated. well worth your time!",2
"a great take on the sci-fi shooter genre. fast paced gunplay, interspersed by simple, but potent, sword play. you are a ninja+!",8
"gun blazing and sword slashing and all co - op = awesome :d",1
"great game, you search for material to build weapons from blue prints, so many characters you can be, but it expensive to get anywere fast... but it is fun, just time consuming",2
"awesome third-person alien shooter. so intense it literally hurts your head, in a good way. you should try it out, its free!",2
"warframe is fun, but not without strings attached. whether or not you enjoy yourself is entirely dependant on your circumstances. if you have the money to burn on platinum (and you will definitely need more than a few dollars), you can get right in the thick of things with a couple of different warframes, and some swagtastic weaponry. everything is priced extraordinarily high, but if you have the means, this is definitely the way you want to play. if, however, you think youll be able to fight the incredible grind without dropping real coin, theres fun to be had, but your time is most likely better spent elsewhere.",1
"a great game well worth the time of anyone interested in 3rd person shooters!",6
"over 100 hours logged at a max of 10 days after ive started playing- this game is an amazing 3rd person shooter co-op and if youve got any friend to play it with is amazing fun. oh, and its free. go play it.",3
"the game runs pretty damn well with max settings at 60 fps. the detail is really good, althow the level design isnt optimal, and you will find yourself running around similar rooms quite often... yet the game keeps you hooked. some might find it repetitive, but i find it interesting as theres always change involved in the game, even if it might not seem so at first. its hard to explain to somebody who hasnt played the game yet, but since its free, i highly reccomend you download it asap, its only about 4 gb with patches and all. its when you figure out how all the mechanics work that you start enjoying the game",1
"warframe is easily one of my favorite third-person shooters of all-time. fun gameplay, cool weapons and awesome characters. the only downside to this game is the in-game currency. platinum. it is vastly over-priced, but you will never be forced to buy anything because, all of the weapons and characters in the game are obtainable by means of grind. which is great considering the gameplay is so fun, you hardly notice you are grinding at all! in my opinion, warframe is one of the best free-to-play games on steam.",3
"ninjas with machine guns fighting zombies in space. the end.",1
"i think its a pretty good game, it is enjoyable. i played it when it was first released before it was even on steam and well, all the glitches and such i experienced are probably now fixed. so if those are all fixed id imagine it is an enjoyable game for all. the only thing i disliked was well, its halfway impossible to find the items to craft armor or weapons. which gets you annoyed and you end up wanting to spend real money on in-game currency.",1
"game its awesome. starts kinda slow but once you learn all about it you wont stop playing it",1
"i dont even know what to write about this game .. :d its so interesting, fun and good that i lost my words .. i recommend it to new and advanced players of this genre . :3 + its free to play",1
"fast pace, beautiful, action packed, ninja style, sci fi themed, addictive game. it can get a bit grindy at time, but for the most part, if you like ninjas, fps and sci-fi, then this game is for you.",2
"this game is very good so far. you can choose from multiple character builds, or tennos and you can customize them and play with cooperatively with others. just like most free to play games, you can get what you want much faster if you buy it with real money. there are still ways to get what you want though, it just take more time to get them. overall though this is a very good game, and its free.",1
"i reccomend this game to everyone on steam this game is awesome",1
"needless to say, some heavy grinding is involved in playing this game. but, if youre looking for some fun with shooting while sliding, wall running and being a space ninja, then this game is definately for you.",1
"a 3rd person, co-op, shooter with some rpg and mmo elements. its sci-fi setting and lore are mostly unique and refreshing. it is also one of the few games i have seen that uses the free to play model right! it is also worth noticing the incredible amount of support the game has received post launch from its developers and fans alike, as well as how much it has advanced and evolved in almost every front since it was originally released. more than worth giving it a try in my opinion!",2
"space ninjas vs. space nazis. best plot ever. cut everything in half, best game mechanic ever. this game is awesome.",2
"woah a lot has changed since i last wrote a review for this game. definitely much better now and fixed alot of the old issues with it. anyone should give it a try its good fun.",2
"i great f2p sci-fi shooter with great graphics, alot of enemy variation,a great crafting system, and good parkour mechanics. however, the controls are a bit stiff, and there are a dissapointing amount of bugs. 8/10",2
"good game but could use more weapons and easier menu options, a little complicated",1
"cool shoot em up ! check it out its free and looks very good on a 7xx card",1
"awesome game, good graphics only downside would be since its peer to peer if your host has bad internet lets just say the amount of lag is insane. but overall an amazing and addicting game.",4
"most amount of shooting ninja wall jumping scifi fun i had in a shooter mmo game ever. really totally free unlike many other games, able to trade mod cards, raid keys, for both game credits and real cash plat. brillant. fun game to play with a few freinds or get into a guild with base construction. im dreaming of hot space ninjas. love this game.",5
"without a doubt i recomend this game, and its a great time to start fresh update new tileset and game mode new weapons and warframe!!!!!!!",3
"very nice in graphics,gameplay, and items to use. there are many guns to buy and gather ingidients to make them. has a very cool way upgrading weapons,charectar, etc. only thing that is bad that the game has some bugs but its ok. also the ai sometimes just doesnt really operate right, like for an example i once saw the enemy ai just walk pass me. 7 and a half/10 great game",3
"beautiful game its great and controller friendly great ggraphics irresistable",1
"warning: prepare to shell out 20$ if you plan to play for more than a day or two. the game itself is pretty fun and brings a very satisfying gameplay. really no reason to download and try for a few hours. all items can be acquired (slowly) just by playing. the only thing players are really forced to buy are permanent inventory space, which is a must, since there are alot of weapons you will want to get and warframes. that being said, prepare for the game to get very repetative after first 72 hours of playtime. there is no real endgame, and all missions become repetative grinds for mod cards and resources.",3
"vezzy vezzy good, nice physics, needs alot of friends 9.5/10",1
"fast pace game, good looking visuals and customizations, friendly community, game is always up to date, they keep there fans up to date",9
"love this game. always come back to it. easy to get into - fun and light.",4
"amazing graphics favorite game in steam so far :d tons of fun extremly addicitive",1
"while starting off on this game i felt like i wouldnt enjoy but as i played through the game i found out that this game is really good and while yes, the art style looks weirdish (hammer head loki) it grew on me and farming in this game can be annoying, once you get your gear leveled up it should be a breeze. if you are eyeing this game at lest give it a go.",8
"this game is top notch for graphics in gameplay.. every move is like a movie and it still never stops amazing me with new crazy enviroments or amazing scenes.. loveit more games should adapt this playstyle and camera control options",1
"yes it became my obsession . i love this game and i will finish it",2
"space ninjas! this game is awesome, it allows for customization on a level hardly seen in video games today. the combat is great, and there is a challenge for those who are looking for it. but in all honesty, if it didnt have you at the concept of space ninjas than you probably arent into this kind of game.",8
"very good game but i dislike playing it from steam so i got it from the original website",1
"this game is fun and makes you feel like a badass the whole time thrue",2
"i hate this game i hate this game agian but love at the same time",1
"the games is the best high paste action shooter and i just love the story and the blood oh yeah alot of it and mass scale killing witch is ing awesome",1
"all i can say is, a complete third person action shooting game.has some charms...",1
"this game is really fun oncew u get better weapons and warframes.the bosses are a challenge but they can pay off.",2
"decent game at start , but wears quickly out and get repetetive and boring. ninjas in space thou...",2
"great game, great grapics, great ping, but with a catch. everything costs a lot. except maybe a few things. you have to be a really determined and hugely dedicated player. still a great game; 3 out of 4 but just that large cost... especially for buying platinum.",1
"a must have game!!! free to play and its pretty good, even if u get in to it u dont really need to spend money like most free games, but if u want level up quick it wont cost a arm or legg!!!!",7
"its wicked awesome deadpool approved though theres a lack of naked women its an 18 rated game why not go all the way",7
"positive things said before seem true. ive been missing this game and didnt even know i do. finest mixture of several games that i like - including left 4 dead, mass effect or crysis. lets see if this will become pay to win in later stages...at the beginning its not and just fun!",1
"a sapce ninja, prety cool, nice gameplay, the mission a little repetitive.",5
"why to play this game: - its free! - its barely 1,5gb! - cool action with gun and blade! - did i mention its free?! play it. now.",4
"its fun to play. it has lots of weapons, warframes(characters each with different playstyle and skills). almost everything can be obtained without money spending. the graphics is quite good, the environment looks really good. its a fantastic co-op mission based free to play game.",1
"why do i have 300 hours in this game when the hell did that happen",5
"i started playing warframe since janurary of this year. warframe feels like a combination of dead space, mass effect, and more. warframe is a 4 player co-op type game and theres no pvp just only pve. warframe has at least 8 different game modes, multiple types of enemies like soldiers, zombies and more. each character has their own unique powers to help your teammates to complete the missions, you can also recoor your character to any color you want. warframe also has pets called sentinels which allows to have a pet that fights for you. for example, it can regain your health, shields, and turning you invisible for temporary amount of time. i only mention about half of the awesome things are in this game and if you want to know more about this game. i think you know what to do! that right! download the game and try it out! ps. message me if you need any assistance! i will be glad to help anyone stranger or friends.",3
"i love this game, very fun if you play it with your friends. try it out!",3
"the game is great, beautiful graphics, fast paced action. the downside is its free to play, so its cash shop controlled, meaning if you got a lot of rea l life cash you can get anything you want early on... so expect to be left in the dust often in group runs until youve played for a long long time and built up your mods, people who payed cash for all their stuff will be at a massive advantage. i played for months without getting a single gold orokin catalyst which doubles the amount of mods you can equip to a weapon, or your suit, or anything. still a fun as hell game, cuz you can play solo or online. getting groups together with people you actually know is shoddy at best, and takes alot of screwing around with the channels. for the longest time my friend and i couldnt even play together because it kept saying i was offline to him, and vice-versa. guild halls are almost cash shop reliant... like the orokin gold catalysts....that  never drops in a run....so you pretty much gotta spend real money on it to build a guild hall...and why would you even want to build one? not sure havent seen any actual reason for it yet other than aesthetic purpose.",1
"great game for a free to play truly great but the gameplay can be a little to hard and it, in a way makes you pay in order to get the good stuff totally 2013",1
"for 3rd person shooting game and free to play? i recommend this game",1
"great game very very addicting loads of fun definitley a must have!!",1
"its free, you can get practically everything through playing (that includes cosmetic items),and its really fun with a group. atleast try it.",1
"this is an awesome game totaly worth every second of game time =d",1
"the gameplay itself is fun as hell, but the over all interface of the game is probably the main reason more people dont play this. its confusing how to set up your character or even really how to get into missions or what order to do them in. clicking the wrong thing can have you doing the same novice mission over and over, or throw you in a game way above your level (for you to get slaughtered). communication in game can be lacking as well, and so can direction. over all the game is fun and amusing, but doesnt really have much long term playability. i put yes on recommend because its worth checking out, but without a revamp i dont see it ever getting overly popular.",1
"a great game if you like the combat and power system. i qualify it like that because combat is fairly repetitive, which is not bad if you enjoy the fight. although not exactly the same, warframe seems like hellgate: london done better. it has the loot-driven action rpg feel through collecting materials, mods, and blueprints, and a super simple and effective matchmaking system. entirely possible to play without putting any real money in, but you can also get quite a bit for paying in a little. highly recommended. what do you have to lose?",1
"very fun to play, especially if you have friends you can work together with. plus, its free so whats to lose",1
"its very addicting and extremly fun and just basicly chaotic epicness",1
"if you really like space ninjas then this game is for you. to get really good stuff you have to put time in the game. it has amazing graphics. but it can get boring",1
"amazing game if your looking for a free to play to lose yourself in for hours at a time this is the game for you!",6
"i love this game. it is so worth getting. it so much fun to just mess around with all the weapons. only thing i dont like is that it isnt too friendly to the newbies. but if you stick with it for just a bit, it gets 100x better.",4
"since i dont have windows i just play on my ps4. pretty cool. controls kinda weird but not awful.",1
"solid game. no need for microtransactions to have fun and be competitive. can be a bit hardware intensive from time to time, but nothing to fret over. 7/10 as a shooter, 9/10 as a free to play mmo, 7.5/10 overall. *disclaimer: personal opinion*",1
"this game is great. if you like ninjas, parkour, and being an all around badass, play it!  it, even if you do not like those things, play wf!",1
"a game of running, shooting, and flying through the air. kill hundreds of enemies, and look bad  while you do it. fire grenades that will kill you if you arent careful(penta), or use the noodle tentacle  gun(phage). go flying around with a pair of dagger-axes(dual zoren) or kill almost anything with a single swing of your blade(galantine) in all honesty, what de is doing with warframe is a great change of pace from the norm. i mean, space ninjas, how could you as for more?",4
"this has to be the best ninja/cod: aw game on the planet",1
"this game is a very good game to play. unless you dont like mmo kinds of games. i recommend.",1
"you should get this game it is the best game in the world",1
"josh peck loves this game cuz josh peck needs something to love, and do u know what that is, this game and oprah",1
"i highly recomond this game beacause of the graphics and the shooters its just great so get the game its free!",2
"quite an awesome game with a great idea. had a lot of fun playing and id play it non-stop if my pc could really take it. not sure if anything has changed recently requirement-wise, but, warframe needs a pretty strong pc if you hate lag spikes and really look to the graphics a bit more than what the game has to offer in other perspectives. its a really well put together game and its continuously updated and enhanced. goes perfect for a gaming weekend with your friends and you can actually employ, test and perfect group tactics as well as solo; many missions require a stealthier aproach which is a pretty nice touch seeing as most mmos require you to smash everything you see in sight. the only problem for me was the fact that, eventually, it becomes repetitive, many users being forced to take on lesser level missions in order to grow. aside from that, when people ask me what games have i played recently and what do i recommend, warframe is one of them.",1
"decent combat, but feels a little floaty. the main issue is that its all mission based. you are eithe rin a menu, or in a mission map. this makes the game very repetitive. not bad, but the same thing over and over. if you are one of the people that can play an fps like cod every game they release for hundreds of hours, this wont bother you. and it does have much better combat, but it gets very boring for people like me. i recommend it because its free and not bad, but i got bored after 15hours or so.",1
"this is future ninja gameplay.....slash everyone!!!",1
"a good free to play game is you like 3rd person action although i recommend you play with friends and hey its free",1
"if you like fast paced games, then this should be right up your alley.",8
"space, ninjas, infection, co-op and free what else do i have to say.",1
"certainly one of the best f2p games out there. despite a few bugs and glitches (which is what you would expect for a game that is still in open beta), the gameplay is unique, the graphics are fantastic, great-looking character and weapon models, well detailed maps, and its fun to play whether you put money in to it or not.",2
"decent third person shooter/action game with impressive graphics for a free-to-play. much more satisfying in short bursts than a long session though.",1
"magic space ninjas in skin-tight outfits. with guns. goty.",8
"let me see your warframe! ok ew gross nevermind put it away",1
"while the grind for the highest end equipment can feel offputting the smooth gameplay is readily available from the get-go and constant updates gives plenty to do if you just want to have fun.",7
"graphics, combat and the whole conception is really good for a free to play game.",1
"where do i begin. this is honestly one of the best f2p games out there right now. its a really great sci-fi thrid-person-shooter mmo/dungeon crawler, and i honestly find it fun. ill split this review into a few sections to help you decision making. system requirments: i can play this on integrated graphics and a fairly high end processor on medium settings with 60-80 fps.the levels are really beautiful, too. honestly you dont need to worry about this aspect. gamplay: the game is really really fun to play - especiallyt with the awesome melee mechanic. you have a primary, secondary, and melee weapon (which, as i said earlier, is tons of fun to just swing around) and you have the abilities of your warframe (sort of like the class you play as). there are maybe 20-ish warframes in the game. it isnt hard to get one, though ive put quite some time into the game and have only just got my first non-starter warframe. you start with a choice of one from three warframes - and you can always get the starters you missed later on. the game isnt very pay2winsy too. sure, you can get almost every weapon (and every cool one) without dropping a cent. sure, it wil take a lot longer to craft/buy the blueprints and then get resources. but still its worth it. and playing with your friends makes this 100x better. overall, if you dont have this yet, id really encourage you to get it.",1
"great game,need more maps and less procedual generation",1
"warframe is the best 3rd person game ive ever played.",1
"online reviews give it a mediocre score, but they are reviewing an older build of the game. the game isnt finished, and the developers are doing a fantastic job keeping this game updated. for a free to play game, its increibly well done. heaps of fun to play with a group of buddies. im very excited to see where this game goes in the coming months.",4
"an excellent game.but there alot of bugs tho its just minor the only time i get annoyed is me falling down the world",1
"freaking space ninjas. game keeps on improving. get some friends, play for free, have fun.",5
"its fantastic but is expensive to buy anthore tenno/warframe",1
"its a awesome game and everyone should at least try it out maybe you will like it!",1
"this game is more fun and polished than it has any buisness being.",1
"very addictive. great action. maybe one of the cons people would complain about is the time consuming grinding for gear and such. other than that, game is really fun.",2
"its a fine game, everyone could play it cause it hawe good meele combat system and many guns",1
"warframe is an amazing free to play game. the mechanics are very simple and once you learn how to manipulate your characters momentum and parkour-esk abilities the game really takes full swing. crafting new suits and weapons is very addicting and slaying armies to find/earn those rare items is very rewarding. i will say that sometimes after rigorous play the game gets repetitive considering a large majority of the maps are re-used and the enemies never make drastic change. but overall i love this game and always return to it after i become tired of it (which i do with all games as a only casual gamer).",2
"warframe is a awesome game customizacion weapons and warframes pvp batlles is the free to play one for me",5
"help im having a huge problem! i messed around with teh video quality its was 68x but i clikced for another and the screen whent black and whenever i try to play it just a black screen! please i love this game",1
"a fair warning.minimum requirements are higher than listed.played it on a machine with these speks and it overclocked.",1
"amazing graphics best shooter?action i have played in a long time!",1
"i really like the game, but i couldnt find the stupid cake.",1
"ninjas. if that were not enough - in space. ninjas in space! get it.",1
"excellent graphics, smooth gameplay and unique charactors make this game fun to play. it can lag if you have a cheaper computer (like me) but turning the graphics quality down makes it better. i have had some bugs that made it difficult to play, but the warframe support team always comes up with a solution within 24 hours. this game is awesome. id say better than call of duty by a long shot!",3
"i would recommend warframe to anyone who likes mmos or hacknslashes",1
"i like the game but you have to make a acount not cool i have 20 friends who have a same problem pleas just lets us play by just clicking on the game",1
"what could possibly be better then super swag magic parkour alien space ninjas with shooty booty guns 10/10 - ign",1
"fun on pc and ps4!!!!! awesome game, so much stuff to do!",1
"this is an amazing game! i would rate this game a 9/10 for being so cool! :).",1
"great game its half pay to win but all items that cost platnium (exept color palletes) can be crafted (takes ages to get those but who cares its fun while your doing it!) i recommend it and its free!",4
"interesting game if you have a passion for sci fi games but even without the passion for this kind of stuff i still belive its an excellent game and i will definitely recomand it to anyone that wants to have fun with friends or alone.",4
"i like the vibe game play and control, but i hate that i cant play this on my mac.",1
"i love this game i played it even on my old cunputer its a realy fun game you guys sould get it :d",1
"if you can handle the graphics, this game looks and feels amazing. the mechanics is well detailed and the trading system is great.",1
"great game - fun action, flexible builds, lots of weapons and warframes to choose from and customize. easy to get into missions and co-op is a nice change to typical fps multiplayer. bit grindy for some higher end modifications but overall minor complaint. devs also work hard to get useful upgrades on regular basis which is refreshing.",2
"this game is excellent for too many reasons. de is responsive and takes tons of player feedback when creating new content and it is absolutely wonderful. they recently incorporated tons of player designed weapons, however going beyond that the game itself is already amazing and only getting better and better. i have been playing for almost two years and am still not bored. there is always more that you can do in warframe. besides even if pve isnt for you the pvp is excellent and extremely challenging.",6
"this game has great graphics and awesome game all around. 10/10",1
"best f2p game out there. great graphics and really fun to play. people say its just a farming simulater but i personally dont think it is.",5
"really awesome and fun game, i cant believe something free-to-play is this good, graphics are awesome and game concept is really really good. give this game a try and you wont regret it!",5
"warframe is by far my favorite game i recommand this game to any gamer that enjoys fast action and an insane lvling system .",3
"yes this is a must have plus its free but if you play by yourself it can be boring so play in a full party(4 people)",2
"its a must play, you have no choice in this matter,",1
"whats not to like about this game, space ninjas fighting clones, robot merchants and zombies! while in space! the sheer amount of enjoyment you get while killing any of the three factions mentioned above is unexplainable, more so when you hear them scream while dying. though it is a free to play game, it is very well developed, and has constant updates with better weapons, frames and things to do! and i cant forget to mention that theres giant space dogs that can be your companion, thats great too. the community is great, the game is great and its clearly only going to get better. download this game if you havent already, youll be in for hell of an adventure!",2
"by god. more than a year strong and this game never fails to impress me.10/10.",2
"excellent game, many hours have been put into this game, and intend to play many more hours more on top of them as the game progresses and gets much better.",4
"defintely the best game i have played on pc and is even up in the top 10 for my playstation. the best part is, well there isnt yet because it is in beta. it is going to be one hell of a full release.",1
"good game if you want to waste time or want to experience something different, too much grinding to my liking, no real endgame all you do is more grinding for levels gear and mods there is defensive mode and survival but that gets old fast. need some epic bosses/ raids. that been said this game is a very enjoyable shooter mmorpg with the ability to change warframes/ weapons for new style of gameplay.",4
"great game, constantly updated with new content. gives increasing difficulty to keep it from getting boring. but loses its playablity over time as most o the things in the game are repeated.",2
"a very good f2p game that actually can be played for free! you will have to grind it though, but it can be done. cool things have to be bought but there are alerts in-game that can get you blueprints to own those sexy goods. latest update polished a lot of things and made the experience even better. i strongly recommend to try dark sector too, as this game is heavily inspired on it. so give warframe a try... what can you lose if its free!",1
"space ninja! great game, gets repetitive, and some of the items grind take forever. this game also has little to no stealth. there is no sneaking around with these ninjas, but do not let this get you down. the game looks amazing, plays awesome, and is a great game if you are looking for something to play coop. i give this game an 8/10",1
"it sucks. just kidding, its awesome. latex-cyborgs in space wowza",1
"the game allows for lots of custmizations and is very intuitive with motion, graphics, and combat. its a definite reccomendation from me.",2
"extremely fast-paced action,intense firepower,visceral hits and tons-of-damage dishout...if you are looking for those things,then only this game can provide.",2
"war frame hase some of the best graphics ive ever seen in a pc game(even tho pc games have the best graphics possible). i love playing it there are some lag issues just cuz i have a windows 8 laptop but it i can deal with that. i recommend it to anyone that likes 3rd person space ninja, shooting, sword fighting, all around fun and fast paced games. it has a good market system but i do have to say that it is mostly pay to win but if you know what your doin you wont have to put a single dollar into this amasing game. the crafting take a bit long and is kindo of a pain but its woth it in the end. one last time i recommend this game to anyone over the age of 13 but i realy dont care who plays as long as there not an .",1
"even with my sluggish internet, i am able to play warframe with next to no lag and still enjoy the breathtaking sceneries in distant planets and the dark corridors on enemy spaceships. no other game can cause such an emotion like this.",1
"pretty great free to play game only id say hurt by how much grinding you need to proceed unless you buy the in-game currency. really interesting gameplay mechanics make what would be a mediocre shooter deep and engaging. not only does every weapon feel different, you have different warframes(armor), each having a unique ability such as fire and magnetism. you even customize yours differently with different cards or mods enemies drop on the map or getting on missions. you can make a heavy hitting swordsman or super quick thunder user. the art direction was weird at first, but once used to it the graphics and style are pretty fitting for the game. gameplay is that of a fast paced third person shooter, but with abilities such as fire, wall running, swords, basically anything that makes a ninja bad . on the plus is 4 players can be on a mission so playing with a buddy is pretty fun. you can solo this game if you want, but its definitely reccomended with other people as the later mission can get difficult. over all i would for sure reccomend this game to some buddies. its free so try it!",1
"this...game...is...awesome....like rlly what else would you want to do all day except running around killing infested or corpus jumping off walls, running on walls, ninja sliding (my fav) or even doing melee attacks from the walls dl it now and add meh plz t^t i is lonely xp",8
"the best space game i ever played. great graphics, runs smoothly, and free!",1
"good: shoot gun, wall run, stabby fun bad: pay2win, real-time day-long waits to build things",1
"the game if very good, emmersive, very fun and alot of fun i love it and would recommend it to alot of people",2
"warframe is by far one of the best fre to play games i have ever invested my time or money into. the movement sytstem, as well as the flat out fun gameplay, makes it enjoyable to play. i would certainly recommend this to any friend who wanted to kill a few hours on a game.",1
"like... playing a multiplayer mass effect... with ninjas! yeah... definatly with ninjas! seriously, its suprisingly good for a free-to-play. i highly reccoment.",1
"dont trust the critics and the metascore this game is awesome as heck! you will need a decent rig to play it though. most addictive game in a while!",1
"not the best third person game out there but is fun for a while",1
"very awesome game. with cool graphics and friendly ui.",1
"great game am still having lots of fun in it community is great overall 20/10 worth downloading.",1
"its got a bit of a borked payment system, but it in no way breaks the game, if anything it encourages playing over paying, which is good. the gameplay is solid, and really makes you feel like youre a high tech space ninja. what it really boils down to is; its free to play, so you dont lose anything by trying it. that being said, these developers deserve every penny they get.",1
"this game is just amazing ive never seen anything like this game its probably one of the best free to play games besides planetside 2. if you want a co-op game like metal gear solid revengence this is the one.with action packed gameplay with swords and guns and powers it just blew my mind with amazing graphics 4 different charcters with different abilities and weapons.it has an awesome storyline that you must get! i really recommend this game to you guys.",1
"warframe is a very good game. ive been addicted to it and been all nighting it. its awesome and free definite download everybody should download it the frame rate is excellent on my 800 dollar computer :).",1
"you shoot aliens who are bad...and break stuff to get other stuff...and you can do a barrel roll. 5 stars",1
"you really should play this game!!!! it is really awesome....",1
"very nice graphics. gameplay is very fast paced and has a small but exciting variety of classes that you can choose from, and the range of warframes you can choose to build is quite big, but nothing compared to the amount of weapons. very exciting!!",1
"amazing gameplay and amazing graphics. the first game i play where the trailer is just like the gameplay",3
"this game was really good. this game was especially when it first came out. im still very concerned about this new layout for the ones with slow computers like mine, but as long as you turn off mostly anything on options, its still the great game it use to be! im a big trader on this game. there hasnt been any problems besides immature behavior, so good luck to all of you!",6
"awesome game pretty good graphics and really fun to play",1
"really great, love the gameplay and everything i love in a game. would 100% recommend it to a friend",1
"i like this game the only downside i see is that you can get blur when shiftting screens.",1
"this is an amazing game with a good story to back up good game play.",1
"this is a nice game. easy to gain xp. becomes harder the higher lvl u are. you can do everything that is in this trailer.",1
"i as gamer, persinly think this is a grate free to play game. it deservers credit for its grate detail",2
"its still in beta but i am loving it. you are essentially a space ninja. you can do space ninja things. there are a bunch of abilities. crafting. its great. try it out. its free.",4
"this is a great game which eatten up alot of hour playing this game. we cant stop!! and if you havent play warframe you are doing life wrong!!!",6
"very unique visual style - fast paced run/gun/slash em up all in coop? yes please!",2
"i like it, but i dont have steam overlay for some reason... and that is a critical element in my opinion",1
"all the fun of running through hordes of enemies and chopping them to literal bits, while having card-collecting system to fill your cravings of being a unique snowflake. youll have a ball when youre splitting alien bodies vertically with your electrified, burning, somehow ice-encased fists, sword, staff, bow or even a boomerang, mate! its free to play, but if youre playing with friends whove put a few bucks in while youre still in the dirt farming potatoes, youll notice (especially in the beginning) a big difference in power. while pretty much every weapon, excluding starters, in the game is viable, there is a one-time permanant upgrade system involving potatoes; each weapon can be upgraded to double its kickass capacity. you can craft potatoes, though they require a somewhat rare blueprint that is consumed each time you make one. so youd probably be lucky to make a few potatoes a week. you can also buy them for 20 plat, you start with 50 and can buy more. in the long run, it isnt worth it to buy potatoes, youll /eventually/ have more than enough from just playing. its totally worth it to put in a few bucks so you can buy some potatoes, but on the flipside, if you just buy every weapon and warframe you want, you wont have any goals. there arent a ton of things in the shop im actually compelled to buy, since id rather work toward and earn it in-game! somethings wrong. i didnt mean to write such a long review. its the :grineer:",2
"exellent and well built game, really reminds me of mass effect and borderlands.",1
"its one of the better f2p games i have played in a while",1
"extremely enjoyable coop experience. even being in beta, it offers more fun than a lot of other games. small amount of maps can make it a bit repetitive, but slicing enemies in half or punching them to the moon never gets old.",5
"warframe is an amazing game with lots of action, fast game play, costomizble things and enemies to kill. id recomend any one to play it but play it with a friend and or friends for the best satisfaction.",4
"warframe is a cooperative free-to-play third person online action game set in an evolving sci-fi world. which is pretty cool weapons are awesome sword fights are legit and the parkour is something to be looking forward to all warframe are awesome and epic, just know which is your style",1
"this game is good but the begining is slow and get better and bettter",1
"space........ ninjas..... what more could you want?",1
"surprisingly addicting. i would like to see more information on game play without having to search forums. overall, awesome game with tons of customizations.",7
"great game over all it just get boring sometimes until u start getting new warframes then tah is when it becomes really fun",5
"grind fest. this game is amazingly fun, yet oddly challenging. the leveling system compels you to keep playing, while the maps and levels change and keep you interested. definitely my favorite game so far.",1
"one of the most addicting games ever, the system that build and get weapons is great as it takes a player a lot of hours to get good weapons",4
"fun and addictive mmofps to play, mixes in some rpg elements like levelling up and item/weapon/character creation.",1
"this game is great in many ways. it has many guns, swords, warframes (a suit), and many more. but i must say this game to get a bit farmy so get ready but he has its ups and downs or give it a try you will love it.",2
"run. shoot. collect. rinse and repeat. compete until you have everything. while this is what the game is, it becomes so much more once you begin competeing with friends, joining the talk in region chat, and going head-to-head agaisnt other players in clave. ninjas in spaaaaaace",3
"warframe? haha, grindframe more like. ... helpmeicantstopitstooaddicting",4
"a thoroughly good game. play solo or with a random group and have fun...play with friends and the fun is elevated to an utter addictive level. no matter if you like to keep the enemy at arms (or gun barrels) length or up close and personal (with a sword or axe), warframe will suite most fpss out there.",1
"the animation guy is earning his pay. every animation looks incredible. the only other game with animations this smooth is dark souls.",1
"not too bad for a free to play game, but if you want to be able to get the nice gear you gotta pay. which makes it pretty bad.",1
"its pretty fun in the start, but u kinda feel like u need to buy extra things for real money. but its a great game if u have a lot of money, and u can still play it without using real money, its just so tempting",1
"my gameplay time speaks for itself. only downside is that to progress at a reasonable rate buying in game currency is necessary, other than that an awesome game.",10
"an amazing experience for both the free consumer, and the big spender. youll never feel obligated to spend money, as nothing is completely gated to you as a free user, but i recomend supporting the game and buying forma, warframe and weapon slots, and catalyst for the best experience. buying weapon and warframes out right seems a bit silly to me, as farming them out is a large part of the game. highly recomend this game to all user who enjoy the gamplay mechanic.",3
"a game that is confusing at the start, but after you get the hang of things, its easy to lose yourself in the adrenaline rush of running on walls while shooting some grineer heads. what i liked most about this game is the freedom of movement, it allows you to be creative in what way you wanna kill your enemy, you can slide>jump>frontflip>ground slam or side jump and aim with your pistol and look epic while killing your enemy. only thing id like to see is a slow-mo option. customization is wide, although you only get 1/5 of it if you dont spend platinum, but if you do, you are limited only by the warframe you have. all in all, the game is good, but i sometimes find myself in a mess on the map, so that needs a little bit more work and polish, make it more organized/easy to work with. after a while this game can get dull and boring, probably due to the same mission being replayed just with different level design(sometimes) in the same pattern and everything is still the same. if you dont resort to some ninja movement, youll find yourself bored after a while.",1
"probably one the of the best free to play games currently available on steam. great support by the developer and fun and addictive gameplay. one of the few free to play games i dont mind giving some money to in order to support this. highly recommend this to any one who likes 3rd person action shooters and fast pace action.",4
"having clocked up over 100 hours now i feel its only right that i tell all you lovely people about this game and why you should download it! warframe is one of the best games i have played in the past 2 years, at least, it combines great gunplay with beautifully orchastrated melee combat. there may not be as many different weapons as some games, but what you do have will more than keep you busy. the clan system is well thought out and balanced, so as to ensure that newer/smaller clans can still compete. negatives? well if you hate grinding then this is not the game for you... repeating missions and instances for better loot, more resources, or just xp is what youll spend a lot of your time doing. i personally didnt find the storyline that riviting, although that may just be down to me playing at 3am (usually). its also really really tempting to spend all of your money on unlocking weapons/warframes etc early (although that could be good? as it shows how awesome that stuff is i guess? xd ) final note... you can creat your own clan with a fully buildable and customisable clan hq (msg me in game if youd like to join kalifre assasins. small, noob friendly clan that i own, part of a large alliance ^_^ ) final final note: the game is awesome and looks set to keep getting better, 10/10, massive thumbs up!! potato",2
"pros: - its free. - space ninjas - lots of warframes, cool weapons, cool powers - lots of parkour. you can wall run, climb walls, roll, jump, slide and shoot while doing all of that. - lots of customization to fit your playstyle - you can stealth it, or go straight up guns blazing - match making is pretty quick - ordis is hilarious - great environments - its free. cons: - not much story or characterization - no skill trees or skill progression - no exploration, the game is mostly just go to planet a, do mission b. - is a tiny bit linear, needs more open environments - business model is a little restricting (to make a weapon you need a blueprint. components, and a timer, that takes alot of grinding) - little character interaction beyond the co-op missions. verdict: its a fun game, i definetly recommend giving it a shot, especially if you crave something like destiny or halo or the like. you got nothing to lose anyway, its free.",1
"in my mind, this is the best thing you can currently do for free with your gaming time, and shooter fans will love this game. it has its challenges, and its problems, mainly in the way of making new content feel new, but its a great game. so jump yourself out of your proverbial air duct, and give the game a try, you may be surprised with how much time you can lose in a game as great as this one!",9
"great game, but not for everyone. the estetic is really exciting, which is one thing that keeps me coming back. the gameplay is solid, and gets a little better with each patch. since its free to play, and you really dont have to pay to win, this game is definitely worth a try.",3
"what a fantastic game i have only played this game for 72 mins but i suppose this is my best online gaming experience ever!",1
"this game is excellent beyond human comprehension, anyone who says other wise is high out of their mind or just a silly goose.",9
"this is a very good fps/co-op shooter game. i would even say that it is up there with halo and destiny. i would highly recomend this game!",2
"a free to play third person shooter parkour game featuring space ninjas? hell yes :)",6
"warframe is a very interesting game. the combat is smooth and the game is really beautiful. however the game has some flaws. for example this game can lag very easily in my case if you do not have a very good computer, the game takes forever to level up and get weapons if you want to get them free. its not because of the currency in the game. the games currency is easy to get however to get new waframes and new weapons it can take quite awhile. the weapons you need to go find materials, not very hard but the waframes are very difficult to get. they will take you many long hours to get because you need to get rare material craft that takes about 24 hours then craft another 24 hours then another. and then you have to put them together and craft it all together. it is a very long process and if you want to buy the paid currency prepare to pay a lot. overall the game deserves a 9.5/10 it has these crafting flaws but the gameplay itself is very good.",1
"seriously one of the best free to play games to come out. youre a freaking space ninja defending the galaxy, whats not to love?",3
"warframe is a stuning game with some many features like being 4 player co-p and verus mode and unlike some free to play games anything in the game you can get (but it will take time) without buying the dlcs. so get it! xd",1
"good combat actions, very intense surroundings and re-action based game. controls are fluents and the story had a good connection to keep you entertained along with the always updating expansions",1
"have you ever wanted to be a space ninja? we all have, and nows your chance to finally be one! as you embark on your epic space ninja journey, youll be able to play what you want, how you want. space ninjas can use machine guns, grenade launchers, shotguns, daggers, swords, and the traditional ninja stuff. but wait, theres more! you can become a genuine space ninja for free! thats right, you can finally accomplish your life goal for the affordable price of $0.00!!!",1
"while this game may not be the most innovative or the best looking, its something to keep you and your friends entertained for hours on end. you are basically some space warrior who has awakened from an ancient slumber and have been tasked with ridding the galaxy of the bad guys (does this sound cliche? sure it does). and, like many free to play games, there are microtransactions to get better characters and gear (which you probably have to do to unlock the full array of customization options).",1
"two words: space ninjas. its an awesome game especially with some friends. give it a go if you havent yet.",4
"a repetitive grind fest but yet still fun. a lot of different warframes classes and weapons seem to help keep it interesting. i would recommend it for some good mindless fun/killing.",1
"an addictive third person fps with a unique blend of sci-fi and mech elements. this game does not require grinding at all and most of the contents are easily attainable without having to pay . all in all , for a f2p game , this game is a must for those who seek an adventure in a modern sci-fi universe.",1
"for a free to play title, this is one of the best youre going to get. hell, it hold its own with full price retail games in my opinion. extremely solid shooter mechanics mixed with thousands of updrage combinations for each weapon make this the definition of replayability. the leveling system works well, with newer players slowly getting intorduced to new concepts of upgrading, and the ability to powerlevel new weapons/warframes once you get a solid grasp on how the system is designed. the crafting system in the game can feel like a bit of a paywall, but only for a few select things, such as the nekros warframe, but with enough time, every item in the game can be crafted, so in theory you can unlock every single thing without spending a dime of actual currency. all in all this is a phenomonal game, and because its free to play, you have absolutely nothing to lose.",3
"i highly recommend this game. its fun as hell, and the graphics are amazing. only downside is that its grind-heavy and the in-game shop is run mostly on real money in the form of platinum other than that, its damn great.",3
"diablo + crysis + space + ninjas = warframe. give it a shot, as its completely free (aside from cosmetics). grinding and repetitiveness plague it, but if you like dungeon-crawling-loot-hunting-monster-slaying-pseudo-rpgs, it comes with the territory.",3
"it has great combat mechanics and even funner with friends. if you wanna feel like a badass play this game.",1
"mass effect 3s multiplayer is the closest thing to compare warframe to. youre a ninja. ninja in space. space ninja.",1
"really fun game to play !!!!just give it shot maybe youll like it!",1
"this game has its ups and downs but all in all its a good shooter",1
"this game has a unique combat style that is almost like mass-effect but much faster and more exciting. its highly customizable and its also free! co-op is great fun too with a friend. main problem is the amount of grinding you have to do to get some gear without outright buying it.",1
"space ninjas this game was terribly fun, running on walls and the other ridiculous things you can do kept me laughing so hard. since my (rather long) hiatus, which was pre-update, i seem to have lost myself in this game. i still have my stuff, but the interace, gameplay, and difficulty seem to have all changed on me. i used to be able to fly though the missions i was on, and now i am dieing as soon as i open a door. given, it could be that i am not in-tune with the way i had played the game previous, but something seems to be off and it has got me unsettled on this game. too many young arses and spamming for my taste in chat at the moment, and trying to find someone on a similar planetary system is all but common now.",1
"best co-op fps game i have played yet, if you dont play it you should!!",9
"warframe is a very fun game, while it is geared to be easier for people who pay for their warframes and weapons, you can get everything weapon and warframe without paying. using the crafting system allows you to get everything you need, although it will take longer. i havent payed any real money, but i play the game just as well as anybody who has.",1
"game idea is good, but bad thing that as always u need to pay money for ultra mega wtf game cash and with that ultra mega wtf game cash u buy weapons, warframes and other cool stuff.... yes u can craft them (cool stuff i mean) but for that u need to play 24/7 (i mean u need to play this game a lot) and thats what game creators want... and this trick is kinda bad for f2p game like this... so yeah, its not bad but neither its good...",1
"so much fun, a lot of jumping and flipping with guns and explosion and shooting! pretty cool",1
"i love runing up to emenies and slicing them in half",1
"its good in short bursts. i tend to play for a week or so after an update then wait until the next update, lather, rinse, repeat. great visuals, solid ai, interesting story, but it just doesnt hold my attention for long periods of time. i keep it in my library just to blow off steam for a mission or two... nothing more.",1
"play it now, play it later, it can only get better with time.",4
"its a good game that you can play if you have a decent pc.",1
"!!! read this if you want to install this game !!! this game is repetitive, very repetitive. theres a lot of action, creation, etc, but it lacks interest for competitive gamers. i feel like this game copies game such as devil maycry but they have its own uniqueness. if youre looking for a fun, competitive game, i wouldnt recommend this game to you. all you do is go through stages or maps and complete missions. if youve played a game called, runescape, you may find this similar to runescapes dungeoneering skill. after completing missions, youll receive rewards, and from those rewards, you can create weapons, armours, etc. although, if youre injured in real life, or simply want to play a fun relaxing campaign game, this is a game for you. its not my cup of tea, so back to fpss.",1
"this game has its positives and negatives. pros: -huge community -clan dojo/ hub and trading post for clans -4 player co-op -fast paced fps and melee action mixed with some futuristic ninja abilities -large arsenal of weapons -different warframes to choose from /classes -consistant and constant updates cons: -laggy lobbies -sometime chaotic updates that aggrivate community (d2.0) -can be considered grindy but i recommend joining a clan with some voice integrated lobbies like raidcall or ventrilo and it will make the experience much better overall.",1
"the game is great! graphics are pretty as well as the gameplay and experience. everything is fluid and has a nice finish, it is well thought through and it is just a great game. i highly recommend this game!",3
"very nice game! ive been playing this for a while now and have watched it grow. its really fun and the rewards are endless.",7
"cool game awesome graphics and awesome characters.",4
"though the game is pretty much about futuristic ninjas, theres rarely too much stealth going on when your special skills involve unleashing antimatter bombs, flash-avalanches, tornados, or a whole variety of of other destructive forces. however, this is hardly a drawback since its implied youre a ninja only because you operate in small team of one to four people with amazing parkour skills and adaptive combat abilities. the game offers a giant selection of weapons, both melee and ranged, varying from simple swords to powerful electro-whips, and basic earth guns to alien-forged artifacts. given the wide variety of characters, weapons, and customizable features, its hard not to make this free-to-play game endlessly entertaining inwith friends or even solo.",1
"this is a game you must get if your low on money and you need a awesome action packed game where you fight aliens with your weaponry such as swords, guns, and any powers you get with what race you choose now go play the game :d",1
"warframe is a good shooter that is totally worth your money and is fun with friends so go out there and buy this s@#t u b@#$h",1
"a great game with many rpg elements. lots of fun if ur into grinding games. fun controlls and ideas. only bad thing i have to say is very glitchy",6
"fast-paced action, if you wanted to stealth it you would need to work hard but it all pays of",1
"really, really, glitchy... but one of the most fun fps games on steam and possibly ever created.",1
"a very good game i really like it. its fun when you play with friend thats why i take it.",1
"space + ninjas + awesome weapons + awesome frames = awesome game... worth the free download!",7
"ive only been into this game for a day now, but, iam hooked. it is very fun.",1
"a great 3rd person ninja simulator. a diverse range of weapons and abilities. only problem is it acts much like an ipad or iphone game in the aspect of pay platinum to rush build this!, however, the addition of trading lessens that to an extent.",2
"its good. i tested it over a year before release. top notch free pve. try it! -zenmaster.",1
"great game, but theres no other possibility then bringing up your wallet if u dont want to sell your own stuff everytime. (i am talking here about the slots, its the only thing that made me quit this game.)",4
"i in love this game its a damn good mix of all a amer needs!!!!!!!!!! :d",7
"this game is totally amazing when playing with friends! but playing alone can be boring sometimes :) great game to be a f2p! really sets new standards.",5
"if you like ninjas,and if you like space, this will just blow your mind!......what are you waiting for go play it! its free!",1
"mac client? i think if you guys made it possible to play this game on mac, it would get more ratings. i play the game at my dads house on my pc and i really enjoy it c:",1
"lots of people like it but i feel its rather boring in my opinion",1
"warframe certainly has a lot to offer you if youre after a little bit of multiplayer hack and slash/shooter action, and whilst it is not as much fun playing solo missions there are always public parties which can be joined. well worth getting if youre not looking for too much in the way of story-centric gameplay.",6
"this is a good game but often does get repetitive because sometimes you have to farm for the amount of money to buy swords, guns etc but it goes by really quick. one tip i could give is that to not buy the blueprints at a low level as it is a pain to know that you have to find the part at a planet you havent unlocked yet",1
"are you dat one person who likes 2nd person shooting games well this game is free and has online,invite and lots more so just oh screw dis!!! just buy da freakin game its so good!!!!!!!!",1
"its awesome just play it. also its a third person shooter type game.",1
"very excellent freegame. watch the trailer and be amazed",1
"great for people who like: sci-fi environments having alternate characters fast paced action learning advanced mechanics color customization guilds/clans loot grinding for rarer items horde modes not recommeded for people who like: a story driven campaign (i believe this is under fruther development) playing solo (without random other players or friends) a melee-only game (while possible, its not easy) exploring every bit of a map (most groups prefer to run through missions/levels)",2
"this game is freaking amazing!!!!!! 5 stars 2 thumbs up!",1
"this game is like phantasy star online but with ninjas! best free-to-play title ive played so far!",1
"its pretty decent, but too much lagg for some reason.",1
"i played this game before i told my friend about it. now he is ahead of me. i hate him.",1
"you run on walls and shoot stuff. you also have a smooth crotch pad. 10/10.",1
"great game. imagine a 3d shooter where you will find the gun that suites your play style, find the enemy type that you like to kill. group up with clan mates to double the fun. you like fast shooting gun ? slow and strong ? you like ranged targets ? you like melee targets ? you want to run around to have an advantage ? you want to sit in 1 spot and use a sniper ? you want to play stealthly ? this game has all the game modes to do all these things and even more. you might need to think about the game a bit differently to avoid boredom after a while. i personally hunted 85% of achievements :d. dont judge the game if you have not tried other then starter weapons.",8
"this is fun! check it out, its free to play on steam, coming to ps4 as f2p as well, so get ready !!!",1
"i think warframe is a good game to play with friends and i give it 4 out of 5",1
"probably one of the best free-to-play games currently in existance. i dont give that out lightly.",9
"warframe is a great mmo and fps it primarly focuses pve which i love and all thought i dont play this game much its mostly due to my dislike to fps and it still captivating me for so long and i still come back to it if you love fps games and prefer pve with alot of cool abilties and weapons its the free game for u!",3
"best game i ever played. have 650 hours of gameplay and im love it",9
"this game is fun, however it can get repetitive quickly",1
"if you arent playing this game, youre missing out. its still in beta, but its absolutely fantastic. space ninjas, john woo-style gun-and-sword-play, squad-based combat, inventory crafting and upgrades, class-based warframes, and its all for free and still growing. if nothing else, give it a try, because ive been playing it since i downloaded it and its just plain damn fun.",2
"m8 this is top quality third person shooter material right here. you should buy it cuz it is cool.",1
"this is an amazing game. it is challenging too. it is a bit like halo but way better. the class diversity is big and there is probably a warframe for your play style. the custumization of everything, even colors, is sweet! you just have to play it to see how awesome of a game this is.",1
"great game one of the best free to plays i have ever played other than tf2 but you have to put a good deal of effortbefore it really gets good id say an 8/10",2
"warframe is perfect for people that dont like pvp and just want to kill npc enemies and the way you play is your choice you could run into a room guns blazing or you could sneak in and take out half or more of the enemies without them knowing stealth is a big thing in this game i recomend that you try it you wont regret it",1
"space ninjas, epic sci-fi action, all for $0.00. nuff said.",1
"a very fun and amazingly well done game. its amazing that it is free when considering how much details and effort have been put into this game. although the enviroments can become annoying since they are repeated very, very often, the mode and story and other elements of the game, do change. like i said before, its a great game for being free and if you like nice fairly face, but not too fast, paced game play and co-ops, then this is perfect.",2
"its a mindless hackandslash grindfest. fun when playing with friends. 7/10",1
"fantastic and addicting co op rpg. space ninjas. enough said.",1
"cyborg space ninjas with machine guns. if i have to say anything else youre overthinking it.",1
"wareframe is the free evolutionary cescesor to dark sector, in warframe you and 3 of your friend (or not) will fight against or along side of 2 main factions. called corpus & the grunier. your main tool is a suit called a warframe. there are several warframe you can choos and create, witch offer you difrent sets of abilitis and tactics. you level them up alongside with your weapons and gain affinity whit the tenno (the player comunity) this game is driven by a grate crafting system whitch allows you to craft every single weapon and warfare in the game. you gaine power join a clan an shere resources you gain in your missions to get access to exclusive warframes an weaponsfrom the dojo (clan) the game is free to play and you dont have to pay a single $        p . to play and enjoy the game to its full extent. dont waist your time on not playing this game!!!! best co-op game of the decade, its a must play.",2
"ok my first impression, its confusing no real learning curve just jump in and go. 2nd it credits me with 9hrs playing i think its more like 9min. i hope to find its better, it taught me a few secends about how one class worked i need to go to a private area and learn the class i chose so people dont get upset at my not knowing what to do. i will give it a thumbs up for now.",1
"as free to play it can get very repetitive and boring trying to collect components to make new guns but the gameplay is very solid and it is a refreshingly new take on mmo shooters. updates are quite promising as well.",1
"very good game, early on its mostly just go planet to planet and unlock them but once you get to late game your job becomes level up your gear, farm for items and go to the void. some people seem to be confused, warframe is in a loot game. its kinda like borderlands in that you level up (your gear, but also your mastery) and collect items. but in warframe you build more weapons and frames. should you play it? yes. should you play it expecting a linear campaign with a great story and character arches like they go from nice and fragile then to a total badass? no. if you enjoy starting with pretty much nothing and earning cooler and cooler gear and like the sense of achievement from getting that braton prime then yes. definitly play it.",5
"its actually quite addicting .... wins on gameplay, and variety of characters (or frames), weapons, and mods. i find myself going into missions to see if i can get just that extra mod or level boost to improve your frame or weapons. hp, shields, power level, ammo consumption, the works. teaming up for missions is very easy and automatic. youll find that most everyone will lend a helping hand to low level chars in missions. if youre starting out, remember warframe wiki is your friend..... two thumbs up.",7
"i have had this game for a while now and have made some walthroughs on you tube (tutorials 101). if you are looking for a great game that is free to play i highly recomend warframe!!",1
"very good game the missions are varied and the constant addition of content stops it from getting repetetive although if you dont have time to do more than a few missions at once you may want to play something else as it takes a lot to do anything in the game so a considerable investment is needed i am currently only getting onto my 2nd full weapon set and have been playing for about 30 hours",2
"i have now played the tutorial about a millin times. the game looks great but if it wont load anything but the tutorial then whats the point. ill change my review if it ever lets me play....... i was able to sat playing the game and it is great. i appologize for the ill review and i will comment further when i log some more time",1
"runs exceptionally well on -tier computing equipment, looks great, fun gameplay, lots of unlockables. i would gladly not not play this.",1
"space ninjas!!! now with wall running action! for a game that actually calls the main characters the player has control of (tenno) space ninjas; i feel more like a common solider or maybe some kind of super marine. for each specialized suit of armor or the appropriately dubbed warframe there is a specific set of powers to utilize. this creates a great many varied play styles to be compiled on top of the games variously expanding game modes. warframes and weapons are limited by available slots to hold them. i.e. but more slots if you want more things. while the ingredients and blueprints to craft items (warframes & weapons) are readily available and easy to get provided you can survive the specific map that drops said items; the items to upgrade and expand these things are at best a rare drop from a hard fight or only come from specific in-game events. otherwise you will pay out of pocket. however a company has to make money somehow and anybody with enough dedication or just stupid luck will be able to reach the apex of their given potential. overall a nice looking game that still provides a lot of fun even to those who dont wish to or cannot pay. this is not a free to play title that gives you only the first few nothings then forces you to drop some money to get into everything. if it was i wouldnt ever bother writing about it.",3
"yeah ill recommend the game.... played it to death and would do again if i had the chance. updates came too slow for my liking when i needed something to grind towards right then and there and sometimes you would get matched with a completely  team or someone who was afk. that kind of broke defense when i wanted to get to high waves. but overall awesome indie game.",5
"repetative, but one of the best looking and most fluid games ive ever played. add to the mix some serious leveling up action and youll find yourself ploughing 10s of hours into it. ...and its free - so you can find out for yourself with no risk!",1
"this game is alot better then the meta score says trust me",3
"this is a free to play game that does justice to the format. there are regular updates and the developement team interacts with the player base to create a continuously developing pve environment that is fun for all players.",3
"pay2sleep third-person hack n slash super robot genocidal ninja men grindfest. 5/5 warbros #1",4
"i was sceptical when i first looked a this game, you know, free-to-play usually are not good at all. this game is different. i was hooked after just about the first hour. amazingly polished, fun, gorgeus and surprisingly interesting. i love how you have the freedom to build your own unique char to suit your play style. i higly recommend this to anyone who is tired of other games, where you have to endlesly gather rat tails, kill orcs and look at elfs...",2
"havent got so caught up with a game for while, warframe is so much fun that it took out almost 12 hours of my time every single day~ it is a fun, its coop, hack and slash, and space ninja(freaking space ninja!!!) this game does have something i doesnt really like in a game, that it uses real time for a item to be crafted, even with that it didnt stop me from playing it. for people who like to have fun, this is your game. the thing that frustrate me from time to time are the bug and glitches, it sometime force me to abandon a mission because of it, though the game is still in beta, bug and glitches are to be expected.",2
"a really good f2p game, mostly co-op based missions but its also fun to play with random people. great graphics, good gameplay, you can get everything in the game but takes some time, but not like other f2ps this one is faster. the only bad thing about this that the platinum is so overpriced its not worth to buy. i would not recommend buying platinums, not worth it trust me, not on steam at least. buy platinum of the 49.99 and the 79.99 dollar version if you want to support the company of the game and get many plats and good in-game stuff to your account. dakra prime/10 (it means 10/10)",3
"an excellent game for anybody looking for something new to play, but also for older tenno like myself, who play the upper levels of the game.",7
"thanks nano , i have had it for some time, it gets a bit old after a while ,the missions seem to be the same over and over with just a different setting,still something to do .",1
"this is a great looking game especially for a free to play. amazing gameplay. very addicting. each warframe, gun and melee weapon has a unique feel to it. the maps are awesome and theres enough of a variety to them. only issue is a lack of story and level objective.",1
"space ninjas in space with space guns and space katanas. preeeetty awesome.",5
"warframe? i love the co-op gameplay and the action. why? its free to play, anyone can play it!!",1
"i like how how to its a face game and crosses alomost no bounderies.",1
"this game is pretty sweet for being free, at least for the 2 horus ive played so far. space ninjas, wall running, machine guns, dual pistols, aliens. and hey, its free; if you dont like it, uninstall it.",1
"ninjas. in space, warframe, as hd graphic game with another twist; its free. for a free game, its badass with charming resoloution and fast-paced gameplay. i dont prefer playing this on high graphics (itll slow down your gameplay and give latency lag). yeah sure de made a  game called star trek : the game, but warframe is a different turn as it updates every-step of the way so you wont get bored of using one warframe",3
"get it. this game, makes any mmo look like goldfish brains.",3
"this has to be the best f2p game ive ever played. amazing graphics (even on the lowest settings) wrapped up with amazing lore. but in the end, who doesnt want to jump around, shooting and hammering at things? ragdolls for everyone.",3
"repetative quality. spend your bonus real money currency on weapon and/or warframe slots. played best with people of the same rank as you, since veterans (from my experience) rarely wait up and just plow through the levels. try to learn all the movement abilities as early as possible (the quickest way of getting around for me was sliding, jumping and then sliding again). controls are good and fluent. graphics are awesome. art style is weird. i would only reccomend it if you have a lot of time on your hands and are bored out of your mind. otherwise, play something else (like spiral knights [no, not really]).",1
"normally im not that much into f2p games as the quality is usually abysmal and basicly whoever pays always wins over the players who dont. warframe is different in this aspect though. the graphics and effects are superb, everything players can buy can also be obtained ingame (although sometimes it can be a bit of a grind) and the devs are extremely passionate about their game (this is easily noticed how fast they react to glitches and how well they listen to the council and the normal players). as a founder and a closed beta player this game has already made brilliant progress and the devs are far from done with this game so expect a looooooooooot more content. definitely a recommend from me. (around 600+ hours in the game)",5
"for being a free to play game it has nice graphics and smooth gameplay. that being said the areas are extremely repetative in nature and becomes almost boring to play in. i understand the game when i played it was only like 6-10 months old and still in beta but even for a preview i got the feeling that after about 40 hours of gameplay you probably seen everthing this game has to offer. pros: free to play, great graphics, good amount of replayability due to many many different kinds of suites being available, powers and customizables make for a good amount of variables. cons: free to play, but pay to win/have fun. i am getting worried that game companies are going to start adopting this method and it scares me to no end that it will spell disater for the game industry. its almost ruined a whole generation of games for me and many many others. overall: fun to play for a while, but to keep having fun money is to be spent and alot of it unless you spent the huge amount of money on a founders pack already. decent overall free to play game, at the very least try it out cause honestly there is no harm in playing a free game.",1
"this game reminds me of the time i sneezed and coughed at the same time. for a moment i felt as though i was master of the universe (similar to he-man but i know i dont have pecks as well defined as him). i like how this game doesnt play around with the idea of giving you a choice about motion blur; whether you set the game graphic settings to function on a windows 98 or the underground super computer that monitors the stock exchange the results are the same. what results you may ask? well rush writes a long run-on sentence about the choices you make for starters. from that point onward things become less like lechuga and more like spinach patte. i found myself pondering the meaning of my life as a lithe robotic swordsman in this strange world. i wanted people to love me but all they ever did was yowl at me and fire lasers at my face. sometimes life is like that though, sometimes life yowls at you and fires lasers at you when all you really want is love. because love is a complicated thing and robots are never prepared for the complexity that even bear people can only bear-ly (huehashdauhsuhduahsda) comprehend. i guess the moral of this story is that sometimes life is like a gourd filled with mayonaise.",1
"ive been playing this game for a whole year now and i must say that as someone who generaly avoids online gaming (wow, lol etc.) this game got me hooked really really good. anyone who enjoys 3rd person shooters or rpgs should definetly give this one a try at least.",9
"this game has been in open beta for almost a year (its one of those games). sure they come out with updates all the time, but i doubt it will ever be a complete game.",1
"naf: hey do-wop is that game any fun? do-wop: not really.",2
"i have only begun playing this game, it is very fun, you can either go ahead and lead the group, or follow behind. you get rewarded for every action you make during the missions. i am sort of excited about the possibility that eventually it will be cross-platform with all those ps4 users. the game play is pretty fun and addictive.",1
"when you want a realy cool adventure where you can be realy hard motherucker than play this !but when you dont want play this modering epic game than go and crawl in your litle corner of shyme !",3
"amazing graphics for a free games as well as animations and abilities. great coop game.",4
"great game for those who want a pve first person shooter! ive got over 200 hours in this game and i plan on putting a lot more into it. the dev team is reasonable, listens to their playerbase, quick with updates/fixes and even interact with their community!",6
"in a game where futuristic space-suited rebels called warframes must protect the universe from the evil, you play as one of the many various frames to choose from. the game starts out a bit confusing, and can be quite challenging, but if you hang in there and really pay attention to tutorials, this becomes what i consider to be one of the best free to play games ever made. with a very vast choice in how youd like to play, as well as how you look, weapons you use, and what type of mission you like to do, warframe is one hell of a great game. if you havent given this fantastic game a try, make sure that is on your soon todo list. and if you have only played a few hours and are having a rough time, go to youtube, there are litterally thousands of helpful tutorials, the same can be said for the websites forums.",3
"this game is surely amazing it is definitely what an f2p game should be like but this game is not without tiny drawbacks. levels are recycled on occasion eg mercury same as saturn etc etc and this game can be brutal if you dont play coop so to do solo you must have a decent warframe and gunz. but if you look past these flaws you are in for a treat. one of my favs of 2013/2014 so far 9/10",1
"warframe is a very good third person shooter. were you choose from 3 classes and you can earn more later. it has high graphics. the main thing in the game is to eliminate, destroy, protect, save, assassinate enemies with your friends.",1
"amazing graphics. great gameplay. characters and weapons are highly customizable. did i mention that all this is f2p? besides farming for mods, this game is will keep you coming back for more. p.s. it always more fun to play with games! 9/10",2
"amazing love it  yea play it please you will love it  it touch it dream it",1
"other than physics issues and the insane amount of grinding required to get anything without premium currency, this is an amazing game. i reccomend it a whole lot.",2
"one day, little clem tenno looked at the stars from his potato farm on ceres and said i want to be a space ninja, mommy. then his momma screeched tenno skoom at him and bashed him in the face with her gorgon. little clem tenno learned something important that day; his beloved mother was grineer scum. ever since then, little clem tenno devoted his life to learning the arts of vaccum ninjutsu, gun fu and coptering so that one day, when the grineer screamed clem in the middle of being bisected by a corrosive-flaming-ice-scythe, he would know they were talking about him.",5
"as a f2p game, warframe is one of the best. the game controls amazingly for a space ninja parkour game. thankfully these mechanics make the repetitive storyline a lot better and the variety of space ninja guns and swords are so fun to try out and ninja parkour some space clones and aliens.",1
"unlike my friend bartrick, i personly love this game. you dont need to pay to win, and you can customize it to your playstile with different suits, weapon types and more, all earned by just playing!",1
"its really good. new content frequently, events nearly weekly and a fun loot game. really addictive.",3
"play this game more than once, its weird at first and will hurt a bit, but just let it go... 10/10",1
"funny co-op grinder tps rpg omg wtf. adicting to spend hours grinding for your eq. and is allways improoving due to frequent updates!",3
"beautiful game! now that this is thru beta everythings more debugged and getting to be flawless. that and the game has super sexy graphics.",1
"awesome sci-fi third person shooter. a gem that should not be missed.",1
"a good game if you enjoy co-op and scifi style rpgs",1
"portal reference incoming . . . spppaaaccce.......... im in space",4
"great game, but after a while it does get a little slow and you have to repeat a lot of missions to get materials...",1
"this game is just awesome. free game but no pay to win - you can work to get blueprints and collect the necessary items. only downside is that to have the most custimization color-wise you have to use platinum. aside from that, the game is totally amazing. a map is never the same, where you start and the path you take never really seems to repeat. definitely one of the best free to play games out there. 10000/10",1
"a great game which is an even greater time sink. content is constantly added and changed so you can leave for a few months and potentially return to a brand new game, i did a few times. if you are a fan of third person shooters then this could be the game for you with alot of awesome warframes and fun weapons to play with as well as some decently challenging gameplay. 8/10 overall in my book.",2
"played this in open beta and it was very fun. i would recommend this game to anyone that likes a fast paced action game, add in the co-op element and its a night of great fun with friends.",1
"hard to understand the way the game establishes the perk system, but overall the game is really fun. good graphics and and fast paced.",1
"+ -classes -lv. -mods -bosses -multiplayer :) -graphic no -!!!:) 10/10 thats all :)",1
"this game is great as soon as i started playing i kept it up for 10 hours pretty much,great agility,good weapons,characters/warframes,and clans, but there are some dissipointing things,most of the store is expensive and takes a long time to get items (12 hours for a bow!). and theres not much of pvp stuff only conclave, so no ctf,deathmatch,ffa,no vehicles from factions. and you cant get that many materiels per level. but i give the game a 8/10. still hooking.",1
"what do we want to do? fart! fart! open up your butt cheeks, this is how our butts speak. lets go fart! -saryn",1
"its an amazing game but tends to be more of a pay-to-win game afterall.",2
"amazing game!!! the combat system is fun. the graphics are awesome. and its free!!! (p.s pleeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaase make it for mac",1
"10/10 i now know what it means to be a space ninja.",3
"great game but could do with more variation in environments.",1
"amazing just amazing. its like boom to the face wiith awesomeness",1
"i think it is a good game but it take some time to get anything.",1
"ok ive only plyed this game for a few hours and i gotta say it is amazing, the only thing it needs is pvp and its perfect. if you like thrid-person shooters like gears of war, dead space or anything along those types and then add ninjas youve got warframe.",1
"best free to play game out there it has amazing graphics!",8
"blew 100 hours of my life on this game. i am out of money. 5 stars.",3
"1) its free 2) its absolutely gorgeous looking game and the game flows very smoothly 3) interesting combat and crafting system negitives: combat gets kinda repetitive, hard to find lobies and the extra help is important because you burn alot of ammo",1
"warframe is kinda like if borderlands 2 gave your more characters to play with, was free-to-play, and gave those characters more abilities to play with. while the two games are pretty far apart from each other, the grind in both of them is real, if that sounds like a huge turnoff recommend you spend some time doing the missions before spending the hard earned blood money in this game.",1
"this game is easy to pick up and lots of fun. things are changing appropriately and new events keep the game fresh and up to date. updates give you more goals and things to aim for and there is always something exciting going on.",5
"ive been playing this game since the first day it came out, actually i even signed up at their website when it was still in building progress. the thing is, this game is a hell out of fun really cool and takes you deep into action just only one edvice; if you have a 2001 computer dont even download this it mate.",1
"this game is really graphic, which is awesome! just some advice, dont play long sessions of this, as the game can get slightly repetitive after a while. but its still a great game especially since its free to play. 7/10",1
"is a very fun game to have and updates bring more fun to the game",7
"it may say that i have spent 3 hours on warframe right now, but in total i have proabaly played 5 days worth.",1
"space ninjas and awsome fighting what more do you want?",1
"an awesome game, great control, interactive, awesome arsenal, and not to mention the the great level design and graphics. would reccomend this game to everyone who likes hoard like attacks and sci-fi like games.",1
"a lot of grinding for mods you want, but its all worth it.",4
"pros: fun game to play with others, friendly community on the game cons: huge grind to level lots of equipment and warframes, solo play is extremely difficult compared to multi.",1
"simple concept -- third person shooter with multiple character choices which can be collected and powered up through use. varieties of builds and possibilities keep the game entertaining, constantly new modifications, builds, weapons and frames to try. no definite end game, so collecting the everything becomes the primary focus, along with building community and meeting new people to blow things up. highly addictive.",2
"really fun game. only downside is that it is kinda time consuming. -warning- extreme addiction may occur",6
"warframe is a brilliant game i played it since before it was on steam and i could always rely on it to free me from my boredom of other games. even if you dont like the look of this game get it because its free and i think itll suprise you",1
"fun game to play with friends! i like to think of it like halo on steroids!",1
"recommended game, if you guys ever played mass effect before, very similiars, but its free anyway",1
"ever wondered what it would be like to be a space ninja? step into warframe and find out for yourself",1
"this game, like absolutely a great third-person ninja fighting derptastic game ever. would recommend this for sure to some people.",1
"awesome game. some grinding (due to rng) but overall a fun way to slaughter clones, robots, and spacezombies. join the war and be the loudest space ninja in the verse.",9
"one of the best mmo games right now. you dont have to farm as much.",8
"ninjas? badass. robot-like armor and special abilities? badass. using ninja robot-like armor and special abilities? just get this game already :d",3
"ever wanted to be a ninja??? well nows your chance, play warframe it is such a good game.",1
"fantastic game, great for a group of 4 friends to have fun and promote teamwork at the same time. there is a lot of grinding, thats most of the game, but hey, its the most fun and unique grinding ive ever done.",9
"its a game about being a space ninja with super powers. whats not to love? (other than the fact its in beta and some of the levels get repetitive)",6
"space ninjas... what else. ive found that with the right mods and play style ive been able to do just as much damage with a base frame as people whove paid money for higher end frames, just not as efficently. thats important for a f2p game in my opinion. the graffics are swell and the movements are pretty fluid. with some farming you can build and create all the weapons availible. really fun.",4
"it felt familiar from the start, like a 3rd person borderlands. once you understand the mods and how to use 1 of 3 starter warframes, it becomes highly addictive. i have played nothing but warframe for the past month! clans, lots of weapons, & pvp! the res & textures are amazing! the lighting is unmatched! this is an 8.5 out of 10 for me! highly recommended!!!",2
"game which you can play for a week every 2-3 months, otherwise its will get really booring.",2
"a fun enough game. the f2p model is very balanced and you dont really have to spend money to do well.",1
"amazing game i recommend that if your new or even old steam community members play it its fun",1
"in the beginning its fun and its co-op, but after a while becomes very repetitive",1
"a good game i think most people should try. its a good co-op game to play with your friends, only downside is that it can be computer intensive. it can also be lag at times. but its also free to play and its nice to search for warframe parts to make new warframes and weapons.",4
"ninjas. in space. swords, guns, explosive powers... the answer is yes.",7
"very intresting gameplay, game itself is free and the game is just so different... should definetly give it a shot guys, have fun!",3
"amazing game great gameplay can get a lot of hours out of it and its free",2
"the best game ever. does need a high graphics card but other wise, highly recommended. almost as good as league of legends",4
"so, space ninjas with guns and powers...whats not to like? warframe is a good game but its also kind of difficult to explain. you are a tenno; an ancient race of warriors who have emerged from cryostasis after a long cyrosleep. thats all i really know about them, the game doesnt go too far into that. anywho, the gameplay is pretty fun but it can get repetitive. there are a number of warframes available either by crafting (you need the warframe blueprint which drops ingame and various other materials to do so) or they can be bought using platinum, which is the microtransaction currency of the game. each warframe has different abilities, strengths, weaknesses, etc but they are all fairly balanced. there a various and sundry melee weapons and guns to chose from as well which can also be crafted or purchased but some of them have level restrictions. missions range from data extraction to escort to kill everything. the mod system....thats a bit too much to go into here but its pretty involved and enables the player to customize their warframe with buffs and abilities. id recommend watching a tutorial on youtube before tackling this beast because the game doesnt do a great job of explaining itself but it is fun. id recommend it to anyone looking for a unique 3rd person action/shooter.",1
"the best third-person grinder that you will ever play. the game is great but once you get into the harder parts of the game you might have to start soloing through the galaxy because no one wants to play with you. even with that, the classes are great and diverse and there are a variety of ways to be a space ninja.",1
"warbros #1, sleek coding, nothing can get better than this!",1
"free-to-play co-op parkour space-ninjas with guns. nuff said.",1
"its a great game it just has some lag so just keep that in mind!",1
"good fast paced third person shooter. match making system is pretty randomized, tossing you in with whatever group has an opening on the map youre trying to play (if there is one) at any point of the level. a lot of people like blowing through maps very quickly, so low level play can be frustrating as you wont get many kills grouping with high levels, and you wont be able to pick up things while trying to keep up. still, solo play or playing with friends to start off as you learn is fun, and once you get the hang of it you should be able to jump right into games with the more experienced players. this is a free to play game, so micro transactions are rampant. they arent required for success, but they do make things quicker and easier for you on the crafting end. crafting can take up to 3 days on some items, and there is an in game pay option to make them finish instantly, or just outright buy the full item for real money. i would suggest playing without paying till you know for sure its the game for you.",1
"warframe is a free exciting action game that can be played single player and multiplayer with friends or without and i recommend this game for you sci-fi action lovers.",1
"its fun, its free, it looks and sounds great. i could go on about the game but ill sum it up by saying this: its diablo + phantasy star online + the guyver + mass effect + ninjas - in space. dig it.",1
"this game is one of my favorites and what makes it even better is that its free to play!",1
"amazing game, you can almost see it as a mix between daiblo + borderlands + masseffect + ninjas, devs are ambitious and push to evolve the game with every update and works with a very active community when adding new content. speaking of cummenity, very welcoming and helping ; all around, if you wanna lose countless hours deep into high action wall running head shotting invisible eviscarating gameplay, all wrapped around in a sci-fi space ninja universe, this is the game for you. 8.5 /10 must be played",8
"it has a nice concept, but the view for shooting is a bit strange, the mechanics are a bit laggy, and each mission is more or less the same thing",1
"an excellent, fun and fast paced game with great memory and cpu usage, i heartily recommend it but with a peice of advice: play with friends and set yourself a goal!",3
"this game is one of the best games iv played. it is great for people who like to play with friends especiualy becasue its different and very enjoyable. maybe it looks like a tipical tps but it isnt... it has a lot of strategy and fun. apart from the micro-transactions, this games blows the system ;)",1
"never seen such an awesome game in quite a while. and its free! i has a very fluent and forward gameplay, and i just love bashing out through the maps aoeing people with skills and doing parkour really fast. the history concept of the game is very well defined, as it resembles a war of races through the universe, having the planets as fighting pits. however, its kind of difficult to become really strong because of its highcost micro-economy. without some platinum, you harshly can get new weapons and/or characters, as well as a lot of customization. so in that way, it gets limited. but hey, its free. has mindblowing graphics. and we cant get everything can we?",1
"warframe has come a long way since its release one year ago. the devs have really out done themselves in the making of this game. the work they put into a truely amazing game and there relationship with the community to keep there costumers happy is outstanding. you will get way more then you would ever expect for a free to play co-op game, and yes it is completely free to play in every way. there is a in game store but everything in the store can be made in the foundry were you can craft anything thats availible in the store along with so much more. everything from the clan play, crafting, weapons, mods, dojo and the variety of different mission types to the bosss its all there. this game has something for everyone and for a f2p game you cant go wrong. the graphics are top notch dx11 with some really great effects and physics, and the game play is some of the best co-op game play i have ever played maybe even the best. it has become so popular it will be coming to ps4. i should also mention its a shooter with melee wich is actually the best melee in any game i have ever played. normaly im not into melee games but yes this one pulls it off big time.",6
"theres no game like it. reccomend to all who love third person shooters or ninja games.",2
"this is an amazing game, very addicting and well worth playing if you dont mind spending time grinding. well worth playing and you can even get everything in the game for free provided you spend a lot of time.",1
"if youre not playing this already, youre a loser. straight up.",2
"great game. its a bit hard to get into it in the beginning but once i went past a certain point i started to have a hell of a lot of fun.",5
"ninjas, fps, assassins, more ninjas what other can i say? very fun game that you can play solo or with friends since you can create your clan or play some missions with friends :) p.s. did i mention ninjas? yes? katana then? shuriken? yeah! it also have those weapons! it even has bow!!!!",4
"this is a game that is definitely more enjoyable with a friend or group. with update 14, the tutorial is much, much better and allows you to choose from three different warframes (characters). you also get your choice of three different melee weapons, three secondary weapons, and three primary weapons. the update also added a ship from which you can set travel destinations, access the marketplace, access your arsenal of weapons, and mod both your weapons and warframe. the controls in the game, however, feel a bit unpolished. wall-running and sliding are difficult themselves, but shooting and hitting your target while doing so is near impossible (unless im just awful). the in-game economy degrades the overall experience as well because buying new warframes, weapons, and revives requires platinum, which must be bought with real currency. there is another in-game currency, credits, which seem pretty much useless and obsolete. playing with a friend is almost a necessity so that you dont have to use platinum to buy more, and no, more platinum can not be bought with credits. then again, all of that is extras and the game is still enjoyable with the starting warframes and weapons, but i just wish more was free, or could be bought with credits, in this free-to-play game. ive posted some gameplay on my youtube channel. feel free to check out post update 14 gameplay if you would like:",1
"this game is simply amazing. and free to play too! the basic gameplay is free. i recommend for all who wanth play fps game.",1
"warefame is a great game if you like flips sword guns and action you will lov this game and evan if you lag alittle bit it does affect anything",1
"its just amazing. space. ninjas. guns. blood. brutality. just play it.",1

"if you were a space ninja, id play you for one hundred hours as well.",3
"love this game to but you might not like it. but i like its a really good game i hope you like it",1
"its a fun free to play. wall running, kunai, lasor guns and karate kicking robots. the ultimate space ninja game!",6
"much better game if you have someone to play with.",1
"its like l4d but ninjas. it relates to a lot of good games like mass effect and gears of war. just a good tps!",1
"this game is a grind fest, linear, and boring after a couple of hours... ive been raiding the same planet over and over again for just one component i need for a weapon... never got it... you can buy... buy weapons and upgrades for money.. or their platnium currency. this game is just boring... oh hey but you can jump off walls and stuff like a ninja, ok thatss fun until it gets boring.. which it does.. if your going to play this be prepared to grind all day and night for 2 months for a couple of pistols and maybe a katana.. and its boring after the first week.",1
"if you like kilin aliens with super skills and guns this is your game",3
"i like the game, its very good and well made. good graphics and the only thing i dont like is that with the thirdperson view you can derp out or glitch out and get your camera view stuck. but all-in-all its a really good game which helps me get through my boring summer!",1
"i think there should be the choice to create multiple warframes",1
"mass effect and metal gear rising forgot to use a condom, with surprising results",1
"the game is extremly fun but almost impossible to beat solo, it also is borderline pay-to-win but its pve unless you go to the pvp sector. i shot a guy with an arrow, he then flew back hitting 3 other guys making them all stick to a wall overall 8.5/10",4
"after wasting my time downloading it is worth it! i must really recommend this game because of the style of the game and the unique gameplay of the game :d (worth downloading it!)",1
"amazing game highly addictive would recommend for anyone who like ninjas in friggin space",3
"i cant play well the game is always getting crash :(",1
"kinda different from most 3rd person shooters, theres always one guy with >750 hours steamrolling the place if you play with randoms. was not impressed 3.6/5",1
"it is a realy good game the only thing i would do to change it is add another invintory spot so you can hold your melee wepon like you would your primairy and secondairy and posibly adding in an assasin kill when you walk up behind an enomy (wile crouching) with your melee wepon inhand it prforms a one hit kill assasin animation.",1
"this game is really good online and with friends it is less enjoyable playing solo mode",1
"this game is so worth it, even with the bugs and anything else. it is amazing",4
"save up your money and everything and get very good guns and warframes so you never loose",3
"this game is both a grind and glitch fest. it takes forever to collect what you need just so you can craft something, and by the time you get everything you need to craft a certain item, its useless because you leveled up so much and upgraded your gear. this game makes me rage a lot that i ran out of complaints on why this is the worst game ive played. the sad thing about all of it is, im addicted to it! play at your own risk!!! 2/10 ps: the wall running, wall climbing, and jumping are complete disasters.",1
"i have yet to play this game but i can tell it holds great potenional",1
"a cool game. the only problem seems to be that its really too short and too easy. after having collected every warframe and everything, there is nothing to do... its not possible for many players to get to level 16 and it doesnt make any difference for game play in fact. grinding is all you need to do, and its easy grinding in most of the case. if you really wanna finish this game fast, just spend some plat and buy the 2 different resource boosters. again, its almost not possible to play this game without paying a penny. you will suffer hard wihout paying for plat because u do need those slots. you can try to get plat from selling mods... however its not really a fun thing to sell mods and grind mods in most of the cases. at the last, wish u enjoy the game. its free... to some extend.",7
"i really did love this game. you know, until an update made it so the game shuts down my computer on the login screen.",1
"probably the best freetoplay game youll ever see.",1
"i love this game but it would be nice to actuallyearn platinum buy ranking up but i still recomend this game",1
"im in love with this game. its one of the few i could play non-stop 24/7. i love the challenge you get in later levels and all the gear to choose from. i totally recommend playing this amazing, free game!",1
"this game is awesome!!!,ive played it for days.its epic and fun.there might be a lot of glitches but i recommend to play this game",5
"nice mix between shooter and melee playgame, the donation and pay to win system its a little annoying but its normal in all free games around internet.",2
"i would recommend this game if youlike sci-fi mmo, sure most of the missions might require 2 people sometimes to get past a  of a boss but the style and feel of the game makes up for it with its mix of hack and slash and shoot em ups not to mention its a good game for a free to play title",1
"i have a problem with connecting in game ! i created account and do all stuf.. but when i open the game its saids : the beta key for this account has not been activated ! help pleaseee!!!! fast",1
"this game is easily worth your money, so it at least deserves your time.",1
"very entertaining co-op, and while still in beta, it delivers a very large amount of content. with the huge amount of customisation, both in appearances and functionality of frames and weapons, and even the ability to build something from the ground up, this game can keep you hooked for a long time. there are naturally, points in which it feels lacking for now, but digital extremes are obviously hard at work making this game better every moment they have. you can clearly see the amount of effort and love that are going into making this, and it seems that with every large update, the game just manages to become more aluring. there are quite a few approaches you can take on gameplay, especially concerning the weapons you choose. these can offer incredible diversity in playstyle, which one can further change according to their tastes, when it comes to customisation. the amount of mobility is also a great factor in this game, allowing you to perform a variety of acrobatic moves to get around, or even get the upper hand on enemies, if you know what youre doing.",5
"this is currently the best free-to-play co-op game out there and theres no reason you shouldnt try it out. a nice combination of melee and ranged fighting, interesting special abilities and parkour. its a game about space ninjas. what else would you expect?",3
"game looks great and plays well, just be warned that at time of writing a major overhaul of the damage system just went down, so theyve got kinks to work out. definitely worth your time!",6
"fun game at first but gets repetitive fast and they seem to only care about their ingame store more than fixing things and it shows. still you can get a good amount of enjoyment before you get tired of it.",1
"seems pretty generic, your basic third-person shooter, no cover, but i guess poor irish people with their whiskey-powered potato computers can run it pretty good, and its free, but as we all know, only s like  mcson(ryan gosling) play the butt-hole of games, like maybe this! i dont ing know!",1
"not sure why people hate this game and say its repetitve, but i love the  out of this :dd ! this game is easy to get into but acquiring new weapons and warframes requires patience, commitement and hardwork ! this game is free to play in mind and yes you can purchase weapons and warframes without farming the components needed to craft the items! if you enjoy 3rd person shooting games i guarentee you that you will enjoy this game, it takes a while to get into but once you dive into the game and understand mechanics, enemy types, warframe abilities its really awesome game!",2
"this is still open beta, which means there will be changes. however, that also means new content too and thats what washes the boredom away. aside from that, the sleek art design and presentation are very appealing. its a 3rd person shooting/slashing/powers and abilities sci fi game, much like the mass effect series which made me start playing in the first place.",8
"this is a very fun game with a good free to play system and considering it is free theres no reason not to give it a try, i expect you will enjoy it.",2
"an amazing game with it getting even better the further you get into the game.",7
"a lovely game yet from my clan it seems to lack a good endgame,that isnt just in empowering mod power and mathematically being unstoppable. it is also made it self in damage 2.0 a challenge in the beginning as said from one of my friend starting the game . the first gear seems to do little damage to any enemy .in the negative it lacks a solid endgame is difficult for many beginners to start ,yet is a lovely game through and through the make up of a good endgame is new weapons coming out every update . in a good note its a good free to play that money doesnt buy power. you can buy the gear yet you must invest time and use into the gear .in the end its a lovely game in constant change thats besides being good, free,and original . it also lack some solid stealth elements. to end its game worthy of at least a glance at ,and it has a good community in the clans (havent look at the game community yet it looks like a welcoming place )",6
"a great game that i enjoy playing even now. with an array of choices for weapons, warframes, and several other options all customizable the game is able to fit the preference of the player. the game is constantly changing and new releases come out often so there is always new ways to play the game.",10
"fun game to play. friendly players. ton of fun in a group.",5
"this game is heroin. ive wasted countless hours of my life on this game, and it has caused me to quit my job, drop out of school, and lose my house. im now sucking  to buy platinum, and living under a bridge next to starbucks, so i can steal their internet to play this game. 12/10 would play all day every day.",6
"warframe is a fantastic game just avoid the anal lice",9
"good game and community. missions are slightly reptitive after a while but still fun when playing with friends.",9
"great game with a few kinks that have to be worked out, but thats just part of being in a beta. competeing with all the other mmo games isnt easy but warframe is coming along quite well.",3
"such a good game that i dont even get why its free. also dont understand how it got a 66/100 metascore. but what can you do?",2
"at least play once if youre an hardcore f2p gamer. enough said.",1
"this game is one of my favorites for two reasons. 1. it always seems to get better and better with each update. 2. it always has a new thing to do at every mission. people will enjoy this game. if you decide to get it, meet you there!",1
"one of the best coop games i have ever played and gives farming techniques a new mentality to make it less tedious. the game is continually expanding and is becomming better with every update. quite honestly may be the best game of this year due to the fact it is also free.",5
"a quick jump-in-and-play level style. unique and interesting looking characters/frames that are far enough removed from modern stereotypes and standards to be interesting and creative. the gameplay is very fun and (almost) supports several types of play. if youre playing in a pug, expect to just rush in and kill everything. but if youre playing alone, or with friends, you can stealth through the mission, sneaking up behind guys and killing them before they see you, or combining certain powers from different frames for maximum effectiveness. you can collect and equip mods which let you use one of four powers for your frames, as well as mod your weapons to have different powers and effects. you collect resources in missions that let you build new weapons that you buy the blueprints from the marketplace for, and defeating bosses or special missions gets you blueprints for frames or special weapons. theyve recently added a codex to the game which allows you to properly make a collection of every enemy type and mod so you can see more information about them and have more to work towards. the only part of this i dont understand is why platinum or buyables are so freaking expensive. it completely turns me off the concept of buying anything instead of working ingame for it because its not at all worth the amount paid. having said that, i have bought platinum, but at high discounts on various sales.",4
"one of those rare games thats based around multiplayer, but is still fun in solo mode. i think the stealth aspect would be impossible in multiplayer. fun, relatively low system requirements, f2p. whats not to like?",1
"truely a great f2p game, i swear if this game cost money they would make alot.",1
"this game is probably the best tps f2p game ive seen ever!",3
"its like co-op gunz online, decent progression. albeit still in beta: a solid game.",3
"i cant stop playing. the first couple of days is the hardest but if you stick to it and play you will be rewarded with fun",2
"get the game, it is the best action, and free to play ever!",4
"this is a fun game of 4 people, and its fun to play with friends d:",1
"warframe is one of the most graphically impressive f2p games out there. the graphics, fun gameplay mechanics, and the nonexistent price make warframe a hell of a good game to play with buddies.",2
"nice game for co-op play and online action in war player-vs-enemy raids",3
"fun action game. sorta like being a ninja in space. good graphics. its still in beta so there are plenty of bugs. i recommend it. its free to play too which is always nice!",1
"an interesting game, in many ways. one that must be played in a party or all sense of cohesion is lost. it can be fun but team play may well be non existant and the wall running is ropey. i have enjoyed my brief time with it but it is most definitely pay to win, ignore the taf that says otherwise. at least it isnt pvp, that business model would kill the game very quickly otherwise.",1
"definitely my favorite third-person fantasy shooter. great customization options, brilliant graphics, and challenging gameplay. certain aspects of the game require you to have other people be in a party with you, so there is also a wealthy amount of multiplayer aspects in warframe that compliment all the single player action one can experience.",2
"third person shooter, rpg, 4-man instanced dungeon-style play, lots of loot and lots of customization. deffinately worth checking out for a free to play. warning- steep learning curve. read up on starter guides. (or get a friend to carry you for a bit)",8
"although replayability does lack much later in the game, theres always weapons to be farmed and the devs are very reliable when it comes to getting some new content.",4
"purely awesome. 10/10 for being a free to play with this many features.",1
"brilliant i did not expect this to be this good i love this game im re downloading it because i did it for youtube then i decided to get rid i love it so much this will be in my top 10 of all time",1
"parkor + being able to buy items but also unlock them! + guns + customization = happy people!",1
"warframe is a free-to-play game about space ninjas. if you werent convinced already to play the game because of that previous statement, then it might not be for you. and if you were convinced, it may still not be for you! as it stands right now the shooting, movement, ability and customization mechanics are top-notch, but theres very little substance in this game. you play missions and get resources to buy new gear to use, but its purely a skinner box in its current state. you farm, and then you get better farming equipment. rinse and repeat. if you were to play this game for long periods of time, the repetitive nature of it all will sink in quick, but if you dont spend a lot of time playing its a blast to play for literally 5 to 20 minutes per sitting.",5
"repetitive and pointless, but awesome enough that you dont mind doing it a million times. great game to pick up at any time and easily join strangers or friends.",2
"im having a blast every time i play and it only gets better if you play in a full 4 man group i would say give it a try. and since its a free to play game you have nothing to lose except time... but come on lets face it.... that time would have been wasted on some other game you didnt like anyways.",3
"by far the best free-to-play shooter out there. great depth and customization. well worth the time investment.",1
"diablo instant gratification with the fun of weapon and equipment call of duty style. fast paced co-op vs. ai see how yours and your teamates skills interact to create devastating combinations.",2
"the good: intense action, solid co-op play, cool art & character designs, and an impressive arsenal of weapons. modding the frames and weapons can make each persons loadout truly unique. the developers also are very receptive to the players. the bad: repetitive at times, especially if you are grinding the rarer frames and mods. limited environments and mission types. poorly executed overarching story (if it even exists). overall: space ninjas! awesome!!!",3
"what can i say, its an awesome f2p game to play, you can work for everything if you so wish to or of course use microtrasactions to buy stuff if you want. some parts shows that you should play with friends though you dont have to. also hey you get to play as space ninjas which is always awesome :d so yeah this is a definant recommendation from me for this game as i feel other should play this game or atleast give it a shot to see if you like or not.",1
"like ninjas? like swords? like guns? like wallrunning? well then this game is for you! ninjas with guns and swords that can wallrun! fast gameplay with a pve instances. plus add the fact that most of the things avaiable in the cash shop can be obtained without spending a single dollar makes the game probably one of the best f2p games out! give it a try you wont regre it!",4
"*sigh* i have a love/hate relationship with this game. you know the term carry in the context of a multiplayer game? well, the graphic and audio teams carry this game. its a goregeous game, in both rendering and design. the space ninja aspect is unique, and the game truly succeeds at making the player feel like a badass. however, i hate to say this, but it feels like the game designers just dont understand game mechanics. every update is two steps forward, one step back. systems are implemented with serious balance problems and left uncorrected. difficulty is an ongoing mess, with 99% of the game being ridiculously easy, and %1 being impossible. new bugs are introduced all the time, and some very serious bugs have been around for several months, with no acknowledgement form the devs. that being said, i cant not reccomend this with a good concience. it has provided me too many hours of entertainment and deserves acknowledgement for it. play it casually, and it will treat you right. dig too deep, however, and the dev team will end up dissapointing you over and over again.",9
"i dont know why youre reading this, because if you are reading this, youre on my friends list; which means i know you, which means ive tried to get you to play this with me, but none of you s have. , cmon, it is free.",4
"this game is getting better you should try it its free,seriously.",3
"fantastic co-op shooter. you can play solo if you prefer and there is still a sense of challenge. rank up your warframe, weapons and minion bot and add mods to customise their damage and shields. clan dojos you can build up together with materials that drop in missions. the item store is purely for cosmetic or to rush getting weapons/warframes. everything in the shop can be acquired in-game.",2
"recommended. its really a great start for a f2p. plus it has so much fantasy to offer. the graphics are really that great. boss fights are really okay. role playing and third person shooting combined. the only thing lacking is the storyline and environment. gameplay, excellent for my opinion. go on, try it. see for yourself.",3
"great mmo with a mass effect feel to it. it may become repetitive, but im sure theres much more content to come over time. its always fun slicing up enemies with a sharp blade!",1
"this is a very good game. it does start you out slopw but once you start building weapons, clans and stuff youll be hooked. there are still bugs. alot of them. so be weary, but that wont stop me from playing. each warframe has 4 special powers and they all play diffrently for difrent play styles. wann stealth, loki is ur guy, brand new to the game, i recommend excaliber. he is mainly for beginners and is a ballenced charecter. they do ask for money and you may buy the things you need however what keeps the game from being pay to win is the foundry. everything and i mean everything that isnt cosmetic can be perchased as blueprints to where you go thru missions so you can get the resouces you need. if you want platnum and dont have money. go on missions and find a rare mod. people eat the up. highly recommend.",2
"dang, if i had to put this game into words, id say that it is unique, one of a kind, and very fun. i like how you can modify your weapon so i would be able to taze my enemy with a sword with electricity swarming around it. it is such a fun game! i dont know why it gets so much hate. probably because random people choose to be jerks and make the developers feel bad about a really good game, when the critic cant even play checkers correctly.",1
"so far this seems pretty rad. its also ftp/ptw, so theres that.",1
"absolutely fantastic gameplay. very much like the mass effect games (though a bit more action-focused). the crafting takes a fairly long time, but i highly recommend at least giving the game a try (its free to play, so you dont really lose anything)",6
"8 out of 10. warframe is a free to play online game that is best described as a third person shooter / dungeon crawler. it focuses on visual effects and graphics while maintaining one of the most fluid and versatile movement and character animation libraries in modern gaming. these two focuses allow for a beautiful and fast paced experience as you and your team clear ships and planetary installations in order to attune your characters, the tenno, to their warframes, ancient, yet technologically advanced powered exoskeletons. it should be noted that the game has an ample amount of micro transaction content, though this area is completely optional and the game can be played without the use of such market. though in return, it should be expected that items will at times be grinded for as transactions offer immediate rewards.",1
"a free to play game, with ninja like beings whom utilize almost telekinetic abilities? definitely a yes. this game is beautiful, and so fun to play.",1
"good community, good development team, they really listen to the community and great gameplay not p2w at all",3
"a lot of fun. also really like that you dont have to put money into the game to get the best gear. you only need to spend money to get the best gear faster",1
"great fun, very good community. awesome game to play with a couple of friends or even to make friends. and it only gets better with each update.",6
"very fun third person shooter, with ok sword play. also pretty good online community, from what ive seen so far.",1
"deffinitley an amazing game, love to play, and very original.",1
"if you like ninjas and fast hack and slash action, this is your game.",1
"awesome game! havent played it for long, but i quite like the concept. you fight trough the planets and moons of our solar system and fend off the grineer, corpus and infested. the only downside of this game is the grinding... you may have to fight a boss over and over again to get the right materials, or blueprints for just that warframe / weapon. but aside from that, fighting alongside other players in co-op, with various events thrown in here and there, i find this to be a really awesome game!",2
"after many requests, my review for warframe is finally here. disclaimer : bear in mind that warframe is still in beta so some problems might be solved... warframe is a f2p multi/co-op online game, if trhe word f2p made you scared fear not its not as bas as it looks , the limitation of the f2p is the slots aspect (as in additional warframes or guns which you can buy since every new account has a small amount of platinum which is the in game currency) other than that everyone has pretty much the same amount of abilitites meaning you dont have to buy anything. gameplay the game has many modes and many maps , 3 types of enemies, boss battles and all of those are procedural generated. the same map wont be played twice the same, in fact the mission objective might change mid game the rooms might feel similar but they are never in the same configuration. graphics look beautiful. storywise the isnt anything new : you good guy, everyone else enemies go kill. overall this game doesnt feel f2p its professionally made to be fun and has a long replay value since maps are never never the same. i suggest giving it a try and experience yourself being the unstoppable space ninja of the future. verdict: 9/10",3
"this is a surprisngly addictive free to play game. it has faced past action, meant to be played with 2-4 players. would reccomend this becuase this is all ive been playing the last couple of weeks! :d",1
"at first, im filled with doubt about this game since its in beta for such a long time.. but soon after i play it, this game is brilliant! nice graphics, game mechanics and combat system, fully compatible with my game style despite having so many bugs here and there. +frequent updates!",6
"great game, lots of replayability if you have a need to advance youll enjoy it! weapons get stronger based on how much you use them and so even the lowliest pistol can be stronger at first than an unused magnum! i enjoy the bosses and stealthy gameplay the most, able to sneak behind enemies and when friendlies come in i can cause disarray and confusion between the ai. all playstyles are supported, you want to be strong, heavy armored and hard to kill sure thing that you can!",1
"a great f2p game with loads to build and unlock. the major flaw is the lack of help starting off with so much to learn and the time it takes to get decent weapons to actually feel helpful in missions. but if you get past this with the help of forums and the wiki there is a gem of game with a crazy amount of content. regarding the f2p model, it is one of the few i have played that does not have an aggresive pay ceiling. you can aquire a nice amount of content before having to dip into your wallet. this is helped by de giving you currency free at the start that enables you to buy a few extra slots for weapons and frames. graphically it is amazing and hats of to de for the amount of updates in terms of fixes and new content. a special mention that the develop listerns to the community and the cool events they do that keeps the game fresh.",8
"this is one of the best ftp games ive ever used it is a third person shooter based on you being in a suit called a warframe. warframes are buildable suit that each have unique properties and abilitys, i really loved this game. key word would be loved, its an amazing game but its often just a repetitive farm, in the 10th update (when i stopped playing) they made a change to the slide and sprint machanics that i just hated, and from there it just went down. now i admit i dont mind and actually like farming and yes this game did make it fun and unique its still what made me give it up in the end. so i personally really do suggest the game i mean playing with my friends i got 250 hours out of it. so out of 100 id give it 94.",3
"this is a great free to play third person shooter. if you love 3rd person shooters then this a must try!",1
"warframe is quite simply the greatest experience i have ever had with a free to play game. the game is heavily loot based, and quite simply almost every item can be acquried without extremely tedious and repetitive gameplay. ( the only things that cannot be acquried through gameplay are mostly purely aesthetic, as well as limited time items that are no longer available to anyone ) warframe is an extremely fun game, better with friends, and a shining example of a free to play model that works excellently.",2
"great co-op fun and addicting even funner when you have friends playing with you",5
"space ninjas, fast paced action, swords and sick combat style. whats there not to love about this game?",1
"a solid third-person shooter with enjoyable gunplay and swordplay mechanics. warframes movement system is also fun and unique, allowing players to slide around surfaces, jump off walls, and easily maneuver around enemies. being co-op based, this game is not for everyone. it is, however, worth a try.",1
"warframe is a very underrated game. the graphics are excellent, the gameplay very actiony and fun, and the co-op makes the game 10x better. grab some friends and play!",1
"so far this game has been quite fun. especially, while playing with my cousin and a few close friends. the overall online teaming up when not playing with friends is quite simplistic. no real cons other than the outrageous pricing on the ingame currency for new warframes.",1
"an great game yet the loadout is very complicated (not reccomended for kids) lol",1
"not bad for the price. i mean considering most free-to-play games ive tried wont even run on my machine without game-breaking graphical glitches, its pretty good. i cant say that i really engaged with the dark-for-darks-sake backstory, and the combat isnt anything groundbreaking, but if you like the idea of slightly improved mass effect combat without the rpg, youre not wasting your time with this one.",1
"great runngun, 3rd person ninja in space action game. like any mmo style game, it does get repetitive, but constant content updates and fixes make the game worth playing. ive clocked nearly 500 hours on this game since i started, and opened up my pocketbook for founders packages and other goodies--and it has all been worth it. nearly every item available for purchase with real money is also available for acquisition within the game itself, making it a truly rare mmo style game.",4
"dont let the metascore throw you, this game has come extremely far since those old reviews and if you like the good old grind games then this is the game for you. start it up, find a solid, fun, friendly clan to join and run missions and make friends, your arsenal will grow quick and render pay to win unnecessary. update 11(damage 2.0) while was a major jump that ruffled a lot of players(including myself) has turned out to be the best thing to happen to warframe so far and wont be the last. basically this is: ninjas in space, let that sink in because those 3 words trump all.",7
"pretty nice for a free 2 play. i see that the developers are full of ideas and can make this game even better than it is right now. (its in the open beta though).",1
"this game is fun and very action packed but lacks variety, most levels have you running around slicing bad guys and occasionaly a slightly stronger foe (a boss). i would say that this games strongest point is the co-op, you can have great fun with a couple or even one friend. the combat system is satisfying and bloody but can get a bit repetitive (shoot him, slice him, shoot him, slice him). there are plenty of collectables in this game but it is largely pay to win. however it is free to play and gave me plenty of enjoyable hours. overall i would give this game a 7/10",1
"among the best f2p games out there. gorgeous graphics and entertaining gameplay. the cliche easy to learn, but tough to master definitely applies here; you can get the basic gameplay mechanics down pretty quickly, but theres a lot of tricks and details that take some finagling to figure out and get right. using the microtransactions definitely can help you out, but in this game its generally less of a power boost and more of a method for faster advancement.",1
"i highly recomend this game, its great if you enjoy third person shooters. it has amazing graphics and eventhough it is grindy its one of the only games i acctually enjoy myself in while grinding for levels. i can spend hours on end with this game and my friends can go weeks without seeing me, so prepare to kiss your social life goodbye if you become as addicted as me. if you havent given this game a try then you should it has a bit of a learning curve because of the dynamic combat system but eventually you can get it. the missions can get slightly repedative at times but since they can change at any moment with new objectives and the preceduraly (sorry idk how to spell today) generated maps can spice things up and keep you entertained. 10/10 p.s. when on the log in screen type in flappy in the email/username spot and hit enter (no password) a flappybird minigame featuring the zephyr warframe will appear (if they havent removed it yet)",6
"one of the best free to play games ever concieved, countless hours of grinding with wonderous graphics and a great free style combat system 10/10 recommended",1
"as a frequent player of this game on ps4, i can say this game is nothing short of brilliant. you play as a warframe, part of the group called the tenno, who have dedicated their lives to bringing sanctity to the solar system. fighting against the terrors of the grineer, corpus, and the infested denizens. some people might think ughh this game is awful it has micro-transaticions!-stupid consumer but they are wrong. this game does have microtransactions. however, whith enough dedication and love, anything that is microtransactionable, you can earn in game. you heard me right. so everything can be free. not that im saying you shouldnt use the micros. they are a handy way of paying the developers for this wonderful peice of work they have created. the games mechanics of shooting, using powers, melee, and parkour to traverse surfaces are incredible. it keeps the game fresh and replayable with all the content included including a working clan system with a dojo you can build from the ground up for you and your clan mates to make together. so to rieterate, warframe is a great game that you should definantly play.",1
"conceptually, its neat. but ive played mmos long enough to tell you that youre gonna get pretty bored just shooting at nameless, faceless npcs all the time.",1
"this games pretty good if you just want to run around and shoot some mans. the free to play model isnt bad and you can totally get by without spending money for quite a while -- eventually youll probably want to buy extra inventory slots, but if you get to that point youll be like 50 hours in and you should probably give em a tip anyway.",2
"pretty cool game. you play as a futuristic ninja kinda race. although i cant use any jutsus, so that let me down. overall great good average awesome game. i recommend it to those looking to experience what it would be like to be a futuristic ninja kinda guy.",1
"melee,space,mutants,parkour,double pistols!!!!!! what elese did you want to concider its awsomeness????!!!",1
"looks great, lots to do, is incredibly fun, and its free. theres no reason you shouldnt try this game out",1
"great game. but extremely gory for a t. yo ucan chop torsos and limbs off.",1
"fast paced missions that anyone can easily drop into, and a ton of things to earn to make your warframes more powerful and unique. all of the sweet ninja moves make it very fun to play. as always, playing with randoms will risk you getting people that just sprint through every level, which is silly because youll miss lotsa loot that way.",3
"one of the best games i have played in ages, i love it.",1
"this is fun to play especially if you just want to spend a few minutes blowing up bots.",4
"addicted to this game. i cant believe its still a beta release. it is absolutely amazing. game play and visuals are best ive seen. lore and sets are out of a movie.",4
"this game is a lot of fun, even if none of your friends play it. the way the enimies scale depending on the # of players on the level is also verry blanced.",1
"third person space ninja action! excalibur frame is probably the best starter, just dont pick loki!",5
"warframe can be described in one way, the baby of dead space and mass effect. it is a corridor shooter and shares the same aspects of both dead space and mass effect. the lore for warframe is very straightforward and generic. you are a descendent of a famous group of mercenaries known as warframes. you are in a never-ending battle between the warframes and the tenno. as for gameplay, not much to say other than it is what you would expect from a 3rd person shooter. the graphics are execellent and make for some very smooth and rewarding gameplay. however i do have to say that since the graphics use a new engine, you might need to scale down the visuals a bit. not a bad game, and its free!",1
"a perfect cross between the swordplay of a lord of the rings game and gunplay comperable to halo. if your rig can handle it, that is. it is definetly buggy, and is still in beta, but it is an amazing experience.",1
"for a free game, this is one you should definitely play! cant stop playing it!",2
"beautiful game it has great 3d graphics and is enjoyable to play with friends.",1
"3rd person shooter. with some solid melee combat and also parkour to boot. pretty fun a bit difficult to progress solo though.",1
"a mass effect-ish third person shooter about space ninjas. outstanding effects, locations, and intense action.",1
"fantastic, wickedly awsome game. i respect this game more than most because as a beta it has delivered more cooperative online play than any game i have ever experienced. the challenge is kept fresh, the warframes are consistently revamped with additional available cosmetic upgrades, not to mention bountiful perk-reminisent mods, and new weapons are released nearly weekly or so. going on four days worth of play time, and i see no viable reason to stop. great game to od on with friends. bravo warframe.",2
"very fun free to play game probably the most time of spent in a f2p. i mean you are a space ninja how does that not sound like fun?",2
"a fun games you can play together with friends or alone. its free and not pay-to-win. you can collect frames and weapons part by playing, while the blueprint can be bought in the market using credits and then you can craft it in the foundry, buying them with real-money is optional.",2
"its good. maybe better sword fighting, better physics.",1
"a fast paced third-person shooter with many possibilities; character customization, clans, lots of bosses to fight, and more, this game is totally worth it to be downloaded",2
"this is best coop. and 2rd pers. shooter, ninja style game i ever seen. i give it a 8.5/10 because there is some lag that are not fixed.",1
"well made, fun 3rd person shooter with cool wall jump stuff... i dont know how to use it but it looks cool. :) it does become a grind because they want you to pay for the items with microtransactions (since this game is f2p). however, this game isnt pay to win. i have not encountered anywhere where i have absolutely had to pay, and the game is good fun. download it if you can, and it has co-op so you can play with your friends. (i believe it was intented to mainly be played co-op)",1
"i do recommend this game, if you have a strong pc yet internet, massive lagging can occur anytime you play cause this game is really good yet big.",1
"this game is strange. its like nothing else ive ever played before: its too easy, unrewarding, the player-hosted servers are a hit -and-miss and the systems (trading, chat etc.) lack polish.... and i cant stop playing it. something just keeps pulling me back in. considering this game is free and the devs are a really nice bunch (the in-game hotfix notices keep on cracking me up. kudos for that) who seem to care for their playerbase, i really advise on trying this game. if you like third person shooters, give this a spin - its a pretty good game :)",4
"somewhat like mass effect 1,2,abnd 3 more fast paced its good!!!",1
"get this game it is soo much fun i think you guys would like it!",1
"this is a game i enjoyed back on my brothers ps4(back when there was just this and resogun), but to the combined efforts of my houses console restrictions, my brother playing it constantly and infamous second sun, i havent played it for a while. its about time i install the pc version.if you like hack n slashes and third-person shooters, warframe is a mission-based combination of both. it doesnt take long for warframe to leave an impression on you. everyone except the evil emperor zurg is invading the planets of the solar system, and you go in with others to fight off, defend, eliminate, protect against, capture, survive against, or rescue people from the enemy. the combat has some variety with the melee combat and is both simple and satisfying. the craftable weapons, customization, various abilities for the expanding amount of classes in the form of warframes(ah, he said it, he said it), daily rewards and creative boss battles make this an awesome f2p that youll keep returning to. im sure its keep patching and updating to infinity and beyond!",1
"all around solid game. i gotta say i am a fan of digital extreme work. the story and setting are pretty cool, and the levels are designed pretty well and look great. the issues however are still being worked out but i find damning: 1) there should be more stages, many maps are repeated in the early game thus far. 2) it being a purely mulitplayer game means you have to work with other people to get some missions done. 3) many weapons are simply sidegrades which is good. though some weapons are simply overpowered as ammo drops are plentiful. 4) pay-to-win. what i mean by that is one can simply buy weapons and gear to get ahead. new suits are $5 to $20 and weapons are about $12. though you can find blueprints or use aquired currency to craft weapons yourself. 5) balancing issues! it is to be expected that the higher level suits would be better, but as i stated above anyone can buy a top tier suit and top teir gun and blow through other players in missions. 6) if you like pvp and want to get into it early on there is very little of it. 7) difficulty curve is like a bell curve. from the first three zones its as follows easy - prepare to die if you didnt grind - easy.",2
"amazing game. this game is brilliant but will only apeal to you if you enjoy the grindy style of game similar to diablo. there is lots of repition to be come stronger and farm certain items. if you enjoy all these elements then this game is for you.",2
"i really like this game but i always must play alone because nobody ever joins me!!!",1
"the first free to play game iv played, that feels like any payed for game. as long as you like(or dont mind) to grind levels you can upgrade, buy and build tons of cool stuff, without paying real cash.",2
"ever want to run through alien ships leaping from wall to wall while shooting people in the face? welcome to warframe. the idea of being a space ninja taking down enemy factions in a dystopian future may seem silly at first but in practice its a crazy amount of fun. with a collector style upgrade system and plenty of weapons available warframe has a lot to offer.oh and did i mention its free?",2
"fun and free, what more could you want? there is too much running when playing with others but that seems to be the price for farming some levels.",1
"the gameplay, especially the way it makes you feel awesome, makes me start playing. the crafting system in this game is what keeps me playing for hours. its fun to collect resources, craft items and then level up those items; almost as much fun as hacking through hordes of monsters.",4
"this game is awesome really fast paced and alot of action love it!",1
"a beautiful game with goregous grpahics, co-op is great",4
"this game of amazing humaniods is a fun and adventurous exploration that takes place through the solar system. warframe allows the player to choose places to go and gives them objectives to complete at these locations. leveling up your weapons or your tenno will keep you in the game. you can likely find yourself spending hours upon hours exploring the great and wonderous world of warframe.",2
"great blend of sword and gun play, coupled with parkouring free-movement elements. definitely recommended.",1
"best free to play out there , from amazing graphics to insane combat system you will never have a dull moment when your in a warframe",3
"pretty good, even with the glitches. the game itself is pretty badass in my opinion especially when you give it some time and money to really get into it. 8.8/10 :)",6
"great shooter, one of the best f2p games on steam, would hapilly pay for it.",1
"warframe is a game where you play as a space ninja in space doing ninja stuff while looking badass but with smooth gameplay and amazing style, the game doesnt lack beauty and the replayability is incredible with the amount of missions side missions void missions is just insane. i cannot give more reason just to pick it up and try it, there are so many ways you can play the game, if you need to play tanky or do a supportive role or even just be stealthy, you can without all the complicated requirements most games require although the game sometimes seems like a grind in most cases its very rewarding and worth it. i havent played as many hours as most people but i have played a few to understand the beauty behind this. i feel the developers should give themselfs a pat on the back and keep working on this game to take it as far as they can. i see potentiol and if this isnt enough reason for you to get it, then you are just trying not to like it! i give this game a 7/10.",2
"perfect graphics & super action. very good customizable items.",3
"i have played this game for about 8 hours and i am on my way to start creating another warframe (oberon). but i highly recommend this game because its free, and is insanely fun if you like a parkour/3rd person shooter and play in co-op, then this is the game for you.",1
"good game for someone that likes sci-fi 3rd person shooters",1
"the game is really good. but is dark sector the prequell to this game?",4
"ever wanted to be space ninja?? if yes go and download this game asap!!!!",1
"i love this game, its amazing how much they base their game around the community. they host livestreams over on twitch every so often to have a run through on warframe or host dev streams so the devs over at de can listen and share their ideas with everyone and let people know whats going on with the game. pros: great graphics not that high system specs frequent updates/ bug fixes great fun nearly everything on the market you can build but obviously takes time an ingame currency called platinum which allows you to buy things ready made with everything instead of farming stuff. cons: items in the market are overpriced ( 10-15 for just 1 warframe!) a  ton of performance issues on the higher levels and new tilesets (but they do alot of updates and try their hardest to fix). becomes a grindfest in some cases and becomes repeated boringness. sometimes ai act like toddlers and run around not knowing what the  they are supposed to do. boring for low levels. but ive got to say its still in open beta and it is an extremely fun game and to see the game really show you whats its ment to be keep playing if your bored of the first few mission  gets alot better once youve got rid of your crappy starter gear for some pretty neat gear. a fun challenge and is meant to be played with friends.",4
"this is the most awsome ftp game i have ever played in my whole life! go play it!",1
"you can be a space ninja with a grenade launchers. definetley cool",2
"warframe is a brilliant third-person combat game, and is ideal for those who like a twist from the average run and shoot type of title. it features smooth and clean parkour (free-running), brilliant runtime, and a bounty of playable characters, weapons and abilities. the game can be played alone, or online, and i 110% recommend it!",1
"by far the best tps ive played in a while. if not, the most. we need more games like this. it is a creative idea ninja in space most would think that wouldnt work but they managed to pull that off pretty well! i am somewhat addicted to the game and the idea. it is well done, combat is interesting switching between guns and melee. upradable weapons with modifications to make. but fair warning: soloing is tough, get some friends to play with you! i happen to solo it (forever alone) ... the first level i died 60+ times before i got through it. but its totally worth it. now to get my girlfriend to play it, that may take even more tries. but that may prove even more worth it in the end.",3
"a good third-person shooting game i have never feel bored when i play this game yes, there are few downsides (samee environment, few kinds of enemy) but it is a good co-op game to play with fds and collect stuff besides, it is a free game highly recommend",8
"sooooo goooooooood i wish all gamers download it i recomended to you",1
"nice and well made game, packed with fun. recommended to all :d",1
"warframe is pretty fun once you get the controls down.. and the game gets even better when you are playing with friends.",3
"review of warframe by: brogames of youtube this is brogames review about the game the game is good because there is a lot of missions and a lot of fun in warframe you can rank up and you can play with your friends online you can get skins for your character in the game . mods the mods on the game are for you to better skills in fighting like you can go invisible and you can use your sword power to kill everybody in sight. guns there are guns for you to rank up with your mods all you can get better guns with your money to get in the game by completing missions our completing ai missions to get more guns you need to buy the blueprints for your gun you want or if you can not get the blueprint you may need to rank up your level. once you got your gun blueprints you need to go to the planets to farm the materials to get the to build the gun you want. to get blueprints and more to get blueprints you need to go to the boss missions on certain planets like earth you need to play that boss missions over and over again until you get the blueprints for your character skins. once you got the blueprint you need to form off planets to get the materials for your blue print character skins.",1
"honestly it gets repetative and can be pay to win but for a free to play game it is great. if you dont mind the levels being the same, grinding, or any of this you will love this game. the graphics are good, and gamplay is nice. the game also is very fun when playing with people you know. id recomend at least giving it a shot if you have not already.",1
"this game is great, the graphics are really fun and the plot is great. it being free is just another reason to get it",1
"incredibly fast paced, action packed fun. if you are looking to blow off some steam, look no further. with a vast variety of ways to play, customizations, weapons and classes (also known as warframes) you can step it up and go all out. but if you hate the grind then it is not recommended you play it. but most games have grinding right? i still recommend this game highly, with hours of fun to be had, i say give it a try. 9.5/10",3
"easily one of the most satisfying, if not the most satisfying game. consists of a great combat system with the freedom to choose over various sorts of weapons that can determine the outcome of every mission, and also has that addictive parkour to traverse the maps in any way you like.",4
"fast-paced action, well designed characters and enemies and beautiful graphics, all for the steep price of free!",1
"a wonderful game in both design and gameplay. playing by your self can be infruriating due to the fact that lives must be purchased with platinum (buyable currency, but slight amounts can be earned through gameplay). if you have no lives and you die on a mission, you fail the mission, end of. this is why i recommend always playing with friends, as not only can they revive you free of charge (unless the friends you have are cruel sadists) but playing with friends is much easier and more fun. overall, a great 3rd person mmo, if a little stingy with unlocks and in game marketing. 8/10",1
"disregard the metacritic ratings because the reviews were done during alpha or early beta. mostly because people are stupid and cannot read. massive improvements since then. id rate it 8/10 now, but if they keep the quality of the patches up it will ne 10/10 soon.",3
"it alright i guess if you have a ps4 but the oceania servers are slow as hell cant even connect to a game..........ever!!",1
"only played this for a short while so far, but im really loving it. nice atmosphere, pretty solid gameplay mechanics. i highly recommend this to everyone since it doesnt cost anything.",1
"great game and awesome graphics, recommend it to anyone who ever played halo but wanted something better.",1
"this game, just, wow, one of my favorite games, the weapons, especially the sword is just so satisfying to use, 9.5out of ten deffinetly download this game.",1
"this is a very great game. excellent graphics and qualitiy. you do need to have patience in this game although that sort of makes it. you build new armor, swords, etc. but that makes people want more.",2
"im pretty impressed with the gameplay. this game third person shooting also combined with hack & slash for melee weapon. indeed a good game with high graphic & effect but low spec needed. i love this game for the theme space ninja it simply amazing, also free player can beat cash in here since all item is buy-able with credit in game. cash only for slot & something more like accesories so this game indeed well balance. you can be patient & wait the forge done when times come or use cash to buy the item. both item forged & buy via cash is same & no diffrent at all. dont believe other score i rate this 8,5/10",7
"the visuals are quite unique, a breath of fresh air in a stagnant genre. i would not mind reading books on this setting or dare i say a movie. the gameplay is fun, and again quite unique. this is worth keeping an eye on.",1
"great if you play with friends or a clan you can find!",1
"great game, very fun! try it, theres no reason not to, its free!",1
"amazing third person action rpg game that lacks a diversity in enemies and can get repititive at times",1
"this game is like haloish but has level u need play lot its fun buy guns with ip or rp like league",1
"greatly recommend, as a co-op only game, its beats a lot of paid games out there by miles, great graphics, really good gameplay and very enjoyable!",1
"i just started playing and it is pretty cool. the characters and environments are super pretty and the game play is very fluid. the game feels like it would work really well on a console. (ps4) or in steam big picture mode. the plus side and down side is that it is free to play. you get to enjoy a good game for nothing but if you want anything more than bare bones content you need to buy it and the content prices are a bit high. just look at the dlc prices... geez. (dec 2013) i think if i can get into this game i would be happy to throw some bucks their way to support it. i guess i am a potential investor like all new players.",1
"very fun game i love the swords in the game but the leveling your rank up is kind of hard and anoying but challenging",1
"this game is fantastic! it has some of the most incredible gameplay from a free-to-play game ive ever seen! i would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!",1
"this game is the absolute most amazing multiplayer game i have even seen",7
"awesome game...anyone who doesnt have this, i recommend you get it",2
"space alien cyborg ninjas vs. clones, mutants and robots. pretty good for a f2p",8
"if you hate pay to win games you may not like this game at all, however, everything you can buy with real money (except vanity items and boosters) can be earned through grinding (though the grinding is pretty intensive), so if youre willing to put in the time, you may never have to spend a dime. however, i would recommend putting money in simply because this game is still in beta but plays like a released game, minus a handful of bugs. the gameplay itself very addictive and fun, especially if you like to play with others in a shooter-run-and-jump-melee-fight style. the videos here on the steam market just dont do the game any justice at all. but dont take my word for it, the game is 100% free to download with zero commitment so download the game and give a go some afternoon and judge for your self. heres a tip: if you do decide to try it, while the game is downloading, visit the warframe wiki. the game is still in beta and tells you very little on what to do outside of the basic controls so theres a pretty steep learning curve, but the wiki is chock full of info on every aspect of the game, this will give you a bit of direction and a heads up on whats happening and what you should be doing to start earning goodies.",1
"this game is ninjas in space what the hell more do you want",3
"warframe is a free to play third person shooter, combineing assassinations and epic firepower, creating one epic ninja.",1
"a 3rd person shooter with melee elements, i highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good shooter/arpg hybrid.",2
"one of the best free-to-play game ive played so far",6
"a good game, with very fluent gameplay, and mutliple classes to suit any player. constant updates and support help to keep the game running smooth, with a very nice and helpful community. 8.5/10",1
"the most fun i have with this game is the very natural feel in which different movements come together smoothly to create crazy actions, like flying kicks and diving through doors all guns blazing. the combat feels very fluid and nice, a game system i would definitely love to see made into a longer game on the scale of a mass effect. as it stands, it is a great game to hop on with friends every now and then to slice, stab, shoot, and kick your way through hoards of enemies. the one down side is the fairly obvious lack of content. you can claim to have as many missions as you want, but that doesnt mean a whole lot when each one is just a copy paste of the last.",1
"its hard to believe how a free to play game could have held my attention for 500+ hours and still be entertaining. the community is great, the developers are friendly and like to stay in touch with their players and its just a in great game! i strongly suggest playing.",6
"this is seriously the most fun ive had in a game for a long time. flipping, wall running, guns, swords, sweet powers... you really want to play this game. modding your suit and weapons to new levels of destructive abilities, speed, and awesomeness is fantastic. i cant recommend this game enough.",8
"come an play warframe its easy an its a free game.its an online game or you can set it to go solo instead.overall i like it.",1
"this is a top noch game, made for gamers , made by gamers. so much in this, so much thought and expression is in this. i went into the game disappointed that there wasnt pvp but, after 10 minutes i forgot about pvp and was hooked on how well the co op works , brilliant game, just bloody brilliant. i love it.",2
"awesome game with the exception for newer players very diffficult to play solo. and if you go online to play eventually get the boot. should have difficulty setting for not so great players who dont always have the time to play but would like to progress and upgrade their warframes. i am a casual gamer but still like playing but game a bit difficult sometimes frustrating",1
"cyber alien ninjas. too bad none of them learned how to breakdance.",1
"this game is amazing. for a sec i thought it was some 3dmark thing.",1
"very well desinged game , nvidia users will enojy this game due to nvidia extra effects !!!!!",1
"couldnt even create an account, went through the sign up with my email address and nothing really seemed to happen. pretty terrible when it comes to a first impression. couldnt even comment on gameplay as the log in system seems to be either bugged to hell or just plain useless. either way, if the gameplay is as bad as my first impression is, i would avoid this game.",1
"ninjas versus pirates, robots, and zombies in space? and the gameplay is fantastic? and its free? this is a must play for just about anyone.",1
"cewl gaem i like it and ppl should be cewl aboot this",1
"great way to pass the time does get a bit repetative tho",1
"fast paced action, incredibly fun when running in a group. this game is made to be played with co-op buddies, soloing is possible but tough. crafting takes a while, but the results are worthwhile. i highly recommend if youre a fan of third person run and gun and hack and slash.",2
"well, its a good game where you can train you reflexes, abilitys and have fun with friends!!! and so on",2
"if you like aliens with ing katanas then get this game !!!!",1
"if you like cyborg ninjas and , this is the game for you.",1
"yes its great rewarding and probably my favorite f2p game",4
"this game is... amazing its unique and overall fun as hell only complaint i have is build times are crazy long x.x",2
"awsome game that taught me how to be a epic ninja and kill random people for there recources and credits so i can craft new ninja gear and buy stuff on the market... no longer will i be threatend as i will be the the one that mugs people",7
"this game is good, and the melee system is amazing.",1
"really enjoyed playing this game ... probably the best 3rd person , online ninja pve game out there , its free to play !! so try it out and rate it yourselves :)",5
"if you like mass effect 3 multiplayer, this is a definite download for you. its a third person shooter, with enhanced speed and chaos. you can be a ninja and run around cutting people in half or stealthy and snipe people from a distance. you even got customization up the wazoo and mods which make the weapons you use even better.its free too! the only reason you shouldnt download is if you dont have enough space on your hard drive, thats it.",2
"best agme ever still crahses but when it comes too the game its pretty aswome",10
"it takes a while to download the game :( get this game!",1
"this is the best game if you want to spend the hours of your life grinding for things that arent worth a nickle in real life and find bugs and see they will never get fixed best game ever 9/11 would play again",5
"love it 99% because make blueprints for warframe parts (chssis,head,ect.) to be buyable in the market!",3
"pretty freakin awesome with friends and if ya do it right!",7
"the answer to a question nobody asked, but apparently should have: what do you get when you combine dark sector with phantasy star online? answer: a fantastic online co-op game wioth loads of depth! you really dont have to pay anything to have plenty of fun (but buying a few goodies is even better), and playing online cooperatively is a blast. the graphics and sound are none too shabby, either, and it supports a controller in-mission. my personal favorite game on steam.",1
"its an awsome game you should play its really cool and add me",1
"possibly the best free-to-play shooter out there. the graphics look great and yet the game runs surprisingly well on less powerful machines. the gameplay is also great. it runs entirely on the rule of cool and has lots of stylish attacks and abilities. space ninjas - its as awesome as it sounds.",6
"if you like unique, shooting stuff, and playing with friends, this is your game!",1
"possibly one of the best free to play games ever! fun to play with friends. i highly giving this a shot.",1
"probably the coolest sci-fi game out here on steam. 9/10 and its free!",2
"highly addictive 3rd person hacknslash shooter, and you are a space ninja!",2
"dont get me wrong when i say at at least one point in our life, we all wanted to be a ninja or a pirate. warframe combines both of these fantasies as you blaze across the solar system as a robotic ninja-assassin space pirate. can you name anything more awsome than that? although the levels get quite repetative when its either a space-station, a high-tech mine or the surface of a snow-covered planet the maps and rooms are so beautifully designed what more could you want? (aside from, yknow a tropical island) movement is amazing and flows beautifully, want to run along the wall over a bottomless pit, before running up another wall to introduce a clone-grown space marine to your katana? go for it, you crazy, crazy . its like a beautiful ballet of death and dismemberment. there are characters (warframes) for all skillsets and play styles from tanks, to nukers, from support to debuff, its all here, folks! if you enjoy the idea of combining swords, guns, honour and parkour warframe is definately the game for you!",2
"whats not to love with this title? space ninjas lots of guns and hell of a lot of fun with friends. i cant help but reccomend this game, the only thing it requires is patients as you are unlikely to get any new equpiment within the first day or so. you sould probably think about dropping some money on platinum (cash store credits) at some point its not needed but it sure makes things easyer!",2
"this game is just awesome,with high graphic quality and a non stop online co op gaming for non stop hours,its just amazing.",9
"amazing game would recomend this to anyone looking for a decent game",1
"probably one of the best games ive ever played, awesome community - but to be successful in this game an awful amount of commitment and grinding must be put into it, although the rewards give a feeling of great satisfaction. for a game thats in beta, it is incredible and is definitely worth a play. love it.",7
"this game is on another level of its own, yes its challenging but yet its fun as all hell",5
"nice game entertaining but less free slot for warframe",5
"best free to play game available to date they just got it right period",3
"fun shooter plus hack/slash!!!! amazing graphics for a free-to-play!",1
"the best game that free in steam and in all the world!",1
"this game is very cool. i love it. it is beta, so it has some small bugs, but they are not that bad. the normal player and buyer are balanced. the making of weapons andd stuff it balanced too, de got it very good. this is my favourite game.",7
"i would pay for this game, its amazing, its complete, the gameplay is smooth and responsive, many options for those who want to experience full hd gameplay, matchmaking takes only a few moments and the co-op its just awesome. the only issue is that you need a lot of credits to buy guns :/",1
"definitely the best free to play out there. sure to vaccuum hundreds of hours out of your life!",5
"steep learning curve. sometime hard to figure out what to do (thank goodness for the wiki page). after you get going, then there are a million things to do or build or look for.",7
"it has simillar things with metal gear solid, that is, stealth...i like it",1
"this game is cool i very like and the skin is cool too",1
"great game, alot of slicing people open, great 3rd person game :)",1
"a good 3rd-person shooter game. you can play solo or online. much better experience with friends and/or people. :d",1
"one of my favorite games, very eager to see what plays out in the future regarding cross-platforming",3
"really, really amazing game! i have almost 500h of gameplay. this game is a blend of mass effect 3 multiplayer with the grinding system of diablo, borderlands, etc...",6
"honestly, a pretty fun game. graphics are amazing, its got a great feel to it too. it can be a bit grindy at times, but with reliable friends/teammates, then that grinding sensation is pretty negligible. id recommend this game to anyone looking for a 3rd person action game. 4/5 :d",4
"if you like being a space ninja. then this is the game for you",5
"its a nice action game to play and to have fun. good sound and graphics and the theme is unique in its kind.",1
"good game,most of its content are getable without real world cash,great graphics,best f2p i have currently seen.",5
"i really love the game and its graphics!! i had so much fun with this game, its basically my new favourite game! :d:d",3
"excellent game but it is still in progress so you may find some bugs.",9
"great game, not just a game that gets you going but keeps you going. one of the best coop games ive ever played.",2
"mirrors edge, meets a 3rd person action shooter, with melee, set in a sci fi universe, where everyone is a ing ninja space killer. so good.",1
"tis is a great game and i love it. i recomend to just about anyone who like te cod serise but is also fine with out first person veiw. there is but one drwabck that i have found and its the fact that this game can get a little repetitive. i wouldnt play it 24/7 if you dont wana get boread. besisdes that this is one of my top faveorite games.",1
"dude. this game is tons of fun to play (especially with friends), looks great, and is free! why wouldnt you get this?",2
"great game with a good community. de does a pretty good job of updating on a regular basis and while not all of the changes are implemented smoothly they do continue to work on them and tweak them as they receive feedback from players.",6
"the best third person shooter rpg out there, just absolutly amazing!",3
"warframe offers a large variety for a f2p game. it is a stunning 3rd person shooter due to its exquisite detail of both graphics, and ninja-like gameplay. it offers a whole new perspective to how games can be played, and because of its 3rd person fast paced playstyle it allows players to make diverse moments of there own. as updates pass its repition dwindles. if you want to be a space ninja, i highly recommend this game for you!",3
"i dont have many hours logged yet, but i can say a few things about this game. firstly, it is very fun and innovative[for its genre] second, the match making or squad finder or whatever you want to call it is nifty as hell, people can join whenever and usually at moments when you need them. third, despite all ive said it is almost 100% pay to play. its free, yes, but after a certain point you have to start putting money into it if you want to stop dying, or get new weapons or armor or abilities, but, if you either keep grinding and keep your head down or throw a few bucks into the game, it is one of the best games ive ever played. i hope too see you planetside!",1
"one word: epic!!!! i know alot of people say that its repetitive, and i am beginning to think it is, but its not..... i mean, different people, different maps, different gear, same enemy...not very similar, is it?? everything about this game is great, and it is definitely not p2w.... it is just.......wow!! the mechanics are great, beautiful visuals, awesome controls, and space ninjas xd and its f2p!? what more could you possibly want from a 3rd person co-op sci-fi shooter??",1
"awesome combat, good action.... steep price tag on all items. you cant buy anything with in game currency.",1
"this game is amazing...if you have freinds that is. this game is not for single player at all, but if you purchase a bunch of in-game money you could get away with it. but that what free-to-play games do... i think it is still totaly worth it! it is a blast to play with a friend or two and the combat is amazing. get it guys...its free..",1
"good game. word of advie though, start out with excalibur. he is a good warframe not matter how far into the game youre, good attacks mixed with good abilitys is just amazing. second choice would be ash, high attacks mixed with freaking awesome abilitys is no match. play and fight with honor.",2
"this game is hands down the best f2p third person shooter out there. the devs have done a lot to make this game as amazing as it is. i even think it should be $20 just for how awesome it is.",9
"pretty fun, but very grindy. the levels get repetitive pretty quick, but theyre constantly adding new areas. combat is pretty fluent, and playing with friends is pretty fun.",1
"ive been playing this game for a few months. if you know me, you also know that i invest time into games i enjoy, and ignore  that bores me. and you also know that i rarely recommend  to people unless i believe theyll enjoy it. this is one of those games i recommend.",2
"amazing, free to model is one i would love to see in the future. the gameplay is amazing, a bit of a learning curve, but once you get it down, its alot of fun even more so with friends, and a a dojo full of people.",3
"its basically space ninjas with weird technological powers! ...now lets be honest here, who doesnt want that?",3
"this is a really good game it is loads of fun to play with friends or just by yourself.",4
"i played this in the first stages of development, and i must say to my experience it changed for the worse. it still is a very fun game however, space ninjas and guns and all. i just really hate the trading card mod system, before it you could mod yourself and be like a god, insanely fast and almost impossible to kill.",3
"warframe is a excellent game it lagged a huge amount when i started but i changed a few settings and it worked fine. the controles where a bit odd for me but i am new to pc gaming so it will take time to get use to the them. i didnt get far in the game but i intend to spend many hours playing and i recommend this game too any one who enjoys ninjas, guns and swords.",1
"its good game for hardcore gamers, beautiful graphics and awesome gameplay!",1
"great game, although the pay for neat stuff is sort of in your face.",1
"a true free to play, may be grindy but the killing dont stop and the fun is unlimited. pick your weapon and your frame, ninjas play for free.",7
"warframe is so awesome! its my favorite game on the pc, other than 7 days to die. it has tons of fun weapons, enemies, and content, with more coming! get it if you have a brain and use it!",1
"awesome 3ps. if you like mass effect, this is the game for you.",1
"fun and inspirering but afterawile it gets old but its still fun",1
"awesome fast paste game ... but the items you have to find is headache :( 7.8 out of 10",7
"a great co-op game and a great looking one at that, while the game is very buggy its still worth the purches and its free.",1
"great game. it may be a little hard to get attached to at first, but once you do youll be addicted. its a fun fps with awesome game mechanics, but a lack of story makes it difficult to get hooked. its very much game first, story second, but its a great game nonetheless.",6
"very good game. u can get all by spamming a chat and sell stuff for plat (boring like hell) it have a  24h wait for lvl up mission that is.. . just that, . :)",4
"another recommendation that took me far too long to write, warframe. like ive said before, and ill say it again, you can never go wrong with free, especially not when its got the amount of polish that warframe has. space ninjas, put plain and simple; with fast-paced action, some little puzzles here and there, and relatively bug-free overall. crafting systems are quite rewarding, and a clan system thats actually beneficial in some way rather than the traditional nametag added to your username. threatening bosses, procedural levels, and randomized obectives oh my! warframe, is the , that is all ladies and gentlemen, good evening. 8.5/10",6
"best game multiplayer and solo game .... yes good game i louve it..",1
"surprisingly good, and not really a grindy f2p game, you can get basically everything in the game in a decent amount of time.",7
"really fun, fun to farm, but once you are done farming, got all weapons you want, it starts to get boring really fast.",1
"pros: incredibly fun. graphics are amazing. wide variety weapons and battle suits that you can choose from. interesting and well made parkour system that replaces classic stealth game dynamics. still in open beta so lots of potential despite it already being a top notch game. free to play. you can pay some money to speed up certain processes but this game is all about the grind. cons: lacks some endgame content. but by them continuously changing the game on a weekly basis i would definitely expect that to change. thats it in my opinion. just be open minded about it and realise that it is in open beta. meaning they will be fixing minor bugs every now and then.",6
"amazing game, very very good game!!!!! if you like star wars, guns & swords, aliens and alot of action, this game is perfect to you!!!!!!! i highly recommend this game to anyone like the thing upp here!!!!! and the best of it, its free@@ <3333 but you have to pay if your gonna buy things to the game (in-game) and so long... get it!, ure gonna lov it!",1
"this game is a grindfest, and they have a entire seperate tab for the story. so that means this is a combat focusd game it feels like dating: at first its all nice and pleasent sitting around and blowing people off, but after a while you just plainly get bored and you have to go on like fifty rollercosters in order to actually move to a haunted house. poorly made metaphore aside its fun at the start but you have to do it over and over in order to get the last piece for a slightly better version of the weapon you are using. if you dont play it to often i reccomend it, if you plan on playing it for more then 5 instances then dont play it.",3
"this shooter is amazing. i myself normally do not like tps (third person shooters) but this one is amazing as you fight endless amounts of creatures and follow a story line with co-op. the gameplay is everything because there story line really is just to do missions through out differnt regions of space. this game i would give the story line a 4 out of 10 and the gameplay i would give a 9.5 out of 10",1
"this game is one of the best third person shooters ive ever played! list of my favorite third-person games 1. warframe 2. the last of us 3. star wars battlefront series",1
"great game, thought it was gonna be cheesy since you know, your robot ninjas in space but its a great game with a very unique play style. id strongly recommend to play it multi-player with buddies through voice chat because its a hell of a lot funner that way",3
"do i recommend this game? of course i do steam what kind of silly question is that? no, seriously get this game its fun and really entertaining i cant stop playing it!!",10
"warframe is a pretty dynamic and fluid game, it reminds me a lot of mass efect multiplayer, which is real good, also katanas are badass.",1
"sick game all in all with little tidbits of dark sector in it.",2
"this game is great considering its free. i recommend it to anyone who likes fast-paced shooters/slashers, high mobility freedom, player-versus-enemy (ai), cooperative gameplay (there is no player-versus-player by the way), futurism, or ninjas. i wouldnt recommend it if you dont like games that are mostly about combat. the game is entirely combat, lightly seasoned with having to pay attention to mission objectives, a basic equipment crafting system, and a unique equipment customization system. that said, its good combat gameplay, since theres lots of room for customization, and lots of room for gaining parkour skill. also swords.",1
"a bit tedious in graphics and etc, but it looks great for its age, its free, its in beta, and its absolutely fun with friends.",1
"i decided to take a break from planetside 2 and try this game out. i gotta say im impressed. the game runs smooth with barely a hiccup, it feel great flipping and sliding around and there appears to be a lot of content in the game. the design is top notch, from every element in the ui, to the warframes, and to the ever-expanding levels. ive only played just a portion of the game and its shown quite a breadth of variety. visuals 9.5/10 ease of use 8/10 replayability 8/10 value 11/10... its free! (kinda)",3
"super fun and really easy to get into, definitely recommended if you like killing stuff. for a free game, it is updated frequently. only down side is it is really easy to find a laggy game so you have to set your ping limit quite low.",2
"think borderlands as a mmo with realiztic graphics. you pick a warframe (character) and level em up with missions. the weapons and skills (mods) level up as well as you use them. this game is pretty fun. been playing it for a few days now and im already lvl 12",2
"fun to play, and you dont need to buy items to be a good player",1
"warframe is yet another solid free to play shooter with a twist. well worth the download, not much else can be said without spoiling the games twists and turns.",1
"the game looks great. awesome, in fact. the particle effects and lighting are just amazing. gameplay wise, controls are smooth and the game is fun. it sucks at being interesting after a time. it is extremely repetitive and grindy and you need to pay to get the best experience. up to you to play or not.",3
"this game is one of the best cooperative shooters ive played, and it kind of reminds me of borderlands 2...if it were free, had ninjas, and made a baby with space games. 10/10 go play it!!!",1
"there is nothing wrong with an enjoyable free game. this game may be repetitive later on, but it still packs quite a fascinating moments when you can unleash your rage upon the ai. it is a very good game for killing time !",6
"the ability to upgrade and sidegrade weapons and frames is compelling, but the game gets repetitive and there is a lack of end-game content. still, those gripes didnt occur to me until i spent over 200 hours in-game.",3
"very cool and fun. what more could you want from a free to play game?",1
"pretty fun game but can get way to repeative. try it you got nothing to lose.",3
"this game is so much fun but it is so hard to get new suits and weapons you should get like 2 weapons for every finished board and a new suit for the next type of world",1
"this game is wonderfully made. i like the game because its fun, its easy to pick up on, easy to use, and you can make a clan, and take over!",3
"its taking my soul away. great game! getting more equip for your warframes has never been so rewarding. getting new characters maxing them out is pretty fun nor get boring. heads up! the first few levels will seem like a drag, but it does get better.",2
"very fun and so many things to discover but one things is the mission is too same",1
"really addictive game if your in too balanced grinding games. probably the best free to play game out on the market, with no doubt!",5
"this graphic on this game is great the co-op sectiion is really great you get to fight against monsters with friends.",1
"if this was a moba but with only the melee damn son but its still good and fun with friends (wich i dont have :| )",1
"the game is really cool! anyone with a lot of platnium can just be so op, and that is a good thing! you dont fight with others, rather just go through a stage with four of your friends or other people... the graphics is amazing and compared to blr, one of my favorite games, i got to say it is better! there are some flaws as in the sneaking mechanics, you are a ninja, you cant just assassinate or rather just pass through guards like a ninja? overall, i think this game derserves a good recommendation!",1
"its a pretty good game, its smooth, yet you can get lost easily, it has alot going for it in the player clan department like designing your own dojo is nice. ever sense i first started in update 3, so much has changed, its harder, and confusing. but easy to get the hang of, i reccomend using a controller to play this game. only flaw i truly see with this game is the fact it takes forever to build any of the gear in this game",1
"one of the best f2p games out there. easily get 400+ hours of entertainment.",8
"i can shoot my bow into a crowd of enemies and they all explode. 10/10 would do it again.",1
"6/10 certainly not the best game i have ever played. i played for a few hours and got bored. the missions tend to repeat themselves. it is a pay to win game. and the combat is somewhat confusing. i run in to battle with my rifle and i cant see anything beacause there are just fire and lightning bolts flying accross my screen. i cant level up beacause everyone killsteals. and if i play alone i am underlevel. so im forced to play for hours on the same mission just so i can level up a bit. there are a few mechanics and features in this game that i do find entertaining and fun. i love sci-fi games. but i just found this game a little off. im shure this comment will be outdated by the time anyone reads this. chances are they fixed the things im complaining about. this game has a bit of a learning curve and it doesent explain the lore very well. the game itself is quite the vicious cycle, and to get out of the cycle you need to pay money. real money. i know many games have shops (tf2) where you can buy cosmetics and weapons, but this game causes players just to become pay to wins. giving this game a try was a bit of a waste of time for me to be honest. apologies if i cause controversy.",1
"mlg space ninja parkour with absolutely no storyline and every mission is the same exact thing. 4/20",4
"this game is just amazing!!!! and its a great idea that its free. 10/10 for me.",2
"great fun, especially for e free to play. the combat isnt extremely great, but definitely solid, apart from a few bugs one and again, though remember, its still in beta! it has nice coop, though it really doesnt change or add anything from sp. definitely worth downloading!",1
"after many requests, my review for warframe is finally here. disclaimer : bear in mind that warframe is still in beta so some problems might be solved... warframe is a f2p multi/co-op online game, if trhe word f2p made you scared fear not its not as bas as it looks , the limitation of the f2p is the slots aspect (as in additional warframes or guns which you can buy since every new account has a small amount of platinum which is the in game currency) other than that everyone has pretty much the same amount of abilitites meaning you dont have to buy anything. gameplay the game has many modes and many maps , 3 types of enemies, boss battles and all of those are procedural generated. the same map wont be played twice the same, in fact the mission objective might change mid game the rooms might feel similar but they are never in the same configuration. graphics look beautiful. storywise the isnt anything new : you good guy, everyone else enemies go kill. overall this game doesnt feel f2p its professionally made to be fun and has a long replay value since maps are never never the same. i suggest giving it a try and experience yourself being the unstoppable space ninja of the future. verdict: 9/10",3
"this is a surprisngly addictive free to play game. it has faced past action, meant to be played with 2-4 players. would reccomend this becuase this is all ive been playing the last couple of weeks! :d",1
"at first, im filled with doubt about this game since its in beta for such a long time.. but soon after i play it, this game is brilliant! nice graphics, game mechanics and combat system, fully compatible with my game style despite having so many bugs here and there. +frequent updates!",6
"great game, lots of replayability if you have a need to advance youll enjoy it! weapons get stronger based on how much you use them and so even the lowliest pistol can be stronger at first than an unused magnum! i enjoy the bosses and stealthy gameplay the most, able to sneak behind enemies and when friendlies come in i can cause disarray and confusion between the ai. all playstyles are supported, you want to be strong, heavy armored and hard to kill sure thing that you can!",1
"great game all in all, its free and all weapons in game are obtainable without the use of real cash. i love this game, the game can get repetitive, but if you have a couple friends to tag along with you on missions, then farming for new items is a blast. theres always something to farm for, either a new gun, and new melee weapon or a new warframe. this game will keep you busy for a long time.",4
"good co-op game but as single campain its little bit boring 6,5/10",1
"its free. no wait let me explain. everything including cash based items are obtainable in the game. even their cash based currency, platinum, is tradeable via in game items. and no its not hard to get. put in maybe an hours worth of work you made 50p. thats enough for a warframe slot and 4 weapon slots and still have some left over. truely a f2p game in its own right and worth every minute you place into the game. the community is amazing and the developers are better. definitely reccommended to those looking for a good shooter, or sci fi game in general.",1
"awesome game first time playing it and i love it i reccomend this game to anyone who loves sifis and all that amazing stuff good job on making the game",1
"this game has dynamic movement controls allowing for fast paced game play or fast silent gameplay. the characters are adaptable to different play styles of first person shooter with a side arm, or swordplay. the third person view keeps you locked into the sci-fi setting by allowing you to see your warframe kick . it has the option to play solo, exclusively with friends, or online with a public lobby for each mission. drop-in games are usually successful and team work is commonplace. overall this game is a refreshing change to your first person shooter sci-fi action games. the storyline is interesting, and although i wont go into to detail, there could be more interaction. this is not an rpg, this is a mission oriented team play third person shooter. weapons are able to be modded for better efficiency, though it would be nice to see those mods change the physical appearance. a downside i have found is the difficulty to gain special currency for new warframes, and new gear. fantastic game, addictive as well - my husband now plays the game with me after only watching me play.",1
"ive tried to play, but the game keeps freezing in the launcher... ive tried downloading it straight from the website, and it gave an error login failed. check your info. i tried making a new account, deleting the certificates and re-installing them, all the known fixes, but to no avail. i am downloading it now, off steam again, and hopefully it wont freeze at the launcher.",1
"its a free, parkouring, 3rd person shooter (also has katanas). nough said!",1
"this game is a lot of fun. you get to go around to different planets as a robot(cyborg?) ninja and ninja many enemies to death. it is free to play, so no risk for you to give it a try. they did something very peculiar with the cash shop however. the punishment for earning new robot suits in the game versus buying them with real-world money is death. bear with me as i explain. there are two methods to get new robot suits(the standard issue ones anyways). 1) someone pays real-world cash for them. you or someone you traded your items too for platnium(the cash shop currency) laid down some money so you can get that shiney new warframe(robot suit). 2) you farmed the pieces in the game itself and then crafted the warframe. so you invested your time and the game makers did not get paid. at this point, everything is still on the up and up. however, what i didnt mention is this: if you employ method 2, you will most likely recieve a stalkers mark and the game will send a super-powerful npc to invade your game and kill you, which removes the mark. in summary... if you played the game to get new suits instead of just buying them with real money, expect to be punished by being ganked by the games cash shop enforcer. p.s. i still recommend playing this.",5
"its a fun team based game like left 4 dead but wit rpg eliments. its a third person shooter with parkor.",5
"warframe has a wonderful dev team that constantly updates on progress for the fans. also its totaly free 2 play.",8
"ive got to say, this game is pretty cool. all of the enviornments look realistic when on high settings (thank goodness i can play on high without lag) and the action keeps you pretty occupied, i just wish that some things arent as expensive and if miost weapon packs or blueprints could be bought with earned money not the one you buy. in my mind (except for the money system) this game get a 4.8 star rating. the other 0.2 doesent get updated until the money system is better! :d thanks.",1
"i wouldnt recommend this to my greatest enemy. even they dont deserve to suffer de. other than that, bretty gud gameplay but stupid rates.",6
"great game, i love the co-op gameplay, very fun indeed.",1
"beta got boring really quick.... its been in beta for quite a while now and well, i dont know if it has gotten better or worse. all i know is its very based on alot of grinding on these boring missions, that like i said, get boring very quickly.",1
"its fun, but very much pay to win or really even to have fun. fast paced, challenging, and repetative but over all fun. for being ftp its not bad, but if you want any new/good gear you have to work your  off or pay money.",1
"pretty nice for a free 2 play. i see that the developers are full of ideas and can make this game even better than it is right now. (its in the open beta though).",1
"this game is fun and very action packed but lacks variety, most levels have you running around slicing bad guys and occasionaly a slightly stronger foe (a boss). i would say that this games strongest point is the co-op, you can have great fun with a couple or even one friend. the combat system is satisfying and bloody but can get a bit repetitive (shoot him, slice him, shoot him, slice him). there are plenty of collectables in this game but it is largely pay to win. however it is free to play and gave me plenty of enjoyable hours. overall i would give this game a 7/10",1
"among the best f2p games out there. gorgeous graphics and entertaining gameplay. the cliche easy to learn, but tough to master definitely applies here; you can get the basic gameplay mechanics down pretty quickly, but theres a lot of tricks and details that take some finagling to figure out and get right. using the microtransactions definitely can help you out, but in this game its generally less of a power boost and more of a method for faster advancement.",1
"awesome f2p-game! definetly worth the time to check it out!",5
"a very fun and rather addicting game. i enjoy grinding levels and materials to make better weapons and gear, so this is my kind of time-eater. great looking game with easy controls and a fast pace. things get pretty buggy when a patch is released, espeically because they tend to do big patches, but theyre really quick to address and fix things.",3
"this game was awesome and its graphics are amazing and the gameplay is cool too",1
"i reccommend this game but i have one problem, these updates take way to damn long",1
"space ninjas with guns + coop + fps + leveling stuff = additive good time.",6
"i downloaded this game after seeing people talk about it on videos of the destiny alpha. i dont normally care for f2p games but this one is awesome!!! im addicted.lol",1
"this game is really fun and no item is overpowered and i enjoy myself it takes patience to collect all the resources you need to collect for what you need",2
"the combat and movement of this game is amazingly complex, detailed & fun. however, i dont recommend coming into this game without watching some begginer youtube videos, the tutorial system is no where near informant enough to explain this game. great game, 8/10",1
"its free you fools! its kinda pay-to-win, but your weapons do get more op as you use them. it has hours of content, and after that, more content. enjoy beating this one, folks.",1
"this game is basically trying to make yourself a better player in the game. its pratically a pve game. it can get repetative but i believe you would not focus on that being so at all.",4
"very fun and highly addicting. worth spending money into.",3
"warframe is unique. it is unique because all of the weapons and warframes are craftable and easy to obtain. most free-to-play games these days are pretty much pay to win and people who pay have an advantage over the people who dont pay. the game offers hours of fun and the satisfaction of building a new warframe is unbeatable. the enemy ai is alright and does have 1-2 bugs or glitches every so often. the wide range of guns and warframes offer more fun and playstyles to the game, be it charging head first into battle, taking a stealthy approach or using the op paris prime or synapse to decimate your foes. each warframe offers unique abilities such as absorbing damage and being nearly invincible while using the rhino, or using nova to completely kill everything in your path with her antimatter abilities. overall, the game is very fun and players are always willing to help you out, but with the ability of being a bit repetitive and sometimes boring with an op setup. i give this game 8/10. this game deserves a reccomendation.",2
"top game there is a bit of a learning curve involved, but once you get it, it becomes addictive. one of the best parts of warframe is that you dont have to rely on buying in-game currency, you can actually advance through the game wihout ever inputting your bank card details - and because its almost all team-based, you never feel its unfair that others have paid for (or perhaps earned) better weapons and equiptment than you, and in fact comes in handy when youre up against some tough foes. the graphics are top notch too, the only issue is sometimes there is connectivity problems, but this is to be expected with an open beta and not much can be said.",3
"this game, although in beta, is updated regularly and managed excelently by de. although this game can be hard for beginner players (especcially those who have not played shooters before), once the first of many sections of missions is completed, players will find that character and weapon upgrades are both common and rewarding. there is no plot, except that the player is an alien race (or appears to be) fighting other factions for solar system dominance - yet this does not matter as the amazing graphics and gameplay this game offers. in terms of graphics, it depends on the players computer. low-level computers may find it hard to play this game effectively with a reasonable frame rate, and high end computers that can handle the increased graphics performance and quality the game offers, will be more than enough. although i cannot recommend this to all gamers, as there are some that do not like shooters or this specific genre of shooter, i would say to atleast check it out as it is currently free. for those who are interested in this game, i would definitely recommend it, and i can tell you personally from experience, you can get hooked.",4
"great game, lots of stuff to do, tons of stuff to unlocked, and it gets better if you play with friends.",3
"incredible graphics and gameplay. there is some farming, but due to the update that increased the amount of resources dropped, it is no where near as bad as it was a long time ago. 5/5",2
"did you dream of being a bioarmor clad ninja shotgunning twisted creatures and souless people in the face? if your answer is no, you must be a very droll person and i have nothing more to say to you...",2
"extremely fun and vast gameplay, warning: do not download if you dont want to be spending alot of time and effort.",1
"dont let the metascore fool you. its an amzing game with great gameplay. best of all its free! what do you got to lose?",1
"this game is alot of fun so far! my favorite free game so far, if you love being a ninja then you need to play this now! its like if deadspace and ninja gaiden were to have a baby this would be it! doctermax",1
"do i have to make things more clear? ninjas, super powers, swords and rocket launchers am i clear? get this... its free!!",4
"one of the best co-op games made... graphics gorgeous, gameplay smooth... the only thing i think it lacks is the true power, of ultimate space-ninja-hybrid-alien-thingies-powers. sadly i dont feel like a galaxy god :d i recomend this game anywhere, anytime, solo, random player co-op or the best... with your friends. ;)",1
"love this game, play it all the time with my friends and it can also be a great single player game.",1
"this game is honestly amazing but! ive benn playing since closed beta so i know how things work. that being said this game has a excessively steep learning curve that might detour new players but if you stick around long enough i swear you wont regret it. also the devs are an amazing bunch and are a huge part of their community if you have any questions check the forums or wiki.",4
"plenty of fun, especially with mates. guns? melee? stealth? customization? if you like all these, im pretty sure youll enjoy this.",8
"ill keep this short, this is a must have f2p game, it looks great and plays even better, + you cant go wrong with.........fu*king ninjas!!!!",1
"a very fun,fast paced,thirdperson shooter with amazing graphics that should blow a persons mind.",1
"great game and it has very good graphics the only downside is ive become very laggy with the latest update.",1
"props to digital extremes for making a fun game, also being able to use there original idea that they would have made in dark sector to make this game fun. you like ninjas, powers and abilities, classes, a range of weapons and the means to chose between steath or just running in guns blazin, play warframe.....also its free so your wallet is safe.",2
"its a cool game it has fairly good gfx and i liked the multiplayer :d",1
"tight shooting mechanics, fun gameplay, deep progression, great coop. we have put over 100 hours into this game in less than a month and were not even down with a fraction of the content!",2
"amazing!! best online game that ive played since the original soldier front.",1
"considering this is still in beta and ive played for a pretty brief period, ive found there are consequentially some kinks to iron out especially optimisation-wise, but this is shaping up to be a very rewarding multiplayer game with a challenge, lots of fun.",1
"if your a player that loves co-op this is the game to get. up to 4 players in one mission. and can start a clan and have a dojo in the game and build it up to the fullest. and with the different characters to play as give different tactics and ways to take out your enemy.",1
"really awesome game. still hasnt failed to surprise me with each new update. stunning graphics. and the best part is that its free!",3
"it is awesome the graphics are sweet and you get to play online or by yourself try this game it is also free.",1
"one of the best free to plays out there that is on steam. my potato can actually run it which makes me happy",1
"more or less a poor mans vanquish, but with co-op. needs a lot of polish before a final release, but if you like what platinum games does then you should have fun.",1
"this is a very fun action game, being an over the shoulder shooter and slasher where you can take the class of warframes, which are suits designed to give the wearer special abilities, be it super strength, telekinesis, invisibility, and many many others. this game is perfect for bored gamers on a budget and it is definately worth a try.",1
"it is a great game. to put it simply, just plain badass.",1
"this game is fantastic. do not look at the meta critic score. they reviewed the game when it was till in beta mode. this is a fantastic game and well worth downloading.",1
"absolutely amazing game! free, addictive, and solid componets (ect. gameplay, level of play, challenging, replay-ability, graphics, good multiplayer features, customization, and it has a decent interphase) overall i belive, since its free, it deserves a solid 8/10. i would say its up there with (on my list) dayz, bf3, and halo reach. which puts it at around rank 3 on my list.",4
"for a game like warframe, i wish there was a kind of recommend button. dont get me wrong, it can be fun, but this is a good example of how you can take the pay-to-play model and ruin a game. if you really want to be successful, you have to join a clan, but in order to join a clan, you have to have really good gear, but in order to get really good gear, you have to invest tons of play time or outright buy the stuff with real-world money. on top of that, its a little monotonous. however, it does have its moments, and its free to try, so its not like youre losing out on anything... unless you actually spend your money on it. 7/10, i guess?",4
"this game is very fun! you should get this gme since its free!! 4.5/5",1
"a game with space and ninjas. space ninjas. what more could you ask for? starting small and having next to no equipment, having to fight your way through enemies that, at first, seem very difficult, yet rising up to an entity that has no problems fighting anyone. a great, fast, high-action game, with lots of combat, (and lately, learning the enemies). if you like space ninjas with cool guns, swords, and armor, then this is certainly the game for you.",6
"its a really fun game but i only got it for ps4 so i dont play it on pc at all :",1
"a fantastic co-op game for anyone who has friends that will play it with them. sadly, i dont.",1
"im not usually one for buying into free-to-play games but warframe caught my eye over 6 months ago. its a new direction for digital extremes (yknow, the guys who gave us unreal) and theyve done a nice job of making a fun and challenging game that you can dip in and out of. i liked it enough to have a punt and become a founder, and i still enjoy it half a year on. its fast paced shootie action that makes a nice change from the kind of deep strategy games or sandboxes that i usually enjoy. also so far it doesnt seem to be pay-to-win either, yes there is an rmt ingame currency that can be used to fast track your way to content but it doesnt make you any more powerful than a player who earnt their stuff through play. the only thing exclusive to the rmt currency are cosmetic items and the purchasing of more slots for frames (characters) and weapons, anything else can be obtained by playing. the community is active, development is ongoing and soon well have a load of ps4 players joining in as this game will involve cross-platform play, and that isnt something many titles offer. so yeah, warframe is worth a look i reckon. and if silently headshotting dudes with throwing knives while zipping about like a parkour boss space ninja aint your bag then no worries. ^_^",1
"i havent played this game all that much, but the time i have played is very enjoyable. playing co-op with my friends, slicing up enemies, incinerating, warping, etc. is all really fun. the game seems to be very large too. my only issue is that i would almost consider this game a pay-to-win game. you can get far, maybe even beat the game not buying stuff, but you just dont feel or look cool if you dont buy stuff, which is kind of dissapointing. overall the game is fantastic, the graphics are phenemeonal, the co-op is great, and the only downside is all the payments to get something cool.",1
"first and foremost: free. that virtue alone gives this game a huge plus to being recommended. you have nothing to lose by trying it. graphically this is one of the best free games ive played. its right up there with many top notch (as of 2013) pay to play games. the distant future ninjas in space premise isnt delved into very deeply lore wise. true lore and story gamers wont find much depth here to stimulate the imagination. players who prefer solo play will have fun for a while, but it will get repetitive. the game really shines in its multiplayer. group up with some pals (up to 4 of you) and ninja your way through a level as fast as possible annihilating the ai, picking up drops as fast as possible - its a feast of visual, reflex, and team work video game fun. it really serves strongly those gamer who love to min/max and find the ultimate way to manipulate the mechanics to make your team of pals godlike in its slaying, looting, collecting, building items glory. - solo/lore players i give this game 12-24 hours of game play enjoyment before boredom. - multiplayer co-op power gamers up to 100s of hours.",1
"warframe is 5 minutes of violence. then you step back, you click through some menus, you do rpg stuff. and then you have 5 minutes of violence. repeat without end.",1
"a free-to-play game worth all the time and effort. a variety of items to use, to build, to get,... you can never tire from its gameplay. ever expanding, only time will tell when it will stop. worth all the money too if you were to spend on the in-game items.",4
"graphics, action, fun, everything! and a few funny glitches like when (probally changed by now) u use mags crush ability on a boss and he/she (the boss) turns into a ball.",1
"epic ninja game is all i can say, one of the best mmo fighting games i have played yet. you have to give this game a go other wise it would be pointless if you just saw my recommendation ^_^",8
"there is a flaw many action games have, and that flaw is making you feel like you are awesome. and what i mean by that is when you do something like shooting an enemy in the face, youre rewarded wit ha really cool head explosion animation or something of the sort. warframe makes you feel like a complete badass. i mean this one time i litterally slid on my knees through this doorway(like in the movies) and shot and killed two bad guys next to the doorframe. someone i was playing with types holy  that was ing awesome. and i replied merely, that wasnt ing awesome, no. this game is ing awesome.",1
"the game is incredibly enjoyable, but once you start getting incredibly powerful, you find there is nothing much left to do other than grind.",6
"awesome game, visually great for a free game. the controls are smooth and easy to get into. modding/upgrading adds depth into the game. you can virtually get anything in the game if you participate in events or grinds. it is a rough game at first (especially boss fights where its nigh-impossible to solo) and even later on. theres also difficult spike depends on the type of the mission that you are doing, and the enemy faction that youre facing. although you need to depend on rng (or luck for short) when it comes to grinding, if you enjoy looking cool while owning horde of mobs, then this is the game for you. grab some friends while youre at it too. i wish there were more factions and maybe more environment maps too. the game has too much feeling of a dead space travel which is kinda depressing to me. this game doesnt have that much in-game help/guide. youd have to rely on the games wiki to understand the game system more. you will also have to prepare ahead to be able to fight effectively. a. lot. one last thing, prepare your own music playlist and rock space ninja style.",3
"very good production values, great old-school fast action with a fluid feel and a great levelling system. one of the best mp games ive played in a long time.",4
"i recommend playing this with a friend preferably with voice chat so fun like that. graphics are great and gameplay is solid. could easily see this as a boxed game in a store and would have paid for it.",1
"cnt able to make backup of the game .. !! plz help me with this problem send me the problem solution to my e-mail sail_mostwanted_yo@yahoo.co.in",1
"awesome ftp 3rd person co-op shooter, its free-to-play in the best sense as you can unlock everything buyable through playing. the best items are only attainable through playing aswell, so theres no buy-to-win feature ^^ highly recommend giving it a try.",3
"this game starts of kinda boring and har because you dont really now what you can do with your weapons and frame (modding). but as soon as you got the hang of it it is a really amazing game, alot of content in the form of different frames, weapons, mods and randomly generated mission areas. it is best to play with friends though since the hosting system aint perfect right now. so play and it gl hf",4
"amazing game.best third person shooter ever i really recommend this game :)",1
"great game... only played for the last 3 days and im hooked xd",1
"i hate it shuts down all the time i hate do not play this pice of junk",1
"ive played lots of free-to-play, pay-to-win games in my time, and this is by far one of them",1
"this game is really fun and addicting except theres lots of bugs and glitches, this game has been in beta a long time and crafting things in the foundry such as a new warframe takes three days to complete please make the time less and finish this game.",3
"1000 hours. no regrets. better than doing normal human stuff or having a social life. :d",10
"its good im just terrible at it (also its gotten better since ages ago)",1
"its an interesting game to play: slash, bash, shoot, loot, all the stuff youve come to expect. it also looks really good except for a few glitches. however, dont expect much of a story or any driving force to do anything because you will basically be farming to unlock cooler stuff later on, such as more warframes, better weapons, etc. and try not to waste your platinum, because thats the way they getcha monies. but if youre only interested in doing cool ninja stuff and becoming an amazing bad***, go on and play already!",1
"so good game. might be hard to start playing,but when you understand the modding n stuff its going to be awesome.",7
"at first i thought this game was quite, welll.....stupid, but! now i have my own clan to look after as well as two warframes to kick  with!",4
"i enjoy this game very much, spent a lot of time just conpleting missions. this game is worth your time.",1
"good game, i had lots of fun with it, but its still need much work",2
"i really enjoy this game, once you get a better warframe than the inital then its really good fun and with riends even better 9/10",2
"pve game with a tf2 like economy and futuristic stuff",2
"ever wanted to be ninja?.....ever wanted to be a ninja with guns?.....ever wanted to be a ninja with guns in space an slaughter everyone who gets in your way with a simple sword swipe from your flaming blades of fury, and then shoot another guy impaling him into a wall which u run up only to do a backflip and stab another guy?....ever wanna do it with a friend?..... warframe in a nutshell.",2
"im just going to throw this out!! this game is free and looks awesome!! also ninjas shooting guns!!",7
"this is a must play game; its super fun and action packed!",5
"warframe is third person shooter co op action multiplayer game were the protagonists are the tennos a kinda ninjas from space but theyre not aliens they are humans trying to get back to their power the solar sistem that is conquisted by a variety of bosses and powerful normal enemys so if you like third person shooter games you should play warframe ninjas play free!!!",5
"this game is so awesome! there is a lot of cosumization to you warframes and weapons (warframes are your suits). although a lot of things have to be bought with actual money, you can still get the items without it, it just requires more work. i like it like that because it gives you something to work for and for to play, looking forward to. there are so many missions! you travel to each planet of the solar system (plus more) and their moons. there is hours and hours worth of gameplay here; ive already sunck 12+ hours into it and im still having as much fun as when i started! however, there are a few problems with joining friends and members of your clans and crashes, but its not a constant thing, so its not too bad. i absolutly love this game! i would recomend this to everybody who loves action, uprgrading everything basically, explosions, and amazing graphics! even with everything dropped, this game still looks beautiful. amped, oh my god! you have to see it if your computer can handle it! there are no wors to desctibe it! deffinatly play this game if you have the time!",1
"really great game considering its f2p. i was hooked for 50+ hours before it started getting a little repetitive, but its being updated all the time.",1
"pretty much the best for short bursts of play if you dont have much time to spend invested in fun. guns feel pretty dang good swords are always a plus whips? yeah they got those power fists too",2
"this is a game about how i play as zero in borderlands 2.",1
"yes i recommend this game to any people it`s fun, there is alot of cool stuff in it like guns, frames and melee weapons and all the stuff there is all can be found in the game without paying platinum but if really want platinum its your choice its your money its worth it to play this game.(there are also some scienceish like the planets that would help you remember stuff in space if you need to :d)",3
"good quality and just the best sci-fi game ever played",1
"this game has a pretty fluid movement system and lots of loadout customisation options, as well as a great community.",1
"play as any of the many types of space ninjas with shark fin helmets that you want! from ones who shoot electricity, to others who glide through to air, to even one who was experimented on and went insane and now goes on bloody rampages! play solo, or online co-operative to beat each mission. start on the planet mercury and work your way among the stars defeating rival factions. level up and gain mods to augment your play style. seemlessly switch between melee and ranged fighting to deal deadly damage in a variety of ways. whats not to love!?",1
"a great game with awesome movement and combat mechanics. the only downside is that the levels get a bit repetitive and there are some bugs.",1
"gameplay is great, filled with sometimes difficult but entertaining enemies. definitely play with your friends. great for role-players.",1
"a clean, polished, ftp game? yes, that is warframe.",1
"a fantastic shooter with plenty of content, depth, and most importantly, dev support. the game looks amazing, the writing is top notch, and the battle mechanics are interesting. the game is easy to learn, and challenging to master. best of all, it is f2p with an option to buy items, equipments etc in a balanced environment. anything you can buy can be obtained in game from drops, or using the crafting system. all in all, its a great game with lots of potential; seeing what the develops have done with is thus far, it looks like theyre on the right track to meet that potential.",1
"the game that makes simply gaming excellent but with promises of good storyline into the near future of the game",9
"needs a way to reset because i played this like a year ago and now i want to make new guy but i am either blind or tere is no way other that to buy a new one(not ingame money)",1
"warframe... how you have consumed my life. 136 hours and counting, in ~3 weeks. thats over a fifth of my time playing warframe. yeah, its that good.",6
"the best free-to-play game i have ever played, and probably the best free-to-play game ever created.",3
"most beautiful free to play game ever. if you like mob grinding endlessly, non stop upgrading and leveling up, beautiful colors, and amazing ninja gameplay. the download this right now. ninjas play free!",2
"fun game for a f2p,definitely worth checking out!!! its best to play with our friend!!",2
"amazing game. its a simple, but challenging at the same time, 3rd person shooter. i highly recommend it to anyone.",2
"for a free to play game its suprisingly good. i was pleasently suprised with it to be honest.",1
"really good game to have some fun time, especially if you can find some people to play it with. and dont forget, free to play :d",8
"these graphics are good i could not play this on my other pc i couldnt but iplay onmy momsdamn boy theseactions like df men so much action iplayed this game i waslike omfg so much awesomenes",1
"parkour space ninjas. thats enough to convince people.",1
"while this game looks great do not be fooled, these ninjas are subpar for any true dark warrior. kamas are fashioned with subpar material, nikanas obviously not shinobi-made and my mom found me playing this and grounded me.",2
"alright game fun for anyone wanting to play a space themed online game.",1
"really weird but fun. hard to understand menus and main screen, but once you stare at it for a while and let your mind fracture you began to understand about 1% of it.",1
"it looks good but they should add more guns to like come on you know that everybody likes guns",1
"probably one of the greatest free 2 play games i have played in awhile, its not pay to win, and everything you can buy in the store you can aquire through playing the game!",1
"this is best third person shooter free to play i have played in a long time. i highly recommend this game.",1
"it is an alright game but if you dont spend a few hours or money you are going to be stuck with bad gear but other then that a good game",1
"absolute fab game like playing as and when got time",2
"this game is a very well balanced game between dificulty and making sure you stay intrested by letting you costomize your warframe, guns, and melee weapons to you liking so no other player you meet will look or act the same way you do. i recomend this game for anyone looking for a fun original experiance in video games.",5
"the game is very good, nice gameplay and the idea with the warframes, mods, weapons to build them yourself is great.",1
"i really like warframe especially when i play it with my friends because it a very fun experience for a group.",3
"you play as a space ninja... in space killing everything in your way.this is one of the best f2p games ive ever played since it doesnt require you to throw money at them to have fun.grab 3 friends and you will have a wonderful time.sometimes its hard to find matches alone so id say you need at least another person to really enjoy this game. i give the game 8/10.",2
"very fun to play with friends. though, some maps look and have the same feel to them.",1
"this is a bad  game. i have not got to too far into it, but i do enjoy playing solo so far. yea im yet to play multi-player, but im sure it is just as fun.",4
"needs pvp. it needs pvp. please give me the pvp. the pve is fun and different, albiet repetitive as hell, hence, needs pvp damnt.",1
"space ninjas. let that sink in as you install. the excitement will build up inside you. space ninjas.",1
"a fun and functional third person shooter. the style and art are fantastic. in game currency and items could be a bit cheaper otherwise it can become a bit of a grind fest.",1
"fun to play and it isnt a pay to win game because just about everything is accessable without paying",4
"i reviewed this for a badge but seriously, this game is truly amazing, with an active player base, innvovative elements, constant streams of content, and increasing levels of difficulty as you get better, this game is awesome and a must play.... and its free",4
"this is a halo meets parkour to me, but it is a very fun game with your friends. its a third person over the shoulder space game.",1
"it can been a bit of a grind fest at times, but synergising with teamates and their frames can be quite fun.",8
"it is awsoooooooooooome love but i cant figure out how to buy things",1
"the most sickass sci-fi free to play i have ever played!!",1
"beside an epic main story line, the game is fun in combination of shooting, collecting, and coop plays.",6
"really fun and addicting game. a bit grindy and you have to pray to the rng gods a lot, but still very entertaining!",9
"rly great game can play up to 4 players online missions or you can solo it but overall 10/10",1
"great graphics and game play.play alone or with people.",2
"interesting game to play, only bad side in it is that its to repetitive. by that i mean the maps and graphics usual gets repeated into other maps... after a while it really gets booring, seeing all the things all over again. game is fun! but it needs new maps, new graphics and new enemies if possible. ( wink wink )",1
"get it!! (#) why? b-because..its a f2p / nop2w m*****f****** space ninja! vs mutated vegans and space zombies!? nuff said",4
"great game! looks great, feels great, plays great. and still free. and finally coop !!! also the acorbatics in this game are amazing and fun! an must have game imo!",10
"only few people know this game, but is awesome co-op game.",1
"this game is surprisingly addictive, and its pretty incredible the amount of content you get for free. you can play as a number of different warframes and build so many items. lots of mods allow you to enhance your build even further, such as being able to add elemental damage to weapons. overall, a great game to play with friends or online!",5
"one of the most fun games ive played in a long time. simple yet challenging. a tad buggy from time to time (it is still in beta) but overall a great game!",8
"really quite a fun game, a lot of different types of guys to pick that change the way you play, and the gun play and combat feels really satisfying when you find your kind of weapon. the microtransactions are a bit costly when buying items, but normally it wasnt that hard to grind for them without spending money, i only bought cosmetic stuff like color variations.",2
"warframe is an addictive free to play sci fi co-op shooter that is constantly releasing new material and pays very close attention to fan feedback. nearly all of your equipment in the game must be built, and so the primary focus of the game is to visit worlds and participate in missions that offer the resources you need. the gameplay is fast paced, flows smoothly, the controls are comfortable, and the designs for weapons and warframes are creative and badass. the games production value is superb, and the micro transaction marketplace for the game is fairly reasonable. the pvp however, is terrible, and there are a few mechanics (such as the day long delay to build weapons) that are rather irritating. overall though, the game is tons of fun, probably my favorite free to play game out right now. 9/10",5
"warframe has continued to grow eversince i played it during its open beta phase a year ago. back then, parkour and those flashy melee moves that we have now were non-existent. i have watched warframe grow, and i have to say that its worth checking out. (a warning though, once you play it you might not end up *unplaying it*)",6
"impressive visuals, good with friends (if theyre up to something such as this)",1
"warframe aka ninjas in space. this game is an excellent pve (player vs environment) game that can be played fairly well solo (one player), but is even better when playing co-op. with constant added new features and weapon systems, it is a fairly good game. the various warframes help in a variety of ways, and can play special roles as it goes up to 4 players which can make gameplay even better and possibly more fun and intense. the loot drop is very good in the way of not having people risking in losing said items, which makes the co-op very toleerrable. beware of latencies though, as it may happen, ecspecially if you have bad internet/bad computer while hosting, or if you joined a public game that has said problem, which can make or break the game. gameplay: 8, story: 6 (only considering the story is fairly basic and just feels dull), graphics: 9 (if your computer can handle it, it is quite nice to look at. the issue for me is the bloom.), music: 7. though it is more of an ambience thing, or it just... doesnt feel too fitting in certain situations. but it is still okay.",2
"most best game ive played better than cod and its free is the best reason!",1
"a suitable experience if youd like to play something with your disabled friends.",1
"great game that is addicting and fun as ...only it can get reptivetive like any other game.",4
"warframe is a cool f2p co-op multiplayer game, with unique style, and good graphics. its not a pay to win game, you can get almost everything in the game, just by playing it. i recommend it to try it out!",2
"this is a great game. for anyone hwo hasent tryed it i sugest playing.",6
"its a pretty good game great graphics good shooting macanics :)",1
"why isnt everyone playing this thie only downside is platinum is expensive",1
"an entertaining time sink that will scratch the common mmorpg players itch for danglign contant grind oriient goals over ones head, its free to play nature makes it rather affordable and it helped break me of my wow addiction, so check it out.",8
"very different game, which is the best thing ever. its just a game you have to try for yourself.",5
"this is an excellent, ever expanding game. they are constantly putting in new weapons and expansions to it to keep the gameplay fresh.",3
"good fun more refined from its beta still issues with the frame rate due to the vertical sync basically turn tht off  the games really easy to use excellent game to pick up and have a bash of",1
"for a free game its outstanding! good enough graphics, and totally free if you can spare the grinding time.",1
"this game is suprisingly good for a f2p game, a little bit grindy when it comes to leveling up and getting better guns but throw on some epic music and shoot your way through endless enemies alongside your friends, not a bad way to spend the day!",1
"its fun and some what addicting to play. the concept is great. and its quite easy to grasp.",4
"probably the greatest f2p 3rd person shooter ever made. theres no gimics for being forced to play money where everything can be obtained if you know where to look and you could aquire almost everything by just playing. basically, its a f2p that doesnt feel empty. [until you almost play it for 500 hours]",7
"been playing this game for a bit today, its controlls are awesome and the flips and slides make it look like an action movie! its truely amazing the unlock system is fair and the ranking system too.",1
"it is a free third person shooter/parkour/ninja game. if you are looking for a game to pass the time while waiting to go out to the movies or out with friends this is a game for you. also goes for people who are looking for a game to play for several hours in a day. you can go into depth wit the games story, warframes, clans, pvp, several planets to explore, tons of missions, and co op play. try warframe for free today.",2
"warframe is a really solid 4 player co-op game. its fast paced and a real good shootem up kinda style. loads of guns and mods make playing really exciting. the missions are fun and while they can be a little dull due to the extensive time it takes to level sometimes bringing new gear or tennos can change it up enough to make it thrilling again. 8 of 10. solid play great for friends who like playing co-op together and plenty of content to play through.",3
"amazing game... and its free! so you really dont have an excuse not to try it.",4
"4 player co op ninjas in space over 24 different charcaters lots of meal wepons (and combos) lots of guns whats not to like",3
"this is a really great game, it updates on time, interesting events, lots of weapons, & very time consuming to keep u interested....new things r added like every update, the community isnt really bad. this game is like pure work hard to win....now thats my type of game",5
"fantastic graphics, mechanics, and storyline. fun to play with friends, strangers, or solo.",1
"really fun game to play with friends the only thing that lets this free to play game down is the stupidly long but realistic waiting times for the building of items or rooms in the clan dojo anywhere between 12 hours and several days. but overall its a really fun game to play either solo or coop with friends",1
"have and continue to play this game for almost a year now. its a great action/mindless fun type game that really helps you pass the tine when your bored. there isnt really a point to warframe; you do what you want to do. fun is determined by how how you define a good time. want to kill a bunch of things with crazy lazers and rockets? done. want to be involved with the story and the tense war that the tenno are right in the middle of? done. the beggining can be a bit of a grind if you dont know what your doing, but once you get yourself a good set of weapons and a decent frame you open up a whole world of possibilities. without a doubt this game is one of the once in a decade games for me, and is all ive really played since getting a job and going to college. matches can be short or long depending on what your looking for and the community is great. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a good free game to spend some time.",5
"awesome but ever changing not new player frienldy as most in game content is only avaidable to veteran players,such as mu self for thee are many crafting restrictions form mastery rank to getting resources (which can prove to be fustrating and difficult).its still a good game if your willing to put time and money into it.",7
"one of the best mmo i have played in my life. brilliant idea, nice graphics and good difficulty make it one of the best ftp games.",2
"extremely fun have it for ps4 and pc gets kinda addicting my advice is to not choose loki some of my favorite warframes is volt, mag, and ember/ember prime. get the game got about 15 hrs in on ps4 it is the most fun if u join a clan. one bad thing is some times with the volt, mag, and ember/ember prime warframes some of the enemys dont drop enough energy for u to use the best part of those warframes the supers.",1

"parkour space ninja third person shooter. a bit grindy, but a good time killer and pretty fun. still a beta, so forgive any bugs.",3
"i love this game because this is better than about all other games ive played for freelove whatever genra you like try this game",1
"parkour space ninjas...essentially a dungeon crawler with guns",4
"fun game for hack and slash plus first person shooter. highly reccomend for anyone that liked the online version of me3",4
"this game is fun when it comes to third person adventures. if you have a good pc that can run smooth graphics, this game is for you. the controls are not too hard to learn and the gameplay is very intriguing. being that it can also be played on a ps4, do yourself a favor and try out both the ps4 version and the pc version. i have played both and i enjoyed the pc version more because the control scheme is better outfitted for this game. if you have a powerful enough pc, this game is glorious. a great suggestion for the new generation gamers out there.",1
"way to good for a free to play game. try it out i bet youll love it. amazing graphics and nice positioning of the controllers. really good game.",3
"an amazing game for free to play. its truly unique.",1
"good game... when you are okay with grinding. its like diablo 3, except it has guns and the loot doesnt drop nearly as much. repetitive, but looks great on the iest of computers. as of this review, there is an event called th cicero crisis. updates and events happen regularly, and the game has improved vastly since 6 months ago. however, the event is repetitive (you take scan plants to get components to make antidotes to open defense missions to get points to get loot). thats warframe in a nutshell. play with friends. if not, play co-op. dont ever do solo. different strokes for different folks.",4
"very fun game lots of content and tons of constant updates. they also stay connected with the community and their ideas. :d",1
"i love this game, the mechanics are truly beautiful and amazing, and ive been waiting for a game like this for a long time. there are two bad things about this game though: 1. it takes absolutely forever to unlock new weapons because you have to get materials that are a long ways away from you. i dont know, i just feel like it takes too long. 2. i cant find anyone to help me with the current missions that i am stuck on and i cant pass the current stage alone, so if more people played this amazing game then that problem would be eliminated.",1

"a free mmo about space ninjas. a bit grindy at times but it usually doesnt feel like youre grinding. all the cash shop exclusive items are cosmetic only, you can buy weapons through the $hop but you can also make them yourself. a really fun game thats still seeing significant improvement even though it has been soft launched (aka completely open beta for as long as is needed)",2
"given the cost of entry, warframes well worth a try if youre in the mood for something different. it has a great mix of shooter/melee type offense. whenever i play this game i feel like a ninja. this game is in alpha so it will have its issues; but, overall its a free fun game why not give it a try?",1
"this game makes me so angry. 10/10. would recommend",1
"yes fun game. really worth it considering it is free to play",1
"pretty slick 3rd person shooter. definitely worth the money ;p, but the grind is a bit much for me, but might be right for you. i really enjoyed leveling up my first mech/warframe, and i enjoyed leveling up my next one, but after that man it was like realzzzzzz",1
"even if it is a bit of a grind, it is so much fun after the initial hour or two",2
"game is constant grinding right after beating venus. repetitive gameplay and pvp is broken beyond repair. 9/10 i dont know why its so fun.",1
"its awesome. whats not to like about space ninjas/samurai",3
"very great visuals for a start. the gameplay is awesome as well. try it if you have the time.",2
"the games fun, and ive managed to work up enough in-game money in about 4 hours to dabble a little something into every item slot. the free-to-play marketing is a thing, but the simplest comment about the capitol aspect of the game is: you can pay to have an item right now, or play the game for about 4 hours getting all the pieces you need to make it. warframes got accseptable everything, and if you remember a certain xbox 360 game dark sector than this is definatly a game to throw a little a cash ar for the fun. 3/5 stars -1 for 12 hour waiting time to craft items -1 for revival micro-transaction, my least favorite one of the cash-purchases in the game.",8
"this game is actually quite fun, i highly recommend you all try it because theres no reason not to.",1
"i installed this game not expecting much, but after 100 some odd hours into it i have to say it is one great game. the graphics are awesome, the game play and modding for your frame is excellent as well. the environments are very well done (not to mention random) depending on where your mission is. you can spend real money on credits to buy stuff in store but its much more rewarding when you work for what you want. game play also gets better when you have a friend or three to play with :) over all great game, do recommend.",8
"this is a really fun hack-and-slack gunner thats super easy to pickup. not to mention that for a free to play game, its pretty awesome.",1
"controls pretty poor and too easy. not to mention theres a big pay 2 win side of the game.",1
"entertaining, truly a lot of fun, i totally recommend it ^^",1
"a great game thats kept fresh by the dev team and can get very addictive. if you like third person shooters, you should really enjoy this game. hell if you like gaming in general you should like this game.",7
"space ninjas with guns and random screaming robots.",1
"a very nice idea! a not so new approach to the genre but very well executed. the characters are nice, textures are crisp, and the game is well optimized even on older computers all you need to do is lower the resolution really it has to work! as an added + whoever liked the multiplayer in mass effect 3 will definitely enjoy this i dont know why; after a while it can get boring but that really depends on the person; yes indeed the levels are a little repetitive and lookalike but still...its a nice experiment run by a strong developlemnt team who promise nothing but quality even for the future... at least give it a try there enough for everybody!",1
"a fantastic game, with a fresh and innovative art style and ambitious development.",5
"its an excellent co-op experience with more than enough action and customization your face has room for. plenty of awesome abilities and varied gameplay leaving you feel like a super bad  ninja commando from hell.",1
"warframe is a fast paced tps that offers varying types of gameplay. easy to pick up and put down, or grind continuously. if you havent tried it yet, give it a shot.",8
"it is a free game, on going, nearly everything is obtainable without pays (excepts one warframe and the scarves so far but you can get a scarf for the free ingame platinum they give you) so definetly a must if you want entertainment for $0",7
"this game is really fun you get the concept of a rpg and third person shooter together as one oh yeah and ur a ninja in space badass",4
"yes yes yes yes yeeeeesss!!!!! such a good game, you can really feel the atmosphere of your surroundings , the storyline is a bit typical, but the gameplay is astounding. outstanding graphics also really make the game, come to life. the voice acting, i could go on all day about it. its extremely well written and the actors appsolutally nail the emotions, and the voices fit perfectly with the characters. my overall opinion is that, this game is delight, and i would rate it 10/10",1
"very good game. fun to play with your friends and can sometimes get challenging",1
"nice game, atmospheric scenes while playing, even though it is and online 3ps.",1
"neeed help can login to dis game really want to play this game :(",1
"the diffuclty of obtaining everything is the only downside to the game. other than that, its amazing!",2
"it is a nice game! trust me this is all im gonna say",1
"my favorite game and still playing since closed beta. the bio-armors (or frames) have a great design as the entire game. the combat style is real fast and gives you a large edge for tactics and customization. updates are made in a fair schedule. the veredisct is: awesome.",5
"best f2p game i have played to date. you are a freaking space ninja!",3
"warframe in its simplest parts is a amalgamation of mass effect 3 shooting, old school diablo looting / hoarding, free running / parkour, and freaking space ninjas! did i say space ninjas? its really really fun living out your childhood dreams of dropkicking baddies in the face while throwing stars at a secondary target. if you ever wanted to be bruce lee; this is your game. i love this game",1
"space ninjas. if that doesnt grab your attention and make you download this free action/shooter/platformer game, then youre dead inside. did i mention its free? one of the few action titles out there that has held my interest consistantly for several months now, the only thing that could make it more epic would be including space pirates... but then warframe would get swallowed up in the galactic black hole created by its epicness.  you got: fast co-op action. a slew of battle suits (i.e. warframes) all with different powers and abilities. oodles of handguns, knives, bows, rifles, shuriken, swords, polearms, shotguns, machineguns, energy weapons, biological weapons and high explosive weapons. dozens of dynamic, on-the-fly environments. wall running, climbing, jumping, sliding, fliping, john woo film style leaping sideways with a pistol in each hand shooting style acrobatics. about a dozen mission types. everything is configurable with atrifacts known as mods. even mods can be augmented by fusing them together to make them more powerful. check it out, its worth the download and playing through the intros if you enjoy action games. if you really like it, consider tossing digital extreme a few coins for some platnum and buy some extra weapon and warframe slots... about the only thing you cant get via just playing the game. theyve earned this one for their amazing efforts.",9
"2 words to describe how awesome this game is. space. ninjas. my work here is done.",1
"get this game! its beautiful regardless of the pc, it runs like a charm on my low end piece of , and if you gonna pay for dlc in a f2p this is the best bang for buck.",1
"a free to play game goes pay to win are you kidding dont waist your time",1
"its not all pew pew pew, some times you just have to slash and dash.",1
"reminds me of star wars except with swords and other weapons which means: best dam game i have ever played",1
"great fun - unfortunately a bit costly if you want stronger weapons! (taking in account r1 = $10+)",2
"this game has more martial arts and grinding than jackie chan and jay-z running a nightclub falling  over teakettle on acid",4
"this game is a load of fun, not to mention it takes time to progress through this game which i enjoy. the platnum is way to expensive in my oppinion. and the time you gotta wait to build stuff is insane...like i am talking about the lowest item i have built was like 6 hours for christ sakes. so to sum it up here pros: -lots of stuff to do -updates keep coming and making it better -easy to play -different ways to play cons: -plat is expensive -waiting time to build stuff too long -need a mid-high end computer spec in general great game and i hope they keep making it better by the month",1
"warframe is a very good game it has very nice tps so very recomended",1
"the game lags but has nice graphics best game ever 9/10",1
"amazing fourplayer co-op gameplay, this is, my favorite game. while some people (like my brother) call it stale and boring, there is plenty of action. those that say that it is repetitive are just so used to being dragged along by an all to evident and forced plot.",3
"one of best but weapon customisation needs it be something i know there are weapon card add on but im talking about physical changes to the weapon for example a sword can get a better grip increases speed and looks epic or aiming sights",1
"i would if it would let me download it so frustrating",1
"easy to find games. its a pretty fun tps co-op game. and its free, and not that large in size. graphics are great. tons and tons of different levels. leveling system also in the game as well as plenty of equipment. i dont know how easy it is to obtain the equipment yet, i assume not too easy. but i havent heard anything about this game being p2w. im having fun with it so far though.",1
"its a grindfest yes, but it is rewarding. all upgrades make you feel badass along with the ability to craft every item in the game (except a few things) it keeps you going back to old levels to get more materials to build better stuff. the game is very well balanced as well. it dosnt take time to reach a max rank on a suit or warframe so catching up to your friends who play is not very hard. once you finished maxing out a warfram you cna craft a different warframe and try the game with a different set of special moves and tactics. storyline is alright, nothing too mind blowing but its styled nice and it makes since. graphically the game is good. nothing groundbreaking but i woudlnt say lack luster. its shiny and fluid. overall i give it a solid 7.5/10 worth playing, its free-to-play so pick it up and at least give it a try",2
"this game is so awesome for an f2p game , just wow , you can fully customize your own build with mods etc.. i recommend this game to all the people that are considering downloading this !!!!",3
"incredibly fast paced flexible gameplay, insanely fun, tough to master",3
"if you have a good gaming pc i recommend this game but in my opinion it is waste of time",1
"repetitive cluster farm shooting! like fapping... we do it every day and it still somehow feels good 7/10 would fap again!",1
"the best killing and grinding simulator... in space! with ninjas!",4
"this game is super fun if you like a samurai based gamestyle with guns, explosions, and powers. ratatatata boom boom boom",1
"great game, really and truly. the gameplay is great, the graphics are top notch, the lighting is very interesting as well. the fluidity of the combat, from the gunplay to the sword play is very nice. there are also unique ways of getting around the maps: wallrunning, sliding, super-jumping, ziplining, etc. once you play the game for a while you start to get the hang of it and learn the tips and tricks, it really is alot of fun. this game isnt without flaws however. the crafting system is a bit tedious, sometimes taking hours to compile all the materials required for something. gaining money/experience also takes a sufficient amount of time. all in all, this game is very fun, very entertaining, and can keep you locked in for a while. beware: your pinky finger will want to fall off from holding ctrl for so long...",1
"is a good and fun game to play with other but is too hard to get good gear and after a while it gets very repeating the alert mission and coop missions",5
"the most awsome game ive ever played! play it and youll be attached forever! lol",7
"this game is a great third person shooter. there are a lot of items and lootables, and the mods and fusion system adds an extra layer of depth to the combat. there are some things that may put you off- one being that all the levels (save certain key points) use tilesets- the devs are adding new ones every major update, so it is getting much less noticeable. another putdown is the fact that you cannot get color palettes for you warframe without paying. i guess they have to make money somewhere! tl;dr: its a good game with cool mechanics but has some flaws that are being fixed.",5
"fast paced, good graphics shooter with a balance of powers, elements, enemy types and leveling.",2
"this is a fun game ! there is a lot that could be said about warframe, like, the available arsenal, somewhat simple, but interesting and fun game mechanics, customization options etc. but there is ultimately one thing, and one thing alone, that makes the game worth all the time one can spend on it - you play as a space ninja ! a ninja in space, fighting alien races with swords !!! i think ive highlited enough features :d",3
"very fun combat simiar to tf2? a litle you find parts and ild new weapons instead of finding them so more like the last of us",1
"the game actually made me arsed to write a review i hate it 5/5",1
"great game to play with friends, awsome graphix and unique gameplay and mechanics.",2
"this game has no words to explain it...its well made and thought and time into this i highly recommend this game for futureistic sword fighting loving gamers who desire such content",1
"if you love grinding in rpgs, if you love mass effect, if you love ninjas and weapons, weapons everywhere then you will love this game. its a f2p game, you can access anything in the game without paying if you commit! make sure you use the alerts app or follow the alerts on twitter. the only reason you would need to pay is to expand your storage (more frames/wepons capacity and also event weapons give you storage spaces) and colors/skins (some helmets are even obtainable for free). in other words, i love this game. its fun, its repetitive but theres always new content coming out and the repetitive is just leveling up new weapons and new characters every day for fun.",7
"excellent graphics for free game and is getting content regularly",1
"before update 11, it was sliding simulator 2013. after that, it became space-ninja-dodge-everything-or-die sliding simulator 2013.",3
"this game rocks. almost 200 hours in and still having a blast.",7
"i played this game over 24 hours, so i might know what im talking about. warframe is a great looking game in many ways and yet feels good too. this game seems to be a too good free-to-play, but yet i feel like i paid for it. story is good but not bad, but what we all gamers care about the fun and gameplay in games, and this game does a great job of doing this. i highly people who really spend their time playing video games to play this game... but yet im not a player who playes all day and i still enjoy playing it. if i were to give it a score of 1 though 10 it would be a 9-out of 10, because it still has more updaes to come and yet when a new warframe comes out every update it get sadden and feel that im not powerful anymore. some bugs here and there but you will not run into any on your great adventure in this game. this game is a should have.",2
"really detailed 3rd person shooter with some free running mechenics but as always microtransactions that are not really neccesary to play the game all in all a good game and only 1 gig",1
"this game is a menagerie of fast paced action of all types. it seriously is one of those games you can lose countless hours over. definately look into this, if you havent already.",1
"great game, gameplay is good and so is the ability to manange ones player. though the micro-transactions are the thing that kills it.",1
"yas tenos kill all da humans. think mass effect/gears of war but with halos firefight type and boom. play with friends and youll always enjoy it.",1
"so addictive once you have a certain amount of hours in game.....",3
"i am about two hours into playing this game and i have to say its pretty damn fun being a space ninja. im running on walls, slicing jerks up with a sword, shooting fools in the face with a rifle. i feel a little thrown into everything with mods and the best way to use them, but its coming to me. id definitely suggest giving it a play if you have the time.",1
"graphics. seriously a f2p game with no p2w model yet the graphics are aaa+.",4
"so far the best f2p, 3rdps, action mmo, etc. ive played. the grind to get cool items is a bit annoying, but they seem to be fixing that with missions that are more fun.",3
"you are a power-armoured future ninja space samurai with guns. think about that for a moment. yes, you can run along walls. yes, you can powerslide through a room whilst gunning down enemies. did i mention the magic psychic tech power things? my warframe has mind control, its awesome. i saw another who exploded in shards of stuff that impaled enemies to the walls. oh, and its co-op. also free to play. warframe is awesome. try it. now.",1
"fun to play. i really enjoy the level of customization to your character and the weapons you can carry. easy enough for a new player to learn the basics, but complex enough for the seasoned gamer.",1
"space ninjas. why are you still reading this? go play it. nao.",3
"space ninjas with guns and powers? why have you not downloaded it yet?!",5
"started playing warframe before i heard of steam, a lot has changed since then, but in a good way! with every release there is more and more fun to have, and many styles to play, from taking mass damage, to dealing mass damage, or sneaking your way assassinating enemies as you go, or not touching a single one if you want! and with the massive amounts of mods, combinations are almost limitless!",7
"sceptical at first being free to play but all in all very impressed with it. hours of fun to be hard and a perfect difficulty level to enjoy. would definately reccomend to anyone else.",1
"love the fast paced tps action. a little grind heavy but you never realy realize youre grinding as youre carving through enemies like a hot knife through butter.",1
"love this game. good mechanics good graphics and a good interface keep up the good work!",1
"i am very suprised that this was free. this game is super fun. it has everything you could want in a game.",1
"fun game that melds mass effect 3 multiplayer with diablo style dungeon crawling. easy to pick up, and even easier to get addicted. this game really shines when you can play with friends - as it is all about cooperative play.",1
"first time playing this, i was very impressed. great free to play shooter!",1
"this one of my top 10 best games ive ever play i highly recommend others to play this you will have so much fun like i have so enjoy the game",1
"fantasticly epic, visuals are amasing and the gameplay never gets old for me.",6
"this game has been improving and adding new content since its release. metacritic needs to update their reviews (though they never do, and thats sad). anyway, the game is worth it if youre interested in a squad-based pve game where you do objectives, blow things up, kill badguys, farm materials to make almost everything in the game (or buy it with money converted to platinum if youre rich), and generally just have fun. its a third person, space ninja game. it can be a lot of fun if you are playing with a group of friends, or it can just be a little fun and something to pass time with if youre playing solo. 10/10 visuals. 8/10 gameplay. 8/10 sounds and music. 8.5/10 overall.",3
"do you want to feel like a ninja? do you like sledding and teamwork with no pay to win? then this is the game for you! also katanas es",1
"its not that bad of a game. best played with friends however.",4
"great singleplayer and co-op, with stunning visuals. game runs nicely, with no faults (noticed). 10/10",1
"warframe is one of the best games i have ever played hands-down. the game is gorgeous, the gameplay gets you addicted in the first hour, and the storyline keeps you guessing. this game is not pay-to-win. you can craft any gun or tenno in the game without paying real currency. tons of mods to custimize the gameplay to your preference. 10/10 download the game while you have the chance! fyi: to those of you who do not have an intel core i5 or higher, and a graphics card equal to or above the nvidia geforce gtx 8600 series, you will experience some lag, and rendering will not be amazing, but the game will play. fyi 2: for those of you who have a crash report when they hit the play button on the game, please read on! when you launch the game from steam, and the launcher pops up, go to the little gear in the top right hand corner. ( directly to the left of the minimization button.) click on it, and a window with a set of check boxes should pop up. uncheck directx10 and directx 11. click ok or save and click the play button again. the game should launch normally. hope this helps!",1
"10 out of 10 would waste my life again. if you get bored with warframes pve plz go try out conclave(pvp)",10
"warframe is simply one of the best games i have ever played. i dont know what else to say. there are always new things to learn about the universe and new items and mods (upgrades) to strive for! the devs update the game at least once a week, but on average there are two or three updates per week that add new content, bug fixes and adjustment. this game has a very shallow learning curve and is easy to get into, then the challenge is always great! 730 hours in and i only took two breaks from warframe that only lasted about a week each. not even starting to get bored of it yet! i love warframe and best of all: everything in it can be gotten with not a single payment . this is not pay to win, but the option to pay is always present as a time-saver.",10
"this free game is probs the best ive seen in a long time!",1
"pretty laggy. i have a laptop that is 4gb of ram... but still amazing game",1
"warframe is a great game and and id rather die than not play it. if my mum were to take away my pc i would kill myself.",2
"i started game and it was loading to checking for new contact and keep runing.... why?",1
"so im nearing 600 hours on warframe and i dont regret a minute, this game is insane fun with friends and is also playable solo. the community is kind and usually you can trust them. 9/10",6
"sweet graphics,awesome gameplay..what can i say u spend ur hours grinding without noticing how time flew by just to get the item u want to stay in the competition...slots are also hard to get so be sure to use ur plats carefully",5
"i want to play it because it is awesome. but since i cleaned my computer, i cannnot open the internet to create a new account. also, it freezes when i try to do a mission. still good. :)",1
"played baseball with a hammer as a baseball bat and enemies as the ball. 10/10. also, constant updates.",3
"very fast paced fun. lots of ways you can play this game. can be a bit grindy but the combat is satisfying",4
"fun, with a but. for the hack-n-slash types out there, this game is for you. get yourself a rhino warframe and have at it. for the stealthy, sneaky assassin types out there, this is also for you. get yourself a ash warframe and go nuts. basically, this game is faultless...except, there are major faults in the game. you are thrown into a game that tells you the basics of how the game works, but with no actual help along the way. unless you have someone in the game already, who knows what to do and how to use certain mods, also gives you certain mods and helps you level up quickly, this game will tear you up. proceed wih caution ninjas.",1
"amazingly addictive, dont play if you dont have time, takes alot of time to grind for new waepons heaps of fun",3
"good customization options. however, it is a pain to grind for mods and warframe and weapon slots should be free.",8
"lots of weapons to choose from and has different playing styles to experiment with. makes you play for hours and hours.",2
"you are a motherflipping space ninja!!! thats enough of a reason.",6
"this game is amazing i had it on my other computer my current one cannot run it but my last one did so i have to say yep its worth the download. 8/10",1
"awesome game, this is pure grinding but very very fun grinding. focus on the journey, not the destination , in my opinion warframe is all about that!",1
"this game....100+ hours and counting. best free game i have ever played, hands down. they did a great job with it, and it has gotten nothing but better with every update. 9.5/10",3
"everything in this game is just awesome... im still green but thos platinum sure can get me annoyed",1
"great free to play game if u wanna start pc gaming :)",1
"awesome game for free, make sure you get your mates involved!",1
"very good co-op fps. very good graphics, great gameplay, very good mechanics. recommended!",1
"with the new damage system warframe just keeps getting more and more interesting. its engaging, easy to learn and hard to master, plus completely free - absolutely no gameplay advantages if you dont shell out real money. highly recommend this game!",2
"in this game you are a space robot ninja who grinds for items and does cool  like stabbing people with swords, using special powers to kill people in flashy ways, shoot people and run like a  .",1
"warframe is an awesome game! it feels awesome to roll and slide around while slicing bad guys to bits! and plus you can enjoy it with co-op as well. my only complaint is that new weapons cost alot and if there is one you really want youll likely have to fork over some real money. but of course, the devs have to make money somehow. try it, youll love it.",1
"this game is pretty cool and is great if you have the computer power to play it",1
"this is a fun game and i would recomend it to anyone i know",5
"holy  the game is good, like if you cant be botherd earning  the hard way just spend a lil dosh and you can buy basically everything.",8
"this game is fun but it takes too long to progress and get new weapons and warframes without paying the money for platinum. the combat is fun and fast paced and is best played in co-op. it sucks that you cant reset or delete your account",1
"warframe is one of the best games i have ever played it even made it to the third most popular free game (behind team fortress 2 and dota 2) you should really play it without spoiling anything to you you will really love the game i know it just give it a chance #warframedabestgame",2
"great gameplay, the graphic totally great, especially the nvidia phyx effects! 9/10 if only we can earn the platinum for free without buying them, but oh well, at least they make some discounts up to 75% so its worth it...",2
"fun game, similar to destiny, not gameplay wise, but menu, scenery wise. for a free to play game, its a pretty fun game",1
"its really rare that a game can be a realfree to play and not pay and you will be god",1
"this game is an amazing example of how a slight remix of an idea can explode in popularity and exellent gameplay. like stealth play? go for it, theres an entire 3 characters for it an a whole array of weapons. like running and gunning? go forth and slaughter to your hearts content. warframe is truly a game that shows that giving the player a large number of pointy objects and fleshy, blood filled targets can be the most fun in your life.",1
"very good addictive free to play 3rd person shooter game , play with your friends to have a lot of fun",1
"great gravy boats of justice! get this game, buy about $20 of credit the first time you get the 50% off that is all",2
"very excellent game, for those who love fps playstyle. addictive, even more fun doing co-op missions, theres even a collectible aspect. each of the frames feels unique, offering a different(though not always blatantly so) playstyle. well worth playing, even just to try it out.",1
"this game is very fun to play theres plenty of things to from survivng from a horde of waves while supplying yourself with air to customising your character and weapons.",10
"fast, action packed fun. craft weapons and warframes !",1
"this is a very nice game, played about 95 hours on it, its fun alone but when youre in a 4-man team its much more fun!",2
"this game is phenominal for free to play! definitely try it out!",7
"ok, while this is an mmo its pretty awesome so far. ive only played it for about two hours, so im way noobish - but this seems fun. kind of feels like mass effect in a way .. but with armored ninjas. which .. makes that cool. im having fun so thats a win. and its free .. which is also a win. i dont know if id be interested in any pvp (because i hate g etting owned .. all the time) but pve is always awesome.",1
"ninjas? cool. guns? cool. space? cool. space ninjas with guns? super cool",5
"quite the entertaining game, warframe is. the way the game is made makes me come back for more. theres no real story line, and theres no real reason to play, and yet its addicting. warframe is a good grinding game where you can unlock all sorts of achievements. i would actually recommend this game to the community. even if youre not a big fan of this kind of game, its a great way to let off some steam. as a protip i feel i must add a little information about platinum. i wish i did a little research before spending mine, so ill say it here. platinum is in game currency you can buy with real world cash. you do start off with some, however. i learned while playing that you can get about 99% of everything without having to buy it, of course it will just take longer. the one thing you cant get, however, is more slots for your weapons and frames. i would recommend spending your platinum on that.",3
"warframe is a fun, action filled game. if you plan to play take time out to learn the game. it takes time to get use to the game machanics but when you do youll enjoy the game or at least be happy that it exsists.",1
"great shooter fast paced with great visual elements . needs a broader selection in map elements but an addictive game to say the least.",2
"great fun initially but gets old because you dont really have any goals to strive for.",6
"this game is amazing. i really have nothing else to say!",1
"first thing i have to say is, this game is still in beta!!! i really like this game! there is a lot of grinding, so if thats not your thing, you might not enjoy this.",2
"the game at the beginning is very slow paced and confusing. their mod system is not explained and their introduction is sort of bad. the lack of story makes the game not as compelling early on however if you do some research and stick with the game for the long run you will find it very rewarding. the gameplay and mod system and the different warframes/guns are just so fun. i have farmed every single prime weapon (the exclusive version of weapons that can only be obtained through grinding). try it out and youll find that you like it",10
"do you like space ninjas? guns? swords? epic third person action? the ability to do a ing backflip? all while grinding out weapons and upgrades through the same 6 maps in a co-op enviroment?!? cause thats this game, its pretty ok. 11/10",7
"great graphics, cool characters, and interesting gameplay mechanics. however the game gets tedious and boring after a while. 6/10",1
"warframe is a top-notch game when you consider it is a f2p title. the shooting and movement mechanics are solid, but some of the free-running elements are finicky and straight up bad imo. youd better think about which starting warframe you want too, because youre gonna be stuck with it for a long time. if you want a new warframe, its gonna take hours upon hours of grinding the same few levels to get the schematics and resources you need to build them, which can get extremely dull. id definitely reccommend playing with friends. overall, warframe has a fair share of flaws, but it is a solid f2p game and i definitely reccommend at least checking it out. 6.5/10",1
"incredible co-operation in this game,and the sword combat feels fluid.",1
"ninjas play this, if youre a ninja this is your game.",4
"pretty cool co-op game, very simular to mass effect",1
"warframe is the all-time best free-to-play game ive ever played, and probably rhe best all around pc game aswell",5
"before, indefinite yes, wouldve said yes a million times, it was a little empty yes, and gameplay was buggy, but it wasnt so complicated....now the maps not fluid or very understandable, some levels are too hard to solo if you are a solo gamer, and it can be just plain confusing... buuuut, it can still be a very good game for teams, i only say no because they ruined it for solo players",1
"i really enjoy the combat, everytime i play i learn something new or some new combo move. sure you can be the guy who sits in the back and shoots things, but you are missing a core part of the game and that involves being the matrix without bullettime. my only problem with the game is that it doesnt really explain how to play it; you just wake up, some creepy guy rubs your leg and then the game is just like now kill everyone and deflect this guys laser beams while defedning your ship and dozens of men with automatic weapons fire at you.",1
"one of the best games ive played but needs to have offline mode",1
"**be warned, warframe can be highly addictive** pros: - f2p - ninjas in space - you dont need platinum for getting the good stuff. only if you want to have all warframes/big arsenal of weapons then you might need to spend some real money. if so, wait that you get big discount as a login reward. cons: - can get repetitive - can steal quite many hours from your day, without you noticing it i cant comment how it is for beginners, for i started long time ago.. and if you are a veteran player, who got bored, give it a go! there has been a lot of changes :)",3
"lemme give ya a pros and cons list: pros: good gameplay good music nice surrounding awesome co-op mode cons: sometimes this game becomes a little pay2win most levels are a bit the same i rate it a 9.2/10 great game",1
"used teleport on an enemy. stucked in the wall. tried moving to get out of the wall. glitched and fell out of the map. died. press revive. respawned at out of the map. died again. -raged and press forfeit- my ashs true story in a nutshell. 10/10",7
"after all the changes and updates, i cant really get into it. i will go back every now and then but i cant see myself sticking with it for much longer. pros: -decent 3rd person shooter for a free to play -can be fun with friends -runs well and is well optimised -constantly being updated (also a negative) cons: -its free to wait, pay to win -the movement system can bug out badly -the guns feel more like your scratching the enemy than shooting them -late game melee isnt viable -only 2 or 3 wareframes are able to survive late game due being able to cheap the game -the ai is akin to a spud, and will run at you in lines and mostly out of cover -the updates have sucked what was fun out of the game -(constant re-balancing and changing of core mechanics, as well as adding unintuative ui changes) -useless weapons and wareframes can lead to beginner traps overall it just seems like the game is being updated over and over to force you to pay money for things, and the obsurdly ridiculous waiting times are a joke. to make and get a fully upgraded weapon that can last a while (until a rebalance) literally takes over 2 weeks. thats to get all the blueprints, grind for resources, grind for money and literally wait for it to build. or you can spend real money and get it on the spot there and then without finding the blueprints or grinding.",1
"a third person cooperative shooter with loot runs, procedurally generated levels, a ton of grinding but more content being added all the time.",1
"i think this is going to be a good game like destiny.",1
"rolled and flew through 2 floors to extraction, then got in a lobby with 5 other tenno. 10/10 ign would bang",4
"this game is so damn amazing i in love it !!! i deffinetly would reccomend it !!!!",1
"space magic, space magic, space armor and space acrobatics.",4
"a fast-paced third person shooter. game best played with friends and using team speak to communicate. playing with random people can by okay, but usually you play with guys that are just farming resources, so its rush to the end. i burned me drive for this game when it was still in beta. the game just comes down to geting resources to build new wepons and warframes, if collecting stuff is your cup of tea, go for it, if your not up to grinding for hours then it is a skip.",2
"this is a great game and you should play it. sometimes it gliches but they always do that!",1
"it really good game it hard but good experience also the cosmetic and the weapons and the enemy are epic as well so yea really nice game also the adventure is long so i recommend this game",1
"thats one of the best f2p games i have ever played. you gotta be patient if you wanna completely design your character. i would rate 8/10",1
"very fun. hard start but once you get your skills youre good to go.",2
"great game im not that good at it still fun being a ninja",3
"(this is just constructive critisim also sorry if i misspell anything) this game is in the top 3 of my pc games (#2). if there were only 3 things that i could change it would be: gerneer models (just cover there face), make it so gus do not need platnum to buy( some guns(weak ones)), and finally include it for the xbox one and ps4. this is because not everyone has a good computer(like me) and like my computer it lags a lot exspecaly online and i would buy the game the second it comes out on xbox or ps. agian i love this game and i love you guys for making it, i am just saying you can make a lot more money if it was on the computer, xbox one, and ps4. i will even buy an xbox one or ps4 if it was relesed on them and i know my friends will too. -guardian angel",1
"this game is good for the first 200 hours or so then it gets boring but every update brings something new so you play it again so i rate this game a 8.5/10 good game not enough varity to keep me playing though also lots of bugs",3
"surprisingly fun. it may seem like a farmfest at first, but once you get your first warframe after your first one and some new weapons, the game gets extremely fun and you will never get bored. there will always be new weapons and new warframes to keep ypu going. once you learn the mechanics (which is very simple), you will be jumping off walls and shooting down enemies in mid air in no time. warframe also has a great community and there is always teamwork. de (digital extremes) are always working on new content and ways to keep the game interesting and entertaining. de also posts all of their patch notes, so you are always up to date with what is going on.",6
"great ninja style game with shooting weapons, love it and recommend it to other players",1
"amazing competitive multyplayer, great game overall. but takes alot of time to get used to for players with no expeireince with these types of games.",1
"now that i have accumulated about 80 hrs on this game. it is a great game given that it is free to play. the graphics are superb. game play wise - lots of variety and many different things to do. however, there is some grinding involve. it is definitely more fun to play with other people. almost everything in game can be acquire without paying actual money other than buying slots of items. so it doesnt feel like it is a cash-to-win game. the crafting system and material gathering is like your typical rpg games, where you have to farm for materials. things to imrpove for this game would include a better interface, it might take awhile to get use to always having to close previous menus since they dont auto -close when you open something else. if youre looking for a good free to play, action rpg game, then definitely give this a try. fight on tennos!",3
"its an amazing, addictive game. lots of fun to play. highly reccommend it.",2
"been playing this for awhile and its probably the first shooter game ive ever actually enjoyed. and im an rpg person! it can get a bit grindy but you find a friend to play with and youll enjoy tromping through the planets slaying enemies. also find a good clan, it helps to keep things fresh and interesting.",9
"hm, every time i try to update the game (which is mandatory when you get it) it gets an error and tells me to restart my computer. then, when i reboot my computer, it repeats. any help? maybe it the system requirements...",1
"this supposedly is a stealth game and the only stealth weapon you get is a sword. >.>",1
"ninjas in spaaaaaaaaaace the best looking tripple a shooter on steam to date, well worth 70 dollars. but its free, what is this madness??!?!",6
"good development and updates still going on. the graphic is good. nice game",2
"ing space cowboys pew pew yippy kiyahh mother (insert derogatory word for love makeing here)",1
"pretty fun, amazing quality for a free to play game.",1
"graphics are nice, gameplay is nice but i can see its going to be a bit grindy. good if youre new to fps :)",1
"its an awsome game but could you make it available for mac?",1
"as of right now i have this game for 2 weeks and i have 30 hours on it and ive dumped way too much money into ingame currency. get this game. now.",1
"i liked it, but i dont really get it. the idea sticks, but the level design just didnt click for me. they way progression works, mixed with the fact that there are little to no people at lower (?) levels makes this game confusing. maybe im just autistic. edit: after playing for 34.8 hours (and counting) after the damage 2.0 update, i get it now! i used to play warframe before, and everything was very confusing for me. this is a rather interesting game where you have to kick  as one of 200 ninja types against robots and fleshlings.",1
"ever since the mesa update, my warframe would not allow me to join any games with other people. everytime i join a game, it tells me that the  connection to the multiplayer host has been lost. all i am able to do is play games by myself. i recommend this game to eveybody but this is the only problem.",4
"awesome game!! who havent played it yet, must try!!",2
"do not download the steam version of this game, go to warframes website and get it, save yourself alot of time. every time there is an update, or one little thing goes wrong, if you validate the files through steam, it makes you download the entire game over again, the only reason i have 35 hours into the game, is cause ive had to redownload the game once every two days. still, its a wonderful game, the only downfall is that fails keep working on steam.",1
"space ninjas! the controls are a bit awkward, some people found using a controller worked better, i remapped almost all of the keys and i still might get carpal tunnel. other than the demanding key pressing the game is a blast and very polished for ftp. there are the occasional glitches, but infrequent enough that they are a surprise.",6
"you must try this game it is one of best free to play.",1
"its the better version of destiny. all jokes aside, this is one of the best games ive played. what really sets this game apart is the flexability of each warframe (aka class/champion/specialzation) and allows a degree of customization that melts the minds of lesser primates. the beginning can slightly overwelming, as you learn how to master your equipment but the player base is always willing to help. there is not a massive pile of strategy involved; good synergy with teammates is more important and tends to be more fun. theres a lot of spaces to see, lots of enemies to trample underfoot and a whole solar system to lose yourself in. ill see you there.",9
"a great underrated game although a bit time consuming and new content is always being added. i have nothing to complain about.",2
"this game is amazing with friends. if you are thinking of playing this game do it with friends. its great! even when i get bored i still end up playing this game again....and again :d",1
"this game is freaken awsome even when it is in beta stage",1
"an interesting blend of platforming and third person shooting that is constantly evolving, thanks to an active community and a development team that communicates with said community. i look forward to seeing where its going, as well as helping it get there!",6
"its like gears of war, mass effect, vanquish, ninja gaiden and dynasty warriors all had a baby. its beautiful.",1
"i dont like concept of this game, its boring and confusing.",1
"94h of gameplay and played since closed beta or beta i think, anyway this game is a great game for people who like teamwork,tactics,parkour and making friends fast id say this is the best 2013-2014 free to play game so far, i hope you make more games warframe, amazing!",2
"firstly, this is not a p2w game like most of the f2p games out there, just pay2rush. all items can be bought with in-game currencies except cosmetics. second, it offers great graphics and even greater optimization that allows you to run the game smoothly everytime. third, lots of weapons and customizations. fourth, the developers are hardworking, expect multiple hotfixes and updates daily or weekly. if you care about the in-game and steam achievements thingy, its currently broken but who says it wont get fixed. lastly... just go and play it already!",1
"i love this game, and would reccomend it to anybody who loves violence and ninjas",6
"tons of weapons and customization, frequent update and eventfull, its like pokemon for adult.",5
"its an awesome 3rd person shooting game. add me! :3 ign: --q--leviticus",9
"its a really good free to play game. graphics are great. it doesnt really have much story to it which i wish it did. sometimes when you trying to get resources and grinding missions to get it, it can get boring at times. otherwise its fun to play with friends.",4
"minus the fact of all the hassel of creating an account and having to check for updates after downloading, the game it is a really fun game with a good campain.",1
"action packed combat. use a combonation of a primary, secondary and melee weapon to defeat enemies. different game modes lead to some rough challenges. has a survivor style play that puts you against ever increasing difficult enemies. great 4 player co-op and has ingame voip support (or use steam). the crafting system is a little weak, but it does allow you to upgrade you charactor without spending real money. items and armor level up as you use them. the interface takes a bit of getting used to, but the gameplay is well worth it. if youre reading this review give it a try.",2
"stretching the limits of the free to play genre. awesome shooter with excellent sword play. 4 out of 5",1
"its a good game but the combat does get a little repetitive",1
"great game with beautiful graphics, plus its f2p. still in beta and can use a lot of work, but it has potential and will be a really great game.",2
"this piece of s**t is better on next gen consoles.",1
"youre a ninja. in space. with superpowers. best free game ive found - put 585 hrs into it at the time of this review and just now running out of things i want to do in the game. pros: excellent parkour system, nice weapons, highly customizable character/weapon loadouts, top-notch graphics. on one level its a pretty simple kill em all style fps, but on another level youll dig into the complex mechanics of damage types and modifying gear and combining players superpowers (abilities) to complete missions. the unique abilities for each character are pretty badass. many weapons have unique mechanics, too. you can solo most of the game if you choose, but id recommend joining a clan to make things easier when you do the missions that just cant be done solo, and there are many veterans like myself around to help out newer clan members. its free-to-play, but not pay-to-win. you can literally get everything in the game without spending real money due to the trading system, but that depends on your patience with farming. cons: ive played through a few major updates and have come to the conclusion that the developers are a highly talented team of visual artists who lack the skill to fix the persistent bugs and theres nobody in the company thatll speak up and say that an idea is akin to going full . they do listen to their community and ultimately fix most of their blunders though. the game involves a lot of farming/grinding which can get tedious.",7
"was fun with a friend when i played it two years ago, although it did become very repetitive in missions and areas.",1
"i swear i thought i made a review for this already. guess not.. anyways! this gem of a f2p is the most spectacular f2ps ive played in a really long time! 10/10 - graphics 10/10 - gameplay (not pvp) 10/10 - playerbase (most people are over 14) the devs push out a lot of content on a very regular basis.",3
"9.9/10 pros: +ninjas +space +spaceninjas +good gameplay +ninjas +spaceship building +ninjas with guns +bows cons: -loader takes too long to check for updates -no water",1
"if there was a maybe option id give it that- the game is graphically pleasing, and the concept of basically being space ninjas is great, but the game falls into all the traps of the mmo genre which completely wrecks the gameplay. you will be grinding for the sake of grinding in this game, and while fun at first, it wont keep you entertained for very long unless youre okay with mmo style grind.",2
"waaaaay too much farming for items such as mods/warframes/sentinels/weapons that require you to do more cycles of repetitive gameplay.",1
"once you play it, youre hooked. even if it doesnt last forever, youll still have a blast .",3
"for a free to play game this is an amazing game. the developers really took the time to spit shine every detail. great game.",1
"overall, i find this game a lot of fun. the combat however would need somefixing, as it gets repetitive and pain stakingly boring to play this after a while. another thin that needs to be touched upon are the various bugs that are in the game. i found that my character would randomly fly off, and that the arms and weapons would get stuck in walls. but still, this game is a lot of fun! a mixture of a next-gen shooter and platform jumpper, the combo seems to fit well.",1
"best free to play game ive ever played (i dont play mobas) but for fans of shooters exspetialy gears of war this is a great game and its free but buying plat never hurt any one but be asured every frame&weapon is avalable via hard work onlything people who play gain is looks. 4.99894392442249852075620/5 stars",8
"awesome game for a f2p game. deserves more attention and should have a wider community.",1
"great game, both fun and interesting, due to the variety in missions, i believe it has a long life time.",4
"mecha ninjas in space where you grind to be more ninja-y seemingly endlessly without plot. did i mention the part where youre a mecha ninja in space?",5
"if we excluse the donation(s) its a fine game... if we include them back...  it. its a pretty good game but man... i hate the waiting times for my items and missions to be complete... but hey, its free!",1
"amazing game. lots of action, adventure and more action. very thrilling to play. the free-to-play thing kinda makes most of the better items or characters in the game harder to get because you need to buy them with in-game purchased currency or you could just try getting it over a long period of time. overall its just an amazing game but can be limiting sometimes.",5
"everything about this game is simply yes -the missions -the enimies -the crafting -the multiplayer they even do microtransacions right, its not play to play, its an option to bypass crafting the item to just get it premade this game is the life and death of me",1
"i played it and liked it or a while, the mechanics were a bit confusing and at some times doors that needed to be open would close and not allow me to progress. but other than that it was a pretty good shooter/hack and slash game.",1
"its a really entertaining system where it really rewards those who dedicate some time to it. sure, grinding is a really fundamental part of the game but it really makes time pass really quickly if youre in a competent squad or clan. get the bow though, tons of fun to use. :od",1
"the game is a massive grind, the missions seem to be copy and paste maps with similar objectives across the board on all planets. however, this doesnt mean the game isnt fun becuse its very fun, and its easy to lose hour after hour to it. striving to reach that shiny new prime weapon, and feeling so accomplished afterwards only to see something else thats shiny and grind for that as well. the devs arent greedy either, theyre very generous and kind to the fanbase, 10/10 would play.",2
"its like civ with guns: just one more mission!!",2
"this game is a fast pace all out battle but the maps lack original design. what i mean by this is that each map looks very similar to all the other maps. you really get the feel like your just in an arena. but the game play is a lot of fun and not many bugs to report about.",1
"i love this game if i hade a beter computer it would be baller",1
"great game. co-op multiplayer is extremely fun. the variety of warframes to play are extensive and unique. the weapons all seem great so far. looking forward to more and more content.",1
"do you want to play a game with space ninjas, in a third person shooter with powers? check this game out, you might just love it. pros. -fun gameplay. -satisfying melee kills, and assassinations. -unique looking warframes (characters) with unique abilities. -nice community. -loads, and loads of melee, secondary, and primary weapons (from kunai, to pistols, rifles to bows, and daggers to greataxes/hammers/swords!) cons. -can get repetitive. -lengthy crafting time. -prices for buying stuff with platinum can be a bit high. ive been playing this game since closed beta, with over 50+ hours on my account, and only 18 hours on steam. this game is great, i highly recommend playing with friends, since it makes the experience much more better than it would be when playing alone.",2
"kinda like power rangers, but 5,000,000,000,000 times more badass. like cleaving enemies in half with your space katana, running up walls, and flying ninja kick badass. oh, and its completely free :d",5
"i was grinding until i got bored to grind i dont know if i pick pos or neg since i played 160 hours i guess its pos",2
"the only reason i can grind for hours on end is excals booty. 69/10",5
"whats up with this has not yet been activated crap.ive seen people play it and its awesome.so i downloaded it and it says not yet been activated.plz gimmie advice on how to do dis.good.",1
"its a good game, but expensive if you want platinum.",1
"the best game i have played in a looonnggg time. amazing gameplay, awesome graphics, and a hell-load of ninja awesomeness! download this game right now and you will have an awesome time. its an friggin awesome game!!!",1
"this is an exciting, fast paced, third-person, game that will keep your hairs standing high! it involves gymnastic kills and (such as jumping high into the air and then slamming down into the ground at your enemy) quick kills. (such as charging at the target, which stuns them then slice or shoot them to their inevitable death.) its great because it gives long-ranged, and close-ranged players a exciting action packed game. i highly suggest downloading and installing it if you like third-person ninja fighting with guns! and bows! and so much more! (it states your a ninja and you really are like you can wall run and sprint really fast and jump high but you dont know any actual martial arts.)",1
"its an action oriented hack and slash rpg mmo, featuring ninjas in powered armor doing parkour. if you arent sold yet on that alone well.......its not bad when it comes to grinding items, and even when you do, it doesnt feel like work because of the pace and intensity of the game. so far its one of the kinder communitys i have encountered in an mmo. give it a shot, its free and its fun.",7
"the game is very fun, with great gameplay, a interesting story and you do feel like a ancient powerful warrior striking down his foes. plus its a four player co-op game which makes it even more enjoyable.",3
"best interactive third person shooter i have ever played. running adn jumping on and across walls, and the huge assortment of weapons and warframes is amazing. each warframe fits a different person all you need to do is figure out witch one fits you the best then youre unstoppable against any enemy thrown at you whether its grineer, corpus, or the infested.",1
"very fun, even more fun with friends. there is always a goal in that game from building a weapon or a warframe, or trying defeat a boss it will always entertain you.",9
"warframe is like an updated version of river city ransom. you go around fighting other gangs and upgrading your moves and equipment along the way. basically everything but some cosmetics can be acquired totally free. the one thing that may slow you down in the free department and have you drop some cash are inventory slots if you want to keep your weapons and warframes. but slots are cheap so dropping as little as 5 dollars can give you a few months of play time before thinking about dropping another fiver.",1
"warframe is a game unlike any other. it mixes rpg elements with 3rd person action. this game streamlines movement with melee and ranged attacks like no game before it. the best part to all of this is that this game is free to play. you can aquire nearly everything through gameplay. spending money only speeds up the process of accumulating warframes and weapons. if you like this game, i reccomend supporting them by purchasing some platinum because these guys keep working on this game, always releasing groundbreaking updates. looking for something unique and fun? just give warframe a try and i promise you will appreciate it.",3
"you need to play this game! its halo meets gears of war meets dead space. i love that crap out of this. sooo fun.",1
"you need to play this game! its halo meets gears of war meets dead space. i love that crap out of this. sooo fun.",1
"addictive, grindy, streamlined and cool. not something you can do obsessively, but fun nonetheless.",2
"warframe is a great f2p game. i first played when it had update 4 or 5, and now update 11. i have 492 hrs on record, and i have to say its a very addicting game. the devs have come along way since update 4. they made lots of improvements based on what players think of the game. love it.",7
"warframe is fantastic, even more so when you take into account the fact its a) ftp and b) still in active (open) beta. the graphics, interface, gameplay, lore, and community are growing and developing day by day into something outstanding, and if its this good already, i cant wait to see what the finished product will be like. as a pve, coop game, the vast majority of the in-game community is helpful and amiable to newcomers, making getting on your feet much less daunting than it could otherwise be.",2
"quite an indepth game, can get everything you can buy by farming but it will take you years so worth a couple bucks here and there. fairly unique game concept with the hack and slash feel with the common run and gun and some magical powers thrown in for good measure. graphics are great and coustomer service is good. just make sure you have good internet lag is a pain and its way more fun to play with people.",8
"amazing as it may sound, this game is better than many many other retail titles in so many many ways. graphics, mechanics, cool ninja moves, stealth action and high customization are just the tip of the iceberg, as the cooperative play is teh real blast you can get from warframe. playing coop will make your enemies tougher, and theyll use attacks that will require your companions to free or wake you up to not get owned. a simple and not too various (were still in the beta section though) ai director changes the structure of the levels every time you play them, taking away the predictability of enemy positions. same goes for loots and treasure chests. a real great game, for no price: its christmas early this year buddies, enjoy!",2
"its a fantastic next-gen free to play game. the micro-transactions arent anybodies cup of tea but premium items dont get in the way of pure skill at the end of the day. its multiplayer only for now but single player looks promising, the co-op aspect of this game is great with a mix between racing too the finish and helping teammates destroy enemies or claim objectives. no pvp yet but a not so popular duel-mode is currently in place. the mission layout is expansive and pretty good to navigate through and the graphics are a treat.",1
"almost same map,same enemy,same missions.annoying shiny flash visual effect kills my eyes.class,skill system is not so mach fun cause almost anything is same.you need so many time to get weapons ,money,exp but not worth.and enemy has bunny ears.bunny ears.",5
"such a ka game! i love the atmosphere and the fighting but mainly team work!",1
"probably the best free to play game out there. the fast paced action is amazing!",1
"this game is awesome. best free to play game. forget metal gear rising. this game is awesome for hack and slash. and the shooting is also great. best free game out there. i am also getting the ps4 version. with that said. the pc version works great with xbox 360 controller. the start menu, like briefing doesnt work that great with controller, but the main menu, and in game, work great with controller, just the like minute of like mission briefing, you have to use mouse, which is a minor complaint, but apart from that the game works 99 percent on xbox 360 controller,",1
"this is an awesome especially because it is free. you can really find no better deal than this game if you like third person shooters.",3
"if cod and uncharted had a baby, it definitley wouldnt be this.",2
"this game is probably one of the most satisfying gaming experiences ever. with this game, you have the ability to earn/or build pretty much everything. weapons, frames, skins...you can play this game and not have to pay a cent and have some of the most powerful items in the game. i find that earning all of the materials to build your equipment is extremely satisfying. combine this with the extreme replayability and you have one of the best games that could hit the market. i will recommend this game 100% to everyone who asks me about it. good job de, you have made a jewel!",4
"only about 30 hours in and already i can see the future: im gonna lose my job.",1
"this game is awesome i wish that the company who makes this will make warframe first person and i love the graphics and every thing for this game",1
"this is a very good game, though it wont recongise my consle controler, its still a very good and well desined game.",2
"cant even play it so why download it, it was a waste of time.",1
"if have to rate this out of 10, ill rate it 10000/10. creative, ultra graphics, and its probably the best co-op game ive ever played.",1
"amazing game and free to play.... doesnt get any better",1
"great game, but i dont like this game update because its so huge.",1
"this is my favorite 3rd person shooter of all time. it is the most epic game i have played yet",1
"played it for 333 hours and the best thing about it is that its free to play.",4
"warframe is one of the most in depth f2p games ive ever played. i have put many hours into the game without spending a cent and look forward to more. the game has solid mechanics and the actions is very good. the game can be slightly grindy when you first start out but collecting all of the different weapons and warframes is part of the fun.",3
"ninjas play free, and space ninjas kill corpus........ play this game.",5
"an amazing third person shooter, free, and you can get just about anything in game without having to use your hard earned money.",2
"very fun and great mission system overall a great game really worth getting...",1
"the game is repetitive in its level design and missions, but its constantly updated with new content. the biggest draw for me was the fluidity of the shooting, platforming, melee combat, using the powerups... it feels smooth and very fun. especialy when youre playing with a friend using a mic, then youll have tons of fun. additionaly the game is absolutely beautiful with its use of colour, its lighting and shadow effects, which is even more amazing considering it runs smooth on my low-spec pc.",1
"easily one of the best action games ive ever played, with loads of different ways to play and choices of weapons and how you can customize them, ive enjoyed it so much that even though its free to play ive spent a decent amount of money on it and i dont regret a single cent. well worth every second of playing time in my opinion, a must play.",10
"fantastic game, especially seeing as its free. however, if you want the best stuff, you have to pay for it - and its not too cheap. if you really enjoy the game though, its definitely worth putting in a little bit, after all, they need the money. my main problem with it is that it just loves to crash; especially when you get a message on skype or steam or anything along those lines. overall, a bit faulty but well worth it.",1
"oh my god, this game. this game. warframe is a game about the tenno/warframes, a bunch of guys in oddly-designed space outfits. theyre ninjas. in space. if you dont think thats awesome already, theres no hope for you. also, you can be a space ninja with a flamethrower. and a battleaxe. and dual revolvers. and you can run up a wall, backflip off it into a s face and cut said  in half. 10/10 would farm orokin cells.",3
"killer free to play game, lots a weapons with different characteristics and a constant stream of new missions, level additions, weapons, and warframes. not the most complicated game but plenty to learn and master.",8
"great game! i dont understand the low meta critic! its much better than that! it deserves a good 80s. with more content and more balancing it could be really great!",6
"a very great game, nice graphics, alot of customization, but platinum is quite costly and sometime has bugs but can be excused since its still in beta",2
"has definitely gotten much better since early beta. no more bland corridor shooter over and over. definitely worth a look, still waiting to see the pay wall.",5
"ahhh warframe. what a excellent game, in my opinion at least. the graphics, are qutie refined, the gameplay, entertaining, the story, a little lacking. yet in all honesty i just want to tank through as many enmies as i can with my rihno warframe, smashing them down like they are nothing. but thats just me, in warframe there is many different ways you can fight, anything that suits your paticular style. yet really, in this game you need to play it to understand, so get out there and kick some corpus butt my friends.",1
"this game is fantastic, gets a little repetitive at times but with all the new content you always have something to do",9
"this game in one word is addicting. very addicting. i started playing it and they i eventually found it hard to stop, in fact the only reason i took a break is because i was tired. this game is an mmorpg that you do not want to pass up. especially since it is free! in this game you can purchase things in game so that you have the tools you need to be the best tenno that you can be. the first couple missions warm you up and tap into that killer that lies dormant inside of you. you progress and as you progress you can purchase new things and become a better tenno. all in all i think this game is great and i have not even finished it yet. i liked this game and i think most people would too, so just give it a try and who knows maybe you will like it. i give it a big thumbs up and a huge five out of five stars.",1
"warframe is a fun yet not entirely filling game. you play as a tenno an alien space ninja being that has to grind through levels with one to three other players obtaining items to build other warframes or other items like weapons or small minions. the game does look very impressive for a free to play title and level desighn from what i have seen is very captivating but with one flaw its repetitive you will find yourself in the same level more than once and after a while this becomes bothersome thanks to the nearly endless pattern of obtaining items to build better gear. in conclusion warframe is a fun fast paced third person shooter that is a nice addition to any game library",1
"this is a fast and awesome game. gameplay is fluent and entertaining. worth your time and its free-to-play. give it a try!",5
"if you think this game is lame, think again! 1. robot ninjas 2. cutting guys in half 3. super cool upgrades 4 .awesome ninjas 69. cool co-op",1
"oh war frame.. we could have been good for eachother, whyd you have to go and be such a brutally unplayable bag of  tacos.. i could have even payed to play.. but you were too much of a stick n the mud.. so i leave you on the road to hitch hike .. this dates over..",1
"the gameplay is fun but there is a ton of things the devs need to work on. you dont play with ps4 players as far as i know either. the grind is also really annoying and if you hate grinding youre better off just spending 60 dollars on the game and unlocking a bunch of things.",1
"its kinda grindy, the controls kinda wonky, multiplayer squad play leaves much to be desired, the damage system is complicated, and everything becomes kinda of samey. its an amazing and beautiful concept that i would recommend to play for a few good months, but it gets boring fast.",3
"this is a very, very good game; for a free-to-play third person shooter, it blows away any and all competition, and you dont have to pay a cent to get powerful. its smooth, sleek, looks great on pc. its intense, action packed; you will hardly have a dull moment. and its only in beta. i want to see how this game plays out as a full-fledged platform for free action; it has my attention in all earnesty.",4
"amazing free 2 play ! you dont neet to pay for win and regularly updated ;)",1
"its fun if you like ninjas, space, or anything involved with this game really.",1
"amazing grinding game. not meant for those who hate grinding",1
"great dev team upgrading and developing the game on weekly basis",5
"amazing! almost everytime i play it seams like theres more and more content ive discovered. and every time you try something new either it be a gun or new warframe it changes the game play, and thats what makes it from going stale.",1
"very fun and fast paced. can sometimes use a better host selection process, but great fun and free!",1
"warframe is awesome. you can totally play it for free, and it supports whatever hack and slash/shooter style you want. you can be a tank, a stealth ninja, or a sniper. theres a huge supply of new weapons, and warframes all the time, and it has a decent storyline.",1
"its not a bad game, but doesnt feel like it has too much in the way of depth. good game to kill time, and you cant beat free.",1
"i think this game is a very good and fast game. the characters look a bit weird but i think its not so hindered the gameplay. a lot of stuff you can craft given it a lot. that is megbirsz get almost everything so quickly and easily you can acquire stuff. continuous updates are what make the game more enjoyable. i can recommend it.",1
"this game provides everything that i needed to really get into computer gaming.",1
"you have to grind for days just to get a new character 9/11",2
"you are an exoskeleton wearing, gun toting, space ninja with memory problems and awesome powers. do i really need to tell you much more? the game play is fast and fun. devastation is the name of the game as you turn enemies into piles of dust with a lightning gun, piles of shreaded beef with some claws, punch through them with a laser cannon, or even nail them to the wall with a bow (and hilariously break physics sometimes when you do) the powers of the warframes give you many tactical ways of playing. do you use the power of electricity with volt and fry enemies with lightning or do you take a rhino and laugh as they franticly try to take you down as you walk through the horde unfazed by gunfire due to your iron skin ability? maybe you like to take a steathy or fast aproach and choose the ash where you can blink behind enemies to finish them off and slice up an entire room with the push of a button using blade storm. in the end, its up to you. battle well, and win often",4
"warframe is 10/10 it has a very slow start with a lot of grinding but once you get some stuff it is amazing",3
"great game, i play it all the time with my friends!",2
"stole my life, killed my dog, got rid of my money, gave me butt cancer. 10/10 will keep playing",5
"i first started playing this game long ago in early 2013 when there was less content. i palyed for a week, then quit and returned in 2014. the game features a refreshing combat system in comparison to other modern shooters, featuring fast paced shooting and melee, filled with varying characters that compliment different playing styles. overall, the game can be tedious due to the amount of grinding and dedication it takes to really achieve something, but it feels amazing once you accomplish it. however, meet the right friends, and you can get into advanced missions and make gainzz at an astonishing rate! tip: make many friends! 10/10",2
"get this game its ninjas in spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace",1
"seems great the first 10 hours , but after youre starting to realise that its a game about farming. i hate farming , especially when the gameplay is pretty repetitive . even if theres a lot of mission type its still feels the same.",1
"one of the best f2p ive played. absolutely stunning. perfect intro campaign to develop background information and test your skills.",1
"amaze game. just wish equipment was eaiser to get without paying the game tons of cash!!!!!!!!!!! 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10",1
"good graphic,awesome game play,different warframe to fit your play style...the best free to play game ever",2
"this is potentialy the best free-to-play games out there at this current time.... it has a rather interesting mix of themes that wouldnt usually match, but in this they do. i play this regularly with friends and will continue to do so. parkour, ninjas, aliens, robots, just perfection. 8/10",1
"it is a alright game if you are ok with the repetetive farming",1
"its a bit hard on solo but when coop its a bit easy when you stick together and farming makes it even harder to get items",1
"your common p2w with a twist, it has space ninja shooting role based characters! with them, you can do anything! as long as its the same thing for about 2 years... play if you have nothing else to do (also comes with so much blur youll throw up!) 4.5/10",5
"this game is really amazing and the size is very little for game like this",1
"love this game! if you like games where you get to kill tons of enemies, try different builds, and mess around with your buddies, then give this game a shot! it takes time, but everything can be done without paying a dime (if you need to save!).",6
"ive played tons of f2p games over the years and while warframe isnt my normal mmo (i usually play rpg games) i have to say its definitely a game that constantly surprises and impresses me. ill admit i dont play it very often and ill get bored and quit for a bit, but each time i come back there is always something new and friggin awesome! digital extremes....you guys are top notch, keep it going :)",5
"a very fun and very stylish game w i would very much reccomend this game",1
"it looks awesome but i have a bug to it. everytime i start it the game freezes and it crashes but i would wanna play it very bad",1
"amazing game dont like that i uninstalled then reinstalled adn lost my save files due to update",1
"warframe is awesome it is definetly something that i would recomend",1
"quite good. i like and enjoy grinding as it hardly gets tiring and most of the time has you being forced to interact with other players. nice visual design too, but i think limbo with the top hat... i think thats going to far.",1
"you new update cause me to crash 10 times and i cant play",1
"probably the best free to play game ive seen on here in a long time. definitely worth giving a try.",1
"this is probably one of the best sci-fi games i have played to date i would reccomend everyone to get it and start playing right now!! the graphics are stunning, the gameplay is smooth, and the options for your warframe and weapons are awsome!! i can now uninstall all other games and become a dedicated warframe addict!",3
"my brah brah its good. not amazing but good ma brah brah",1
"free-to-play. good simple fun. would play again/10",5
"its awesome! and free! i highly recommend this game! did i mension its free?",1
"i was skeptical about playing ths game at first seeing as i dont normally get in to the whole mmo/ pay to play scene. but this game is awesome. i now have almost 8hrs logged into this game and only been playing since yesterday. even though yu hav to pay real money for the most important in-game currency, you still earn credits that can be spent towards upgrading your character when it comes to there power, health and shields. i also really enjoy fusing and uprgrading the mods in this game which are ued toward you characters abilities. overall this game is def worth it! try it out especially if you like ninja or just fast paced 3rd person shooters.",1
"hard game but very fun requires lots of hand eye condirnation fast action",1
"this game is amazing!!!they should make a warframe 2 or something like that.",1
"wow, i would never think a free to play game could be this good! amazing. 10/10",1
"awesome game! nothing else can resume what this game is, simply awesome. i have played this for 200+ hours already and it is simply awesome. and best of all, its a game where you can trully play free without being hindered in any way. sure, you will not get some things quite as easily, but you can still get them if you try. this game has action, speed, powers, awesome guns, ninjas, swords, axes, daggers, all the awesome things you expect from a tps (third-person shooter) sci-fi game. surely, it can get a bit repetitive if you only play missions, however, now they have installed a brand new pvp system, so, as some would say, pvp matches are never the same. with that in mind, we could say that this game lasts forever!",1
"if you love parkour and fast pase third person shooters then this is the game for you.the game is limated at this time 12/30/13 but look forward to dlc and upadates. even though this game is free the coolest wepons must be payed for with real money.",1
"awesome. if you like stealth and shoot em up games, you need to try this.",1
"much fun very play grinding is actually entertaining in this game because i have fun brutally slaughtering things and theres a decent challenge there too.",3
"whats not to like i mean youre basically a space ninja with guns and super powers. theres a wide variety of warframes to suit any kind of game play ranging from stealth to full on guns a blazing. you do start out relatively slow choosing from 3 warframes that arent exactly exciting but getting better more powerful equips is part of the fun. just try it out...its free and you get to play as a freaking ninja. nuff said.",1
"this game is rly good game it can be on controller",2
"this game is a very fun. tem based game. i enjoyed the hell out of it. i recommened it to all types of players",1
"great game been playing it for awhile and still playing it today. nice community setting except for the ingame communication system. that needs some work on but still awesome game.",7
"it is fun to play and the warframes look awesome! the boss battle for me is currently not too hard since i just started playing. it can be played with friends or solo so that is what i like about it!",1
"first week: its ok second week: cool game third week: wow, great game fourth week: 300 hours? this cant be right! fifth week: 430 hours, i have a problem...",4
"they should add skateboards for all the grinding you do",4
"pros: graphics gameplay controls story voice acting mixture of shooting and melee combat feeling badass flipping off walls and chopping dudes up cons: not enough hours in the day to play might destroy relationship/marriage could cause loss of feeling in  might cause loss of friends 10/10",1
"i bought a space gun using my space money, i used said gun on space zombies, i casted space magic on said space zombies, then i space ninjad my way to the space boss, where i used my space parkour and my space sword to space kill him, i then returned to my space ship were i rubbed the space belly of my space dog. today was a good day.",4

"its a great si-fi game with stuning graphics and great gameplay. check it out!",1
"strangely amazing. really suprised me, especially the fair f2p stuff.",1
"it is a solid game that is fun to play with friends",1
"an enjoyable games. somewhere between pso and unreal tournament. nice graphics and free to play. 8.5/10",1
"its a great game. not too easy, but also not too hard. its a simple and not complicated game. you go in missions, kill, loot, upgrade and tune your warframe. if you dont want an over complicated system of tuning, fun with friends and a great shooter with some melee counter-part, warframe is exactly that.",1
"i have seen this game grow into what used to be one ship that was randomly generated, to multiple areas with alot more random generation, lots of new weapons, warframes, and cosmetics, (most) that dont require spending money. this game is seriously what f2p should be. i would highly recommend for anyone looking for a fun, quick, and action packed game. pros, cons: -pros- *amazing graphics *very optimized *lots of warframe, weapon, sentinel, kubrow, and more, customization *dont have to spend a penny on this game *very very very friendly devs *very friendly community that will help you if your stuck on something. -cons- *not really a con for me but, grinding with be pretty common in this game. *rng is.... ehhh.... so thats my personal review for this game. yes i know its not that great. i heavily recommend this game. what are you waiting for? go and be a space ninja!!!",4
"great game pick it up and play with the cool community.",1
"4 words: space ninjas with guns. on a more serious note: a bit pay to win, while possible to grind items and credits you usually have to do a lot of it to really get the cool stuff... a lot of things are also nearly impossible to get without the use of real money... but if you want a game where you run, jump, gun and slash your way through different types of enemies in all kinds of gory ways, then go for it!",1
"only game i play and the amoun tof money i put into it could buy me 50 aaa games best game ever!!!!!!",4
"is good to entertain, very long gameplay (really no ending) and after each update it gets better is a on-going ride, a free ride and that is all what matter.",1
"very good game, a little disorientating when you start playing, but when you get a hang on it you wont stop playing. wide range of weapons/modifications",1
"im realy enjoying playing with my friends. not your typical mmo and i like it that way!",2
"one of the best co-operative third person shooters ive played. amazing graphics and animation, and the controls are easy to learn.",1
"i love this game. especially with the new archwings, this game is fact-paced and fun to play. pumping a couple dollars into the game helps you move along faster, but this game is definitley not pay-2-win, and you can play the full game comepletey free. this game does get repetitive, so i would reccomend playing maybe a couple times a week.",2
"warframe is extremely fun to play with friends and its challenging at times giving people a goal to shoot for. i think its a very well designed weapon and warframe crafting system aswell, though farming some parts for specific weapons and primes can get a bit (insanely) repetetive. great systems of trading parts for other parts with other players etc, though a fair warning to anyone new !! the grind is real !! overall good game but can get repetetive at times. :3",4
"absolutely love this game. still, anything can be good by adding space ninjas, am i right?",4
"warframe is by far the best game i have ever played outstanding graphics and detail i would of payed 10 pound for it",1
"probably one of the best free to play titles ive ever played, everything that is not a cosmetic item is available through gameplay and the best items are only available through farming. the gameplay is fast, parkour, ninja action; with a variaty of different game modes and characters available to change your style of play. if you like sci-fi, co-op shooters, with space ninjas give warframe a try. it does have a bit of a learning curve, but general chat is pretty friendly and there are enough videos on youtube to fill you in on what you dont know.",5
"its a good game had to rebind some keys and most of my time in the game was spent yelling join my clan at random strangers",1
"parkour, ninjas, and cool powers what more could a narrator ask for? 10/10 would observe the rhino in its natural habitat.",7
"this game turned me into a farmer with a nice corn grinder as that is all",2
"amazing game, brings 3rd person shooters to a new level! lots of customization and replayability, no real storyline and better to play with friends. a viable warframe (class) for every playstyle with the ability to customize your stats with mods. would rate a solid 8.5/10",5
"pros: - unique, fresh new look into the f2p genre - amazingly easy to learn controls yet complicated at the same time - a true progression system that makes you feel like you accomplished something (mastery rank, individual rank) - variety between weapons and warframes - great supportive community - some of the best gameplay i have experienced in a f2p game to date - no bad warframes - looks beautiful, graphic and environmentally speaking cons: - becomes a grindfest early and mid game - missions are mostly all the same type of objectives and enemies - waiting times on crafting is immense - two kinds of players: super fast and super slow. ruins the game between waiting and catching up - getting new things in the begining can be super hard the game shines its brightest at mid game. or close to there anyways. its a great game. 7/10. give it a try at least.",4
"best free to play coop in steam with differrent classes and weapons in 3rd person",1
"first moments of warframe will be difficult, youll be overcome with menus, numbers, and a lack of direction. if it werent for the stellar gunplay and the smooth fast-paced combat, most new players would probably never get past the first moments. as you play and begin to wrap your mind around the features of the different warframes, weapons, and mods you notice youre starting to enjoy the game much more. then. youre addicted. working towards new frames and weapons to play with is great. finding new mods to equip your weapons with, and watching your damage soar is a great sense of accomplishment. then you wonder, with all these amazing powers, and super weapons that youve created. where is your worthy enemy? things to do, are a bit lacking after you become a super ninja killing master. nonetheless the steps getting to that point are still very fun and exciting and still worth a recommendation. from playing so far, the game is updated almost every wednesday adding bug fixes, new weapons and new gameplay content. the game is still in beta afterall...",4
"i would give this a 5/10. the gameplay is fine, combat is wholly rewarding. i understand the devs have to make money, but does the difficulty have to increase so darn quickly? one minute i was kicking grineer but, the next, getting sawed in half in no time! if any devs read this, which is unlikely, and furthermore if any devs take what i say into consideration, which is even less likely, please drop the difficulty, atleast to a very marginal degree? its free, so it will occupy some time, believe me, and the coop is amazing, but dont expect to go very far without shelling out some of the green stuff.",1
"warframe is very good game.you can shooting or use your melee attack in this game. 8 out of 10 for this game",3
"fast paced mmo, switch between guns and cqc with easy without having to stress over complicated controls. long story and replay value at the top of its class i would recommend this to those who wish to have a fast pace game and good firefights.",1
"a really great game!!! if you download it please reffer me! you wont regret the download omg!!",2
"i recommend this game to all of you.. very beautiful looking game with easy controls..",1
"this game is becoming one of my favorites quickly. i dont play it all the time but it keeps me coming back!",2
"its grindy, but if youre into collecting things this is probably a good game for you. there is a codex that sort of works like pokemon snap, and there are lots of weapons and frames to unlock. like most pve games, once you learn the mechanics and behaviours it starts becoming dull.",5
"space ninjas, running around grabbing rescources and completing missions, for free, whats not to like? pros: -missions are good fun, repetitive, but the different environments makes them fun enough for you not to notice -wide variety of weapons, from a massive two-handed sword to a automatic rifles -fleshed out clan system, where you can build your own base with duelling arenas, research areas obstacle courses etc -combat is simple, but fun -warframes and thier powers make combat even more fun (mags upgraded pull causes her to ragdoll enemies around the target, sendng them flying, always awesome) -free-to-play -im no graphics expert, but ive always thought that this games graphics are gorgeous cons: -microtransactions, most stuff is possible for you to get, but it takes a lot of time, farming bosses, getting a new warframe will take you a very long time. -graphics may make it lag on some pcs (my friends laptop lags) in conclusion, a good game, but microtransactions let it down",2
"this game will rock anyones socks. may be a little complicated, but if you stick with it, you will be all set.",4
"one of the fairest and most kept up to date f2p games of 2013, started off pretty rough and wonky but the amount of polishing thats been put into the game made it really worthwhile and you should defninitely try it out. one of the downsides of the game? considering its a f2p game you will be slightly limited in the amount of warframes/weapons youll be able to stock up. but if you spend as much time playing (and loving) it as i did, that would just be a reason to support the developers and throw some money into upgrading your slots. major downside? the bloody chat is still pretty awful.",5
"this is a good game so far amazing graphics and all!",1
"just started playing this game about 2 weeks back and it has been a blast so far. i would go into great detail on what this game is about, but that would take too long, so here is a few words to describe it: space ninjas, guns, powers, robots, aliens, swords, lots of other cool , and...its free. what more could you want?",1
"a game about magical space ninjas, who dosent want that",1
"this game is a lot of fun when playing with friends, but alone he is boring and a lot of boring missions.",1
"guns, swords, crazy d flippin , what the hell isnt there to love about this game!?",3
"one of the best free 2 play games youll ever find its in my top 10 steam games",1
"an indie game turned tripple a - ace that may sound like a bad thing, but believe me i have nothing but praises for warframe. well i have the occasional nitpick, but every issue i have with this game is counteracted by the fact that its free 2 play. the good kind of free 2 play too none of that free 2 play but if you spend money youre better than anyone else bs. i wish there were a few more people playing pvp, but thats a personal gripe. the guns feel great, the powers feel great, and the freerunning; my god the freerunning. this game costs nothing so why are you still reading this? go install it!",1
"this game....whoooo man its great! its so addicting and fun as h***! ive blown so many hours into this game and i just cant stop! one cool thing is that if your pc is slow orrr maybe you prefer a controller.. you can play this on the ps4 for free aswell! pretty much the only thing that annoys me is that there is a currency known as platinum and the only way to get it is to spend real money on it :/ if you dont plan on spending cash on this game then you can still obtain everything but it is going to take alot of time. well that pretty much wraps up my review! i give this.... 8 out of 10 and i reccomend this to any sci-fi lover like myself",1
"a pretty damn good game for being free. grab a couple friends and go whoop some @$$!",1
"best free to play on steam in my opinion, great graphics, the levels can get repetitive, especially when youre looking for one certain material, but come on, free, easily worth playing.",1
"a fun co-op game. although a lot of aspects are pay to win, it s very satisfying to get new weapons etc, on your own.",1
"pretty good free to play game, community isnt as bad as expected combat is fluid it isnt pay 2 win in game cash is used to modify your class mods and upgrade weapons platinum is used to buy warframes (new champions) all in all i would recommend this game, for a bit of casual fun or maybe to try something new",2
"this is one of the best free-to-play games ive ever experiences. sure, it has in-app-purchases, but you can get pretty much everything with a little dedication. great gameplay, and the content continues to increase and expand!",2
"i have seen videos and played this game it is very adventurous and if you want excitement this is the game for you warning:this is a very fast thinking game",1
"do you like aliens? do you like ninjas? do you like free games? all of this is put together in one game, which is warframe. well, first off, you have to sign up to play the game, but its worth it. you start up the game, go through some stuff, blah blah blah, but then you finally get some gameplay. now before you play this game, you might want to tell some friends about the game. dont have friends? get some. why? you may ask, and ill tell you why. being a free to play game, there is a catch to it. here is the catch, hear me out... you do not want to die. you get 4 lives per day, once you run out of lives, you have to buy the lives yourself, but they refil every day. this game is really hard without friends, trust me, i tried to play it by myself, not a good idea. you go through missions with different objectives to do. a pretty good game, i would definitely recommend this game.",1
"play this game if you like cooperative shooters and/or space ninjas. do not play this game if you want to 100% it - they seem to be actively against letting you do that.",5
"an awesome game thats fun for anyone. awesome graphics and fluid gameplay i recommend this game for anyone who love co-op games or just love to shoot and slash your way through hords of enemies",3
"this is an amazing and super fun game. the graphics are cool and the game itself it fun to play. i recomend this to any shooter game lover out there, definitely worth the download wait!!",1
"some problems with connecting with friends but the game is amazing otherwise!",1
"get your ninja on, with some sick open ended battles. i recommend not standing and shooting, but get on the walls and run!",2
"its really awesome game and slices and dices which i like alot :)",1
"i literally hit a paywall. free to play my left  cheek. its only free to play if you have friends that can help you run through the hard missions early to get enough resources to start building weapons. if youre lucky. youll have to end up paying them for weapon and warframe slots unless you want hours upon hours of grinding to go to waste, so no, this isnt f2p, its pay to win, like everything else out there. as fun as this game is, youre gonna spend your life working towards a weapon that youll end up selling later anyway, so why bother? 8/10 would be so much better if there was no inventory slot paywall.",1
"great action based game. i personally wouldnt call them ninjas, but that is just me. there is little to no stealth involved. it is free to play and not even close to a pay to win. all items are either cosmetic, unnecessary, or can get made in-game (with time and patience). i like going between melee and fire arms as well as the variety they offer of each. many warframes to choose from to match your style of play too. many of the early levels can be played single player like, the others are easy to find groups for. i had so much fun playing, i put $20 into the game. much of that plat is still just sitting there, unused. all i bought was a single color pallet to make my warframe look cool.",1
"a great game especially with friends while it can get repetitive at times i would gladly have paid for this game. the developers are very active when it comes to adding new content. every time i have taken a break from the game something has been added and/or improved. unlike a lot of games with stores in them this one isnt a pay to win deal as you can get everything in the game besides colors and a few pieces that provide nothing besides a new appearance for your character by just playing.",2
"its a pretty good game for what it is. space ninjas. its a high-concept posthuman space shooter with a lot of content, even if its grindy. if you have a couple of mates to play with its not so bad, though.",1
"the game is brilliant got it to work on my laptop amzed by that because my laptop shouldnt run it",1
"you get to be a flippin space ninja samurai thing 11/10",4
"i have been playing off and on for the past year or so, and i cannot recommend this game enough. digital extremes keeps adding new content, building on old content, creating new and inventive weapons, new and inventive space ninja, just working damn hard to make this the coolest game ever made. and they are really close.",3
"free game, ninjas in space just awesome. somewhat sequel to dark sector? just play the game.",5
"at first, i was unimpressed by the unatural way the characters tended to move in the opening weeks of this game but it has grown on me quite a bit. i went from ehh, the default inventory is fine with 2 warframes and 10 weapons to gaaawd, my inventory is full with 5 warframes and 20 weapons and i still need potatoes for half of em",2
"i like it! but, it is really hard if youre going to do a solo playthrough. i hope they will change this in the future (not a chance). other than that, great gameplay, great graphics and aggressive ai (in solo :p )",1
"warframe is a new generation of shooters where you dont take in the aspect of first person. instead you take on the third person point of view which can be very different from games like call of duty, battlefield, and all of the other top games out there.being in the third person gives you a lot more awareness and ability/control over your character. you may have to use more strategy then your normal games you may or may not play, but once you learn it will be a lot of fun for you and your friends.",2
"great game for casual play. suitable for busy lifestyle players, get off work/school, hops on for hours of hackn slash and shooting with buddies. game itself has great graphic, audio and atmosphere to settle in as well monthly new content and occasion lore event that reward unique items. major upside with this game isnt pay-2-win but play-2-win, you will need to spend quite some time to choose and develop your playstyle and the arsenal you are associate with to be decent for end game contents. game is currently on beta, there are tweak and adjustment from time to time which it isnt game breaking, it is still highly enjoyable if you like a much relaxing pve style. pvp is also supported.",2
"requires some money to get platinum to buy more slots for warframes and weapons, but platinum can be aquired ingame from other players after grinding for some mods. fun game overall!",6
"very good ftp game, can get everything via ingame or go the cash store route, although nothing that you can pay cash for is overpowered vs grinding in the game",2
"please sit down and relax, this will be a very long read: this is a very good game.",4
"tried to play a mission, crashed. tried to send a bug report after the game crashed, the program to send the report crashed aswell. 10/10 would crash bandicoon again",1
"one of the best free-to-play games on steam, very good graphics, nice gameplay, awesome story (but not read by most players). tl;dr: space ninja simulator",2
"recommend this game because it is very interesting how the fighters fight and shoot their weapons at the guys! it isnt like any regular shooting game where u just shoot a gun, these guys have special abilities and also have swords instead of knifes! there are strong but slow moves and fast but weak moves! a lot of interesting attacks!",1
"this game -- what can i say? its simply (and more) amazing! the graphics looks very fine (though the game needs more ability optimize), the gameplay is smooth and great (if your computer/laptop is better than my laptop) and... its just a really great game. warframe, being a 3rd person shooter (coop/singleplayer), i thought, could never be that good of a game... or can it? well, the answer is yes, it can, and it definitely blasted through my expectations. this is a game worth playing with your friends (really, the coop experience is exhilarating to the max), and definitely a game that will last long in your/your friends book. 9.8/10, would play again... and again... and again... and again -- you get the picture. try it. its fun. what more can i say.",1
"it has ninjas jumping around in space doing cool . its also a very fun co-op experience, and because of its free to play nature its very easy to recommend.",1
"warframe is a great third person shooter and the devs are always hard at work to make it better! if you havent already i would give warframe a try.",6
"i think this game is what you humans call, radical!",1
"free shooter, fun varied weapons, fun frames, free updates often. gets a bit repetitive, but is alright in short sessions of gaming.",2
"i was loving this game when i was able to play it. until i was unreasonably banned for something i dont know as i did nothing wrong. other than that i will say it is an addicting game and is not a pay2win, but a pay2play as it does not require you to buy anything. but i have to give a bad ratingdue to being banned for no reason. if you have space and can run it get it and try it out.",1
"man this game is just mindblowing, what happern if you add ninja and space, youll get warframe, play it and belive it, its yours, tenno",1
"be ready to grind! im ready to grind. are you? its good grinding though. like the kind you would expect from a passionate woman.",1
"this game is fun and gory but you can turn off the gore",1
"this game overall is really good for a free game. you can be unique by choosing different classes and customizing your own guns and skins.",1
"hay ! i cant continue next match ... why ? my loading is ceased .. give me advice if u know about that ... thx u ..",1
"what started as an experiment into a new free-to-play game has expanded into one of my biggest addictions. warframe does what other f2p games fear to do: provide 100% of the content, in a grindable way that makes it worth your time to play. it neither takes ridiculous amounts of time to garner the things you want, nor are they set so expensively it isnt tempting to just buy everything. from tight controls that make skill matter, to delicious stats for the most mathematical of minds all the way to the constantly evolving enemies and tile sets, it will take a while to master the game. and once you feel that youre an expert, out comes another update. it seems that a constant stream of new stuff is falling out of the servers ready for you to get your ninja on. also, the developers are very keen on keeping their userbase happy, and to that end theyre constantly making tweaks and additions. the new trading system is a longstanding requested feature, dojo updates are always happening and new frames keep long time players interested. in short, you have literally nothing to lose except free time if you want to try this game and free time is overrated anyway.",3
"warframe brings forth a new light over the co-op tps concept. not only does it allow for dynamic, compelling and visually advanced pve / pvp gameplay but also there is a very well developped customization and upgrade system which, once it has been fully mastered (average learning curve of an hour following the recent rebuild of it i would say) puts players in a position where possibilities appear to be numerous if not limitless. the only flaw one should maybe point out is the lack of story-telling and background, yet and since the game still is in an open beta testing phase this could be taken care of within the next few months or so. digital extremes follow-up to 2007s dark sector has a lot to offer and there supposedly is a lot more to come. only the bravest of tennos will see the bright light of a new day shine upon the scorched galaxy!",10
"the most fps enjoyable game that ive ever played new update every month !! collect items to buy new characters, weapons, skill and upgrade your abilities. there a ton of things to do and it quite fun to see your frame getting stronger.",3
"this game, although basically requiring micro-transactions, long farming grinds, and repetitive missions, is very fun to play on your off time. i would consider this a once in a while play because of the repetitive missions. regardless of the amount of grind this game has, it has amazing graphics and very fun and engaging combat. just like vindictus, this game hosts servers on the hosts computer. this means that players in other countries or with lower quality computers will affect every players ability in combat as well as latency. players will find themselves damaging enemies 10 seconds after they hit them in certain cases, or doors will open after a delay. it almost relates to a facebook game in the fact that you only have 4 lives per day unless you pay for a life. it also has a huge micro-transaction basis and long repetitive missions. regardless of all the flaws, it is a very fun game to play as a break from your regular games. and now that it is being ported to playstation 4, we may see even more improvements to the game as well as the server hosting system.",2
"ing space ninjas. spam , buy , upgrade , and be a ninja. so dl this crap.",1
"dont listen to the haters. the grind is enjoyable and the cash shop is all about convience rather than gimping you if you dont pay. the graphics are sweet and the combat is awesome. highly recommend! bring some friends!",2
"rather unstable at the moment, but still a rather entertaining co-op third person shooter.",1
"its a great multiplayer game with cool characters.",1
"addicting and refreshing, i love when games like this instead of generic cod type of style, you should totally get this if you are in to space ninjas that are fighting for their kin, even though theres probably millions of them lol",1
"good game, lot of fun. recruiting ninjas! sign up, suit up and help me take back the solar system in warframe! click this link to sign up for this awesome free-to-play game and well both receive cool rewards!",6
"i like everything about the game warframe, theres nothing specific its a good game i love all of it!",1
"very awesome game. just requires a fast computer and good fps.",1
"really cool game love it lots. full of action and excitement, it draws you in for more and more",1
"once youve played one map, youve played them all. repetitive with little to no variation. brings nothing new to the table. i guess its good if youre 14 and havent yet played a hundred other games just like it.",1
"tired of all discusting f2p titles? heres your painkiller! yupp, this peace also have contents, that you have to buy for real money, but you can also made it without it. massive graphics, also optimized peace, it just awesome...full of gore, fully customizable char, errything can be changed around you. craftin, grindin, killin, coopin, beerin, everything in one game, in a f2p game! man, dont waste any time, grab it, play it...u gonna like it, i swear that! 99999999999/10 !",1
"im over system requirments. but out of others reviews, experiances, and a good friend of mine - he loves it. so just from per-pressure out of all good iv seen threw youtube, hosting sites, clan sites, this, and the original web site. ill have to recommend it. it looks good and the game play looks very unqiue. = lass my computer crashes to a blue screen then reboots when i tried this game... happen to me with metro: last light as well. no idea why.",1
"tried to be a ninja. dream was crused by old man 10/10",1
"i am a rank 12, in thisgame, and that is considered a low rank, the pros to this game are: its an amazing coop/solo game, very good customization with everything, at a price but its very good in a way. i want to say no, but i also want to say yes.",1
"very,very good game. some may complain about the only 4 auto revives but cmon peaople , this game is not for single player",1
"a stunningly beautiful game with unique gameplay which allows for a long-time sense of enjoyment even if you have a low attention span. this game is expertly equipped for all types of gamers. i havent had many hours in this game yet, but i am always looking forward to playing it. best of all, this game is free, so you should definitely give it a try.",1
"63 hours played after 2 weeks out... yeah... im going to have to recommend this one. a little grindy if you dont want to pay cash, but thats just how mmos are. some pvp tho i havnt played much of it yet.",6
"excellent semi-run and gun game able to play at nearly any pace. enemies can be challenging by going into harder mission areas or simple by staying within certain mission areas. everything suit, weapons, powers, account have levels and can level up differently. being able to customize the way your weapons deal damage is unique plus with the foundry to create weapons, gear, items, sentinals(pets) makes nearly everything easily accessible. alert mission every couple of minutes to hour constantly keeping something new to change pace if your stuck, community so far has been very helpful with plenty of varied support and interaction from de(creators). if your looking for something fast pace and have a penchent for causing mayhem to someone elses order then this is a great game. plus with new frames(suits) weapons, and mods being created, gui being upgraded and atleast one even every month boredom will never stay for too long.",1
"this game is easily worth your money, so it at least deserves your time.",1
"very entertaining co-op, and while still in beta, it delivers a very large amount of content. with the huge amount of customisation, both in appearances and functionality of frames and weapons, and even the ability to build something from the ground up, this game can keep you hooked for a long time. there are naturally, points in which it feels lacking for now, but digital extremes are obviously hard at work making this game better every moment they have. you can clearly see the amount of effort and love that are going into making this, and it seems that with every large update, the game just manages to become more aluring. there are quite a few approaches you can take on gameplay, especially concerning the weapons you choose. these can offer incredible diversity in playstyle, which one can further change according to their tastes, when it comes to customisation. the amount of mobility is also a great factor in this game, allowing you to perform a variety of acrobatic moves to get around, or even get the upper hand on enemies, if you know what youre doing.",5
"this is currently the best free-to-play co-op game out there and theres no reason you shouldnt try it out. a nice combination of melee and ranged fighting, interesting special abilities and parkour. its a game about space ninjas. what else would you expect?",3
"game looks great and plays well, just be warned that at time of writing a major overhaul of the damage system just went down, so theyve got kinks to work out. definitely worth your time!",6
"fun game at first but gets repetitive fast and they seem to only care about their ingame store more than fixing things and it shows. still you can get a good amount of enjoyment before you get tired of it.",1
"seems pretty generic, your basic third-person shooter, no cover, but i guess poor irish people with their whiskey-powered potato computers can run it pretty good, and its free, but as we all know, only s like  mcson(ryan gosling) play the butt-hole of games, like maybe this! i dont ing know!",1
"not sure why people hate this game and say its repetitve, but i love the  out of this :dd ! this game is easy to get into but acquiring new weapons and warframes requires patience, commitement and hardwork ! this game is free to play in mind and yes you can purchase weapons and warframes without farming the components needed to craft the items! if you enjoy 3rd person shooting games i guarentee you that you will enjoy this game, it takes a while to get into but once you dive into the game and understand mechanics, enemy types, warframe abilities its really awesome game!",2
"this is still open beta, which means there will be changes. however, that also means new content too and thats what washes the boredom away. aside from that, the sleek art design and presentation are very appealing. its a 3rd person shooting/slashing/powers and abilities sci fi game, much like the mass effect series which made me start playing in the first place.",8
"this is a very fun game with a good free to play system and considering it is free theres no reason not to give it a try, i expect you will enjoy it.",2
"warframe is a sci-fi co-op shooter, centered around our planets and the occasional moon or two. you have the standard currency and platinum. while you start out with a little platinum its diminishes quickly, forcing you to either spend hours getting the standard currency or taking out your wallet and buying platinum. now for the gameplay. its fast fluid and action packed, but dont expect to survive too long without help. the co-op makes the game a lot more fun. you could spend hours traversing the galaxy, but dont brave it alone. there are mods which you can use to give you special abilities equipping them on either yourself or your weapons. now there is a slight issue with the game i want to bring up. its blur. when moving the camera or yourself everything but the center blurs a little bit, which can be annoying at times. all in all i would say this is a great game, but has some flaws. i proudly give it a 9/10.",1
"amazing third person co-op shooter. you parkour around in futuristic robot ninja suits killing clones, robots and mutants! does it get any better than this? and you get a sword. i like swords.",3
"bear in mind that this is a free-to-play title, and even the best free-to-play business models hold micro-transactions. however, everything available through micro-transactions is also available for free, providing you are willing to invest your time. the game itself is impressively well optimised and aesthetically beautiful. i am personally impressed by the volume of content consistently being added in warframes updates. the developers seem to be putting a great deal of work into the games continued quality. fight alone effectively or creatively combine your abilities with allies; focus upgrades on gunplay, melee combat, or sci-fi superpowers! if you have spendable time, or expendable cash, test out this games features.",2
"game is having a fantastic open beta so far bin here since day 4 of closed beta the game is great joining a dojo helps u a lot with new players learning from experienced players every warframe has its strong suits none are of them are useless weapons and missions ingame are excellent as well with nvidia effects on the game looks even better",10
"i normally loathe free to play and somehow i spent 40+ hours and maybe $40 on this game and feel like every penny was worth it. a fun third person action game, set in a very unique universe with a very unique art style.",2
"awesome game. love the controls, but extremely buggy. and offers no help what so ever on how to set up your character. 4 out of 5 stars",1
"well designed graphics and character aesthetics. hack n slash with a fun melee system. there is no better feeling than connecting a charged melee attack on an enemy while sprinting.",5
"excellent co-op mmo. it has great visuals and art direction, and was what the game dark sector was supposed to be before the publisher butchered it. excellent game set in an interesting world.",1
"space ninjas. space ninjas. with powers, fo reals play dis, its free.",1
"it is an amazing game fairly unique in its genre and free to play to boot almost everything that is available in the cash-shop is attainable through playing the game itself as well",1
"keeps crashing for me i like it but i dont get to play it and it crashes",1
"not bad graphics, a little glitchy/buggy at times, but the real reason that this is a good game is that its not as pay-to-win as other free games 9/10 pretty good!",1
"im not sayin its aliens but uh... its uh... aliens",1
"very great game. ive been playing warframe for a long while now and let me tell you guys out there it just keeps getting better and better. one of the best free to play games of all time",5
"pros: awesome graphics who wouldnt even notice that? cool and many characters to be play. called tenno to be exact great overall game! cons: farming farming farming farming this is not a pay to win game which is good you need patience so farm to win lol but of course still some gamers dont want that on high level mission you need co-op players cause high level mission is  hard and you need squads or players to played with and thats take too long or hard to find, unless you have max full mod weapon and tenno then your good to go lol",1
"genius......a combination of the things i love ninjas and guns.............i later found myself scratching my neck wondering the next time i could play updated: i cant go a day without playing this game and im starting to think i have a serious problem lbvs",3
"i find that i like this game as it is one of the better ftp games such as dota 2 but i can and will say that you get what what you pay for therefore i feel as if this is a free version of destiny ... to a point. would recomend this game to one that is looking for a slight change of style. the controller surport is ... well a pain in the a** at times so i would recomend you just get used to the k&m, besides that i belive that this is a very well rounded game and would recommend it to everyone looking for a mission, enjoy.",1
"great game to play! although it sort of got repetetive.",1
"i am ninja he is ninja you are ninja too. space ninja.",1
"ive played warframe since closed beta and still have a lot of fun with it. ember is my favorite warframe...imagine futuristic space ninjas with super powers, guns, and swords. 4 player co-op cant go wrong :p",4
"one of the best coop games i have ever played and gives farming techniques a new mentality to make it less tedious. the game is continually expanding and is becomming better with every update. quite honestly may be the best game of this year due to the fact it is also free.",5
"a quick jump-in-and-play level style. unique and interesting looking characters/frames that are far enough removed from modern stereotypes and standards to be interesting and creative. the gameplay is very fun and (almost) supports several types of play. if youre playing in a pug, expect to just rush in and kill everything. but if youre playing alone, or with friends, you can stealth through the mission, sneaking up behind guys and killing them before they see you, or combining certain powers from different frames for maximum effectiveness. you can collect and equip mods which let you use one of four powers for your frames, as well as mod your weapons to have different powers and effects. you collect resources in missions that let you build new weapons that you buy the blueprints from the marketplace for, and defeating bosses or special missions gets you blueprints for frames or special weapons. theyve recently added a codex to the game which allows you to properly make a collection of every enemy type and mod so you can see more information about them and have more to work towards. the only part of this i dont understand is why platinum or buyables are so freaking expensive. it completely turns me off the concept of buying anything instead of working ingame for it because its not at all worth the amount paid. having said that, i have bought platinum, but at high discounts on various sales.",4
"one of those rare games thats based around multiplayer, but is still fun in solo mode. i think the stealth aspect would be impossible in multiplayer. fun, relatively low system requirements, f2p. whats not to like?",1
"truely a great f2p game, i swear if this game cost money they would make alot.",1
"this game is probably the best tps f2p game ive seen ever!",3
"its like co-op gunz online, decent progression. albeit still in beta: a solid game.",3
"i was an orfan of mass effect 3 multiplayer, but then i found warframe and now im a space ninja. as we all know, the purpose of the ninja is to flip out and kill people. we kill evil humans and worse things, in spaceships, asteroids and planets of the solar system, while flipping and running on walls and using some sweet armors. seriously, though, its a fun game with a cool crafting system, the best free to play ive ever seen. suit up and go slice some mooks, mate.",9
"its a great game, with stunning visuals and impressive mechanics for a ftp game, and it has an incredible amount of content. the actions like wallrunning and rolling around like a true ninja makes it feel like you are actually a warrior taking on massive amounts of enemies through superior skill and cunning. the downsides come into their own when you take a look at two things. one, the stealth aspect. its great to pull off a stealth kill, but unfortunately it most likely wont happen more than one or two times in a mission, because the enemies are always aware of where you are as soon as you have been noticed once, regardles of whether they actually saw you enter the room or not. the second part is the business model. should you happen to be a fan of incredible weaponry, prepare to pay. a lot of guns take more than $5 to unlock, which is straddling the line between microtransactions and macro transactions. despite these flaws, its still a great game, albeit a bit grindy if you do not want to pay for the weapons.",2
"a pretty nice dungeon-based system game where you run around accompanied by 3 other people and do different objectives. has rpg elemets.",4
"an amazing game free to play game. i love the gameplay style with the sword and weapons!",1
"i am very proud of where this game has gone in the past few months. it started out as a very good game, but the gameplay was repetitive due to the lackluster spaceship battles. since adding a ton of new weapons and maps/game modes, i see it as the game has come a long way. i feel that it will only get better as obt goes on.",2
"so much fun! im not even lvl 2 yet but my friends and i are already addicted! besides a few glitches, this is by far my fav. f2p game on the steam store! i love this game and am looking forward to buying it on ps4.",1
"an awesome squad bassed fps. love the weapons and the customisation with enough stuff to keep you occupied for hours.",3
"freakin awesome, horrible idea to download during finals.",7
"one of the most best tps game ever!, like much to be excalibur! xd",1
"with my previous experiance of the closed beta, the game was fun and very interesting. now getting back into it and playing it on steam it has improved overall, graphic quality, content, varity of different locations and missions.",1
"i find this game to be a solid alright its a time sink (majorly), it takes around 2-3 days to make a new warframe(new class) after collecting all the pieces. unless you pay for the warframe then you get it automatically, you may like this game if you like leveling up, playing the same maps which may get repetitive, farming. i give this game a 7/10, it is a time sink but it can get highly repetitive.",1
"this game offers a great feeling of advancement and pacing for a fan of fps games whose team death matches arent quite rewarding enough. dozens of different weapons to choose from for a solid amount of loadout cuztomization. warframes themselves each have a few unique abilities as well as varying attributes. on top of all this the game has a cuztomization system that is fairly complex yet simple enough to still enjoy. more than anything what set warframe apart at first glance was that the game truly is designed to be played both coop and solo. very few other games out there do this quite as well.",8
"awesome game very good graphics and lots of fun with friends! yes it is pay to win but its worth it and you dont have to pay to have fun and upgrade you stuff!",1
"surprisingly well made, well running, fun game. and i efen like de color. not at all the quality (or lack therof) i might have expected from a free game.",6
"at first glance this game looks like a huuuuge grind and waste of time. however once you get through the learning curve and have a better understanding of how the game works you will be amazed by how much of a depth this game has. the game still needs a proper lore and a proper story mode but i heard that it will be implented sooner or later. the best thing about this game is that almost everything is free. the only things that are not free and require real life currency are some sort of scarfs you can wear and the colors that you need for customizing your weapons and suits (warframes). the graphics are amazing and this comes from a guy who has medium-low graphic settings. the combat is really cool and at times it can get intense. the devs add more weapons of all kinds (primary,secondary,melee),more missions and new warframes very frequenly.they have also added a pvp system which doesnt get much attention these days but it still is cool to have. there are so many missions and so many weapons that once you get the hang of it you will try to literrally craft them all. all this game really needs is a true lore and end-game as well as a better tutorial so you can understand quicklier what you need to do.",3
"as stated before, warframe is at its core a simple amalgamation of mass effects combat mechanics mashed together with the old school diablo/2 loothoarding mechanics. while the reviews (metacritic included) might say otherwise, warframe is actually a damn fun game with smooth performance and great replayability behind it. another great thing about warframe is that while it is an mmo, you can actually play it singleplayer without requiring an internet connection, so you can play it even without internet. if you are a fan of fps, and especially something like mass effect, and you want something extra added on to it, warframe is definitely worth a try. also, dont be fooled about microtransactions eithereven though you might see that a lotas eventually you will gain enough resources to forge better weapons. i certainly went through this way, and the work to output to progress in this game is definitely worth the reward. (yes, i only played an hour. hah.)",1
"currently played 45 hours and have 3 characters so by no means is this an in-depth review. this is a very fun action packed game, it can keep you entertained for hours however i do want to point out that it can be a grind fest and can get very boring very quick. level can repeat constantly with the only difference is having a different objective which can make it seem like youre playing the same mission again and again, but for some reason it didnt seem to bother me too much. trying out new characters different weapon and abilities keep the game feeling fresh. level 30 is the max level, however you can use forma to upgrade your warframe and then this causes your level to drop to 0/ unranked again. doing this allows you to add higher level/ more mods which allow your warframe to become stronger, now whats the problem? well this causes you to repeat missions over and over again which wouldnt be as bad if the mission were not already a repeats of the previous mission all in all this is a very good game, however there is a lot of repetitiveness!!!",1
"if you want a game that rewards cleverness and skill, a game that allows you to take almost any appoach to solo or small team infiltration missions, allows endless possibilities for customization and allows you to create all of your equipment in a monster hunter style kill and loot style... warframe is for you. this game combines the gunplay and ability useage of mass effect 3 (minus the cover mechanic) with nearly the same wall running/climbing level navigation as assassins creed with all of the same john woo slides and dives of max payne 3. this game is simply a rush to play and rewarding to progress through.",3
"if farming materials / kicking  and looking cool while doing it is your thing, i would highly recommend warframe. :)",3
"a pretty fun game! and unlike some others say it doesnot require lots of purchases and a large grind. just bring some friends to help you out and your good to go. 2 games worth of content for gree",1
"this game has got me addicted to it off just 2 hour of gameplay, it is absolutely amazing and i reccomend this game to anyone",2
"best free to play around, with very few limitations placed on the game due to premium currency",4
"cant say i hate it. fun game overall, usual online players, but its another one of those to unlock all this game has to offer, spend cash or do  on our facebook and website page! and i am getting really tired of those games. still, its free and worth playing if you have friends or the feeling of addventure.",1
"my favorite free to play game ive came across so far",1
"the game is great and a lack of significant pvp means pay-to-win doesnt become as much of an issue. if you want to have the coolest gear you will probably end up throwing a couple dollers at the game, but you get what you pay for. make sure to read the wiki and research items before buying. getting the ultrabad gun sucks. the game is fun, and constantly improves. with no entry fee, aside from a computer that wont melt, the game is fantastic. #mylaptopisfreakingawful",2
"shoot a bunch of spooky baddies as an awesome robot space ninja thing. its alright, 10/10.",3
"this game is just fantastic:d! i recommend this one",3
"great game. i thought my computer couldnt run it but it could. and when it did it was amazing. one of the best games out there. still in beta so who knows how good its going to be in a few years? try it out. 9 out of 10 stars!",1
"dis game is aresome!! for a free play and pay to win its pretty balanced",1
"the game is amazing < and the graphix is great, i enjoying the gameplay",1
"warframe its a vere nice game it have an awesoem wepons and mods at have evere thing you need i playd it so mutch so i recommend this game go a head and download it and have a look on it guys :d --------------------------------- pros: +nice graphics +nice gameplay +beta lol +coll cntents +so many to explore ---------------------------------- bad things: -nothing bad:d lol ----------------------------------- so what are you waeting go download the f**** game lol :yoy:",6
"this game is a wonderful dicovery i found when roaming the store. this is a f2p multi-player game with beautiful art that is bit abstarct. it has a nice color palette and a nice palette of characters. the voice actors are a bit bland but it is reasonable with most being cybernetically edhanced creatures or a.i. type characters. the gameplay is wonderful and easy to pick up. the missions are mostly easy so it is quite casual. both the weapons and the classes allow for players to choose their type of gameplay. this game is nice on scales without making the small cons stick out like sore thumbs i would rate this about 87.9 in 100.",1
"awesome, f2p and not as p2w as youd expect, just a little tricky to learn, but well worth the effort and time with brilliant new updates too.",3
"this game runs flawlessly on my system and is very fun to play. i am not too good with shooters but hey, fun is fun and it is comical to watch me die! lol. i definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun shooter.",1

"awesome and fun and sick its awesome but trying to get platinum is hard but dat does nothing",1
"warframe is not one of those games that has a point. there is no real meta to it; the stuff you do when you start playing is basically the stuff youll always be doing. you kill hordes of clone nazis and evil business robots so that you can get better weapons and kill more clone nazis and evil business robots...etc. to some, that sounds boring, pointless, and a waste of time. warframe isnt for them. its for people who want to be a freaking magic space ninja and run around decimating piles of bad guys in the flashiest ways possible. ever wanted to punch the ground so hard it stops time and then pick off everyone in the surrounding area as they fall over in slo motion...with a scythe? warframe lets you do that. what about shooting things with your fiery shotgun of death wihile running on a wall and then shooting yourself off the wall to smash into anythign you hit? warframe lets you do that. lots of players focus on min-maxing and getting a perfect, synergizing mod/weapon/frame build or figuring out the most efficiant grinding farms, but i think theyre taking the game too seriously. warframe, to me, is all about flashy, insane, non-stop slaughter. 9/10 would make spaceship into floating tomb again.",2
"it is a good game with excellent dynamics with a good addition as of the middle of the battle and the mobility of the characters and do not forget about mods to all weapons and armor that makes the game more exciting",4
"cyborg space ninjas with high powered weapons and machine space familiars. if you dont think this is tight, get out of my face.",3
"fun game, easily accessible paid content for those who wish to play for it, and a blast with friends. includes voice chat in-game as well, which makes communication a breeze. a little buggy, but its to be expected from a game so varied, and they get fixed every week, if not, added new features, too. 8/10",5
"first f2p game ive played that isnt entirely about in game purchases. theres certain shortcuts or cosmetic items you can buy, but the rest of it is attainable by playing the game. theres no insane handicap (for example slower leveling) put on players and no one will have an advantage over you just because they paid. as for the gameplay itself, its crazy how you can go for melee or gunplay. theres a lot of warframes you can build (basically playable characters) with varied abilities and looks. after a while you depend heavily on farming (like any rpg) but it doesnt feel like farming at all. the number of combos, skills and weapons you can use always keep the game fresh. theres also flight combat gameplay you can unlock by doing a quest at a higher level, which i havent unlocked but really shows the ammount of depth this game has. anyway, i barrel rolled off a cliff and headhotted an enemy with my bow in mid air 10/10",3
"space ninjas in space. with guns. also theyre space ninjas. in space. and you run around all parkour, shooting and cutting up everyone you see. in space. also did i mention that youre a freakin space ninja. in space!",7
"one of the best online and co-op games im recommend this game for evryone.",4
"its still in the beta at the moment so theres the occaisonal bug. despite this warframe is one of the best f2p games out there with solid game mechanics a smooth leveling system the more you use somthing the better it gets allowing you to upgrade it with more mods. as well as the fact it is a true free game meaning you can get all the equipment (guns, melee, and warframes) as long as your willing to work for it using there forge system. the forge system basically allows you to purchase blueprints with in game money then use those blueprints to build the object while this is time consuming the game is incredibly fun. my only complaint is that theres hardly a storyline even with this plemish the game is excellent. so if you enjoy cooperative games this is a must have.",1
"excellent game with good advancement and an immersive (if mysterious) plot. enjoyable combat mechanic with varied enemies, environments and modular special abilities to employ.",4
"best game ive ever played and best of all its freeeeeee ;)",1
"i played this game from seing footage but i never thought id enjoy it this much, sure there pay 2 win aspects are there but with whats avalible to you thats free and a grind you can do quiet a bit. i play as a gun wielding ninja but my style i rush and chop people into pieces i can traverse the enviroment wall running jumping off high ledges making all sorts of fancy moves (in my style of play). there cuztomizeable abillites to change that to use all sorts of power or buffs and its all pve. give it a go!",1
"the graphics are great, it has physx support, its free! what else do you want?",1
"apart from tf2, warframe is easily the most polished, entertaining free-to-play game on steam. this game is extremely addicting and succeeds where many other games have failed. it outdoes brink in incorporating usable, parkour-like mobility into a shooter. it outdoes planetside 2 in making it feasible for the player to learn game mechanics from experimentation. it outdoes most other f2p games in that it allows the player to become powerful without needing to use purchased currency. above all, the games concepts are unique enough not to be hackneyed, and practical enough to make for a fun, sustainable game.",7
"this is the best game i ever played never gets old :d ninjas play free wooot download it and see what i mean. this is the first game that i never lose intrest to. i play for hours xd warframe rockss",5
"one of the more unique games on the pc. brings a lot of new concepts and ideas to have a player-friendly enviorment. it has some cool thoughts, and is executed in a great state! it is an amazing game. i say get it before it starts costing money. once it does cost money, i would still suggest buying it, however i wouldnt say go over 75$. its too good to be free, so get it before a price comes out. -ryan",2
"excellent f2p game, would recommend everyone to give this game a shot",1
"warframe is an amazing free to play game and is packed with non stop action! if you love the look of destiny and love games such as halo,star wars,planetside 2 and dead space this game is worth checking out!",1
"this game is damn good fun. been playing since it went into beta, and it was pretty full of bugs back then. the devs have been really constantly hard at work, the game feels much less buggy now and the content generation rate is extremely impressive. theyre also super responsive and communicative with the community, which is a huge plus. however, it does suffer from the same issue as tf2 in that it has way more melees than it needs, but thats not so bad. the game is a ton of mindless fun, you just get to shoot a bunch of bad guys with a huge arsenal of weaponry, and the co-op aspect is pretty cool, especially with friends. plus, its free (albeit with a premium currency that has a really expensive model...). the main crippling factor of the game right now is that it has no late game; after youve explored the whole star chart and done the void missions there really isnt too much to do right now. fortunately, the devs are working on that so well wait and see.",6
"amazing game, its just so cool, great graphics, smooth gameplay. get this game.",1
"warframe is an amazing free to play 3rd person shooter that does not lack anything in the graphics eye candy department. it is fast paced, the levels get harder and harder to deal with, and is amazing fun when played with friends. highly recommend it!!!",3
"i love the game but now when i try to play it it saysthat it didnt recive infermation from the servers so i cant play anymore so plz fix that and nerf the flamethrower also while your meeting my every comand id like a aoe mod for assult rifle like a insinuary rounds that leaves a gas that catches hostiles on fire but make it like the thunderbolt mod so when maxed its like a 30% or better yet a 40% of doing it back to the problem tho i tried to re downliad it or on the file it gave me it sayed repair and i tried that, since i deleted and re downloaded im shure it deleated my progress but if u add cross compadability some how that would be nice that way i can play with my brother who plays on the playstation 4 plz fix the update and make forma more common or able to buy the blueprint for 100k or something that way its reasonable to get but not almost inposible [ i tried to get it from like 4 tower 2s and 3 tower 3s ] plz help with these problems so i can continue playing this amazing game ps. amazing work on the game so far i know its in beta so its gona be amazing when its not!",1
"warframe, a game i always dreamed of, but could never play until i found warframe!",2
"first started he game confused about everything and how to get weapons and what not talked to some people in the game and learned my way around things, overall a great game just wish there was easier way to have more chracter and weapon slots instead of getting buying platinum",1
"never thought id find myself playing a shooter, but this game is special. great action for those more experienced at shooters, but accessible enough for a newb like me. definitely recommend it!",1
"gets a bit grindy over time, so unless you find the basic gameplay fun, this isnt for you, but its free to play, so i would suggest giving it a try at the very least. its a competent tps with strong melee and ranged play, various weapons, and a weapon leveling system that feels very rewarding.",6
"love the game. but it seems as if the starting weapons dont allow you to enjoy it as much as possible. i recommend playing with friends for a better experience. but in other terms spending 50 dollars for the stalker pack is worth it once you decide which warframe you are suited to.",1
"very good game i love it after hours of playing it i do recommend this game to all who read this.",1
"warframe. a free-to-play third person shooter that has cool mechanics of crafting and combat. personally, i never really got through it much because of a lack of balance. alone, you usually got owned by enemies and with someone else it was too easy. and when i wanted to play with a friend (cough revcomm cough cough) hed say i wanted to derp around in a room and do nothing when i was really looking around the level for the first time and looting stuff. its a fun game, i just never got into it. if you want a game about space ninjas then here you go.",6
"one heck of a game! very exciting and cant believe its free!",1
"good game but sadly id like to try the extrem multiplayer pvp.",1
"you can get in to this peice of  i tried getting in to a new account it forze and didnt make the god damn account!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"great game. if you want mass effect without the whole story and with a bit more of halo action, this game has it all. even 9999999 modifications to weapons, sword, suit (warframe)!",1
"space ninjas!1!!11111!!!11111!. but seriously, if you computer can handle it then youve got nothing to lose other than the hours of your life youll be spending playing it.",1
"incredibly addicting. awesome visuals and oh yeah, mutha in swords, axes and the damn grim reaper.",2
"played it for quite sometime off steam, its alright. the content is the same thing, over, and over again gg th styll",5
"its alright as an action type of game, but u get bored pretty quick, cuz its the same missions all over again.",1
"in the past few days ive played over 20 hours of this game, even from the begginning it is immersive and very entertaining, generally small learning curve and straight forward design. updates and hotfixes are constantly being uploaded, congratulations and thank you to digital extremes.",1
"this game is beautiful and awe-inspiring. i would pay upwards of $20 for this- but its free.",1
"love the game, for my opinin the graphic is the most beutifull in the f2p jenre, the game is creative warframe for ever <3",1
"a great third person shooter with co-op pvp element",7
"this is one of the best shooter ninja games i have played so far. if it wasnt for my friend who showed me the game, i would have never had seen it . i thank him a lot and i would highly recommend it to anyone. the best part is that it is free.",1
"this game is awesome; its free-to-play, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is breathtaking. you have the option to solo dungeons, or play online with your friends. this action-packed game is possbily number one on my list of games.",1
"great combo ninja aliens with superpowers awesome!",1
"you can run up a wall, backflip and shoot an arrow into the skull of one enemy while in mid air, and send it flying into another enemy from the momentum, and they both go flying off the cliff. parkour good, guns good, play the game.",2
"if you like co-op games aswell as solo shooting games, this is for you. just a great game.",1
"ing space ninjas. thats all you really need to know.",1
"love this game, fun and smooth controls! you can really do some crazy acrobatic moves with enough practice :) you can craft everything in the game, you dont have to pay a single penny! its free! try it out!",2
"very cool game, smooth gameplay and really good graphics. the customization of characters and weapons is fairly interesting along with the mods needed for some customization. on the other hand the platinum is fairly expensive, you dont hvae to use it but its really helpful with some things :) overall 4/5 :)",1
"a game that is heavily relied in teamwork!!! thumbs up for that",2
"i highly recommed this game to my friends, its just awesome :d",1
"short review: as the game explains, free to play. what they didnt tell you is that 80% of ingame items are cash shop only. the game controles running character response is all very fluent and to be able to pull off epic movements and techniques with such smoth controles is satifieing. game pacing can be a chore and before you reach to a new area or do some interesting mission, your going to be playing through the same area with slightly diffrent mission over and over for about 10- 20 times over. well thats all i have to say about it.",1
"its a blast, can say that being able to be a badass ninja in a third person action shooter is the way to go.",2
"at first it kinda sucked because my computer couldnt handle all the graphics but when i got all that fixed this game is by far topping everygame i have on xbox.",1
"warframe is an amazing shooter thats looks great but has some server issues",3
"this game is amazing, a must have. its beautiful and smooth, textures are great. a ftp game that i would pay 30$ for :) very satisfied!",1
"gun ninjas. also generally satisfying content and excellent art direction!",3
"this game is a must! something about being a space ninja with a machine gun gets the blood flowing. fast pace, lots of customizations and tons of fun equal a kick  game for any shooter junkie.",1
"warframe is basically this: youre a space ninja taking on massive hordes of enemies in an attempt to save the solar system (and then some). what do you have? a melee weapon, a couple of guns, and three friends. what do they have? a massive arsenal of many units, with varying levels of strength and gear, capable in some cases of destroying you instantly. no pressure, right? oh, i forgot to mention. you also have superpowers thrown into the bargain. ever seen a room full of thirty people spontaneously combust, or a person become so self-magnetized that they literally became a black hole? well, prepare to.",1
"propably a first game thats so much fun, i didnt mind the repetition at all. so well balanced that i occasinaly die, but its not frustrating. instead it keeps adrenaline going when you are running for exit with last 1% of health an no shield :) plus the graphic is great, levels keep changing (even when replaying!) and the game runs on full details on computer from 2008 8-o the free2play model has a brutal prices though.",2
"i play it, you probably havent played it, if you did, disregard what i am going to say, just play it.",7
"really cool game, and always entertain me with new guns, warframes, and missions.. keep up the good work and keep it updated :d",1
"this game is still in beta so cant expect a perfect experience. over all this game was not a let down consedering i spent no money on it and have over 100 hours so far. this game has flaws (espically the new damage 2.0) but its in beta and this is the whole point is to work out all the bugs and have it nice and pretty for full-game. this game is slightly a pay to win slightly. basically you can buy every warframe and most of the weapons (cant buy prime versions) but they all start at lvl 1 and have to lvl them. so this game does have a pay to win way through it kinda, but that ruins the experince of not having to farm and play through with low lvl gear/starting and actually working your way to the top. overall i would give this game a solid 7/10. but hey in due time this game will be a full-game and hopefully then it will blow all of us away. good luck out there tenno.",4
"not a bad game for free to play. still new to it but feels like a fun game to kill time. and if you have friends, why not? good for bonding. free. whats not to like about it?",1
"it is a game to try. afcorse the price does not hurt at all :d",1
"i love this game the graphics and actions awesome ps you can freerun",1
"a great game which involves not only shooting skills, but strategy as well. the bad part about this game is the fact that you cant really communicate with your team in the game, which makes it a bit difficult to coordinate some times. the best way to play this game and enjoy it to its fullest is to form your own team and communicate through stream, skyper or other similar programs. that dosent mean that playing the solo is not fun, it is, but everything is more enjoyable when you are surrounded by friend. so go on! form your team and go kick some alien butt!",1
"i love it! its such a good game,its fast,its fun,its sci-fi,its parkour! every little aspect of this game is truly what i would call a sci-fi shooter!",1
"great game, even though still a bit glitchy, but a great concept, a great deal of fun and overall a game im sure that will soar to great hights!",2
"online action games are rare on their own, finding a decent one is even harder. id say warframe is a brilliant game all-in-all. the only time it lets itself down is that it is very pay to win, you either wait days to get a decent setup or empty your wallet and it get it now.",3
"this game hands down was one of the top 3 best free to play games of 2013.",1
"totally recomend it dose not get this fun for something thats free",1
"warframe is a great free to play third person shooter with back to back action, amazing graphics, and many hours of play time. there are three major races to battle against having many different types of enemies for each race. in warframe you will team up with other players and, fight together in battle. not a team player go solo and, wage your own war. no matter if you are a spy, soldier, or mercenary for hire, slash, cut and shoot your way through space. and always remember ninjas are awsome!",1
"looks gorgous and whos doesnt wanna be an ultra sick space ninja.",1
"its a really cool free game amazing graphics super fun single or multiplayer combat, in other owrds it makes you feel like a ninja so play it.",1
"the gameplay is great but at some points it just feels repeated",1
"if they had a open world version to this would be even more amazing but still a very good game, gets repetitive tho",1
"looks to be an awsome game that i cant seem to get away from lol. its free to play or you can buy some upgrades.",1
"so much fun. best to play with friends but still fun.",1
"disclosure: i havent played this game for 20+ hours. as far as free to play games go, especially on steam, this one seems leaps and bounds better in controls and just plain fun. graphically the environments can be too repetitive and not really look as good as they should, but the character models and especially the animations are just fantastic. one of my bigger complaints is that the cluttered environments sometimes make it hard to pull off all of the most fun stunts, like wallrunning while mowing down grineers around you. unfortunately while i think the gameplay beats many free-to-play games, the cash shop is pathetically stingy. this is a game where they want you to pay for everything - be aware that the first tenno you choose will be the only free one you get! even the other starters frames will cost you, and the conversion rate is unforgiving. i honestly think theyd get more money if their prices were more reasonable; im sure im not the only player who wouldnt mind throwing down money occasionally if the reward justified the price.",1
"very fun and interesting game. pve based, solid gameplay, good combat system. amazing visuals. overall for a ftp its one of the best.",1
"its pretty great, but the map design gets kinda repetetive after a while. still fun though",1
"warframe is a good looking game although the maps begin to repeat and becomes dull. still fun and addicting",1
"not bad. will definitely play it more. hope the combat gets more interesting at later levels.",1
"if you like ninjas, 3ps, and guns, then get this game!!!",1
"warframe might have high-costing microtransactions, but there is always something to do even if you choose not to pay.",7
"best shooter that ive played. thats for free. the in game physics, and gameplay make it an intense game.",1
"well you got a tps with online functionality and its free. doineedtosaymore",1
"warframe is an interesting take on the run and gun style of third person shooters. set somewhere in the future where technology is quite advanced and the known universe is governed by three different factions. the grinneer, corpus and the infected. you play exploring the different planets goverened by these factions in a warframe warframe does an excellent job blending in rpg elements with fast paced gameplay. each warframe has distinct abilities and purposes for different situations, i would even go as far as being to categorize them in different classes. the weapons system is also quite beautiful. consisting of being able to upgrade and customize your weapons in any way you want. warframe does have quite a grind which is evident later on, but if you just want a way to waste time with three other friends, then look no further than warframe.",4
"this space ninja simulator has come a long way from the closed beta. with beautiful graphics and fast-paced action gameplay this game is the best free-to-play experience on the steam store. while the method of aquiring new weapons might seem like a grind the fantastic gunplay and action-movie esque ninja manuevers make the gameplay so solid you cant help but want to play more. i highly recommend getting one of the starter packs though to speed up this process. i ended up buying a founder pack when it was in closed beta and i still have plenty of platinum. just be sure to not spend your platinum on warframes and weapons directly. instead only buy catalysts and reactors that buff weapons this way you can make the most of the money you spend if you choose to. sentinals are also worth the platinum. my favorite starting warframe is the mag with its high crowd control possibilities and team utility that make bosses a breeze.",3
"i love this game. it takes a bit to get used to the feel, but once youre wall running and jumping from firefight to fisticuffs the flow just works awesome.",6
"combination of the fan, drive and very interesting game mechanics. surprised and hooked!",5
"the fact that i have put more hours into this game in 2 weeks than i have in any other game i have downloaded should be enough said.",1
"an absolute joy to play with friends. it is a game that should be sealed with satisfaction guaranteed. nothing beats a the concept of space ninjas.",3
"i cant really play this game with my directx 10 i dont know why?....",1
"amazing game! even though it can take a while to get the hang of, once you get used to the dynamic controls this is a extremely fun game with unique action and item systems. this game gets even better because it is free to play even though i would be happy to pay for it after experiencing this masterpiece.",1
"for those looking for a co-operative multiplayer experience, warframe delivers on multiple fronts. varied character customisation, squad based play, clan/guild support as well as a multitude of other features, warframe is a great co-operative (and potentially solo) game to play with friends or others alike. primary influence: mass effect 3 multiplayer pros: - develops a refined experience (barring beta bugs) and much needed breath of life into this particular genre. cons: - can get partially repetitive when played alone. - still in beta.",2
"great game playing solo, but even better going at it with friends!",1
"probably the best free game ever! great graphics and gameplay, mobility and weapons! still in beta so i wont fret about bugs that are common",7
"teamwork is needed for survival you cant run and gun but you dont just get hit by one bullet and die like how most tps games go. you at the start get to buy one out of three starters i have been playing for a while and still only have my one, when you level up you actually have to go through a test in order to get to the next level if you fail you can try again until you pass the test. this game is fun most of the time it can get hard really fast. but give this game a try learn the basics make your decision around rank 5 took me about an hour to get to rank five due to just finding good team mates.",1
"great runngun, 3rd person ninja in space action game. like any mmo style game, it does get repetitive, but constant content updates and fixes make the game worth playing. ive clocked nearly 500 hours on this game since i started, and opened up my pocketbook for founders packages and other goodies--and it has all been worth it. nearly every item available for purchase with real money is also available for acquisition within the game itself, making it a truly rare mmo style game.",4
"dont let the metascore throw you, this game has come extremely far since those old reviews and if you like the good old grind games then this is the game for you. start it up, find a solid, fun, friendly clan to join and run missions and make friends, your arsenal will grow quick and render pay to win unnecessary. update 11(damage 2.0) while was a major jump that ruffled a lot of players(including myself) has turned out to be the best thing to happen to warframe so far and wont be the last. basically this is: ninjas in space, let that sink in because those 3 words trump all.",7
"great plot setup, very little lag and perfect graphics pretty much sums this game up. its worth a try its so well made, its worth putting good money into weapons/gear for this game.",1
"they want money so bad it is almost funny, they make up for it by making most things attainable in-game and giving you fun game play. you pick a class, rank it to 30 and do so for the rest of the classes to gain levels that let you get the better weapons/classes. you have to wait unless you pay up, if you have ever played an mmo or one of the castle building games 12 hrs - 3 1/4 days is not so bad. it is a third person shooter and every class has their own powers, mid game you will be spamming them to kill waves of enemies at a time just because you can. fun stuff.",8
"cyborg-ninjas in space shooting, slicing, stabbing, burning, poisoning, and freezing genocidal clones, metal gears, and totally not the zerg. with only a few hours of playtime, you too can go from a complete beginner to a screaming train of death, bullets, and being sick-nasty.",3
"warframe is a game that i will never forget. the amount of things to do and build is incredible. i just cant keep my hands of the game. there is no other experience like this and its for free too. you have to try it.",1
"honestly and truely this game is unique ive never been more satisfied while playing a game",4
"warframe is a fun game i been playing it for like a year or 2 but besides that its super fun i think everyone should come and try it out but its not for everyone. ps opppppppppppppppppppppp #df",6
"the game is sort of like the mirrors edge combat done right. however, if in single player, you could use slow motion it would be much better.",1
"warframe is the best free to play game on the market. 10/10",1
"pretty fun, great graphics, play with friends?! definate recomend since it is free.",1
"wow! me and marfy played this tonight and its briliant! its not the deepest thing ive played, at least not on the surface although im sure a bit further in that will change but its got fantastic graphics, fluid control and animations, co-op, fun as hell and its freeeeeee!",2
"this game is strange. its like nothing else ive ever played before: its too easy, unrewarding, the player-hosted servers are a hit -and-miss and the systems (trading, chat etc.) lack polish.... and i cant stop playing it. something just keeps pulling me back in. considering this game is free and the devs are a really nice bunch (the in-game hotfix notices keep on cracking me up. kudos for that) who seem to care for their playerbase, i really advise on trying this game. if you like third person shooters, give this a spin - its a pretty good game :)",4
"somewhat like mass effect 1,2,abnd 3 more fast paced its good!!!",1
"get this game it is soo much fun i think you guys would like it!",1
"this is a game i enjoyed back on my brothers ps4(back when there was just this and resogun), but to the combined efforts of my houses console restrictions, my brother playing it constantly and infamous second sun, i havent played it for a while. its about time i install the pc version.if you like hack n slashes and third-person shooters, warframe is a mission-based combination of both. it doesnt take long for warframe to leave an impression on you. everyone except the evil emperor zurg is invading the planets of the solar system, and you go in with others to fight off, defend, eliminate, protect against, capture, survive against, or rescue people from the enemy. the combat has some variety with the melee combat and is both simple and satisfying. the craftable weapons, customization, various abilities for the expanding amount of classes in the form of warframes(ah, he said it, he said it), daily rewards and creative boss battles make this an awesome f2p that youll keep returning to. im sure its keep patching and updating to infinity and beyond!",1
"all around solid game. i gotta say i am a fan of digital extreme work. the story and setting are pretty cool, and the levels are designed pretty well and look great. the issues however are still being worked out but i find damning: 1) there should be more stages, many maps are repeated in the early game thus far. 2) it being a purely mulitplayer game means you have to work with other people to get some missions done. 3) many weapons are simply sidegrades which is good. though some weapons are simply overpowered as ammo drops are plentiful. 4) pay-to-win. what i mean by that is one can simply buy weapons and gear to get ahead. new suits are $5 to $20 and weapons are about $12. though you can find blueprints or use aquired currency to craft weapons yourself. 5) balancing issues! it is to be expected that the higher level suits would be better, but as i stated above anyone can buy a top tier suit and top teir gun and blow through other players in missions. 6) if you like pvp and want to get into it early on there is very little of it. 7) difficulty curve is like a bell curve. from the first three zones its as follows easy - prepare to die if you didnt grind - easy.",2
"its the combination that can achieve good standard co-op+violonce+teamwork= ultamite fighting game",1
"this is game is awesome for players who play tf2 and want a story line. it should be rated t. one problem is that platinum (in-game money) cost a little too much. other then that, the game is awesome!",1
"i give this game a potato out of 10. (what can go wrong with epic space ninjas?)",1
"great game, seems grindy at first but gotta catch them all if ya know what i mean,.",2
"amazing game. this game is brilliant but will only apeal to you if you enjoy the grindy style of game similar to diablo. there is lots of repition to be come stronger and farm certain items. if you enjoy all these elements then this game is for you.",2
"for a free game, this is one you should definitely play! cant stop playing it!",2
"beautiful game it has great 3d graphics and is enjoyable to play with friends.",1
"3rd person shooter. with some solid melee combat and also parkour to boot. pretty fun a bit difficult to progress solo though.",1
"a mass effect-ish third person shooter about space ninjas. outstanding effects, locations, and intense action.",1
"fantastic, wickedly awsome game. i respect this game more than most because as a beta it has delivered more cooperative online play than any game i have ever experienced. the challenge is kept fresh, the warframes are consistently revamped with additional available cosmetic upgrades, not to mention bountiful perk-reminisent mods, and new weapons are released nearly weekly or so. going on four days worth of play time, and i see no viable reason to stop. great game to od on with friends. bravo warframe.",2
"i`ve been watching this game progress and grow and it only keeps getting better and better. online connections are smooth and the players are mixed between calm, serious, or quiet, all of which have some degress of skill as well. very enjoyable game, configuration methods to suit your playstyle, easy to pick up on even if you aren`t good at shooters. the ai are challenging and use cover, you have to outsmart them to win, and there`s something satisifying about slicing a foe in half with your melee weapon... personal rating: 9.9 out of 10 - the .1 being your fingers may get tired by how long you play this game!",3
"amazing game, considering it is free. it certainly lacks some content but it will definately catch up in terms of content. the game is not very friendly towards new players however, if you put in the time it pays off well. it gets kind of repetetive at later levels, but killing people in an artistic manner never gets boring.",2
"pretty sweet game. the idea for the game is hella cool. ninjas in space. a lot of weapons to choose from, each warframe has different abilities, the game has a really good community, wouldnt hurt giving this game a try.",8
"psychic cyborg space-ninja shenanigans. pros - feels fun when you actually have decent weapons cons - solo mode should actually be somewhat soloable for a change",4
"awesome game very real like and so great to play for hours 5/5 stars",1
"interesting game with elements of stealth, action, hacking and so more. wonderful co-op.",4
"even though its still in beta (as im typing this) its incredibly polished and smooth. one of the most fair business models i know. great combat and great customization trough the mod system. looks good. biggest problem with it so far is the difficulty to connect, it has a bug/issue where you might get a message saying you should open some ports and that upnp has failed even though you already opened those ports. but it is still fun to play even if you cant connect and have to play solo edit: the connection issues have reduces usually it works, i am very much impressed with the rate and quality of the new content the devs manage to produce. the performance differs from update to update and i do advice to look at the options in the launcher they help a lot.",7
"awesome game!! brilliant atmosphere amongst players!!!!!!! only bad thing i can say is too many updates constantly! but jeah allround fun none the less!!!!",5
"a decently fun game that you can play with friends, though playing solo may be overly difficult and the rank up missions are kinda a bit..... out of place, in terms of difficulty.",1
"its the perfect mixture of ninjas and cyborgs. what can get better than cyborg ninjas?",3
"although id put my  in this cat i would not and repeat would not eat its  if it wasnt filled with custerd from like a custerd dount",1
"excellent f2p game, doesnt require you to pay to win. you can get everything in this game for free except for some cosmetics and slots for new warfames and weapons.",3
"warframe is a game where you play as a space ninja in space doing ninja stuff while looking badass but with smooth gameplay and amazing style, the game doesnt lack beauty and the replayability is incredible with the amount of missions side missions void missions is just insane. i cannot give more reason just to pick it up and try it, there are so many ways you can play the game, if you need to play tanky or do a supportive role or even just be stealthy, you can without all the complicated requirements most games require although the game sometimes seems like a grind in most cases its very rewarding and worth it. i havent played as many hours as most people but i have played a few to understand the beauty behind this. i feel the developers should give themselfs a pat on the back and keep working on this game to take it as far as they can. i see potentiol and if this isnt enough reason for you to get it, then you are just trying not to like it! i give this game a 7/10.",2
"perfect graphics & super action. very good customizable items.",3
"i have played this game for about 8 hours and i am on my way to start creating another warframe (oberon). but i highly recommend this game because its free, and is insanely fun if you like a parkour/3rd person shooter and play in co-op, then this is the game for you.",1
"good game for someone that likes sci-fi 3rd person shooters",1
"the game is really good. but is dark sector the prequell to this game?",4
"ever wanted to be space ninja?? if yes go and download this game asap!!!!",1
"i love this game, its amazing how much they base their game around the community. they host livestreams over on twitch every so often to have a run through on warframe or host dev streams so the devs over at de can listen and share their ideas with everyone and let people know whats going on with the game. pros: great graphics not that high system specs frequent updates/ bug fixes great fun nearly everything on the market you can build but obviously takes time an ingame currency called platinum which allows you to buy things ready made with everything instead of farming stuff. cons: items in the market are overpriced ( 10-15 for just 1 warframe!) a  ton of performance issues on the higher levels and new tilesets (but they do alot of updates and try their hardest to fix). becomes a grindfest in some cases and becomes repeated boringness. sometimes ai act like toddlers and run around not knowing what the  they are supposed to do. boring for low levels. but ive got to say its still in open beta and it is an extremely fun game and to see the game really show you whats its ment to be keep playing if your bored of the first few mission  gets alot better once youve got rid of your crappy starter gear for some pretty neat gear. a fun challenge and is meant to be played with friends.",4
"this is the most awsome ftp game i have ever played in my whole life! go play it!",1
"free to play, mix between mass effect 3, borderlands, and dead space. get it! you have nothing to lose",1
"this game is freaking awesome soo ninja like action packed with tons of cool stuff nice variety of color customization and tons of weapons to choose from",1
"great game! never thought id like an fps game this much. totally customizeable gameplay with all the weapons and frames, and the best part is if you feel like putting in the time, you can do almost everything in the game without spending a real dollar!",5
"really great game, dunno why people would hate this.",2
"this is a great game overall. the graphics are great, the gameplay is amazing, and there is a good selection among the individual warframes. however multiplayer is a little laggy and difficulty progression of missions is too hard and demanding of players who decide to to it themselves.",1
"awesome game. puts you immediately in the action. so addicted already.",8
"its pretty much phantasy star online with space ninjas, but its also a fun game to play and its free!!!",2
"awesome game teamwork is essance in all 4 1/2 stars",1
"warframe is co-op fps game that provides a new playground with many options. where teamwork is key to takedown tough bosses to get new blueprints for stronger, more powerful warframes and weapons. warframe has pros and cons. the pros of this game is that it provides a fun, enjoyable experience with lots of options concerning weapons, warframes, modfications to your weapons and warframes. it also has a rewarding victory when new weapons and warframes are built. the cons are that while building new weapons and warframes is rewarding, it can take a minimum of 5 days to build new warframes and a usual 12 hours for new weapons. also this game is in beta so sometimes it may run perfectly and other times have bugs or even crash after extended periods of play or if repeating the same mission over and over. the final verdict for this game is 6.75/10 because this game is a enjoyable experience with a few cons but doesnt quite live up to its full possibilities and expectations in some multiplayer pvp areas.",1
"this game is addicting! you should get it its really fun, and has lots of action!",5
"abit repetitive and sometimes feels like a grind-fest with some major bugs but fun with friends.",3
"the art style is beautiful and interesting. the game play is easy to learn and fuctional. game is a grindy co-op ninja sim. its great fun with friends, solo is enjoable as well",1
"really a good game! stunning graphics and sleek gameplay.",2
"theres not a lot to warframe, but the games execution is second to none. youre a future magical space ninja, and you kill lots of things. the gunplay is really satisfying, and melee combat is pretty good if you manage to pick a good weapon (the standard single swords are generally all bad, good early weapons are things like the fang or orthus). there are a lot of really fun parkour tricks as well that you probably wont learn about for quite some time into the game. there are arguments over whether or not the game is pay to win, but its not just a cut-and-dry thing. at some point you will really want to buy more of the in-game currency, but that point doesnt really come until youve played for something like 60 to 80 hours at the earliest. the game is free up to that point, and if youre still liking this fantastic game after 80 hours, just pay the devs. at the time of writing this review, ive put in 265 hours, and put $15 in the game. thats value.",3
"the first free to play game iv played, that feels like any payed for game. as long as you like(or dont mind) to grind levels you can upgrade, buy and build tons of cool stuff, without paying real cash.",2
"ever want to run through alien ships leaping from wall to wall while shooting people in the face? welcome to warframe. the idea of being a space ninja taking down enemy factions in a dystopian future may seem silly at first but in practice its a crazy amount of fun. with a collector style upgrade system and plenty of weapons available warframe has a lot to offer.oh and did i mention its free?",2
"fun and free, what more could you want? there is too much running when playing with others but that seems to be the price for farming some levels.",1
"ive never dropped as many hours into a game as i have with warframe. sure; it loves to make you grind, but for once ive found a type of grind i enjoy! the high-paced movement and action-packed combat always has me coming back for more.",4
"not gonna lie, this is a very fun game. that being said, there is quite a bit of hours that you have to put into this in order to get the game to open up to you with all the weapons/frames/etc. once you get past that though, the game is quite deep. so many playstyles to choose from, mods to customize each build, and different weapon combinations with each warframe/build gives this game quite a deep shoot-n-loot system. you will have to invest time into the game anyway in order to rank up your masteries but you could cut down the grind a little by putting some money into the game and getting some platinum immediately in order to get what you want earlier on, so you can immediately begin to use whichever frames/weapons that you want. i recommend that if you do put money into this and get platinum, use it for cosmetic stuff that you cant normally get, such as the color palettes, syandanas, etc. everything else you can get in the game as you keep playing. still, though, its not required but helping the developers for a game like this can go a long way. = ) digital extremes has constant updates to this game. many warframes and weapons/missions/game systems have been introduced since its initial inception. and this is just the beginning as the game is still considered to be in beta. if you give this a chance, it is well worth your time to play.",1
"it is a very fun game but gets boring after a while. also, if you do not have a fast enough processor, it will lag like hell.",1
"awesome game! cant really describe it, but its a co-op ninja fest!",1
"honestly it gets repetative and can be pay to win but for a free to play game it is great. if you dont mind the levels being the same, grinding, or any of this you will love this game. the graphics are good, and gamplay is nice. the game also is very fun when playing with people you know. id recomend at least giving it a shot if you have not already.",1
"this game is great, the graphics are really fun and the plot is great. it being free is just another reason to get it",1
"incredibly fast paced, action packed fun. if you are looking to blow off some steam, look no further. with a vast variety of ways to play, customizations, weapons and classes (also known as warframes) you can step it up and go all out. but if you hate the grind then it is not recommended you play it. but most games have grinding right? i still recommend this game highly, with hours of fun to be had, i say give it a try. 9.5/10",3
"easily one of the most satisfying, if not the most satisfying game. consists of a great combat system with the freedom to choose over various sorts of weapons that can determine the outcome of every mission, and also has that addictive parkour to traverse the maps in any way you like.",4
"an awsome game about you being a freking space ninja",1
"you can be a robot ninja space pirate, with wallrunning and everything you might expect. i have a lot of fun in this game and the f2p side seems fair enough",6
"extremely fun with friends can easily be one of the best games ive played but it can get boring due to not alot of maps although if that were not so then would easily be my favorite game :)",1
"ninjas in space with guns real ninja feel with great natural feeling actobatics and combat",1
"whats most important here is that the game is free and its fun. if your computer can manage the graphics, you have nothing to lose by giving warframe a shot. if youre the min-maxing type or any sort of person who likes to break down systems into a series of personal goals, you have no barriers between you and many, many hours of enjoyment. for my part, i had a fun several missions, but it became clear that i was playing and trying to inhabit a world of people who were much more ready to invest time and grinding into something that wasnt giving me the payoff i needed to keep going. i never felt much of a sense of direction once the repetitive nature of the missions was revealed.",1
"best third person shooter ive every played and love the story :d",2
"i have 600 hours of game play and i still have tons of content to go though. they consistantly update, and the developers keep in touch with the community by livestreaming weekly. i reccomend this game especially to small groups of friends who want a co op experience",10
"still has all the bugs you would expect from a beta, and they dont seem to be in a huge rush to get rid of them, but their support is pretty good, the community is strong, and the gameplay is undeniably fun, with more varied missions than when it was first available. they have done a good job of keeping the carrot on the stick, theres always something you want to get, and the recent addition of melee 2.0 was a welcome one.",5
"i normally dont have trouble recommending a game i play this much, but it really is a hard sell. the game is pretty much openly hostile to newcomers (rng everywhere, resource and rank requirement walls for better gear, exclusionary design choices like one-time mods/weapons and removal of arcane helmets). so i cant seriously say a new player will get into this on their own and have fun. that said, once the game gets rolling, its a one of a kind experience and really rather addicting. if we are friends on steam, and you wanna give this a try, please contact me! the game is a million times better with an experienced older player helping you out, and me/my friends keep a successful shadow clan that will get you set up to actually enjoy the game. if we dont know each other, and you wanna jump into this game solo, continue at your own risk.",6
"very grindy when you are starting off, but once you manage to get going, this game becomes tons of fun",7
"nice . you get to play with your tight biosuit and alien ninjas friends in coop fashion against some ugly controlled bots. thing is.. if you want to get a better suit, more tight (sexy) to your body than the current one you have to spend some  in it. this is a game for people that likes ballet.",1
"i like it but its hard to build wapons and warframe and there alot of stuff i need to buy it by platinum but i had a blast with it and i still playing it",2
"awesome!!!!! this game is a direct masterpiece, everything about it is awesome! i like the sci-fi feeling and everything. cool game!!!",1
"it has its limitations, but for a free-to-play shooter, its actually pretty fun. the story is pretty interesting too. my biggest peeve is that it gets very repeptitive after a while. otherwise, i rather like it.",1
"a little grindy but when youget what you grinded for its incredibly rewarding, and also thanks to the new trading you dont have to pay money for platinum, admittedly its a little difficult but then again, its the free way. 100000/10",4
"after the first planet the game starts to get boring",1
"for a game thats still in beta, this is pretty amazing. slow at first, but really addicting once you get the basics down.",5
"this game is good to play with friends and do a bunch of parkour , also it is fun to make your own warframe that fits your playstyle.",1
"warframe is a great co-op game withalot to offer,unfortunatly like every f2p (free to play) game there are pricy in-game purchuses.",1
"a wonderfully fun game. does seem to be a bit sparse however ill update when i play again!",1
"this game is a boss at entertaining just love this game its as dope as sope hanging from a rope",8
"good graphics and stunning gamplay! definititly a must for anyone who is in to sci-fi, action, or just plan old fun",1
"i failed at running on walls 10/10 would fail again.",1
"great game but the fact that as far as i know you cant actually create a new game so you  up once then you cant change it so good game but add a way to make a new game. (if there isnt one already)",1
"ninjas with machine guns fighting zombies in space. the end.",1
"i think its a pretty good game, it is enjoyable. i played it when it was first released before it was even on steam and well, all the glitches and such i experienced are probably now fixed. so if those are all fixed id imagine it is an enjoyable game for all. the only thing i disliked was well, its halfway impossible to find the items to craft armor or weapons. which gets you annoyed and you end up wanting to spend real money on in-game currency.",1
"game its awesome. starts kinda slow but once you learn all about it you wont stop playing it",1
"good game ever! weapons warframes are all awesome!",1
"been playing now past the 30 hour mark. its oddly addiciting and i cant get enough of it. the missions are the same but the big plus is that the maps are different and the enemy will always come back for me.",1
"this is a good game its even amazing graphics on the lowest.but on the highest its amazing",1
"not normally my type of game but i found this amazing iv had to force myself to come off it and sleep lol",1
"good stuff , but the platinum is overpriced and the chance to win cheaper platinum is xtremely low unless you just started , the plat is overpriced :(",2
"this is a fun game with great graphics, badass character design, good weapon vairety, addictive gameplay, good sounds/music, fun to play with your friends. in conclusion: on a 1 to 10 scale, i give this awsome game a 9 out of 10. (p.s.:if you havent played this game yet, then you have to give a chance to this game.)",2
"why the hell are you reading the reviews? you can be a bloody space ninja> get to downloading prospective tenno!",4
"very good gets boring after a while so get it but i have not got very far so its very boring.",1
"its alright but the recent updates have made it more and more less interesting and its heavily p2w probably because people are losing their interest on it",7
"warframe is a great hack-slash/shooter game with magic, and sci-fi elements, for a f2p game, it has amazing graphics, and its overall amazing, i really dont like game with in game purchases, its overall really fun, and great to play with freinds. 7/10",1
"extremely good quality, extremely good game, micro-transactions no one likes them but it is what pays for the game. overall good content, playability and replayability. a hole lot of hours of fun stored inside and constant updates and new content, if i had more money to spend i would spend some here, no doubt! have fun.",1
"i do really like this game first i thought you could only get weapons and new things if you payed but when i came further and further in the game i saw blueprints which you could make the stuff with other items you get from killing bosses / survivaling and i already came pretty far in the game and its really fun tho",1
"it got boring fast. although it was fun while it lasted.",1
"cool game but kinda tough to get into without help.",1
"vezzy vezzy good, nice physics, needs alot of friends 9.5/10",1
"fast pace game, good looking visuals and customizations, friendly community, game is always up to date, they keep there fans up to date",9
"love this game. always come back to it. easy to get into - fun and light.",4
"amazing graphics favorite game in steam so far :d tons of fun extremly addicitive",1
"while starting off on this game i felt like i wouldnt enjoy but as i played through the game i found out that this game is really good and while yes, the art style looks weirdish (hammer head loki) it grew on me and farming in this game can be annoying, once you get your gear leveled up it should be a breeze. if you are eyeing this game at lest give it a go.",9
"this game is top notch for graphics in gameplay.. every move is like a movie and it still never stops amazing me with new crazy enviroments or amazing scenes.. loveit more games should adapt this playstyle and camera control options",1
"yes it became my obsession . i love this game and i will finish it",2
"this game is a fantastic over-the-shoulder shooter with high customization on your character, weapons, and provides diversity between yourself and your team of 4. it is easy to start but retains some challenge later on for experienced player. the best part is its ever evolving gameplay. though it is still in beta, the creators are always looking for new and exciting ways to expand the gaming experience and make it far more enjoyable to play.",5
"one of the best f2p games ever. its not p2w either, because its not pvp.",1
"this game is a lot of fun. i worry about it being a long term game though due to the nature of doing the same exact thing over and over forever.",2
"this game is fun to play with friends, i would give it a 9/10. many bugs but the developers try their hardest. very interactive staff and developers that will reply to your post and comments on the forums.",4
"very fun game. it reminds me of a cross between the mdk games (remember those?) and the mass effect games, only not as deep. very entertaining co-op gameplay.",1
"if you dont play this game please consider suicide",4
"awsome game!!but is kinda repetitive tough...but still awsome",2
"this game is great i dont have many hours and i am quite new to the game but i must say this game is so good. its pretty much space ninjas but with all these extra things that make this game as good as it is. it does have quite a bit of grinding but it doesnt matter as this game is that fun",2
"one of the best free to play games ive ever played. the combat and movement system is amazing, especially with the new melee 2.0. the lore behind the game is deep, but will take some time to learn. you can earn every item in the game through the game, but you can speed things along by purchasing platinum with real money, which is useful for a variety of things. there is a large variety of warframes to choose from to suit the players play-style. if youre looking for a refreshing game in the free to play genre, i seriously recommend you play this game. you will not be dissapointed.",1
"amazing fun. my only gripe with this game is i have put in foreal 45 hours and am only rank 3 and it is very hard to find certain things to build new . other than that this game is amazing. just realize your gonna have to grind hard unless you wanna spend some cheese.",7
"i will come clean, i have not put many hours into this game, but i will say that the hours i have and of course plan to do have been awesome :d the game has an interesting design and concept :d and the fact that its free just makes it better ;) it is definatly worth a look :)",1
"the game needs pvp desperately. one of the best combat systems for any western action game and it completely lacks and competitive pvp outside of dueling 1v1s and 2v2s. if pve is your thing this game is definitley worth a try but imo you can only kill npcs for so long until you move to another game from sheer boredom. it takes a page from action games in the past giving a great single player/co-op mode on the level on halo but it seems the devs forgot what made games like halo/quake/doom soo good it was the multiplayer.",1
"it was good when i played it, but if things change too much in any free to play, it can easily become pay to win. good little series, makes multiplayer a blast, lots of places to go. tps are gonna like the sword and gun combo to take down baddies, and the wallrunning ninja crap makes it flavorful game. needs armor weapons. (at least i think so.)",2
"while i have only played the tutorial and 3 missions, i already know i am going to play alot more. it is addictive, with good gameplay, shiny graphics, and a feel of reward for the time you put in. it is at least worth a try, given that it is f2p!",1
"i love this game, very fun if you play it with your friends. try it out!",3
"the game is great, beautiful graphics, fast paced action. the downside is its free to play, so its cash shop controlled, meaning if you got a lot of rea l life cash you can get anything you want early on... so expect to be left in the dust often in group runs until youve played for a long long time and built up your mods, people who payed cash for all their stuff will be at a massive advantage. i played for months without getting a single gold orokin catalyst which doubles the amount of mods you can equip to a weapon, or your suit, or anything. still a fun as hell game, cuz you can play solo or online. getting groups together with people you actually know is shoddy at best, and takes alot of screwing around with the channels. for the longest time my friend and i couldnt even play together because it kept saying i was offline to him, and vice-versa. guild halls are almost cash shop reliant... like the orokin gold catalysts....that  never drops in a run....so you pretty much gotta spend real money on it to build a guild hall...and why would you even want to build one? not sure havent seen any actual reason for it yet other than aesthetic purpose.",1
"great game for a free to play truly great but the gameplay can be a little to hard and it, in a way makes you pay in order to get the good stuff totally 2013",1
"for 3rd person shooting game and free to play? i recommend this game",1
"great game very very addicting loads of fun definitley a must have!!",1
"its free, you can get practically everything through playing (that includes cosmetic items),and its really fun with a group. atleast try it.",1
"this is an awesome game totaly worth every second of game time =d",1
"the gameplay itself is fun as hell, but the over all interface of the game is probably the main reason more people dont play this. its confusing how to set up your character or even really how to get into missions or what order to do them in. clicking the wrong thing can have you doing the same novice mission over and over, or throw you in a game way above your level (for you to get slaughtered). communication in game can be lacking as well, and so can direction. over all the game is fun and amusing, but doesnt really have much long term playability. i put yes on recommend because its worth checking out, but without a revamp i dont see it ever getting overly popular.",1
"well i will make it simple if this game was for money i would clearly buy it",1
"this is a good game for people who like to grind and do the samething over and over again just in diffrent texture, but otherwize its okay. it is fun for a little while, then it gets boring",1
"this game is amazing but it does require allot of things like crafting upgrading selling making buying all that stuff and you have to know how to play for it to be fun its no call of duty but trust me this game is awesome highly recommended for players of the 3rd person si fi",1
"despite the fact i no longer play it on computer i still like the game as you can now get it on ps4 as well",1
"awesome f2p! fast and rewarding. shame that so much is payed for",1
"this is one of my favorite f2p games. i would recommend for everyone.",5
"great game, but the downside now is almost no population in newbie areas",1
"good graphics and smooth game play, has a very shallow tacked on lore and very grindy so much so a bit of a standing joke of a nick name is to call the game farmframe, you grind for experence to unlock new gear then you grind for matierals to build the gear only so you can grind more experence to get even more gear. the co-op of the game is kind of a joke, your better off playing by yourself unless your playing with friends. if your looking for mindless fun killing things then this is a good game if your looking for a game that has meat on its bones then your better off looking elsewhere.",2
"an interesting take on 3rd person shooting and an overall solid co-op experience. dont let the beta tag fool you, it feels and acts solidly. the two biggest weaknesses of the game are the grinding and the samey looking levels. the levels are procedurally generated and easy to get lost in.",1
"addictive as hell, regular updates keep it fresh. its still technically a beta but free to play. everything can be done without purchasing anything but theres a lot of delays between you and the highest content. some stuff cant even be rushed with money. ultimately ive ended up paying more money into this than most games i just buy outright, but its incredibly enjoyable, visceral and fun. you move with extreme agility, the upgrade and class systems are super fun to tinker with and second to none. theres enough depth and complexity here to keep playing for months at the least. its got me hooked. some complaints? a lot of bugs for a beta thats still perfectly willing to take your money. it puts massive delays on some things that can only be solved with in-game currency or not at all. a lot of the upgrades are pretty useless. pros? super fast, fun, almost completely co-operative gameplay. everything is basically co-op vs pve so theres not a douchey vibe amongst the players, youre all almost always on the same team. so you can just get down to winning. theres a pretty good variety of environments and abilities and classes, enough to always keep you curious. all in all its really fun and enjoyable and can be enjoyed for free, but everyone that ive seen playing it, has ended up resorting to paying for at least some things. it just makes it much easier to get by.",2
"pros: shooting slicing shooting slicing shooting shooting buying random stuff finding upgrades shooting customization and...shooting stuff till it dies. cons: confusing maps.",1
"a must play. the same multiplayer style as mass effect 3 but with more custimozation. lots of looting, parkouring, shooting, and modding. it probably has the best graphics of any free-to-play game out there.",6
"totally worth the download! i have not seen any online game that could even be compared to this! its like halo meets naruto, totally badass~!",1
"fast paced action or completely stealth. its up to you and thats what makes this game so wonderful. the degree of customization for your warframe allows for many of the same to exist and still be light years apart from one another. i recommend this game if youre into action packed games and have also dabbled into first person shooters.",1
"this game is a cool, space shooter. the shooting mechanics feel like gta v, but there are more weapons",1
"perfect co-op game is still in beta that means has some lots of bugs but it becomes better and better with every single update :)",1
"great looking free to play, interesting mechanics such as sneaking, if you really dont want to fight you can sneak your way through a map. which i found very interesting. the game consists of suits that your character wears called warframes and each one carries special attributes, such as stealth extra abilities cloak, etc. but is free what could you lose by giving it a try?",1
"farming, crafting, cooperation, clans, alliances, ninjas, space ninjas, ninjas with guns, parkour, melee, lazer guns that go wwwwwwwoooooooozzzzzhhhhhhhhh, tentacle space water ninja with a pirate themed looks and water powers! and lots moar! ive been playing this game for a while and i still think ive barely scratched the surface that this game offers. de is extremely supportive of this game and omg this game has changed so so much. this game is in no way a pay-to-win game. yes it has microtransactions but you can obtain every damn thing in this game besides cosmetics, although during special events de gives them out for free. but seriously play this game. its really good. like really, really good.",5
"fast pace, mind blowing fighting, if your into chaos and swords with fricking crazy guns, take this game",1
"really smooth, nice play for fun, need time to grow in this one, witch i dont have t_t",4
"warframe is a 3rd-person, part parkour, shooter-rpg hybrid where the name of the game is level-grinding and getting your warframes (classes) to be the best. this game has been in free open beta for well over a year now (something pretty rare these days), and the devs show no signs of slowing down. the atmosphere is incredibly erie, the boss battles are serious challenges, and its great fun to just be a badass, gun-wielding, super-powered, alien space ninja. it rarely gets more awesome than this. theres also a wikia site that is chock full of info for beginners and veterans alike that will hold answers to all of your questions. however, despite trying to inject a story in here, the game just isnt quite ready for it, and you wont care for it after 2 hours of gameplay. theres no obvious track of continuity here, so whatever story elements there are, theyre all over the place and confusing at best. the game can also be a graphical strain for those with less-than perfect computers with all the patches its gotten over the years. the store was also fully functional before the most basic of texture pop-ins were resolved, but this has since been corrected. you want a fun way to pass the time and feel like youve earned your rewards? get this game and you wont regret it.",1
"you know i keep on coming back to this game.....fun as hell and i have to say.....interesting art direction, love the look and feel of the enemies. fun playing as a group.",1
"i love this game, just a shame steam have ed it to the point where the game wont even start ! they actually know about the problem and have not did a thing to fix the launch issue.",1
"words cannot express how much i love this game, everything it does it does perfectly. imagine this: space ninjas, with guns, and powers, and fluid gameplay, amazingly fun co-op, a katana!!!! along with axes, broadswords etc. and so many guns that borderlands gets jealous (not really cause borderlands has a lot of guns but you get the picture, lots of gunz) warframe has so much to offer and so little to let it down. im positive that this is the best free to play of the year and maybe even the best multiplayer game overall. all of that stacked on top of the fact that its free, the only reason not to download warframe is that your pc/laptop/whatever cant handle it. download warframe, i can assure you that you wont regret it.",1
"fun to play game with a fair bit of depth. the majority of the content is available without spending a dime. takes time to farm materials for building new armor, but there is a real sense of accomplishment when you make one. my one gripe would be that the game is very hard to play solo. you need a group to do all but the easiest of worlds. thankfully there are usually plenty of games in progress to jump into and a large community of players to form groups with.",2
"i have had great fun in this game. i have shot all the things. and as far as i can tell it is theoretically possible to get very far and become very badass without havint to spend cash money. although the game will encourage you to spend cash money quite often. definitely one of the better f2p games out there.",1
"just seriously?! ftp?! ubelievable! sooooo smooth! graphics ingame are ridiculously good! artwork is ridiculously good! this game is just ridiculously good! :-) long live warframe! :-)",1
"honestly its a pretty good game, i really dont play it much anymore but i did spend a bit of rl money on it but was worth it.",3
"warframe has what most free-to-play games lack; a complete single-player experience. dont want to play online with your friends? you dont have to. dont want a game thats just an arena multiplayer shooter game like hat fortress of dutyfield 4: foxtrot alpha golf goty edition? good, because its barely implimented in this game. introducing your friends in the multiplayer experience only improves the experience through strategies, teamwork, and making fun of your noob friends for their stupid noob gear because theyre  noobs.",3
"very nice ninja action farm grind game. ing ninja powaahhhh!!!!!",1
"warframe is an interesting third-person shooter play game. you have a diversity of weapons (primary and secondary category) and melee weapons. the game graphic is pretty good, the tennos (a.k.a warframe), scenery, enemy, weapons and so forth are so rich of details. the most (and main) interesting of this game are tennos undoubtedly, each one has your unique and style power and characteristic and this is make you feel like a ninja. what, ninja? yes it is, you may walk on wall, super jump, throw shuriken stars, play like stealth (like a true ninja) and so forth. the game is still in beta mode then dont be angry when you realize you need spend some money to buy slot for more weapons and your new warframes",6
"pretty awesome game, i enjoyed the gameplay and the battle style! however, its hard for beginners.",1
"were nice game! can recommend for every gamer! downloade >.<",1
"like the game. its difficult but you have others online that can help and thats what makes it enjoyable for everyone and me. i would remend this game for everyone.",1
"i love this game! ive been playing nonstop and its very fun. i would recommend this game to players who like a third-person shooter with the ability to create an arsenal of powers.",4
"warframe has a some really good things, but it also has a lot of bad things. it has really interesting things and really boring ones too. since it is free to play, give it a try and see for yourself. as for me i love the art direction, the lore and the level design. i hate the grind and its depth in gameplay.",5
"a delight for any lover of ninjas, assassins, warriors, akimbo-style pistol-users and the rest.",4
"awesome. more fun when you have friends that play as well as a clan. lots of amazing detail. can get boring after a long time.",1
"personally i just find this game to have no point at all and is just a grind and its a paywall big time without spending some cash you just will not enjoy this.",1
"great game, strongly recommended. graphics are impressive and fighitng is tons of fun. many types of missions, played in groups in up to 4, many types of weapons powers and their modification , so there is much room for creativity. game community is one of the best out there, as most players are really friendly and open to chat and collaborate. the only drawback is that the game has no end. you play the same missions over and over on various difficulties, so you can farm resourses over and over so you can craft new weapons and tools over and over so you can play higher level missions... over and over. and that takes much time, or money, if you wish to speed up the proccess. there are examples of players investing much money then just quit. still, it is worth playing, even if it is once in a while just for a thrill of a fight, killing or destroying endless waves of mobs.",2
"very fun game. quick-paced missions; large variety of enemies and a great aresenal of weapons to destroy them with. the movement is superb, wall-running and crouch-sliding through hallways never gets old. graphics are quite pretty and the levels have a nice variance of scenery.",1
"rlly good game plus new update made it better then ever with the new melee combo system",2
"this is one of the top f2p games out there, with beautiful graphics and great combat this is a must have!!",1
"one of the most satisfying and intense games ive ever played. when it first came out, i immediatly downloaded it, and although it was tad repititive, it was instantly addicting. it has been a privilage to watch this game grow and evolve into something truly unique and unreal. the fact that it remains free to play is something to behold in itself, because the quality and fun that this game provides outclasses a number of games ive payed (in my opinion, sometimes too much) for. the community for this game is extremly supportive and friendly, one of the best ive seen in a party based co-op shooter. if having a blast for free is something that you enjoy (it is), pick up this game immediatly. also, ninjas play free.",2
"it was fun bu the graphics were fuzzy, not really laggy just simply fuzzy",1
"level up,fast,fun,collect mods,get nerfed...still good",5
"its good a good game well if you dont whanna pay for the weapons like points or something well you can work for it blueprints bro!",1
"this game appeases my inner feminist with badass and strong non sexualized female characters. also youre a space ninja.",2
"the initial grind may seem unappealing for this game, but if you can endure it just a little then the many oppurtunities and customizations of the game can give many, many more hours of enjoyment. the clan system also works effectively when combined with dedicated players to add group driven research and progression that unlocks even more unique weapons. regular updates with new and unique weapons continue to add to the games huge variety, allowing you to customize your style and play the type of space ninja badass you want to play. gear up with a couple of friends and play this game!",4
"warframe is a great game because it has a little something for everyone. the games warframes supplement each possible playstyle. a few bugs are present, which should not deter players since it is in beta stage. warframe has crafting for the people who like to make cool stuff, small puzzles for geniuses, a looting mechanic, the ability to make any weapon a total beast, and a variety of weapons to fit any playstyle: the sprayer, the sniper, the heavy hitter, etc. the music is awesome at first, but gets a bit repetitive after a while, but gamemodes are fun and are challenging if given time, even the first stage has challenging levels. bosses are a bit overpowered but drop great items. warframe is incomparable with other third-person shooters, you could say its a different breed.",2
"its a very good game, but it turns into a grindfest very often. aside from that, i highly recommend it.",3
"this game worked great when i downloaded it the first time months ago, since then i have not been able to play because it fails to update. it is a free to play to there is no real risk you shouldnt try to enjoy this game. just know it may crap out on you",1
"great game not becasue its free becasue the amazing third person fun enjoiable co-op with friends and i give this 9.75/10 great game keep the updates comin",1
"very cool mechanics. unless youre impatient, not necessary to buy to win. even so, buy to win seems to play a more aesthetic mechanic to the game. each warframe has 4 abnilities that you earn as you play, and each gun can use special mechanics, like increased damage, elemental, and increased fire rate. the parkour elements are very cool as well, since each warframe has varying speeds and agility",1
"i think if they turn the melee weapon into a selectable this game would be more enjoyable!",1
"this game is absolutly amazing. the gameplay is nice, graphics are at its best and some beautiful explosions. while youre killing some enemies you can also look good while doing it. aside from good things warframe has bad things. you must buy platnium to get a majority of the weapons and warframes in the game. but if youre rich thats good for you. platnium takes alway half the fun of the game, making you have to grind to get another sort of point. that sorta point can be used to get recipes but those recipes have materials that are in different planets, making you have to pass a buncha levels to go get your weapon. but if youre okay with all that stuff then i really reccomend this game.",1
"what else can i say except that i am a big fan of warcreng",7
"this is a good game for you if you like mass effect sort of combat system, great fun. the game is free to play but you can buy item/ gear if u wish to, you only pay if u hate grinding the game. think the system is pretty fair. i rate this 9/10 just because there is still few stupid bug within the game they need to fix.",4
"the only almost disadvantage of this game is farming for some parts, but the farming is fun. basically what that means is that there is no disadvantage of this game. play.",2
"mmmmmgeehhhhhh. needith beefy compooter. but one of the best free games ive played.",1
"this game is purely amazing. not in a long time have i played something so immersive. oh, and its free!!!! that part still blows me away for the level of quality this title is. im sure more games will take this route in the near future and i can see why when you have good games like this one being free. the only thing ive found worth real money on this game is for the color packs. (almost everything else minus also some minor cosmetics can easily be earned in the game)",5
"this game, is pure awesome :d its awesome, its got great graphics, its got great weapons, its just... awesome, get it now its free, join my clan!",3
"this game is great when u play with ur friends and or solo only bad thing about this game is all the maps look the same",1
"this game is very fun when u r with good friends or a team that really know how to play",3
"defintely the best game i have played on pc and is even up in the top 10 for my playstation. the best part is, well there isnt yet because it is in beta. it is going to be one hell of a full release.",1
"good game if you want to waste time or want to experience something different, too much grinding to my liking, no real endgame all you do is more grinding for levels gear and mods there is defensive mode and survival but that gets old fast. need some epic bosses/ raids. that been said this game is a very enjoyable shooter mmorpg with the ability to change warframes/ weapons for new style of gameplay.",4
"great game, constantly updated with new content. gives increasing difficulty to keep it from getting boring. but loses its playablity over time as most o the things in the game are repeated.",2
"a very good f2p game that actually can be played for free! you will have to grind it though, but it can be done. cool things have to be bought but there are alerts in-game that can get you blueprints to own those sexy goods. latest update polished a lot of things and made the experience even better. i strongly recommend to try dark sector too, as this game is heavily inspired on it. so give warframe a try... what can you lose if its free!",1
"i really reccommend this game, it might seem hard and bleak at the start, but once you get to later missions and a few friends, you start to get new things and the game gets a whole lot better, wait till you try void missions!!! :d 9/10",1
"always being updated with more awesome weapons and frame xd no reason to not play this massive game with 6million+ people on pc :d",5
"i think its a great game if you have a good pc it gets a bit laggy here and there but it has pretty good game play",1
"warframe is the best game ever i mean just look at the character design its the best ive ever seen nuf said =3",2
"this game is a fast paced game but the tower capturing on earth is to hard that you keep dying",1
"fun game if you can get past how lame the helmets and armor look. im not that creative but i know i coulda came up with something that actually looked mean and bad a$$ like a space ninja should, thats all... :tank:",1
"this by far the best free to play game i have ever payed the developers are constantly improving the game there are no cons about the game except that at times it can be a bit reppetitive but there slowly changing up so there is some diversity i give 20 out of 10 exceptional also ive been playing this game in early beta like right after alpha an all i can say its come a long way",6
"i wasnt impressed with the trailers., but its free to play, so i figured why not give it a shot. i have to say warframe is fast becoming one of my favorite games now. it is probably going to become my new main game. thats saying something. give it a try! character leveling, skill and weapon mods, crafting - if these are game features that appeal to you then you owe it to yourself...",10
"its great for a free to play. the pay wall is a challenge but not impossible to over come, as long as you have time. most good gear can be gotten through paying for it of course, but if you have the time most items can also be made through the games crafting system, it just requires a lot of materials that take a long time to harvest. the combat is great fun though, it feels much faster and more fluid than many mmos. however it is an instance mmo, not open world. its just a mash of match after match. at this point and time id say warframe, hawken and tera are the best f2p games out there. with a tie between warframe and tera for the best. this is also quite fun on the ps4, but it doesnt handle as well, wall running is a real challenge with a controller.",1
"omg was there ever a better 3 rd person? answer - no. i love warframe and am very progressed and good at it. i hope further updates will change a few bots though :d. 10/10 *****",2
"pretty much the only game where you can get litterally anything without paying a dime :d",1
"warframe is a fun third-person shooter where stealth, speed, and power are key to being a good player. if you really want to be a top notch player stay with the team and dont run off on your own unless your sure that you will not die and can complete an op on your own while the rest of your team deals with the harder one. i would reccomend this to the ninja-lovers, the stealth junkies, and even those who like just freerunning and parkour in video games",1
"i highly recommend this game for fans of co-op shooters, if you enjoyed mass effect 3 multiplayer this should be an easy decision.",4
"still seeing new stuff after 300 hours.. not bored yet!",5
"very fun shooter with great co-op multiplayer. however, there are a fortitude of microtransactions which can be used to either further increase your charcters power or visually. the game is competitve so i wouldnt say play-to-win; just play-to-shoot-really-simple-ai-that-can-be-easyily-outskilled-although-will-overpower-you-in-masses-win.",4
"a awesome third person shooter with many things to do and great things to play.i highly recomend this game.play solo or with someone , either way this game will strike you as fun.after your first few missions, you cant stop playing. all in all this game is a great looking game, an initially interesting game, and probably one of the best.",1
"great game, fun to get all the characters and get more weapons, great you can build more characters or buy them, i love the clan room so you can have a nice place to hang out and practice your skills with friends all together just a lot of fun to play!",2
"once you figure out what the  is going on its kinda crazy",1
"i like the gameplay and style, very fast paced and the graphics are good for todays standard",1
"a fun fast pace game with a lot of wepons to try out. the mods that you can put on your warframe and wepons and really change how you play wich leave you with a lot of things to look at when you mod your stuff.",6
"damn good game, and it gets more and more content every major update. 19 (i think) warframes to choose from, compared to the original like, 6. thats a big leap in gameplay and content. every planet has unique areas now, and there are outdoor environments as well. the story adds to the gameplay because the more you play the more lore you learn.",9
"unending glory. customize, level up, party, pvp!!! beautiful graphics, omg.... :)",1
"this game is extremely unique, it combines elements from many genres and combines them into a mixture that fits perfectly. de made a game with pieces of sci-fi, co-op, rpg, third person shooters, pvp, pve, and a very nice microtransaction system that works well together. the store is another great thing about the game. the prices are incredibly low compared to other games with the same cash system. for example, in league of legends a certain cosmetic skin could cost upwards of 20 dollars. in this game a skin would cost around 5 dollars. the shop allows players to access items faster, but it allows people to obtain the items through playing the game as well, thereby removing any pay to win factor. in summary, this game is a combination of elements that equals a fantastic experience that everyone should be a part of.",1
"this is easily the best free to play game ive played of 2013.",5
"its a really fun game with fast action combat with fun parkour style movements and interesting options for the games focal combat exoskeletons and weapon combinations.",1
"best tps i have ever played and it is not necessary to spend anything on the game unless you want to ! and the best part is you can build your own weapons theres no need to buy them with real cash although the crafting time needs to be lowered and so as the warframes crafting time it isnt big of a deal..try it out its really fun to cut mobs in half with your sword..which you made..and which u modded..",1
"the menus seem a little awkard to me. the game play is pretty cool. i dont like the platinum system however i do understand that you need to pay for this game somehow.",1
"recommend playing, you will enjoy this game, i have no doubt.",6
"every update digital extreme puts out on warframe improves on an already solid, great game.",1
"describe this game in one word? o............m..............g!!!!!!!!!!!",2
"game is simple and funy and every update its geting beter and beter",2
"warframe is one of the most addicting games i have ever played. it is so fun and i reccommend it to anyone with alot of spare time on there hands. although there is still some glitches and bugs inside the game but they are just minor bugs they are not really bad.",4
"i love paraclimbing, the fun of falling from the highest part of the ceiling, shooting lightning as volt from that height feels sooo rewarding.",1
"warframe is a great game, it has so much to only be in beta. i cant wait to see what the devs have in store for us next.",2
"the game is awesome,the movement of the character isnt something that you see every day. only thing it requires from the player is not bad aiming skill.and the game is pretty intense,dont forget to take a break sometimes.",1
"ninjas in space using galatic wepons with a woman guiding you its a dream coming true",5
"still teething problems with joining friends, but excellent otherwise. great gameplay and great system. wish there was more to the other factions, different enemies etc.",4
"definitely a solid game for those who enjoy pve fps and collections or challenges. most notable features, in my opinion, would be the clan dojo, boss fights, and mods for your character and weapons. basically a slightly repetitive dungeon crawler with achievements.",3
"love this game! really fun. interesting to play with the different warframes.",4
"great game , not too much for tactical insight , but its a great game to advance forward that gives challanges if they could had a little more tactic to that game it should be great .",1
"good game and all... but why all of sudden is it continuing to say login failed, cannot connect to server. how can it not connect to server. my internet is obviously working, cause im writing this message, google chrome works find. uninstalling till you can find a way to solve this issue -___-",1
"free-to-play, very good graphic, much weapons / levels / mods... omg guys, play it!!!1111 :) :) :)",5
"i really like this game because the graphics are good, theres single player aswell as multiplayer and there are loads of things to have fun with. if your patient and like the things i just listed, then warframe the game for you.",1
"extremely enjoyable coop experience. even being in beta, it offers more fun than a lot of other games. small amount of maps can make it a bit repetitive, but slicing enemies in half or punching them to the moon never gets old.",5
"warframe is an amazing game with lots of action, fast game play, costomizble things and enemies to kill. id recomend any one to play it but play it with a friend and or friends for the best satisfaction.",4
"warframe is a cooperative free-to-play third person online action game set in an evolving sci-fi world. which is pretty cool weapons are awesome sword fights are legit and the parkour is something to be looking forward to all warframe are awesome and epic, just know which is your style",1
"this game is good but the begining is slow and get better and bettter",1
"what always impressed me with this game was how the launch trailer animation is... well... just slightly dramatised gameplay. its literally what the game is, everything the ninjas do in it are actions you can do in the game (albeit animated slightly better), its not some ot korean mmo intro. its super ethical advertisement and i love it. overall its a good game and i suggest it. its free anyway so you lose nothing trying.",2
"this game is really fun and addicting. you should all play it.",1
"cool game! the graphics are ace. over all a cool game and well worth the download. be nice to see the finished version.",1
"warframe is amazing. awesome graphics and combat and character and weapon customization",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. perfect space ninja game. i give it 44 out of 6 space potatoes.",2
"suprised how good this looks and plays. your not gimped for not spending money, but i suspect the pinch will be soon. like the coop aspect. very pretty game. can see myself playing this for a bit.",1
"an excellent hybrid game that tries to combine all the good things of todays mmos, and does a fantastic job at it. warframe is enjoyable for hundred to even thousands of hours of gameplay, just give it a try i know youll like it. ;)",3
"space ninjas. ninjas in space. a bit slow to start, as most f2p games are, but hang in there a bit and you can have a lot of fun for not a lot of money. pros: -fun combat -very diverse weapons and warframes -most everything is aquirable without having to spend money cons: -it can get a bit repetitive, but taking a break from it for awhile seems to remedy this -you will have to pay money for slots to get more weapons and warframes",4
"i think this game so far has full potential and pretty awesome. sliding and pressing the melee buton making your twirl like a girl with a swords pretty arousing. the only thing i can say thats bad about this game is the fact you need platinum coins to do everything. and it takes 1,000,000 credits to get a blueprint, a whole month to get the resources, you spend more money, and you have to wait for it to be built. besides that, this games pretty awesome.",1
"really enjoyable to play and im not sure why we have to get a key to be in our clan",1
"fun, but takes a decent amount of grinding to level up weapons and warframes and they want money for a lot of items with no other way to attain them.",2
"games pretty good only been playing for 3 months and im impressed with what is has to offer. have any questions about it ask. dont know how to say it but parkour like assassians creed. mixed with mass effect i would say.",2
"i love this game its well developed awesome graphics but need weapon that we can buy using ingame money.",4
"this is a great game, it is a third person shooter for those fps gamers. love this game id say its one of my favorites.",1
"game is fun, you have to earn your weapons and your suit. you first get a gun/weapon blue print buy at store or find as a drop (boss, chest ect) then you need to craft the gun. you find all the items you need to craft the item and then wait around 12 hours for it to build. now if you dont want to play you could always pay, just buy everything and be the best.",2
"for an fps, this really has a neat story to it. i like the action, even plays well on a laptop. (although the default video settings were way to high; whatever happened to autodetect?) for free, this really is quite good - so far i dont get that gimme money, you stupid little monkeys! vibe as seen in so many free android/ios games where that is rampant. smooth action and highly detailed models. ton of customizations (when purchased or unlocked). * <2 hr in-game so far",1
"yes - very worth while f2p - download and play a few hours",2
"this a very good third person mmorpg and whoever doesnt think it would be good then try it you will get hooked",1
"best 3rd person shooter yet with some knife action",1
"warframe for a free-to-play game is very light on demanding money from you to get the most out of the game, in fact i see no reason to spend money at all. the fun pacing of the gameplay and the ability to work towards getting anything you want for free (without a korean amount of grinding) eliminates the need. unless there is something very specific you want from the start, which you can most likely purchase for $10 worth of in game credit, which is pretty reasonable. the rpg style leveling and hunting for upgrades during missions leaves a very satisfying taste to your play. the visuals are gorgeous and the combat is intuitive once you get a handle on the controls. youre playing nano-ninjas retaking the galaxy, whats not to like?",7
"*a great free to play game* i played warframe during its first months of release for around 10 hours. at that moment i felt that there was still a lack of content to keep me playing the game so i stopped. then during the 1st year anniversary of the game, there was a free gun for free so play again but i was late to login to receive the free gun :( nevertheless, the gameplay was all of the same which is good. new contents!! actually lots of it!! and neverending fun unless you run out of slots to put your warframe/weapons since you have to pay to increase capacity. so just use the free 50 credits when u start playing ^^ or jsut sell your rank 30 things :] *around 50hours played when this review was written*",1
"it is a very fun game no doubt, but after a while, missions seem repetetive and get old. luckily they are adding more things to the game.",3
"this is a pretty fun game after you learn the ropes. they have been improving the tutorial system since i first started but the beginning was pretty rough. there is a lot content, systems, and mechanics that dont make immediate sense. i loved the 200+ missions that you can do, the only downside to this is that there is a set amount of missions types so they become repetitive eventually. also when youre done with all the missions youre not left with much to do other than trying to acquire rare weapons or warframes. prepare for a grind. how long you can enjoy that is up to each player, i was fine for a while, but it just gets old. the dev team gives you weekly updates/patches and great support, kudos to them for that. its a f2p game, pick it up, play with some friends. youll have fun.",4
"very grindy, youll be waiting a while until you get some good equipment and weapons, but once you do, the game becomes somewhat fun, its good if youre into grindy games. you also have the option to speed things up with some real currency, but its a tad bit overpriced for a free to play game, worth checking out none the less.",1
"plays very smoothly and allows you to adapt to your class of choice. is unlike any computer game ive evers seen and has a improved way of play like online phone games. reminds me alot of wow in the way the game is played with other people throug the missions, and a charactor range like lol with all of the classes being balanced but overpowered for people who have found a class that best suits them. with all of the comparsons to other great games, it improves on them and makes something extremely addicting and new!",1
"good. strong graphics and great multiplayer gameplay. if you dont have any friends, dont play this.",1
"you like ninjas? you like space? you like guns? you like swords? you like space ninjas with guns and swords in space!? this is the game for you and your friends and basically everyone on the whole internet ever.",2
"amazing game considering its free. killer game play, brutal combat, and awesome graphics make this a choice game for me.",1
"just epic! ninja style melee combined with amazing shooting action & upgradable weapons.",3
"great tps that is f2p. all the updates make the game way better than it was in update 9. its so great! i love it! its muddaf****************************************************************************************************king cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooollllllllllllllllllllll",1
"this game has space ninjas in space..... that sold me there",1
"by far the most action packed, unique, and flat out fun free to play game ive ever had the pure pleasure of beta testing. ive been with warframe since the closed beta, back when it was just plain ol loki, volt, and excaliber, back when mag was the hot-class everyone was trying to get... this game has grown so much and im glad to feel like part of the family watching it grow from so young to what it is today. i love this game with a passion. its a keeper on my hard drive.. remember fellow tenno, ninjas play free.",1
"i was a bit sceptical at first. you know, it being free to play and all. but then i realised that you can always get stuff for free, it had great gameplay and to put the cherry on top you can parkour.",1
"well on its way to becoming the interwebs next top mmorpg. highly recommended, even in its beta form.",1
"very fun co-op mode with diverse mission and really nice graphics and great hybrid between meele combat and gunplay give this game a go and its free only gripe with the game is the ai not that smart. i give it 9/10",1
"i recommend this game because the graphics, movement, and gameplay are really good, they really thought of something that everyone would like.",4
"step one: eat children. step two; play the f*** out of this game until your f***ing stubs for hands bleed and f***ing die of malnorishment. step three: resume step one after step two. step four: ??? step five: profit.",5
"badass game, yes it has some glitches and the wait for building weapons and new warframes is unbelievable but soo worth it! i give it a good 7.5/10. dont knock it till you try it, it will be worth it!",2
"great f2p with paid upgrades. quick in and out missions allow those with limited play time to still get in accomplish something and get out without having to spend hours just to prepare.",1
"really awesome game! i wish i found the right people to play with... but overall really awesome! i really enjoy all of the new things they keep bringing in...",2
"this game is amazing!!! you play as frigging super space ninjas from space and kick extra terrestrial butt. other than some minor grinding and annoying micro transactions, it is one of the best co-op action games since left 4 dead!! do yourself a favor and download this game and get some friends to download it, then play together. 9/10",1
"i love this game it is so cool but the dlc is to much but the game is awsome",1
"better than i expected. its a bit complex but i recommend. 8/10",1
"its a great fast pace game like a better free third person halo with more energy sowrds aliens gunes power armour and annoying computer people to get your head around",1
"this game is the definition of amazing. if you love ninja gaiden 3, halo, and borderlands, this game is perfect for you. i cant tell you how much i loved this game from the very beginning. 9,001/10",1
"warframe is a unique game. i havent seen many games which give you this kind of control over a character, nor so many customization options. every time you go into a mission you have an infinite number of possibilities for how to tackle it. different loadouts are more successful than others, and that will depend on the mission youre taking on and your playstyle. the character-building aspect, although there are no skill points to spend, is deeper than most mmos, and i think its a good change. everyone is on a level playing field, and the most hardcore veteran still has a few frames that he hasnt maxed for the times when he wants to let others pick up the slack for a change. the game exudes polish and charm, and playing it doesnt get old very quickly. high replay value, tons of content to play through, highly reccomend giving it a day or two of play. the games only weakness is its learning curve, but tough it out and youll find a game thats easy to play but hard to master.",5
"this game is sooooo awsome and adicting.me and my friend played one whole day and i feel this is one of the best pc games ive ever played",1
"whats the best time to play warframe? tennoclock",1
"really fun have not had this much fun since gears of war on a 3rd person shooter.",2
"v much techno ninja yes yes v space ship much unts vvvvvvv pew pew",1
"great graphics and a fun co-op experience attempt to make up for a terrible ai system and repetetive gameplay and maps. controls work well, yet there isnt many combat options. this game would be definitly recommended for anyone who is broke, has a bunch of friends, and some time to kill. 6.8/10",1
"the game is good but its ing  for me why the game crashes when i attack or left click it just straight away crashes last time i played it about last year it doesnt crash thanks to the new update the game just got a pain in the .",1
"i have to say before warframe i have had a bad experience of games in beta and was hesitant to get it.however so far the game has run very smoothly and i have had a great time fighting with other players.considering that its free theres no reason you shouldnt have this in your library",1
"this game is very fun to play and i recommend you to play this f2p game if you like shooting but also a bit of rpg-ing. lots of different frames, weapons and mods to lvl up. only negative thing is the connection to server problems sometimes, but that doesnt ruin the gameplay.",2
"its awesome,i love the graphics and the gameplay.just...great work!",3
"only played for a few hours but with what ive experienced in that time ill definitely be coming back and playing some more!",1
"brilliant game for those who like the whole android samurai third person shooter type games in space going from planet to planet lvling up and upgrading personally i love this game.",1
"space ninjas or as the people want it to be space vikings in ninja suits",8
"played alot of games of all types.the graphics ,illistration,the all around make up of the game in my opinoin is awesome .make sure you get a good video graphics card you will need it.alot of detai, and work in this game .good job digital extremes nicely done!!!!",1
"clean design, fast-paced environment, and loads of content to immerse yourself in. definitely worth a try to say the bare minimum.",1
"really fun game cant wait to try out all the new goodies",1
"amazing, extremely fun, i dont think i can put down this game in any way other than why is it free?. if anyone sees how fun this game is and doesnt download it, i will come to their house, slap them, download it and force them to play it.",1
"tons of fun for a free to play.....as terrible and unquoteworthy as that is",2
"a must-have game! stop reading the reviews, really, just download since its free. i mean free right? who doesnt want freebies?! <awesome game btw.",2
"this is an extreamly fun game slightly repetativ at times but that is eserly fogoten as the graphecs are amazing! the controlls are grate gun and sowd play are good some times runing up or acrros a wall can be a bit awcward ; also each warframe (class) have unique abilatys one can call upon the dead to hellp and one can controll magnetic forces. 8/10 amazing (",2
"power ranger esc ninjas in space!!!! why wouldnt you play it?!",1
"warframe is a very fun and addictive game,but it has a few problems. ill go over what i like about it first, and then the bad will be next. the good: this game shines no matter what graphical setting its on. the gunplay is fantastic. all classes a.k.a frames are unique. you dont haft to spend money to get what you want, just find them and build them in a r&d lab. very active player base. the dojo is the coolest concept ive seen for guild hideouts. dojos are like small building with pvp and stores in it, and its pretty easy to get lost in one. co-op is fun! the bad: very repetitive. some frames will out class others in endgame content. because you dont haft to buy things, it can take days to finish items you find in the research lab. some weapons are user level locked;meaning you haft to level your account to get certain weapons. random players who try to rush maps. hard to solo. and thats about it. if you enjoy games like borderlands and monster hunter, then this will be enjoyable to you. ive put in over 300+ hrs before i got burnt out, but in that time i enjoyed my experience. 3/5",5
"sweeeeeet! reasons why i like this game: amazaing graphics, best combat, everything bro!!!",1
"i cant believe this game is free. if you dont get this game, youre totally missing out. it is an amazing game.",1
"great third person shooter ninja action rpg-like game. great game for ninja lovers :d you can go stealth, gung-ho or hack and slash. whatever you prefer, its there. game can get grindy but thats what you would expect from something with an rpg leveling feel.",1
"first, its ftp; granted it is somewhat pay-to-win in a sense that one can purchase weapons as opposed to collecting; however, it still has many elements i would look for in a game i would spend money on. that being said, i think that it is worth at least trying. especially given that its space ninjas.. needs more decapitation..",1
"great game 8/10 bit grindy at times but good, no pay walls either in the last 100 hours i bought 100$ of plat just to support them, thats how good it is.",6
"this game is a really great. very unique setting. cool gunplay, melee combat. art is amazing. i dont think anyone has pulled off space ninjas/samurai yet, but they have there. good rpg elements and character (warframe) optimization. fair free to play model. you can have a load of fun for nothing. i dont think much is not available for a ftp player willing to put in the time. highly recommended. critic scores on metacritic are completely bogus, as usual. if you like shooters, think a progressive element with a lot of optimization and choice is fun, and want a setting that is actually new, look no further. oh! even runs well on older machines in my experience! i have some 5 year old middle end amd/ati gaming computers that run is very well. your mileage may vary, but for how cool it looks im impressed.",1
"free to play? hells yeah it will give it a try. sadly there are pay-to-win aspects in the classic dual currency system. the game features an amazingly fun movement system, but do your reseach. not novice friendly at all for it takes so much time to get into. warframe is diablo meets prince of persia meets ninja gaiden meets rage meets mass effect.",1
"warframe is the game if you really want to be a ninja even when you play it",1
"great multiplayer you will need a mic to talk to people to tell them your position",1
"a nice and beautiful game for shooter fans. graphics are awesome in this game. this game needs strong connection in the internet or else the game will be trash. i hope that this game can be played offline too...",1
"this game is a departure from the normal multiplay shooter experience in many positive ways. not only is the concept really fascinating, but the gameplay is solid and fun. and hey - space ninjas.",1
"its a great game,with multiple playing options.very entertaining especially for people who like to switch things up...and its free.9/10",6
"this game is amazing! the graphics are nice, game play is superb and this game, overall, is like a different genre of gaming itself. in my opinion. just saying.",1
"its hard at first but once you get used to it, it will get better and its really fun to play with friends too.",1
"love this game, but whats not to love about space ninjas. my only real problem with it is that it keeps crashing on certain levels. thankfully though, it hasnt crashed on any important missions for me yet.",1
"very fun 3rd person shooter, always lots of things to do and work for in this game to keep you interested for a good long time",3
"for a free game. this takes the cake. yes i absolutely recommend this game! it has a good story and has infinate things to do.",5
"do you like ninjas? good. do you like space? good. that means you like space ninjas with magical powers. i highly urge you to get this game, and join the tenno cause.",1
"for people who like shooting games and ninja aliens. its great for multyplayer and very fun.",1
"this is like gunz online ( the original peer to peer installed version) compbined with rengoku 2 stairway to hevan.",2
"yes. just yes. the only comment i have to make is that the crafting system is a little unclear, but othewise this game is amazing!",1
"i love the graphics, the weapons and everything else for free! i truly recommend this game",1
"very fun, not completely pay to win, and have yet to see a hacker so thats good. i just wish for better level design because i get lost too often.",1
"youre a space ninja wizard. youre probably evil. youre going to love the 300 different ways you can kill a man.",2
"slow on start up, but once you start to experience middle and late game content, it becomes incredibally addicting. devs are great and listen to the community and they add constant updates to fix small and large problems alike. 9/10",8
"warframe is a very unique sci-fi third person action shooter game. you play one of many different warframes each with their own unique abilities and looks. your main weapons consist of a primary weapon (usually a rifle) and a secondary weapon (usually a pistol). but you also have your sword in which has fast paced hack-n-slash action. mix all of these together with equally fast paced gameplay, satisfying loot drops, and deep weapon and skill leveling and you have one hell of a fun sci-fi game. this game is absolutely addicting. its so much fun, i would recommend this to everyone. free to play? cant beat that!",1
"i wish that this was on mac. creators make a mac version!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"technical warfare, abilities, custom guns oh my! great game.",1
"fun an addicting clans are very acitve get it an start playing but u will never get off",2
"paying for anything in this game is pricey so dont spend too much on platinum. but as far as free to play games go, this is one of my favorites. its constantly throwing stuff at you to do, and i feel like im missing out on some nice item or other if i dont check regularly. the combat and damage system are incredibly indepth. combining elements to create new damage types is extremely rewarding. few games manage to make you feel as much of a badass ninja, as this one. great game, but still in beta.",2
"this game is cool. i will recomend it but if you are going to be a new player you may spend money to rank up faster. thats the one problem i got also that it can be challanging. i hope to make some of you play this good game.",6
"i really enjoy this game, there are elements of hack and slash, gunplay, stealth, and rpg the worlds are beautiful the hidden secrets i find all over the diffrent maps give me many hours of fun.",5
"best game n.a. - has ninjas,swords,guns,boobs - would play again, if resurrected as a barn owl!!!! - saryn so.... kawaii se... sempai! - best story ive seen to date, better than mlp fan-fiction!!!!!! - little girls and boys cant even handle this review right now!!!!!! - you thought that ftp games where lame you where ing wrong son!!!!! - 10/10 would bang! then lock up in basement for another session!!!!! over all this game is an excellent with friends, that i dont have...... cough* p.s - skirts if you read this i have a crush on you ~<3",3
"some games are only as good as long as the story holds. usually these last one, maybe two playthroughs for me, and i go back to my online games. with warframe, i get the best of both worlds: the story is ever-expanding, and it has mmo-esk, yet instanced gameplay. i may get sick of it every now and again, but this is the game i keep coming back to. warframe promotes learning more about the game and its developers, and getting attached to the community. not many games can get me to want to do that.",6
"this game has a very intuitive gameplay style which is one of many addictive aspects of the game. its an open beta game completely free where you get to play as space mercenaries called the tenno who are a group of super space ninjas. listen guys.. let me put it this way.. free space ninjas get it get it!",6
"dope game. good graphics, fast paced over the shoulder action ; only gripes are that there needs to be more enemy variety, as well as most of the missions feel....kind of the same? run through complex from point a to b style. luckily theres ninja parkour moves, which makes traversing the levels more enjoyable. both issues that i have about it can be fixed with (hopefully) future updates & patches. otherwise top-notch game.",1
"for a free game its preety addicting once you know what your doing",2
"warframe a game where you never feel satisfied with where you are at an always wanna play more an more. at every turn of this game i felt intertwined with the world of warframe from the graphics to the amazing gameplay. its free to play an has a in game store which you need platinum for but if you find yourself playing for more than a year i believe you will buy some with real money. as the game stats in its title you play as warframes an you can craft every single one or you can buy them all but thatd cost you some hefty moola. it is very satisfying to make your warframe as you find yourself more inwraped in the game world as you make them. you feel accomplished after you spent the hours farming for the nessasary materials to make the things you need. an nearly everything in the game you can craft just cost credits which is what you can earn by just completing missions. from guns the swords this game hits the spot for action an if you like hack an slashing game or more gun approach then this game is for you. i found myself putting hours into this game an only wanna put more. ive made 4 warframes an bought 2 an i only wish to get more. they all add a different role to the game. if i did a review on this game id give it a 8/10!",2
"little repetitive, but love the huge customization possabilities, great weapons. love it.",4
"such a good game sure you have too wait 12 hrs to craft  but hey you can get any weapon for crafting aaannnyyyyy you can also craft warframes,sentiels, for the standard plat. oh and the combat hollyy  it is epic.",1
"i was a pirate that turned into a puddle... 10/10! but seriously this game is fantastic. the best free to play game that ive played and it has me playing and playing. this is a great game thats action packed, pakour ninja running, slicing enemys in half and so much more. it has tons of weapons and has warframes which are the things you controll that all have theyre unique abilitys (a pirate based frame is one of them). anyways i suggest that you get this game because it is amazing and endless fun",4
"great game with constant universe and content expansion, everything is accessible through simply playing, and space ninjas...",9
"casual enough for a quick run whenever theres time but with unexpected depth in terms of customization and crafting. pugging with strangers is perfectly feasible (other than with, say, payday2 where i consider voice comms essential). its definitely not pay2win as you get most items with credits earned by playing the game. only certain weapons seem to be real-money exclusive. as are slots for additional warframes, but the initial 50 platinum will buy you 2 free slots already, for a total of 4 warframes. pretty good package, gorgeous graphics and level design and immense amounts of fun. 10/10",2
"warframe reminds me of masseffect game which i addicted to :d",1
"its a fun actioner that you can play mindlessly if you want to blow off steam, but with plenty of crafing and levelling to keep me fiddling around! i definitely enjoy its co-op nature.",2
"its cyborg ninjas, in space! highly recommend. if youd be willing to help me out, please use my referral link!",2
"i play this game now for several moth and it doesent become boring. there is always new content to play and equipment to gain. so even if you think you are finished there will come a patch and theres somthing new for you to explore.",7
"this is a great game the only downside is long waiting times to get new items",3
"warframe is a free to play co-op game created by gamersfirst aka the designer that brought the mmo known as apb and other free to play games. your character is a warframe that a exoskeleton suit that grants you incredible powers and you are assigned dangerous missions across the galaxy. these missions vary from standard exterminate, survival, sabotage, spy, deception, defense, mobile defense, capture, rescue, and assassination missions. each mission will take place in a randomly generated dungeon so it may seem a little different each time, but you will find yourself in the same repetitive environments. there is a variety warframes, weapons, mods, and other equipment that you can use in your missions, but to access these you must either craft them which takes hours or days to build these items or buy them with platinum (real money currency). overtime while you complete missions, over this span of time you will level up your warframe granting more health, shields, mod space, and power. overall warframe is a fun mmo, but beware if you arent into grinding, gathering materials from missions, in game shops, working with others, or waiting to obtain items due to crafting you will not like this game.",1
"addictively fun ....multilvling options and challenging content building of weapons and warframes , guilding and progression. all and all a well rounded game for fps and amazing graphics for a free to play",1
"a great co-op game,play with your friends for maximum fun,it may look like another cheap pay 2 play shooter game,but this is the real deal.i highly recommend it,it also gives you this awesome i am a ninjaaaahhhhhhhhhhh feeling. so in a nutshell,warframe is anything but an ordinary f2p game.",1
"awesome gameplay. the items and weapons are a tad expensive, but its great for a free to play.",1
"for ages i didnt play this and sadly it looks like im not alone because you get a good quality 3rd person shooter offering both pve and pvp gameplay and a fair amount of depth. this game could do with an influx of players and its free, so give it a go. you have nothing to lose.",1
"the best manouverability i have seen in a game, with amazing graphics and gameplay this will redifine your defination of agood free game!",2
"you can use a sword 10/10 would slice with a sandwhich",2
"forewarning: you need a fairly good computer to run this game at the moment, my favorite game on steam, very fun with friends and even solo allthough, the game is pretty much a massive grind-fest, its fun to grind for everything tons of replayability, with the huge amount of weapons, some of which require a clan updated fairly often, with each major update adding a warframe, a few weapons, new mods, and occasionally, a new planet at the moment, have 46.4 hours on it, and just now getting my second warframe (ember incase you were wondering, oberons coming up in a few though) one thing i need to say you pretty much need to be committed to progress in the game im saying like 5 or more missions every time you start up the game other than that, youll fall behind anyways, very good game, its free anyway, and pretty much everything you can get by paying with platinum, you can get just by playing the game, only things that you cant get are the syandanas and some of the accessories for the frames",3
"great game but takes a little too long to get stuff without paying real money,but if thats my only complaint it has to be a good game!",1
"overall a decent game! either you play it or you dont! rng and alot of farming gogo..",3
"its good fast paced action with a multitude of weapons and characters to play. most stages will keep you on your toes and really test your ability with your reflexes and often your ability to cooperate with other people should you chose to go at it multiplayer. game is fun and really lasts a good time on ya. the only negative about the game to me is the build times on new weapons or warframes that you want to play, apart from that its a great game.",5
"really well looking game u can get all stuff in store just by playing game but it will take forever but really good game",2
"you get to be a space ninja with awesome special abilities. you use those special abilities, and an impressive arsenal of weapons, to slaughter robots, zombies, and space marines. and its just so satisfying.",3
"i reccomend this game to all gamers that like action packed games.",1
"well it is self explanatory if you like cutting some ones torso in half or you like to cut some ones head off it is for you.",1
"hands down one of the best free to pay games ive played if a long time",3
"really good game, recommended to everyone who loves good shotting game",1
"this game is brilliant its fun and you play as some badass ninjas in space what else could you want",2
"play this game it is so much fun just download it now and doo it",1
"although there are obvious grinding elements, the gameplay itself is fun enough that you dont mind.",2
"it reminds me of metal gear rising, its a lot of fun when you play with friends, next gen engine, and an adictive modeling system, i recomend it",1
"its a really fun game to play with your friends :d",4
"the game itself is great, but it is not a third person shooter. i hope im just not verse with the controls, but by all indications it is the same as a first person shooter, please send the details of what i missed, otherwise i cant play this game but those who love this type of action will love it",1
"this game is one of the best free to play games of all time.",1
"their is only one thing that can discribe the game wtf, space ninjas space ninjas you would think this was some crudy atempt at getting close to a final fantisty game but hell no, you would download the game thinking a well got a couple of hours to kill and i am bored of my games i will see whats on the steam f2p but after playing the first mission and killing a death squad of grinire you will come to terms of how friging amazing this game is a mean come on the litiral 4hours of game lore are enough to keep you going for a nother 100 hours and thats not including all of the strange and just badass warframes and weapons. so after that what can you say other than wtf",2
"very fun free-to-play, successfuly makes you feel like a space ninja. has been updated massivly with lots of very good fixes and addons throughout beta period. would recomend",1
"best game ive played in years, active devs that listen to the community, updates every week with a lot of content, many hotfixes, not pay 2 win!!",7
"straight amazing. absolutely love it. ashamed to admit, but is representing when i say, i spent over 100 hrs in one week playing this and did not get bored at all. 1000/10 lol",1
"its a good game but it needs more work bugs are there and there but its worth wasting your time on it",1
"this is the best game ever made i play this on ps4 and pc when away from home get this an add me on steam",1
"very fun f2p game. theyve done transactions pretty well in that the best/most rare gear in game cant be bought but has to be earned, and anything that can be bought can also be crafted/found without an inordinate amount of time. plus its like diablo with space ninjas so how rad is that?",1
"this game. this game. i have played quite a few third-person shooters, but my main complaint was that most of them were simply fps-style gameplay, just over the shoulder of your character. the standard, run-shoot-take cover deal. not this game though. with a variety of weapons, characters that have their own skills and powers, and a slick melee/free running mechanic, this game is one of the most fun third person shooters i have played yet. the fact that it is also free helps. no, this game is not pay-to-win, if you were worried about that. there is a market system, but most, if not all weapons and armors can be forged with in-game currency and resources dropped from enemies. perks like colors and the occasional ninja scarf do requrire cash, but they are only there if you want them. overall, i give this game two thumbs up. if you were worried by that metacritic score, dont be. this is a good, lasting game that is frequently updated by a developer that acutally listens to player feedback. i can only see this game getting better in the future.",2
"*must download!!!!* third person fps + rpg style gameplay + borderlands 2 super improved graphics + looting items, crafting and upgrading weapons, modifying skins and weapon colours, adding mods to weapons and leveling up! bored of rts and mmorpgs and mobas? give this game a try!",6
"y u so gud, no really this game plays well, feels well and is much fun with many people. i highly suggest that everyone try it at least once.",2
"really sharp graphics and particles. blows ps4 and xbox one away. the f2p model isnt bad either. you can craft all the items that would cost real money if you just have patience.",1
"its really good, so many things to unlock and alot of updates too.",1
"a great game for people that like to run and gun and stab, slash and parry from time to time. i dont know why youre still reading this, just download this game already!!!!",1
"really good game well put together. i found this game to be a lot of fun really well put together for a free to play game not all f2p games are this well thought out. down side if you play with someone who has cash to spend you may be a bit put off at how fast there growing and how slow your growing, but this is to be said for most if not all f2p games. i say play and have fun doing so.",1
"very well done f2p game, and it is constantly being improved and fixed. gameplay can get abit repetitive after a good few hours played but as u level and open more options (warframes, weps etc) u can swap out a warframe and play through matches in stealth and such, adding more life to the game. great game to play with friends in teams of 4 taking on survival maps. highly recommend.",9
"very fun and addicting game, must try. the graphics are amazing and the gameplay is awesome.",1
"this game is wounderfull for a f2p game. i reconmend that everyone atleast trys this game of space ninjias.",1
"it has ninjas in space, great graphics, amazing community. what more could you want.",6
"you get to be a bad  space ninja with swords,guns, and all kinds of skills so why the hell not play it. also its still in open beta so chances are it can only get better! :d",6
"its a solid third-person shooter with a few interesting mechanics. the sci-fi setting and ninja gameplay may not be for all players, but it changes enough that it is worth at least a try with a few friends.",1
"i am incrediby fond of waframe, as not only does it offer aa funmult-player experience, it isnt much of a play to win game. most or all items that you can purchase can be made, which is a fairly hard thing to find in a lot of newer games, especially with micro-transations now being a thing. i love the work the developers put into the game and the fact that they listen to their community and work with them to create the best experience, even if it takes breaking a few things to get there. the level and character designs (ember prime, valkyr and the glaive prime in the recent update especially) are incredibly beautiful and there is an ever-growing list of frames to choose from. definitely give warframe a try, theres nothing to lose except time :)",5
"its a new style of combat thats easy to get used to, fun times to be had, its definitely worth a shot.",1
"fun game to play, especially with friends. amazing visuals, and a variety of roles which you can fill; whether it be an assassin, tank, disruptor or support, you can have them all. and the best part of this all... every weapon and warframe is free. just gather materials, and build them with hard time. trust me. its fun.",9
"its one of the few games i have that i enjoy on a casual level, great graphics for a f2p. not to mention the devs are always listening to the player base, which is always important. i personally give this game a 8/10.",10
"its a great game, with stunning visuals and impressive mechanics for a ftp game, and it has an incredible amount of content. the actions like wallrunning and rolling around like a true ninja makes it feel like you are actually a warrior taking on massive amounts of enemies through superior skill and cunning. the downsides come into their own when you take a look at two things. one, the stealth aspect. its great to pull off a stealth kill, but unfortunately it most likely wont happen more than one or two times in a mission, because the enemies are always aware of where you are as soon as you have been noticed once, regardles of whether they actually saw you enter the room or not. the second part is the business model. should you happen to be a fan of incredible weaponry, prepare to pay. a lot of guns take more than $5 to unlock, which is straddling the line between microtransactions and macro transactions. despite these flaws, its still a great game, albeit a bit grindy if you do not want to pay for the weapons.",2
"a pretty nice dungeon-based system game where you run around accompanied by 3 other people and do different objectives. has rpg elemets.",4
"an amazing game free to play game. i love the gameplay style with the sword and weapons!",1
"i am very proud of where this game has gone in the past few months. it started out as a very good game, but the gameplay was repetitive due to the lackluster spaceship battles. since adding a ton of new weapons and maps/game modes, i see it as the game has come a long way. i feel that it will only get better as obt goes on.",2
"so much fun! im not even lvl 2 yet but my friends and i are already addicted! besides a few glitches, this is by far my fav. f2p game on the steam store! i love this game and am looking forward to buying it on ps4.",1
"an awesome squad bassed fps. love the weapons and the customisation with enough stuff to keep you occupied for hours.",3
"freakin awesome, horrible idea to download during finals.",7
"one of the most best tps game ever!, like much to be excalibur! xd",1
"with my previous experiance of the closed beta, the game was fun and very interesting. now getting back into it and playing it on steam it has improved overall, graphic quality, content, varity of different locations and missions.",1
"i find this game to be a solid alright its a time sink (majorly), it takes around 2-3 days to make a new warframe(new class) after collecting all the pieces. unless you pay for the warframe then you get it automatically, you may like this game if you like leveling up, playing the same maps which may get repetitive, farming. i give this game a 7/10, it is a time sink but it can get highly repetitive.",1
"great tps/action/stealth game. good game with fast action, intense, varied combat with interesting enemies that range from alien marines to strange creatures. big world to explore with beautiful locations. melee combat is my favourite feature here with my new sword and the fantastic gore that feels great to slice enemies open. i also like the space ninja theme here too. good customisation, good progression. totally recommended",1
"this game has a nice style to it, blending a mission based rpg-like style with 3rd person shooting and epic melee weapon fighting and parkour. theres about 20 classes to pick from, 3 to choose when starting the game and the others you have to build. if you want to play this game it will take a bit of a time investment, and sadly a lot of things in the game make me believe its created by ea (too many things cost real money) but its worth it in my opinion. every item that you can build takes real time, adding an interesting quirk to the game. its very fun to run on walls and jump off assisnating the first enemy you see and continue flying around guns blazing killing everyone to comeplete the mission, or if it fits your style more, you can also do the whole mission stealthy. the game even lets you hack the alarm system to regain stealth in case you get caught. i almost forgot to mention the graphics... 9/10 grahpics. it looks beautiful and the design of items and character models is amazing. one thing, always turn off verticle sync in the display settings. if you dont, the game will lag for no reason. overal amazing game but takes a bit of a time investment to get your stuff personalized (getting the class, or warframe, that you want, getting the weapons you want, etc).",2
"i dont have many hours logged yet, but i can say a few things about this game. firstly, it is very fun and innovative[for its genre] second, the match making or squad finder or whatever you want to call it is nifty as hell, people can join whenever and usually at moments when you need them. third, despite all ive said it is almost 100% pay to play. its free, yes, but after a certain point you have to start putting money into it if you want to stop dying, or get new weapons or armor or abilities, but, if you either keep grinding and keep your head down or throw a few bucks into the game, it is one of the best games ive ever played. i hope too see you planetside!",1
"if you want a game that rewards cleverness and skill, a game that allows you to take almost any appoach to solo or small team infiltration missions, allows endless possibilities for customization and allows you to create all of your equipment in a monster hunter style kill and loot style... warframe is for you. this game combines the gunplay and ability useage of mass effect 3 (minus the cover mechanic) with nearly the same wall running/climbing level navigation as assassins creed with all of the same john woo slides and dives of max payne 3. this game is simply a rush to play and rewarding to progress through.",3
"if farming materials / kicking  and looking cool while doing it is your thing, i would highly recommend warframe. :)",3
"a pretty fun game! and unlike some others say it doesnot require lots of purchases and a large grind. just bring some friends to help you out and your good to go. 2 games worth of content for gree",1
"this game has got me addicted to it off just 2 hour of gameplay, it is absolutely amazing and i reccomend this game to anyone",2
"best free to play around, with very few limitations placed on the game due to premium currency",4
"this is an excellent game. it is challenging without being too difficult and you dont have to buy anything from the cash shop except fluff items. everything can be found by playing the game and you can purchase things if you want too, for convenience or to alter your characters apperence. some of the fluff items can even be gained via alerts which are temporary little missions that pop up every now and again. the only con is that, if you are a new player, it can be very confusing and intimidating. they are currently working on making it easier but as long as you stick with it, ask questions, and use the wikia.. you will do just fine.",5
"great co-op game. has its issues, but it is really fun. you can get through the micro transactions pretty easy, and its only really cosmetics thats the only thing you cant get with in-game currency. overall a great free game, that is a ton of fun. score: 8/10",1
"i am way too tired to write a thought provoking review. so just buy a zephyr warfram and have fun flying allover the damn place killing raisans in space like a ninja with guns n .",3
"the controls and interface are a bit overwhelming but once you get used to it the game can become very fun, just be patient with it.",1
"halo cross ninjas its amazing and u can customize so much stuff its really cool even tho im new to it im having so much fun",1
"amazingly fun game full of cool stuff with great devs.",6
"flesh menaces versus the galaxy in this oer-the-shouldie mass murder simulator. nerve-shredding combat at 90 miles an hour with weapons on the spectrum of handguns all the way to electronic versions of  youd find strapped to your favorite ninja turtle. plays like mirrors edge meets mass effect. lovely upgrade/crafting systems in a booster pack format.",2
"warframe in my opinion it is just too amazing to be free and i mean for gods sake youre a space ninja whats not to love about that and another thing it have a great and helpful community involved in it plus its a really great game to play with friends.",7
"poorframe, the game that will make you poor due to all the spendingsssssszssssssss",1
"even despite the small problems this game has it is very addicting slaughtering enemies and leveling up your warframes and weapons, and this game is only just growing i feel there is a lot of promise here",5
"great game, reminds me of a space type of call of duty, but different, i totally recommend this for gamers who love shooting games.",1
"pretty badass and loads of fun if you got loads of time and money to buy in game currency but pretty good for a beta and a f2p but really grindy. the graphics and gameplay is nice a real good sci fi kinda 3rd person shooter action rpg game nice with friends and lots of missions but kinda repetitive.",1
"warframe is a very specialized game, focused on action, flare, and fun. and boy oh boy does warframe nail action and fun. with over a dozen unique warframes(powersuits used by the player, each with their own unique abilities and stats) to choose from youre sure to find one that you really enjoy .",4
"i havent played this game fully yet, distracted by shogun 2, but the times that i have played it, its has impresed me with the styl the design and the good ai from the apponents in the game it self. very well crafted carackters, game and design lay out. i like the free wepoan give away to selabrate the first year that this has been going for. for thous who are knew to this you must try it, you dont have to spend money to play but it does speed up your carackter development witch makes you a more powerful fow for the enemy.just used my dex furis today ! 22 apr, just going over some old sections to get more combat experianc, what a weapon !!!!! good for closee quarter contact, just what you need in a tight place like a corridor or a room. the lay down of fire is phernominal, it sure get`s through the bullets !. the mag`s just dont hold enouph bullets, you have to watch the bullet count, or you could find your self in a place that you might not be abel to get youself out of. the sound effects of the gun, its just write and the effects of the action when its under fire just oresome. you can take out a cluster of the grenner solder or any of the other apponantes, they have to be generaly close to each other, found this out by accident. havent tryed it al long rang will leave that to my trusty mk-1 braton.",6
"very cool game, very grindy, great time eater. very fun with friends! very very! be warned: this game wants your money and makes things harder for you if you dont pay, but if you have the time to invest, you can work around that.",2
"for a free to play mmo. this game tops my list. youre welcome, creators of warframe.",1
"a very good game, with excellent co-op and gameplay, though it feels a bit copy/paste, grindish, and has plenty of pay to get stuff elements, i still find this game to be enjoyable.",9
"its an awesome game that will have u going for more again n again :p",2
"i personally dislike shooters, but this one is different!",1
"unrivaled fast paced melee, and 3rd person pve shooter. looks great, heavy rpg elements, customization.... worth the download. a free to play game that makes you want to pay for it.",8
"nice game actually gfx pretty smooth and kinda original would prefer more of a pvp side too it but there is a great ammount of co-op missions and a lot of cosmetic customization. would recommend + its a f2p cant complain at that",1
"one of the best co-op games, after borderlands2 ofc :p",1
"this game can be lots of fun once you get past your initial warframe and have at least one orokin reactor and one orokin catalyst. it is free to play and anything can be made with a good clan dojo. you are a space ninja fighting in our solar system against the corpus the grineer and the infestation (much like the flood in halo). you have shields armor weapons and modifications to outfit yourself and goto town on the maps. good gear comes from the doing void missions and orokin derelict missions.",2
"completely unique and incredibly addictive, nothing else like it out there.",1
"great game for f2p lovers. even though theres not much strategy in this game, but still it provides great team coordination and communication between the 4 players. a bit expensive to purchase platinum and materials to find are harder than expected for those blueprints. but thats where the challenge comes in. ciao.",1
"fun game, seems to improve every month or so.. still has some bugs but thats to be expected. would def recommend this game.",8
"great graphics and sound. seemed incredibly dull in the beginning, but after discovering how powerful and interesting the mod system is, i was hooked. the game is very repetitive and some items require considerable grind, but its definately a good distraction if you have a friend or two to coop with.",1
"best game ive ever played and best of all its freeeeeee ;)",1
"i played this game from seing footage but i never thought id enjoy it this much, sure there pay 2 win aspects are there but with whats avalible to you thats free and a grind you can do quiet a bit. i play as a gun wielding ninja but my style i rush and chop people into pieces i can traverse the enviroment wall running jumping off high ledges making all sorts of fancy moves (in my style of play). there cuztomizeable abillites to change that to use all sorts of power or buffs and its all pve. give it a go!",1
"the graphics are great, it has physx support, its free! what else do you want?",1
"apart from tf2, warframe is easily the most polished, entertaining free-to-play game on steam. this game is extremely addicting and succeeds where many other games have failed. it outdoes brink in incorporating usable, parkour-like mobility into a shooter. it outdoes planetside 2 in making it feasible for the player to learn game mechanics from experimentation. it outdoes most other f2p games in that it allows the player to become powerful without needing to use purchased currency. above all, the games concepts are unique enough not to be hackneyed, and practical enough to make for a fun, sustainable game.",7
"this is the best game i ever played never gets old :d ninjas play free wooot download it and see what i mean. this is the first game that i never lose intrest to. i play for hours xd warframe rockss",5
"one of the more unique games on the pc. brings a lot of new concepts and ideas to have a player-friendly enviorment. it has some cool thoughts, and is executed in a great state! it is an amazing game. i say get it before it starts costing money. once it does cost money, i would still suggest buying it, however i wouldnt say go over 75$. its too good to be free, so get it before a price comes out. -ryan",2
"excellent f2p game, would recommend everyone to give this game a shot",1
"warframe is an amazing free to play game and is packed with non stop action! if you love the look of destiny and love games such as halo,star wars,planetside 2 and dead space this game is worth checking out!",1
"this game is damn good fun. been playing since it went into beta, and it was pretty full of bugs back then. the devs have been really constantly hard at work, the game feels much less buggy now and the content generation rate is extremely impressive. theyre also super responsive and communicative with the community, which is a huge plus. however, it does suffer from the same issue as tf2 in that it has way more melees than it needs, but thats not so bad. the game is a ton of mindless fun, you just get to shoot a bunch of bad guys with a huge arsenal of weaponry, and the co-op aspect is pretty cool, especially with friends. plus, its free (albeit with a premium currency that has a really expensive model...). the main crippling factor of the game right now is that it has no late game; after youve explored the whole star chart and done the void missions there really isnt too much to do right now. fortunately, the devs are working on that so well wait and see.",6
"amazing game, its just so cool, great graphics, smooth gameplay. get this game.",1
"warframe is an amazing free to play 3rd person shooter that does not lack anything in the graphics eye candy department. it is fast paced, the levels get harder and harder to deal with, and is amazing fun when played with friends. highly recommend it!!!",3
"i love the game but now when i try to play it it saysthat it didnt recive infermation from the servers so i cant play anymore so plz fix that and nerf the flamethrower also while your meeting my every comand id like a aoe mod for assult rifle like a insinuary rounds that leaves a gas that catches hostiles on fire but make it like the thunderbolt mod so when maxed its like a 30% or better yet a 40% of doing it back to the problem tho i tried to re downliad it or on the file it gave me it sayed repair and i tried that, since i deleted and re downloaded im shure it deleated my progress but if u add cross compadability some how that would be nice that way i can play with my brother who plays on the playstation 4 plz fix the update and make forma more common or able to buy the blueprint for 100k or something that way its reasonable to get but not almost inposible [ i tried to get it from like 4 tower 2s and 3 tower 3s ] plz help with these problems so i can continue playing this amazing game ps. amazing work on the game so far i know its in beta so its gona be amazing when its not!",1
"graphically engaging, fastpaced, dungeon crawler-esque, rpg elements, and overall a good time. if youre looking for those things, look no further, and download warframe!",1
"a fantastic game. this has great graphics and a great setup. i recomend this to anyone looking for a great shooter game.",1
"the developer of this game, put so much effort into making this game and though its free! i recommend this game to all of the halo fans out there though its not like halo but of course look alike, play alike and good alike, this game involves futuristic sci fi and third person shooting assault, a very good game indeed it is",1
"if you dont play this game, you are very lame. if you play this lame, then you are very game. game very are you then ,lame this play you if. lame very are you ,game this play dont you if.",1
"warframe has had a relatively short life so far but the progress de staff and developers have made in that time has been more than i can say for even some of the largest budget studios. i played the initial beta phase and reappeared to see the release of update 6, now update 12 (at the time of this review) and the content i have returned to has almost doubled, if not tripled. if warframe continues to develop at the pace it is currently, i can see this game becoming the largest and most pristine free to play experience on the market, also not using the term free to play lightly - warframe truly requires absolutely no purchases to enjoy or be competitive with.",2
"very fun and addictive multiplayer game. developers are very in touch with the community and the game is constantly being updated. 9/10",4
"awesome game. its a shooter set in a futuristic/space environment. essentially its a bunch of space ninjas. takes a while to start out, because this is a bit of a grinding/farming game. however, you can get really far into the game without spending a single cent, because most of the time, your real money currency purchases are either aesthetics or for additional character or weapon slots. for myself, i did not really progress very far until i joined a clan (to have people help me out) and to get to about 50 hours of game time. by then, you should be having a really good time and have plenty of resources to use.",2
"whether youve dreamed of being a sci-fi ninja or not, warframe nails this genre flawlessly. being a free to play game with tons of active users, any content that seems out of reach is easily achievable. satisfying both the casual and hardcore crowds, warframe is definitely the parkour space game youll be wall-jump-slashing right to.",9
"game is ujust awesome though d time taken to upgrade is a lill longer i liked dis game so much",1
"awesome game have 2 play it very awsome setting >__< play it its free!!!",1
"warframe is a compelling game that, at first glance, seems overly grindy and repetitive. however, once you take root in the game, you will find that this isnt the case- all thats needed is a little patience and a relaxed playstyle in order to really have a blast. the one thing to remember above all else is that the only way real-world currency affects the game is in extra slots- for warframes and weapons. and theyre cheap enough that you dont need to feel guilty dropping a few bucks a month to buy a couple. everything else is optional, and some cosmetics (extra helmets, sentinels) can even be built in game. all you need to know is that it takes time and effort to obtain these, and if youre impatient and cant wait three days for a new frame to build, other games may be more to your taste. theres plenty to do in the game whilst you wait though; and digital extremes are adding more every month. so would i recommend? well, if you like good gameplay, space ninjas and dont mind waiting for the good stuff, yes.",4
"youre a ing super ninja! with guns! how awsome is that? any way, recomended!",1
"this game is so fun and beautifully rendered, that the idea of space ninjas has been fully realized. now for the problem: it crashes. often and annoyingly bc my computer, (laptop) should be able to handle it for an extended period of time. its an intel core i7 vpro with windows 7 operating system.",1
"great game i woulh have payed for it :: my twitter @crazydegree :: i follow back",1
"a boatload of fun, with bits of the fighting style of mass effect, and the parkour system of assassins creed, this game is very well done, even in its beta state.",3
"honestly one of the best ftp games i have ever played it could get a bit stale after awhile but as a whole it is amazing!",1
"this game is the best free game i have ever seen. this game is already a full game and yet its still in beta.",2
"although i do not like this game, this review is going to be as unbiased as possible. warframe is a third shooter. you can modify your weapons and customise them to your hearts extent. you can buy new weapons and rank them up. the character your are moving is a warframe. one downside to this game is that it is not very beginner friendly. this is what is stopping me from giving this game a higher rating. rate: 7/10",1
"i enjoy this game, its well made and fun. really customizable to set everyone apart from one another. great game!",1
"perfect game for people who are looking for a coop only game.",1
"this is a really fun game. all the challenges just give it that simple edge.",1
"its a great game that you can easily put a lot of time into. the visuals are great and gameplay is fast, along with a indepth mods system to really customize how you play.",3
"as a hoarder i hate having to buy inventory slots, but otherwise this is a fantastic game. grindy and a bit samey as far as gameply goes, but still, fun.",1
"it is fun and a very intersting universe to look and fight in.",7
"this is a fun 3rd person shooter, it has stealth and parkour elements wich makes it even more fun.",1
"its a free to play halo with ninjas, why wouldnt you want to play?",3
"the game gets pretty entertaining when you get the hang of it and it takes time, effort & patience in the game. especially effort the game is p2p and only few stuffs are free and that takes your time. anyways great game, great visuals, awesome features. love it!",1
"the feeling of a very high budget and well produced free to play game. i will start off with the bad parts though, i admit, very very pay to win in some aspects; although they try to balance it with some great characters/frames that require some skill and some time to actually aquire and master. all items that include weapons, characters and companions are able to be created by in game playing. you can get anything that your flaunting millionare friend has(besides a pink/red colour pallet for his weapon). with the clan dojo feature implemented, adds so much replay value and leads you to spending days just creating something that in the end will make you very proud of yourself that also will put you ahead of any other clan, weapon wise and style wise. connecting back to pay-to-win aspects, this game is playable with no competitive-ness actually needed. you can duel your friends but you never have to get out of the coop gameplay style to actually progress furthur through the map questing gameplay style that this game has to offer. for a free-to-play game - 8/10 if i had to pay for it($30-$40) - 7/10 this game can introduce many aspects of gaming to new gamers, also adding in the fact that it is free really makes this game accesable and a great learning curve for those unexperienced player.",5
"this game is awesome! it puts you right in the action with and epic third person shooter experience with a wide range of abilities along with a simple but good story. 9.99/10",1
"fast paced and very fun, it does a lot of good things, while only having a little trouble with some minor bugs.",6
"amazing game. really fun to play with friends. the nice part is its free to play. and you can grind out anything peopel who spend cash would get. is good foor shooting the breeze or trolling around and having laughs with your mates. if ya need a friend to laugh n play with hit me up. always happy to help grind stuff out. xd -shadowdrauka",7
"loving the co-op and the infinite modding you can do to your weapons and warframe.",2
"the best free to play game on steam to date (in my opinion) but definately worth checking it out if you like assassin type games with cool abilities and third person gameplay, then its a must.",5
"super epic game, really hard though, if you are a beginner, do not play solo.",1
"pretty fun. its a big grind game, but more content is added regularly. its still in open beta so everyone is still trying ti figure out what the end game is. if you want to have fun for about an hour at a time get it. not pay to win too",4
"this is one of the best shooting games i have played in a while! :)",1
"can be repetetive at times but recently they have kind of mixed it up enough with interesting level designs and difficult enemies. while you can play this by yourself i really recommend getting a couple pals and just having a blast because you get to parkour in space. also i know what youre thinking f2p=p2w but seeing as this is coop you dont have to worry about someone that has bought stuff dominating you. overall prettyfun/10",2
"microtransations to buy gud  hell yes!!! also the game has a pretty good gun and run system flow to it. but guns!!!!!!!!!!!!!! murica",1
"crashes way too much but it is a lot of fun when everything is working. mods can be a chore to keep organized, its not hard to have 300 or more in inventory and selling that many can take some time. it is possible to sell them as a group but there is a glich where you have to try and sell nothing then select the mod and then it will ask you how many you want to sell. havent tried the trading option but im glad the ds put it in there. the graphics/physics are superb, kudos to the graphics arts boys and girls. they rocked it !!",4
"really nice game if you want to relax from other hardcore fps shooters :)",1
"this game is action packed and very fun and interesting to play. however without a good computer it can make it hard to play well.",1
"even though you are doing basically the same thing over and over again, something keeps bringing me back. maybe it is the fact you get to unlock cool weapons or characters if you keep playing. maybe i am losing my mind but either way i like it! you cant go wrong for a free to play game.",2
"flawless third-person shooter! it has a great variety of enemies, good challenging levels and amazing ninja maneuvers like sliding, wallrunning and jump kciking and so much more!",3
"i recommend this for any and all experienced gamers. this is an amazing experience.",1
"thanks digital extremes! its a wonderful game and i really like it.",4
"space ninjas. a novel concept that for some reason, i had never considered. im not very far into the game yet (not even ranked yet), but i can already tell this is going to be game i will have a complicated relationship with. being a keyboard & mouse user, i find it slightly difficult to control things at times, and occasionally the camera just does not want to co-operate. but this is a small thing, compared to the amazing overall depth and quality of the game itself. if youve ever wanted to play a ninja in space, with deadly powered-armors and insane abilities, warmframe is the game for you. just like fps games? prooooobably not going to be your cup of tea, but you should try it anyway, because who knows? you might be surprised.",1
"the graphic of the game is awesome, combat system is pretty good, slash, jumping. every part of the game was designed carefully. although its not the best, but u have to know. its free!",4
"fun game, i played it when it was pretty early beta only a few frames were out then. it was good but i lost interest after about 10 hours of gameplay. hopefully ill pick it up again and they made it more polished.",1
"almost as good as snorting lines of powdered babies while hopping on 1 leg fapping ! must have game for anyone !",3
"i love this game but i wish they could add a team deathmatch mode",1
"warframe is a exiting multiplayer/solo game that introduces plenty of new ways to have fun with different weapons and gamemodes! 10/10",4
"there is very little reason to actually pay real money for stuff, only a couple of otherwise-unattainable items. it really is a free-to-play that doesnt screw you over excessively. plus the combat is really good, reminiscent of the excellent multiplayer of games like mass effect 3.",9
"like ninjas? of course you do. like space? psh who doesnt. what about mothering swords, little  that float around with you, jet powered hammers, and giant- rocket launchers named after our ogrelord shrek? you will now if you get this game. its good. play it. now. stop waiting hit the download button. do it. ogris ember master race.",3
"if i could ever lvl up and past the test the game would be great!. still playing to pass the test but if i pass it not sure if i will play it anymore.",1
"crazy fun. you have the ability to be a ninja in outer space...i mean wow! this game is great and i love the concept of all the mods being cards and how you can upgrade each one and you only have a certain amount of space to fit them in your inventory. be it your warframe, primary weapon, secondary weapon, or melee weapon. in order to build affinity you need to constantly change these items when the hit level 30 as once your warframe or weapon (no matter what type) hits 30 you no longer gain affinity for your account. it is important to gain affinity as this allows you to progress and unlock stronger items that are really required to get to the harder further planets. the game is free to play but be aware in order to unlock the extra weapons and warframes you need to buy slots for them and warframes are 20 plat each and weapons are 20 for 2 (only come by 2s ) i waited to get the random daily bonus to buy some platinum. i paid 25$ for 1000 which normally goes for 500. this game is well worth the money i put into it as i have played many hours on it and do recommend you do the same to give back to the great developers that made this magnificent game.",2
"love it! been playing this over titanfall on my xbox one.",2
"this is an amazing game with really cool concepts. and you can be a ninja. thats all you need to know. you can be a ninja.",1
"its free, its co-op, its fun. need to hear more? you play as a sci-fi ninja i think ive made my point",1
"a fun and creatively made gameplay with multiple ascpects which will please different types o gmaers. however a times it can be a tedious when you have to grind for rrsources and blueprints. overall though it is a fantastic game.",2
"if being a space ninja does not win you over. then maybe the addictive mass effect 3 style co-op will. not to mention you can get some really cool stuff all at no cost.",1
"i had doubts about this game, but they came to naught once i started playing. the style is truley unique and it is easy to spend hours on end in playing the game. the only issue i have is sinnce it is in beta it isnt fully fleshed out, meaning lore and story are lacking in some areas, but the game is totally worth it. shout out towards the devs who are always improving the game and responding to us on the forums.",2
"really cool game, and always entertain me with new guns, warframes, and missions.. keep up the good work and keep it updated :d",1
"this game is still in beta so cant expect a perfect experience. over all this game was not a let down consedering i spent no money on it and have over 100 hours so far. this game has flaws (espically the new damage 2.0) but its in beta and this is the whole point is to work out all the bugs and have it nice and pretty for full-game. this game is slightly a pay to win slightly. basically you can buy every warframe and most of the weapons (cant buy prime versions) but they all start at lvl 1 and have to lvl them. so this game does have a pay to win way through it kinda, but that ruins the experince of not having to farm and play through with low lvl gear/starting and actually working your way to the top. overall i would give this game a solid 7/10. but hey in due time this game will be a full-game and hopefully then it will blow all of us away. good luck out there tenno.",4
"not a bad game for free to play. still new to it but feels like a fun game to kill time. and if you have friends, why not? good for bonding. free. whats not to like about it?",1
"it is a game to try. afcorse the price does not hurt at all :d",1
"i love this game the graphics and actions awesome ps you can freerun",1
"a great game which involves not only shooting skills, but strategy as well. the bad part about this game is the fact that you cant really communicate with your team in the game, which makes it a bit difficult to coordinate some times. the best way to play this game and enjoy it to its fullest is to form your own team and communicate through stream, skyper or other similar programs. that dosent mean that playing the solo is not fun, it is, but everything is more enjoyable when you are surrounded by friend. so go on! form your team and go kick some alien butt!",1
"this is a great game load of fun and play time with all the different warframes avaiable to purchase. my one and only fault in the game is not everything is explained to you such as what certain words mean. i like the learnign curve for the game just not the info provded.",3
"ah, warframe. i prime example of my all time favourite game series ninja gaiden (pronounced guy-den) turned futuristic and closely reminds me of a ever so violent game called prototype but is ever so fun and co-op so if you like action, adventure and ninjas then stop reading and download this ftp game.",1
"this was seriously one of the best steam games ever! xd",1
"dont be fooled by the disgraceful reviews of the big reviewers like ign and gamestop or whatever, but this game is amazing, especially for free to play. you feel in control and can chop your enemies down using some skills you obtain, you can change colours of your character, get new skills and mods for your weapons, helmets etc. now dont get me wrong, these things come at a price, quite a large price too, i totally recommend this game, its fun and can have a blast with friends. to be honest, i would rate this game a 8 out of 10 for some flaws, but i am disgusted of how the big reviewers have rated this game, so i just want to back it up a bit.",1
"the game has a good solo campaign with some challenging milestones such as stealth kills for the entire mission. the customization is horrid because of how long it takes for a f2p gamer to make an item. you have to travel the universe just to make one part of a suit. after you gather all the parts it still takes at least 24 hours real time to make them item. for a hack n slash game i highly recommend it for the smooth gameplay and great action it gives to the gamer. out of 5 stars id say 3 1/2 because of the terrible customization... play with friends!",1
"warframe is, simply put, awesome. constant updates, attentive creators and a lively community make this game stand out from so many other cruddy games.",8
"this is an amazing game with just , outstanding graphics. when it commes to free-to-play games , this would be one of the best. its gameplay is very fun , and the weapons , enemies , and characters are very well done and balanced. so if youre looking for a good free-to-play game , this is it.",1
"space ninja robot assassins... in space. i honestly dont think it needs any more recommendation than that.",1
"i recommend this game to people who are fans of sci-fi action games. as you play and complete more missions, you start become more stronger, you can fusion cards, build weapons, play online, customize your skin and create your own clan. you and your friends will have a great time playing this game. gg",1
"pretty cool, but definetley pay-to-win. its worth giving it a try to see if you like it",1
"pretty solid third person shooter. worth of sinking a couple of hours with your buddies.",1
"this is a truly unique game. generally, im hesitant about third person games, especially shooters. after playing warframe, i understand why its third person. it has to be third person to give you that parkour feeling. if you thought assassins creed was a good blend of parkour and combat, then you havent seen anything yet. this is what the next generation of shooters should be. fast-paced gameplay with unique combat, warframe is one of those games that you wonder why they were never made on console. i am pleasantly surprised by this game and look forward to playing more of it. if you are skeptical about warframe, give it a shot. its free, so what do you have to lose? you might find out just how fun it is to be a gun-wielding space ninja.",1
"this is an interesting twist on the fps.. if you like co-op and fast paced action, this is a good one to checkout. i havent done much with the pvp, but the co-op missions are awesome. the only downside is that the lower level sections are a bit empty. once you get past those, its an endless supply of players.",1
"if you like parkour, ninjas, space, shooting, , and  like things hanging off the back of players heads then this game is for you. it ruins friendships. but its fun.",1
"its fun but if you fall out of the map or off a bridge and land on a pipe or in a hole you are trapped and have to restart",1
"i did not have high expectations for this game. how ever the visuals are nice if your running a nvidia and can turn the particles on.",4
"really good game if u know how to play it and this game is a true free to play everything that can be bought by real money can also be crafted ingame",1
"nice game,but requres the mouse button in order to revive character,should be able to revive with game controller aswell! best graphics for a 3rd person shooter,but its missing something",1
"i enjoy this game very much but there is still lots ot work out for game play wise. it is a very free base system in my mind. meaning that the direction isnt there really but i like that about it. it dosent matter how you gt your self through the missions as long as you do the steps needed. you can go back and forthe from the start of a level and back agian with out any problems. its fun but needs more of a story or maybe just a little more gam play depth. its a great shell but i feel its lacking. over all i love it and will continue to play. cant wait forthe updated later versions.",1
"this game is amazing. i am a huge fan of anime, japanese cartoons and it has tha feel to it. but, with amazing graphics. in the graphics department it reminds me a lot of timeshift, which is a plus in my book. love this game. my wife and i are going nuts over this game.",1
"this game was my #1 f2p of 2013 and so far still is. as for being a f2p game, it is being treated like a p2p mmo with its constant updates while it continues to evolve. not to mention des awesome involvement with the community it has accumulated ovver the past year. warframe has enormous potential and is heading in the right direction. if youre looking for an action packed shooter with a large amount of rpg elements, this game offers that and then some. dont be scured! ninjas play free!",5
"this is a free mmo fpshooter game with a lot of action and extreme fantasy ... join now ... youll like it ...",5
"from the makers of unreal and unreal tournament, incredibly fun, if flawed in some places. dont let the metacritic rating deceive you. while most of the criticism is well-earned, it belies the fact that there is a very solid, entertaining core here. the gameplay reminds me a bit of hellgate or borderlands, in terms of its fps-rpg play. the weapon variety, however, is more interesting along with a crafting system that keeps you coming back day in and day out. you wont find a gripping story here, but you will find yourself curious to explore the possibilities, balancing effectiveness with a style that suits you. this is a game that makes farming fun!",4
"one of the best f2p games ive ever played! u have to try it! its free!",1
"nice game but u will resolve the crash display driver has stop working..",1
"wonderful shooter, amazing premise and story line. sadly the missions get repetitive for a casual gamer and to keep the interest of players they have to go heavy into the metagame aiming to get the best items, mods, frame to build tenno powerful enough to survive the mid-game content. uranus and neptune are not friendly to players that havent spent 10s of hours grinding to get enough resources to have a half decent warframe. good game but hardcore players only",2
"top of the line free to play game, second best ive ever played next to league of legends. a few reasons 1. amazing co op shooter, 2. awesome graphics even without top of the line pc 3. fast credit earning compared to other free to plays 4. innovative and addicting upgrade system for everything, armor, weapons, pets, spells, ect. everything lvls up indivudually and is just a very satisifying experience, although it may be a little intimidating at first, get past that learning curve and it is very rewarding. will take a couple hours before you realize what is going on with everything and how the system is laid out",2
"one thing about this game. its free? this game is great. my favorite part about warframe is how there is constant goals. the system assists you in completing your goals. you have to build your weapons and playable characters (warframes) if you dont wanna pay for them. and no one does. i would for sure reccomend this game.",4
"the first minutes into game feels like getting cancer but as soon as you complete tutorial you realize you have one! you try to delete this until you see a hundred euro dlc for this game so you buy it give game another chance get hiv and spend more money for treatment. bottom line: free 2 play games are expensive indeed and we all going to play and spend money playing it because in the end of the day it matters that you have paid weapons and cancer and hiv is not as bad as it seems because we will all get executed.",1
"mothering piece of  steam rolls back all updates if you check file integrity, same happens with planetside 2 and im guessing all/most games that have their own launcher. ing piece of  steam   you! !",2
"it was good but lagged alot and i have a prety good computer",1
"awesome ! you want it ! digital extremes hears the music. warframe makes good progress and update 12 made me a fan.",5
"im currently obsessed with this game, as long as the servers are stable its truly an unvelievably good time, one of the only f2p games ive ever played that im considering spending money on",1
"great game, love the different warframes. you cant buy everything in game unless you put your own money creating a challenge to get all of the pieces of warframes and weapons for the forge. i do wish that the maps were different, i feel like they repeat a lot for the worlds.",1
"this game is fun, if not played a lot. if you play a lot then it can get repetitive and boring.",1
"one of the greatest games ive played. i wouldve paid for this!",1
"this is a fast paste game, with space ninjas, and has awesome graphics! endless gaming with very well created customization system and its free ;d.",4
"warframe is a great game the controlls on pc are a bit out of reach or just plain hard to get to. for instance to sprint is the (shift) button and to slide is the (ctrl) button the (shift) button must be held down to spring and sliding requires you to sprint. this however can be changed in contolls. also after a while it dose start to get a little slow and mabey boreing but overall a great game. it would help if the developers added more planets or recources because often times just having new warfames and wepons will not cut it due to the ability to buy them with real money. the graphics are great and the gameplay is also great. walking through the missions and shoosting and cutting up grineer and corpus just feels so natural and also maby getting the chance to do some infested missions. all the charecters and enemies look quite stunning and the colors of the game are fantastic. the wepons also do some pretty cool stuff (e.g. pinning enemies to walls, blowing up enemies. ragdolling enemies). some of the animations on these wepons (depending on who you are) will make you wildly laugh.",1
"a fantastic game, with excellent visuals. with a wide variety of customizations, warframe also gives players many opportunities to create their own playstyle. my one complaint is that the game eventually comes down to grinding, and this can be a boring process. overall rating: 9.5/10",1
"a lot of fun to play, hard to get the good gear, but once you have it and levelled, its worth it in the end, its not a pay to win game, but it certainly is pay to get everything faster.",4
"the game is very fun, but if you dont spend money on items it can take a very long time to get them.",1
"probably the most fun i can get from a third person shooter/hack n slash online game there is out there in my opinion. what i like about the game: the countless amount of mods and weapons there are, the fun coop multiplayer mode and unique classes/warframes. what i dont like about the game: quite repetitive at times, requires a significant amount of grinding and the countless amount of mods and weapons are either obtainable through grinding or real cash. all in all if you hate grinding avoid this game at all cost but if you dont mind grinding or like it, its a must have.",1
"great cooperative game, a perfect option for those who like online pve. you can forge or buy new characters, gear and guns. even been an open beta, have few bugs.",10
"this game has it all nice graphics really good fight physics fun challenging missions all in all a great game",1
"an enjoyable shooter for those of us that dont care for all of the modern shooter malarchy. so those of you that do will likely not find much here to enjoy although you never know. this is definitely a grindy game; youre gonna be doing similar things over and over again although they keep things intersting by varying the level layouts slightly. its the kind of game thats great as a solo distraction; play it while watching or listening to a show. if youre looking for an immersive gaming experience, you will deplete this game rather quickly - think more in terms of mmo gameplay than traditional sports shooter.",2
"stopped playing it a while ago, but its pretty good!",1
"amazing gameplay fun combat system and sweet character growth with flawless multi-player!!!",1
"very fun and addictive. this game boasts tons of collectables to enhance your playthrough, and gameplay immesnly. although at times, warframe may feel like a grind to get that item you really really need for crafting, if you got your friends to back you up, your pretty much unstoppable! i would reccomend warframe to people who like -rpgs -third/first person shooter games.",1
"one of the greatest games i have ever played, you will get hooked on it for weeks at a time.",4
"it is a game developed for players who like sci-fi, cooperative missions, ninjas, and cool graphics all mashed up to form warframe. the game itself is excellent, but the parkour actions are kind of sloppy, if the sloppiness is fixed, then the game would be great!",1
"imagine this as halo 3, but with more customization and in 3rd person.",2
"freakin awesome game! if you like freakin awesome games, this is one to play.",1
"love it, brilliant and really fun. graphics perfect, mechanics flawless but can end up being a grind.",4
"its kinnda weird when you wait in the lobby but this game is awesome",1
"i wasnt convinced id like it, then thought hey its ok, it may keep my interest for a while....i seem to be totally addicted to it now; very solid mechanics and devs who arent afraid to try stuff then go back if it isnt working. im surprised but i am still enjoying it. fun game, good company running it.",8
"dont know why people call this a grindfest when there isnt really a endgame or a objective. its only a grind if you make it one yourself, all the guns are well balanced and the game isnt that difficult. the main goal of the game is to have fun and enjoy the community.",5
"this is one of the best free-to-play games out there. i have played others on and off, but this is the only one i have ever stuck with.",2
"while the concepts and lore are interesting, the gameplay can become rather repetitive and sometimes it feels as though the game is forcing you to play with others in order to overcome a particularly hard mission.",1
"very good game its free and there is a lot of upgradable things. you can play solo with friends or radomly join others in the fight against evil.",1
"robo ninjas in space!!! wallrunning!!! shooting!!! melee!!!",5
"cool game. it is fun to watch your weapons level and add damage to them",1
"i honestly didnt believe i would like this game, because its not really my type. but its a lot of fun! you start with one class (warframe) and your mission is to conquer every planet in the universe. you are provided with different missions, for instance: defence mission, spy mission, rescue mission etc. while youre at it you can save up materials for building a new class (warframe), weapons or other items. you get mods which strenghten your warframe, and you can choose exactly how you want it to be. you can choose to solo, invite some friends, or join some strangers in your fight against the other races.",2
"this game by far is one of the best games i have ever played, best yet its better than more than half of my games ive actually purchased 10/10",2
"games really fun and cool but if you dont want to spend real money on new weapons and warframes, be prepared to play for a looooong time",1
"this game is very good. a lot like mass effect 3s online coop...",3
"this game is just awesome.you can make own warframe.",3
"i would love to play this game......but it just wont start -_-",1
"[before i start, id like to say that i understand that this game is in alpha stage.] there are a few bugs that annoy me, but when i can load it, oh is it fun! [p.s optimal system settings? its real hard to change settings]",1
"amazing game online and single player, you can play campain missions with your friends and other online people, but you cant play against them but hopefully in future updates itll change maybe",9
"great developers, weekly updates, monthly content additions. plus, ya know, the game is awesome.",7
"warframe is basically ninjas in space. a fun game and great quality for a f2p. several warframe and a multitude of weaponry provides a good shot at finding a mix that best suits your individual play style.",4
"this was a great game, and with improvement, it can and will compete with the bigger games, such as warthunder minecraft, cod, adn battlefield",1
"its all about grinding, you can make some fun hours with it but its really hard to get attached, you dont felt the progression and the loot, craft and equipment system are not user friendly",1
"nothin but high-octane ninjitsu and laser emus all the way.",1
"at first, i liked this game. you could dance wherever you wanted and it was a perfect paradise of a world. nobody discriminated on you for being bad at dancing and you could learn to get better over time without fear of anyone ing with your . but then desteve decided to  everyones o ring and everything spun out of control not only do you need to learn how to dance from the very beginning again (why, i was getting so good) you also need to rely on absolute luck-based chance to actually learn some of the better dancing moves, instead of your friends being able to just help you learn them. now instead of a perfect paradise its a hellish bloody firestorm. desteve can be equated to the hitler of my warframe (germanys) fourth reich. thanks obama.",1
"its great!! keep adding stuff, game is definately in development. i very much like the new content or new items made every month.",4
"it lags really badly and crashed. i am not sure whether this because of my laptop or not but the game seemed real fun (during the five minutes i got to play it) and id definatly would recomend it! has melee fighting as well as guns and a short introduction into playing. you can wall jump and all sorts, so its pretty cool.",1
"good game. nice graphics. smooth gameplay. only downside is have to craft all your different frames....",3
"its all about the platinum baby! thats what benjamin franklin would say if he played warframe. this fast pasted co-operative shooter is loads of fun, but very addictive. play as any of over a dozen supersoliders (warframes) and defend our solar system from threats. this mission based game is free-to-play, but will require a bit of cash to access all the features.",1
"aww yiss moda blooping explotions and waste of time for very cool stuff like new frames and new weapons arm up with swords bows crossbows shurkians, kunais feel like an armed futurastic ninjas and stuff",1
"a great game with a lot of weapon and gear its worth playing it.",5

"two nincompoops made me play it but its an ok game though.",1
"i have played this game for a very long time, and it has come a long way. a year ago today the mercury tile set was the only tile set, and now they have antire planets! i love this game, and i will follow it untill the multiplayer servers are no longer officaly hosted and then some. keep up the good work digital extremes, and thanks for this amazing game. `big-head hancho",3
"good game 4/5 skulls, wood recomend to all famly and freinds. gg everyone this is crakin up to be a grate year in gameing history.",1
"if you like call of duty and battlefield 4 plus 3rd person view, then this is the game for you 8/10",2
"fan-in-tastic game. play it right now, ill gladly help you out. :)",1
"who doesnt want to be a ninja? but what about being an ninja in space? well in warframe you can, its one of the best games i have played and still continue to play every day, and from where it started it has got better and better, and continues to impress me with the high level of gameplay and innovation it has, if you played and enjoyed drak sector then this is definatly for you, and who doesnt enjor yunning around slicing and shooting things up? plus its free, so what more could you want?",2
"having issues on the load up. evolution-engine fail..quite depressing",1
"amazing game, started playing it, once i figured it all out, found my self playing for 3 hours straight 1st day was hard to stop to go bio.",1
"this game focuses on more gunplay but is soon to make the melee system better and more lethal. this is my most played game on steam and i honsetly love it.",7

"have tested it . very nice. like te part that allows you to switch between online play and solo play. just hoping for an offline lan update!!",1
"8.5/10. really fun to play, interesting mechanics and the p2w is not overkill (you can farm rare items and just trade them for the p2w currency) . my only issue is the replayability (usually fixed when the developers update). otherwise a fun game and definitely worth a try.",1
"it is very yes. time spent on warframe is rarely time of waste, so download and play the enjoyment about warframe. fun is funny game and people enjoy. its wonderful sound, strange shape.",2
"one of the best games i have every seen. playing since closed beta. its a game when you leave it and you come back a month later you will fall back in love with it",3
"kinda great. first time playing fps with that rpg kinda feeling though but great experience.",1
"play warframe its so good youll be slapping yourself silly",5
"decent, lots of grinding, and enjoyable if you willing to wait couple days for item crafting.",4
"warframe is a really good game, i just wish that i had a different laptop so it can run fast",1
"this game is really fun. between firefights and kickass sword fights its pretty neat.",1
"i recommand this game for who ever likes ninja games. yes it is hard to start off with but when put time and effort into it this becomes a fun game.",2
"this is the most awesome game i hve play it, thumbs up~!",8
"one of the best free-to-play games on steam! this game is very fun to play, and even more enjoyable when you have friends at your back! id recommend this game for anyone looking for a great cooperative third person shooter.",1
"great game, probably the best third person shooter game, with lots of cool and unique features!",2
"i definately recommend this game to everyone, its absoluetly amazing! i just cant get enough of this game, ive only been playing it for about 6 days now and i have lots of time put into this game. for just a free to play game, this one is a lot of fun, and it has amazing graphics plus it runs really smooth. some people say that you have to buy platinum if you want decent stuff. but actually, the only time you have to use platinum, is when you want cosmetics (i.e. helmet, syandana, better colours, etc...), more warframe/weapon slots, or to purchase something right away. now, i would recommend using the 50 platinum they give you to start off with, to buy more slots, because the cosmetic stuff isnt really that important, where as slots are. basically everything else, you can get blueprints for, then go around to the different planets and missions to gather the materials to build them. some blueprints (warframes for example) require that you fight bosses more than once or go into the void so you can get things such as, the helmet, chassis, and systems. yes, this can take some time, but its worth it in the end. overall, i think this is a great game! the only negatives i could think of, is how some maps are used more than once, even though youre on a totally different planet, and the fact that you have to buy more colours with platinum. but, other than that, this game is great, and if you havent already, try it out! its free :d",1
"an great action game u can use swords and guns best combo in game ever see!!!",1
"an open beta, but not just any open beta. warframe takes on a third person and tactical challenge. being very successful so far by climbing to the tip of the top of the free to play games, other than tf2 of course, it has been played by many. i like this game for its unique and cool content. the game my be a little hard to understand at first, but once you get it, you get it. i recommend warframe to all players that are looking for a tactical shooter.",1
"amazing get it now you fight npcs and buy gun blueprints then find the stuff to make the gun!!!!!!!(or buy it) yay=5 star",1
"this game is so awesome! most fun ive had with a multiplier game in a while. customize the  out of your character, weapons and  and have some ing fun dude",1

"the game is still in open beta for more than a year, the improvements made so far is astounding and the potential to make it better is tremendous. a real f2p and not pay to win. stunning gfx, tps like a real ninja. cant wait for melee 2.0, new warframes, the hub, the alliances, the badlands, solar rail, the katana and may be new planets, solar systems and factions !! there is some minus obviously like the chat system, the dojo, the main ui (not the hud while playing) etc.. but they dont interfere with the fun",3
"if you like action based multiplayer games this is one of the best choices you will ever choose. really fun to play with friends and kill some bad guys!! you will find one of the best co-op experiences in this game. in terms of graphics it looks amazing for a free to play game and the combat system its simple and very good. i defenetly recommend this game to everyone!! maybe ill get a few boobies with this game xd boobies!!",1

"is a very good looking game. i recommend it to anyone trying to escape the fps genra and find something fresh",1

"a great-looking, initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole.",1
"best ninja slashing mothaing shooting game play with lcd and go ma a",5
"quite entertaining fun woth friends little laggy at begining though",1
"i just started playing this game, and i have to say this game is astounding for a free-to-play game. the visuals are fantastic, and the combat system is dynamic and exciting. i would recommend this game to anyone looking for a mmo to play.",1
"warframe... it is what it advertises, a minmo space ninjas with guns! theres nothing else to be said about it.",1
"amazing game for what i`ve played of it. this is a beautiful looking game, great idea behind it and relatively refreshing feel to an fps. controls aren`t terrible, but could be better. the tutorial explains combat well but i have no clue how to get better weapons/upgrade mine without paying real money. the weapons also seem unbalanced, basically giving you no reason to use anything but your primary unless you`re practically on top of an enemy. i also hate the fact i need to buy colour packs. i`d be fine with that if it gave you basic colours first, but of course you`re given dilluted colours and shades (ie: light green instead of green, turqoise instead of blue, pink instead of red, grey instead of black). other than my rant about the problems in this game, it really is a great game and i`d recommend it to anyone. i`m truly baffled that this game is free, i would have paid for this! this is more than worth the space on your computer.",1
"so far for warframe it says update failed and will not allow me to play. it better be worth all the work once i can finally get on.",1
"for being a free to play game it has nice graphics and smooth gameplay. that being said the areas are extremely repetative in nature and becomes almost boring to play in. i understand the game when i played it was only like 6-10 months old and still in beta but even for a preview i got the feeling that after about 40 hours of gameplay you probably seen everthing this game has to offer. pros: free to play, great graphics, good amount of replayability due to many many different kinds of suites being available, powers and customizables make for a good amount of variables. cons: free to play, but pay to win/have fun. i am getting worried that game companies are going to start adopting this method and it scares me to no end that it will spell disater for the game industry. its almost ruined a whole generation of games for me and many many others. overall: fun to play for a while, but to keep having fun money is to be spent and alot of it unless you spent the huge amount of money on a founders pack already. decent overall free to play game, at the very least try it out cause honestly there is no harm in playing a free game.",1
"this game reminds me of the time i sneezed and coughed at the same time. for a moment i felt as though i was master of the universe (similar to he-man but i know i dont have pecks as well defined as him). i like how this game doesnt play around with the idea of giving you a choice about motion blur; whether you set the game graphic settings to function on a windows 98 or the underground super computer that monitors the stock exchange the results are the same. what results you may ask? well rush writes a long run-on sentence about the choices you make for starters. from that point onward things become less like lechuga and more like spinach patte. i found myself pondering the meaning of my life as a lithe robotic swordsman in this strange world. i wanted people to love me but all they ever did was yowl at me and fire lasers at my face. sometimes life is like that though, sometimes life yowls at you and fires lasers at you when all you really want is love. because love is a complicated thing and robots are never prepared for the complexity that even bear people can only bear-ly (huehashdauhsuhduahsda) comprehend. i guess the moral of this story is that sometimes life is like a gourd filled with mayonaise.",1
"ive been playing this game for a whole year now and i must say that as someone who generaly avoids online gaming (wow, lol etc.) this game got me hooked really really good. anyone who enjoys 3rd person shooters or rpgs should definetly give this one a try at least.",9
"this game has been in open beta for almost a year (its one of those games). sure they come out with updates all the time, but i doubt it will ever be a complete game.",1
"naf: hey do-wop is that game any fun? do-wop: not really.",2
"i have only begun playing this game, it is very fun, you can either go ahead and lead the group, or follow behind. you get rewarded for every action you make during the missions. i am sort of excited about the possibility that eventually it will be cross-platform with all those ps4 users. the game play is pretty fun and addictive.",1
"when you want a realy cool adventure where you can be realy hard motherucker than play this !but when you dont want play this modering epic game than go and crawl in your litle corner of shyme !",3

"ye, i tested it once again and its improved a lot. i wont mention what is the big plus of all that, because it is self explanatory and if you dont know, play the game! it sure is worthy, for now. hope they dont destroy it. old: played the closed beta, dont believe the trailers, the game itself isnt as great as they show it, though it is worth to play, especially with friends and alike. maps are boring tho, enemy ai is this games weak point.",1
"most of the time its great. gameplay fun, i love the theme. clan and alliances add to it. the downside it that, starting out your have a limited amount of slots for your warframes(your characters to play as) and weapons. it also experiences frequent bugs. most of the things wont bother you as you get platinum handouts now and then(platinum=the bought currency) and just one handout is usually enough to buy you enough slots for your warframes and weapons. it definitely is not a p2w game. youll enjoy this game a lot. that is when the bugs dont interfere. for me they arent extremely annoying yet, theyve only been rather minor. good game, fun, creative, 9/10",1
"a very good game for sci-fi fans out there. also very good for parkour fans.",4
"really a lot of grinding, but a lot of fun. hmu: foob ;-) *smooch*",8
"this game is awesome, played it a ton. although after 70-100 plus hours (yep) it can get pretty repitive. although, the team behind this game updates it frequently so it adds a bunch so you never really run out of stuff to farm for, but this game is farming. that is all it mostly consists of. so if you do not like farming and the occasional boss fight iwould reccomend but if you do enjoy that kind of thing like myself give it a shot :d",1
"great game over all amazing it requiers enviormental use and planing ahead love it",1
"for me this is one of yhe best games i ever play on a pc free to play",1
"a free game where you can be epic space ninjas reking other space things. 10/10.",1
"i honestly dont know how to rate this game. you grind to grind and the grinding isnt even the kind where an erection is expected. drop rates suck, players suck and trading in this game? id rather inject meth directly into my testicles and skewer my eyes on rusty thumbtacks. that being said; if you enjoy this game and how free! it is youll want to spend money on it, youll feel an actual need to, just to avoid spending 5 hours mindlessly copypasting a list of 20 or so mods you want to sell for half the price of what people usually ask. but you can go fast, there are lots of colours and latex body suits with some nice butts in them. i give it a 9/11",5
"such an awesome game but mostly need money to become stronge because most item need platinums to be purchased and thats a problem for player from diffrent country.",1
"i recommend, but with the caveat that it needs more work. the initial instructions on what to do are kind of shoddy, which leads you to be matched up with people who have absolutely no clue what the hell they are doing. 10 minutes later youre screaming at them to extract just so you can end the mission. i am pretty sure that after i get out of noob central i shall enjoy the  out of this game",1
"i simply love the game ! stunning graphics , great frame roster , lots of ablilities , teamwork means a lot ! a great variety of landscape, hi-tech maps to the ancient remainings of the earth, many kinds of mobs , lots of weapons : from the deadly close range shotgun to the 1-shot-kill sniper , to the ninja weapons : bow , crossbow , hikou (aka shuriken) , kunai ... many kinds of melee weapons : from the basic sword , to the double axe , the scythe , even throw disk (aka glaive). the mods you add to those weapons are simply terrifying! it takes a while to upgrade the weapons and get the mods , but the result is deadly (for the poor enemies that are forced by the ai to attack you... many get so scared that they get stuck just to prolong their short life spam , which is kind of annoying , mostly in survival and defense missions). simply put : marvellous ! i havent even begun to talk about the melee weapon stances - which give you formidable combos ! pack that with a bow , kunai / hikou and sets of mods at each of them and you are the perfect ninja assassin ! this game deserves 10/10 in my opinion , obviously there are many features i havent even mentioned , you should go find them out for yourself ! meet me in game : x3quan8",1
"i would recommend this game to anyone. it is always becoming better and you should be able to come back to it.",6
"as others put it so very well. ninjas...in space. this exciting fast paced shoot-em up run-and-gun styled, third person squad ( or solo and anywhere inbetween) parkcour simulator will leave you with your wrist stinging from playing several hours longer then you intended. and beileve me, if you get into this you will play it untill you drop. the hours ive spent in-game were well spent. doubley with friends. it can get grindy. espeically for good weapons and warframes ( new playable characters ) but the time spent normally passes quickly ( again with friends ) and the rewards are actually worth it. my reveiw is a doubled handed thumbs up. i found the game to be action packed and intense, albeit a tad glitchy at times. but thats where the funny, funked up magic happens ( fallout players will know what i mean ) but by far, the very best part of the game that i like, is the very thing the game advertises  ninjas play free. all weapons, warframes, mods, and as you play through a year customization options are all avalible for absolutly free. the option s there however to buy it, and get it without trying. but cmon now who has fun pushing the a button to win? so in conculsion. warframe is a ninja game. a free tp play. non-pay-to-win, ninjas flipping in space action packed splosion festivel anygamer can enjoy.",4
"very addicting and fun game, im giving it 10/10 cause its a free game and most of the items you can get in-game.",1
"put 25 hours in so far and i am hooked. my favorite game at the moment. the good: great cooperative game play fun in game mechanics the game is challenging enough to keep you interested grinding for mods adds a rewarding aspect to the game its free the bad: level design can be repetitive some mods take forever to get there are some flaws and maybe more than i mentioned. however, the game is free and fun to play. great game.",2
"game play its fun, and updates continue to add to that fun. just be ready to spend a couple of bucks if you dont like to wait for stuff.",6
"i completley recommend this game, its perfect to pass time and have fun",2
"i completley recommend this game, its perfect to pass time and have fun",2
"i recommend this game because it has a very good gameplay and graphics",1
"this game is fun to play by yourself or with your friends! if you like alien shooter games then this might be the game for you. :d",1
"this game is super! theres nothing like running and gunning with a little ninja action. teamwork is a must, so you have to band together and use your warframes abilities tactically.",1
"you can play as a space ninja-samurai who stabs people in space. 11/10 wish it was an organic creature so i could birth its children",1
"for a game that is still nominally in beta, i have had ridiculous amounts of fun in warframe. squad-based 4-player mission instances across many amazing tilesets, with an incredible range of weapons and frames (exoskeletons) to use. multiple mission types, looting, crafting, mastery ranks, clan spacestations, clan conflicts, events, and more. the dev team is highly connected to the playerbase in a way i havent seen in other games. updates are normally weekly, hotfixes are rapid when theres an issue, and lets not forget the devstreams. who doesnt want to be a space ninja? whether you are bending the forces of magnetism, setting the world on fire or teleporting to every enemy in the room and backstabbing them all at once, i hope you enjoy your new addiction.",9
"this game is one the best free to play game over u have to get it because i say so and it good",1
"they update a lot..... but they fix bugs i didnt even know existed, yet they leave major bugs lingering in the game for way too long. 0/10 there incredibly pay-to-win but its damn fun.",4
"i recommend this for everyone who likes ninjas, yeah! ninjas in space! how cool is that? plus! free-to-play!",1
"this game is so good you dont want to stop playing and f2p... o mama!! 11/10",5
"fantastic gameplay and weapons, hope more stuff comes!",4
"i recommend this game bicause of the cool grafichs end the easy gameplay",1
"if you love third person shooters, or shooters in general, you will love this! even if it is still in beta i think, a great game and has a great future as well. i give a 10/10. a few bugs here and there, but i highly reccomend this game.",1
"one of the most impressive free-to-play games ive ever played. graphically impressive, with uniquely designed weapons, enemies, and characters. its a little light on story, unfortunately. also, unless you want to grind for hours for certain weapons and extra characters, be ready to fork over some real life money for some platinum (warframes premium currency).",1
"warframe is great, cant stop playing, a bit of a grind but worth it. nothing is more satisfying than having all the warframes and weapons in the game and equipping each with maxed out mods making your warframes and weapons extremely powerful. each warframe is like a tool and every tool has its purpose and usefulness depending on the situation. each comes with unique abilities, some warframes are harder to get than others. some weapons are just fun as hell to use. melee is on par with some of the best guns, and there are many optimal ways to build a warframe depending on what you focus on and what style of play is most enjoyable to you. the game can remain completely free to play as every item is obtainable given time.",5
"nice game... 10/10 no have bugs and very goof graphics!",1
"probably the greatest f2p game ive ever played. this game gets a 10/10 for the simple fact that anything you can spend premium currency on - you can also obtain without spending a single penny if you put a bit of time in. which is great but then if you want to buy all the super amazing equipment your gonna be spending a decent amount of coin - gotta respect that. other than that, the actual gameplay is nothing revolutionary - just a very smooth mixture of shooting/mellee combat. then you throw in the hundreds of modifications for each piece of equipment and you have an incredibly addictive f2p shooter!",1
"totally agree with this game! when i saw the first ever trailer for warframe, i was like woah! that was epic! i want this game right now! although, i got it this year and missed my chance on getting pretty cool stuff including the dex furis which i totally checked my inbox and didnt show up at all! anyways, i give the game a 10/10!",9
"sure this game requires patience to get better items, but the gameplay is the best i have seen in a while. this game is most definently worth a try!",1
"th game is great fun and is exciting. the one thing that i dont like is that most of the things you have to buy with your steam money and the weapons that you can buy with in-game money cost obsene amounts. i was a bit dissappointed when i found this out because i was hoping i could get new characters and swords etc. the ai could be improved since you can get through a level by rolling around and melee attacking everyone. but for some people it still is fun.",1
"i cant run into game, my launcher has problem updating with launcher update failed, restart updating it said",1
"great atmosphere for any shooter gamer, it fast, quick and changes levels everytime you play, its like mass effect had a child and this is the result! great game!",1
"free-to-play shooters... lets face it... the market is full of them, but most ftp shooters fail. not because they were bad shooters, in fact, most of them were quite good shooters... but, ironically, it isnt the shoot&run mechanics that kill or raise free-to-play shooters, but the mechanics that are not shooting and running. since all ftp shooters involve shooting, players are drawn in either by the settings or brand name, but stay for the extra mechanics that keep the game alive. this game has them. its a grind game, yes, but its a shooter... and its an unbelieveable amount of fun to shoot and kill things in this game, so you wont mind it. plus the crafting system(based on farming) is fun and addictive. weapons provide variety from shotguns and rifles to grenade and rocket launchers(plus a couple of bigass swords). and the clan system, ooh the clan system is kewl!... clans are more japanese-dojo oriented, but the clan base(dojo) is really kewl, and the fact that you build it yourself just makes it more so. anyway, its worth a try, if you get the crafting system and stuff, itll probably eat away at about 150 h of your time. tip: way more fun if you bring a friend in.",2
"recommended game, if you guys ever played mass effect before, very similiars, but its free anyway",1
"ever wondered what it would be like to be a space ninja? step into warframe and find out for yourself",1
"this game, like absolutely a great third-person ninja fighting derptastic game ever. would recommend this for sure to some people.",1
"i do not normally write reviews but this game is worth everything i have put into it. i get very bored of games very easy but warframe has been keeping my attention for 100+ hours. it is crazy how this game is still in beta yet it feels like a full release. i would give it a 10/10",4
"yes this game is amazing if you love having stuff to do at all times this is the game for you.",2
"epic games great to play with friends so epiccc but its kinda boring if you dont have friends to play with =/ and cant chat with other players when gaming that sucks a little =(",2
"once you figure out how to get into everything this game is very fun i would recommend trying it out",1
"greath game,everyone who likes to build up levels and gather equipent will like it, also the fighting is getting better and better with each update",9
"its a space ninja sci-fi shooter runngun slash em up f2p co-op adventure dungeon grinder! at least one these points must have gotten u excited :p",2
"this game is awesome. you wil have lots of fun playing this. you can choose stealth of rampage.",1
"i just ught a new laptop i hope this game works on it ;)",1
"there is nothing much to say about warframe execpt its awesomeness. 1st of all it have ninjas... and space... well the gameplay is fun to play. the crafting system makes u want to make more. i recommend this game to all players who like playing a coop-playing style. if this game just have ninjas i would only rate it 8 but this game have ninja and space so 9.5/10 for me",4
"warframe is the bomb. no joke you guys. so much fun, and i just started a few days ago. the melee system is a little on the rough side in my opinion, but i dont care. the vast variety mods make the vast variety of weapons more enjoyable with one-hit kills. and dont forget the sentinals! overall, i rate this game 10/10 crowbars. stop reading this review and go play the game!",1
"i like this game because of we can play a lot of weapon type",8
"i enjoy collecting and upgrading, this game fits me, however, i dislike how somethings are removed like weapons (boar (normal) snipetron, and now stat helmets). however, everything else i enjoy greatly.",9
"this truly is the best game i ever played. its a third-person shooter and very fun, because its not killing other people instead you kill a.i. in different levels and missions. the co-op oriented gameplay is very appealing to me and has many benefits to it, than the traditional pvp games. if you like something different and unique, i would recommend this game to these who do. this is a 10 out of 10 for me.",1
"this game is amazing and challenging. for those who want a battle this game has it all!",5
"fantastic. if you have a bad gaming computer, you can run this at 30 frames easily. thats what call of duty is at, and that game isnt bad frames wise.",1
"this is a great game to play with freinds. i really enjoy this game and can not wait to see this game really take off with some really cool stuff. keep up the good work warframe.",7
"pretty cool everyone should get if u like halo and gears of war nice 3rd person",1
"space ninjas. i cant think of anything else to say.",6
"really fast & hard third-person action, keep an eye on it! someone out there reminds hayden tenno? ;-)",1
"this is why f2p works. i only dld warframe because it was free. i didnt expect much. maybe shoot a few bad guys, slap a few digital high-fives, get called a noob by some psycho teenage virgin.. you know, good time in steam world. then i would log off, uninstall and move on. but this one caught me by surprise. the graphics are great. the particle systems are a nice touch as well. the game doesnt try to be too much. its comfortable being what it is.. an acrobatic, sci-fi, space shooter. get together with a few other random players, slide, wall-run, swing swords and fire high powered weapons at space scum as you traverse our solar system. its clean, simple, visually impressive fun. i will probably never play this game hardcore but i will definitely pick it up from time to time. i may even drop some scrilla on it at some point.",1
"game is awesome! can play free or put money into it to get some items and frames you want.",7
"boring as . one of the most repetitive games you will play in your life but its still above average and amusing the first few times.",4
"decent game. i really enjoy it, but dont be fooled by the free to play. it is definately a free to play, but to get any sort of decent upgrades you have to pay for it. if youre looking for a third person shooter to play with your friends for a while this might be it.",1
"good game, without playing with friends it can only be fun for so long",1
"space-ninjas with op guns and an arsenal of awesome swords and . entirely free and with some friends can be a lot of fun. definetly one of my favorites",2
"very fun game but if you buy plat dont waste it on stuff you can build anything slots for warframes and weapons are much better.",2
"this game used to be so great. i mean it still is. the changed the way you navigate the universe and it confuses me :(",3
"if you are into shooters and dont mind future type of games, this is perfect",1
"warframe is a fun game based around stealth tactics but once your seen shoot or slash your way through enemies",2
"pretty good and fun game i think im going to play it a lot!! haha",1
"good game, gets repetitive but can be very fun if you dont play too seriously. looks great, runs nicely",1
"pointless item grinding and space ninjas. what more could you ask for? (concept is interesting, but combat is exstremely repetative and boring, wasted potenial. shame.)",1
"gotta play this cause you know you want to be a space ninja.",7
"brilliant game, so many features and amazing graphics and gameplay. this game has many signs that it can be bigger and better with these constant updates. cannot wait for the future!",4
"space ninjas. wall running. upgrades for everything. nuff said.",1
"good, fun game. the keystrokes are simple and easy to pick up. so if youre new to pc gaming, dont be afraid to give this a chance. even for the vet. players the story (from what ive played) is good. its key focus is team work. soloing can be done... but trust me. working with others is the way to go. hours of fun, easy to pick up, many play styles to pick from. a good game.",1
"my 2 handed greatsword attacks faster than a dagger, 10/10.",5
"a third-person co-op f2p space gun ninja themed bloom effect simulator, whrrfrrm somehow manages to be a lot of fun to play. the only thing you cant get with a surprisingly reasonable degree of patience is item slots to store your arsenal, theres so few ways to grief people that even pubbies are tolerable to run with, and most of the enemies are obligingly punchable. the real standout is the mobility options, in which you can powerslide forever, run on walls, run up walls, flying kick dudes, and generally dart about the levels like a murderous superball.",3
"i left this game for some months and came back to feel the awesomeness again, started over with a new account, and i had a lot of fun seeing all of these new changes like the cutscenes and the badass intro, the dynamic weapon selection that allows you to choose unlike before, and the characters look very cool and have a lot of unique abilities.",2
"it was a great game got a little boaring with the farming idea but it was very fun",1
"if youre into the sci-fi genre video games, then this is the game for you. i downloaded this game despite the skeptisism from other reviews and i definitely do not regret it. it took a minute or two to get used to the different types of weapons and features the game offered but once you get the flow of the game you just cant find yourself to get away from it. what more could you want in a sci-fi co op slasher game, your a space ninja that basically recks house with a whole ninja aresenal and badass space ninja wizard powers. your basically goku and thor mashed together into one badass dude that s people up because hes so badass!",1
"i shot a guy in the  with a bow and he exploded. 10/10",1
"if you like cyber space ninjas that fight androids and robot ostriches fighting infertile masses of armor fighting totally-not-the-flood, then this game is for you.",1
"space ninjas. guns. lasers. bombs. arrows. swords. space zombies. space nazis. any other question?",10
"it is amazing, it may not seem like it at first but if you get a friend or two it becomes the best co-op game ive ever played.",4
"sexy alien robot ninja simulator 1 thing. mobility!",1
"its an okay game if your computer can handlw it, i havent played too much because my computer has a seizure when i try to play it, ut from what i did play of it, it was fun.",1
"this game... this is my second review for it, and my opinion has stayed the same, this is an amazing game. the only way to fully describe this game is: ninjas... in space... with rocket launchers.",4
"a very great game. robot ninjas!!!!! also it doesnt need a high end pc to play. the graphics are amazing. 10/10",1
"ing awesome game. if you dont play this, youre a dickmonger!?",2
"amazing game for old pcs.on dual core is working fine just you need toi have a good internet conmnection and vsync enabled when youre fighting.try it.!!!!",1
"quite fun if you play with friends.i recomend it for people who like to have fun with their friends",1
"i would definately recommend warframe to someone who does not have a whole lot of money in their steam wallet. the graphics are amazing, mainly because somehow i can get it to run on a higher setting than most of my other games, and you are basically a ninja with whatever weapon you can afford in-game. its pretty amazing being able to sprint, crawl, and flip your way across the room in a matter of seconds. not only can you purchase weapons and gear, but you can also craft your own if you have the materials for it. i would say that the only problem with it, though, is the fact that you level up pretty slowly (at least i do) and from what levels i am able to play it seems that the goal is more or less the same. it still has plenty of enemies to kill in any fashion you can, and you always have to make a quick escape afterwards. i still think that this game is pretty cool for something that costs absolutely nothing.",1
"ive played this game before and to be honest my first experience was a little scratchy this is a skyrim dungeon map shooter mix",1
"this game is the best thirdperson shooter i watched my friend play it",1
"this game is really good online and with friends it is less enjoyable playing solo mode",1
"this game is so worth it, even with the bugs and anything else. it is amazing",4
"very nice game, it has nice sword moving and karate moves, epic co op game too.",1
"dude, free game about space ninjas. whats not to love?",1
"one of my fevrit games and it keep geting better evry up date 5/5",1
"it s a good game but farming is everything...if you don t like that kind of game don t play it...",4
"i really enjoyed playing this for a while with a friend but playing this game alone is boring as hell, i would only recommend it if you have some friends to play it with otherwise not since it gets repetitive fast.",1
"it is really fun fast paced tps which is very rare lately",1
"a very fun game where you play as space ninja mercinairies.",5
"great game, but out of curiosity, i just bought a steam wallet code. is there a way to pay for platinum using the wallet code in place of a credit card?",1
"i love this game!! it is so much fun and it never gets old. online mode however when you want to join a level it brings you to a clan that could be farther in to level and you dont start from the beginning. that is my only complaint. the scenery is so ammazing. how i would descirbe this game is halo but free. yes this game does have a lot of inspiration. art: halo, when you lose your health you fall down and a teammate has to pick you back up to save you: left 4 dead & call of duty. gameplay: mass efect. however these inspirations dont bother me. highly recomend this game.",1
"the game its very good,and you need to coordinate your team to win,its difficult,but good",2
"one of the best games ive played, gets addicting when you get a hang of it :p",6
"works best on pc, not so much on ps4. fun, good lookin game.",3
"holy crap, i enjoy this game. granted, you may need to put a bit of money into it in order to get enough equipment slots, but if you play your cards right, you can build almost every weapon and warframe in the game. yes, some may call this a violent farming simulator since once you get a certain distance, youre mostly looking for resources to build weapons, warframes, and upgrade equipment. that said, its a quality third-person shooter that--while not having any solid story like in a single-player game--it still has very good gameplay and plenty of potential to grow far beyond what it is now.",4
"dont be put off by that metascore, this is a very solid game. id put it more around 82-85 after having played for 150 hours or so prior to steam. even the default warframes they give you to start with are very fun to play. you can earn all the others, including all kinds of weapons, through normal gameplay. spending a bit of real money can, of course, speed things up, but it is certainly not required. this game has a very unique vibe to it that really doesnt exist anywhere else. from the ui, to the way your warframes move and fight, to the diverse environments you will battle through. the combat is fast-paced and fluid with fantastic animations and character models, and a very simple parkour system to learn and master. everything from wall running, to sliding along the ground while you shoot, to more advanced moves that allow you to perform flying kicks to knock down enemies, or sliding past a group of them and executing a spinning attack to take out their legs. you can play solo or with friends. you can be stealthy, or run in guns blazing. its completely up to you and your playstyle and the weapons and mods you select for your warframe. grab a group of friends and give it a try. you will not be disappointed.",3
"probably the best game ever. join me. its free to play. :)",1
"this game has some glorious features, my favorite of which is its well-formed free-running mechanic, which allows for extensive play with the levels after some basic familiarity is established.",1
"this is officially my 2nd favourite game, the 1st being borderlands 2. <3",3
"great game, best free to play model i have ever seen. worth checking out for sure if your looking for some fun run and gun co-op action while playing as a space ninja.",3
"probably one of the best game ive played in years. a good co-op shooting third person. try it, its free anyways !",1
"its free, and while yes it may still be buggy warframe is still a good game. with the frequent updates adding new content to the game its only getting better...",1
"not enough motivation to farm the game for its sweet items. design is beautiful.",1
"this game is like left 4 dead, except youre a space ninja. and you cut up and shoot overly-cloned space marines, robots, and aliens. with persistent item leveling and upgrades.",1
"this game is grindy as . not as bad as some ive played, though. good looking game, with fun action. the different warframes (suits) add different abilities and while some of them are less than fantastic most are at least kinda fun to play (some are hilariously fun).",3
"cant stop grinding to grind some more so i can grind more after that to unlock something else to grind while im grinding. grinding: the game.",3
"i like warframe so much but ii want to get alot of plantinum but i do not know how",2
"nice game in total.. but that being said its pretty much the same thing you do so if you never grow old i a game this is for you it delivers both action packed thrills aswell as stunning map layouts",1
"such a fun game, love the game with everything changing and the gameplay always surprises you nicely",1
"this is a very good game but there are two problems i have with it. one) the game isnt rewarding enough and... two) please make it easier to invite people to your clan. other than this its a great game, love the graphics.",1
"if you love mass effect 3s multiplayer this game is for you. fun fast paced 3rd person shooter based in a sci-fi world.",1
"fast gameplay, cool moves, and a cinematic experience. hell i dont even like third person shooters, but this is an exeption!!! a must have for hardcore gamers.",1
"fun, immersive, and addicting, while being f2p and not pay to win.",2
"this game is in cool for the one who loves action!!!",1
"a good third-person shooting game i have never feel bored when i play this game yes, there are few downsides (samee environment, few kinds of enemy) but it is a good co-op game to play with fds and collect stuff besides, it is a free game highly recommend",8
"sooooo goooooooood i wish all gamers download it i recomended to you",1
"nice and well made game, packed with fun. recommended to all :d",1
"warframe is pretty fun once you get the controls down.. and the game gets even better when you are playing with friends.",3
"good story, amazing weapon customization, fun to play",6
"great game, great product, great fun, five stars! this game is good!!!",1
"what i would expect from destiny, but like, not bad and free?",1
"awesome game lots of content and updates almost every week new stuff. however , there are some bugs which doesnt really matter most of the time. this game needs more optimization. nevertheless, great game and i highly recommend this. i had so much fun over the past few days and really enjoy the abilities of warframes and all of them are special. special alerts mission would keep me playing but rewards should be abit better.",2
"warframe is a fun action packed thrill seeking game for all those who enjoy a great time of blood and gore with stealth or guns blazing can go co op of single player its all your choice, and come on space ninjas i need not say more",1
"so much to do in this game, and so many weapon to build :d",7
"the game got an interface redo which is targeted at the playstation 4 players who total out at about 20% of the playerbase. this redo made the game unplayable by inducing motion sickness, hiding vital options somewhere 4-6 klicks deep which you have to access over and over again, removing the starmap for some sort of planet spin wheel including a mission spin wheel, implementing senseless color codes, hiding important info behind your character model, removing the option to change your loadout quickly before a mission launches, screwing with the mod interface so that you have to memorize dozens if not hundreds of your mods by name now. i easily put 100 into the game and was really into it but this ui update flat out killed it.",5
"excellent 3rd person sci-fi themed shooter with good ui and beautiful fluid movements",4
"the game is a really fun tps (third person shooter) for people who like ninjas and space! remember this though, the game is still kinda chy and sometimes crashes, but dont let that stop you from enjoying warframe to its full. p.s.-its free!",1
"wow, this game is amazing! ive just started today and im addicted! if you like spacey games that are really modern, this is the game for you! im going to continue to play this game and i will never stop till i die, or i become really old. fun! you can get a clan dojo and build stuff in it, make in game friends, play with them in missions, join a clan, and upgrade segments in your space  to make things like a clan key. one segment lets you customize your character and weapons! so fun! 3 classes to choose from!",1
"this is by far one of the best free to play online shooters ever created, there are so many weapons and many different playstyles that go along with the warframe you choose, if you havent played this game then you definately should play it.",4

"warframe is not like any other 3rd person shooter. it is unique in its own right, with a brilliant plot, well-designed models, and smooth gameplay. i highly recommend you get this game. whether you like melee or ranged combat, warframe is not for the light-hearted. you find yourself in a fast-paced rpg-type world with missions, upgrading, and squads. arm yourself, team up with friends, and annihilate. play warframe, for ninjas..play free!!",1
"warframe is set in a universe where the solar system is locked in unending conflict between the tenno, the corpus, and the grineer, while the infestation threat looms over all three. you can carry out a number of different mission types to collect materials, credits, blueprints, and simply prove your skills while culling the unending threat. warframe is a game about farming at its core. you collect materials to make more weapons, warframes, and companions, eventually switching to new ones while customizing abilities and stats to suit your play-style. and while the game is in essence about farming, the combat, power, and movement systems allow one to create a very entertaining spectacle of flashing steel and lead. run on a wall, jump off, spin like a helicopter, and decapitate a grineer soldier, then top off the display by landing into a graceful slide followed immediately by another instantaneous guillotine slash from your weapon. learning to carry out movement combinations and power uses all while using firearms and blades of all sort is what makes this game really enjoyable. but, you might eventually get tired of the farming and look for a different experience.",4
"this game is a awesome 4 man squad shooter. the missions can get a little repetitive but it is fun if you play them in different styles :)",4
"7/10 best farming simulator ive ever played. lacks in lore and end-game mechanics, but its still open-beta, and digital extreme adds to it usually once a week. definately worth someones time.",7
"a hot game full of dismemberment and gore and awesome character models. fun to play with not to eat.",2
"i love this game. i have been playing this game for the past 2 weeks and it is one of the best games i have ever played. it is like a cross between assassins creed and halo or a space ninja simulator. with many diffirent characters and weapons to choose from as well as hundreds of upgrades for equipment this game has a massive amount of customization.",2
"warframe is a different kind of free to play game. instead of barraging you with ads, or forcing you to buy things you dont want, it completely keeps the aspect of a regular month-to-month or one time pay type of game. while some could fight and say its , pay to win, i beg to differ. while you can use platinum, the games currency for real money to game transactions to purchase already made weapons or new characters, youre not limited to having to use your money. instead you create the items, making the game that much better, thus the games fun lies within the aspect of creating and gathering materials for items and trying to be the fastest or the strongest tenno the solar system has ever seen. anything you can buy, you can create. it may take a few hours of fighting but then where would the fun in the game be then? in summary, warframe is a new twist on the f2p game industry, by one single characteristic that makes warframe collect most likely the most revenue of any free to play and that is they do not force you to purchase items. no one likes being forced into anything , especially not a game, and this game, one where the devs listen intentively to the players, patch things accordingly, and make the game all around enjoyable by not making you pay for a monthly subscription or limiting your activites by not paying, derserves more respect than it can ever obtain. plus: ******* space ninjas. 11/10",2
"combines the best o sword fighting games and third-person shooters into one, its purely amazing",1
"i feel like a ninja now... thanks to warframe. ... hell, thats all i should write on this review. lol play it!",1
"i played this game and it was epic since i have no windows computer anymore and i am going to get a asus just to play this game. so kewl.",1
"the game is awesome but gets kind of confusing when trying to buuld new weapons and getting upgrades",1
"the game is quite entertaining , i reccomend this to be played by any third person shooter fans . but also , i encountered a bug that force closes the game after 15 minutes of gameplay , can anybody help ??",1
"the only other games that can send you on such a power trip i find is e.y.e. divine cybermancy or space marine. you are a magical warrior ninja in space with guns and melee weapons of all sorts.",2
"is a good game but i like the open world in the space and batlles in the space but i recomended",1
"warframe is an amazing f2p game that has one hell of a paywall and that is simply buy and get bored fast. this game offers a high amount of freedom around the map and do all sorts of stunts but this game requires patience to make it a fun experience for everyone. the level of gore is great and the graphics are beautiful and it has a great storyline, sure it has repetitive levels but if you ignore that and look only at the fun factors and have a lot of patience then this is good because i tell you now when it comes to mods, you got to grind so much to get it. if you just want to ignore the beginning tutorial and want the very best equipment from the start then dont come here because it will be a waste of time and real money as you will be bored very quickly. just to tell you guys, due to getting addicted to this game i have trouble when playing other third person games because the level of freedom is completely different and i cant wallrun 9/10",4

"a 3rd person shooter with melee elements, i highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good shooter/arpg hybrid.",2
"one of the best free-to-play game ive played so far",6
"a good game, with very fluent gameplay, and mutliple classes to suit any player. constant updates and support help to keep the game running smooth, with a very nice and helpful community. 8.5/10",1
"the most fun i have with this game is the very natural feel in which different movements come together smoothly to create crazy actions, like flying kicks and diving through doors all guns blazing. the combat feels very fluid and nice, a game system i would definitely love to see made into a longer game on the scale of a mass effect. as it stands, it is a great game to hop on with friends every now and then to slice, stab, shoot, and kick your way through hoards of enemies. the one down side is the fairly obvious lack of content. you can claim to have as many missions as you want, but that doesnt mean a whole lot when each one is just a copy paste of the last.",1
"i cant tell you all how much i love warframe. its got to be one of my favorite mmos and a major timesink. this is all coming from a guy who didnt even think twice about it the first time he tried it -- i actually disliked it at first. and most of you trying it out for the first time probably will too. but youll get the urge, just like i did, to come back and play it 300 hours more. theres something so compelling about the structure of warframe. its such a simple concept -- fly in, shoot some baddies, complete the objective, fly out. rinse and repeat. yet somehow, it piques my interest. dont be turned away by that classic free to play business model. warframe isnt competetive first off, so theres no pay-to-win. you could spend hundreds of dollars buying everything in the game, but as every fan of warframe will tell you, it kills the fun. money usually goes to more aesthetic and none-essential parts of the game, or can be spent on virtually anything you might need. even then -- in game trading allows for you to obtain the currency in game that allows you to purchase these things. warframe is always changing, so its something new almost every month. theres plenty of fun to be had flying about, jumping from wall to wall and goring your foes, eviscerating any living being into 3 or 4 pieces. 8/10. worth giving a try.",4
"havent played it enough to write an in-detail review, but get this game. its awesome.",1
"i needed something to keep me busy while waiting for destiny to come out on pc. . . found it!",1
"the game itself its pretty awesome, graphs, render, gameplay, history, leveling. but can become repetitive, you take a really long time gathering what you need to craft the equipment you want, still can be good, cuz u really have to fight to presume your really cool weapons, but as i said, it can become repetitive, so you have to find something else that makes u want to play. but it rocks!",2
"myabe best f2p game yet this game does not pursue pay to win f2p model seriously. players can obtain every good items without real-money pay.(however, it take a time for item farming) there are many new players comming everyday. if anyone interesting tps co-op action game, i recommend this game. one thing i dont like this game is, too repetitive mission play",2
"space ninjas, access to a plethora of weapons, accessories and pets/sentinels all for free. just your time and effort is needed. huge learning curve, but really rewarding!",5
"dont waste your time or money on this trash. i tried to log in and i get a message saying my account was banned until 2035? when i submitted a ticket the answer i got was that i voilated the eula somehow, would not explain how i supposedly did, and informed me that there is no further reason to discuss the matter. im glad i did not spend any real money on this, and i urge new and current players to do the same.",1
"warframe is a fun game that is free. the combat is smooth and fluid, and the game provides unique weapons for wider variety. the only issue is that the settings need to be customized. the default controls need to be handpicked for the most part, and the game needs to be played in windowed mode, but that is my only complaint. the rest of it is really fun and it puts an interesting spin on the shooter concept. tl;dr like mass effect combat with less cover. play in windowed. fix key bindings",1
"from blowing enemies up with a rocket pistol too striking them down with a big boomerang too chopping them in half with arrows, this game is prett much the best 3rd person, parkour, action shooter you can get for free. though dont let the shops and crafting get in your way, cuz once you figure out that they are super simple, the game is just a blast........ ninjas play free, even if you are not a ninja.",2
"worth playing if you got no better game to play has some potential to become something worthwhile but at the moment its a little lacking in content by that i mean its repetitive. fun, but repetitive. cant wait to see where it goes",1
"first of all i will state i dislike fps.. but! this game is amazing community = helpful gameplay = easy graphic = amazing this game is great for free to play, even if you spend $0 or $100 must check it out",1

"i really love this game! the graphics and gameplay is amazing i also love the how each warframe has a very unique ability that they can use! keep it up! :d",1
"ive never seen such an asinine implementation of a microtransaction system. this wants you to pay exorbitant amounts of real world money for things that should be in-game currency (like continues). the general price for a trivial item is more than most complete games cost outright. the gameplay doesnt really live up to the hype. characters feel sluggish compared to the blitzkrieg enemies. the damage you take spikes dramatically, leaving you lead with no real clue what hit you (or when). but you probably could have evaded it only you didnt run like you were trying to hold in a duece. the art style is incoherent, mostly seeming like a direct lift from quake ii. it is, however, a beautiful recreation of it. the game loads fast, the game engine seems highly optimized and runs fantasic. in fact, it uses all the bells and whistles my hardware can provide and still runs faster than games that look 1/3rd as good. too bad pretty aint enough. warframe has a great foundation from which to build an amazing game upon. it just lacks in so many fundemental ways. but more than anything, the greed of the microtransation system is what kills this game. this is a poop nugget with a spit shine.",1
"best free to play game on steam id pay $60 dollars for this on a disk anyday! i love playing with my freinds every day almost!!",1

"this game is awesome, great for co-op with friends. and amazing graphics for only 1gb download!",1
"this game is about runnning up walls and shooting arrows at aliens faces... what els do you need ?",2
"love this game been playing for a long time and its not a pay to win type game as you can make most of the weapons or sell ingame items to other players to make platnum. graphics are great and the gameplay is smooth. give it a shot!!",1
"while im not a big fan of most free to play games, warframe is one that i could come back to and have some fun with. with a lot of stuff to get, fun gunplay, and a rich and vibrant community, warframe is definitely a free to play game you should at least give a shot.",1
"this game...just wow! i have rarely seen this kind of game with a massive community over all consoles. freerunning and being an all-around ninja with 100s of weapons to use, this has become my around get-to game when i just want to express movement! would reccomend to anyone with a pc ps4 or xb1.",6
"great game. many options alot of intense actoin and the ability to blast your enemies to pieces is a fun atmosphere.",2
"while the lack of end game content is limited to the t4s and outer planets it is enjoyable to say the least. every mission does a great job at making your warframe feel like a complete badass. plus the addition of dev blogs on fridays gives the opportunity to tune in and see what the devs have planned for the next update.",5
"considering that this is a great advantage for anyone to play a free to play game this isnt worth wating your time on.theres always going to be that one game thats says free to play but with a catch you have to use real money of credit card on the website or you can use some money from your steam bank to buy more plantinum thats the most thing that i hated this waste of my time peice of  game.yea sure it has good graphics and all but still the money thing still ticks me off eveytime i think of it.find otehr peoples recommendations after you play this waste of time game peice of  after you get the concept of it.its why its probably gonna get knocked off steam one of these days.",2
"as someone whos played a lot of the game (225 hours as of when im writing this), i can say its overall a pretty good game, and its all but boring. it is, however, fairly repititive in its play, and you have to either a) get used to a lot of grinding and waiting, or b) spend money to get things quickly and the way you want them. it is pay-to-win in a few senses, but everything you can get by spending real money, you can get by waiting for in-game time-limited, occasional alerts, which give the same things out. as far as grinding, its like every other game with an rng that tends to hate or love certain players. it has a fairly balanced player market, in which you can sell these *rare* items you get from the rng to other players for platinum, the credits you spend actual money for. so, in a sense, spend time on this game and you can convert it into practical real money. over all, this game is pretty well-done, especially as far as graphics go, and id recommend it to anyone who likes mmos in general, even though the themes and genre may not please others, along with the lack of lore. either way, its a solid game.",3
"chop,chop,chop,space ninjas aaannnnddd more chopping totally awesome",2
"amazing game.. but lacks of map.. i feel every level is a same place -_-",1
"at first glance, this looks like an awesome game., especially for a f2p game. i have to say im very impressed, thus far. ive only played for a few minutes but from what i have seen so far i really like. as of right now i would definitely recommend this game. the action is smooth and the graphics are pretty good, with what i have to work with here at home on my laptop. it definitely reels you in and makes you want to play, but for now i have to go...ill find out later i suppose if its worth the space on my hard drive.",1
"pretty freakin awesome with friends and if ya do it right!",7
"the answer to a question nobody asked, but apparently should have: what do you get when you combine dark sector with phantasy star online? answer: a fantastic online co-op game wioth loads of depth! you really dont have to pay anything to have plenty of fun (but buying a few goodies is even better), and playing online cooperatively is a blast. the graphics and sound are none too shabby, either, and it supports a controller in-mission. my personal favorite game on steam.",1
"its an awsome game you should play its really cool and add me",1
"possibly the best free-to-play shooter out there. the graphics look great and yet the game runs surprisingly well on less powerful machines. the gameplay is also great. it runs entirely on the rule of cool and has lots of stylish attacks and abilities. space ninjas - its as awesome as it sounds.",6
"if you like unique, shooting stuff, and playing with friends, this is your game!",1

"i am a disciple rank in this game warning:: this game is gonna own you and consume a lot of time this is so much fun too much to explore too much to do much to know off topics as stalker and things new exciting updates that are awesome this is just a awesome game that most of the people are fan of!",7
"holy crap this game is good it is so good man if you dont have it get it even if it will crash ur computer its worth it man so better download now for the awesome multiplayer with a few of your bros. cuz nothin beats that multiplayer feeling with your brother. or friend so i totally reccomend this game never ending/1 totally awesome with the guns aliens and maps. but its a little pay to win unless you spend 1,000 hours of getting xp for buying good weps and you have to be pretty good to get tons of points( like pro level)",2
"-some people cant even log in i can not find anything positive because i cant even log in so -i have played this on xbox 1 my only problem is that you have to wait a day to lvl up if you fail -i will update this when i download this on my new computer :)",1

"one of the best games i have ever played. very fun, very addictive. so much to do in this game. i highly recommend this game to everyone.",3

"great game to play so long as it runs and doesnt crash.",1
"i ran sideways on a wall as i was blocking bullets with my katana before i striked off the wall & split him in half thats enough for me for a free to play game.",1
"one of the best free2play games out there. love this game.",3
"not a addicted game nothing special, oh  why i got 200+ hr of playing?",3
"8/10 +fun, fast-paced co-op gameplay +great visuals +lots of content without paying a cent +did i mention you can chop dudes in half? -occasional glitches and bugs can and probably will appear -feels somewhat repetitive/grindy -menus and mod options can feel a little overwhelming at first amazing quality for a free 2 play game. has some occasional bugs that like to pop up, and it can get a little repetitive if you dont wanna put any money into it - as some of the more advanced items take rarer resources that can be somewhat annoying to get. also, the game mechanic that allows you to modify your warframe and weapons with mods can take some time to really comprehend. but if you just wanna cut some dudes in half with your friends without paying a cent then id highly recommend checking it out. i will probably end up putting money into this game at some point as i really do enjoy it.",3

"i dont normally play these kind of games but i do like this game. decent combat, nice visuals, and its free.",1
"absolutely love this game. i got disillusioned with destiny on the xbox one pretty quickly and a friend recommeded i try this. it is amazing. you can play solo or with other people. there is pvp and pve missions, and they have a lot of variety. tons of weapons, skills, abilities, mods, upgrades......ive spent almost 60 hours playing thus far and i am still just stratching the surface of this free game! i havent had to use any of my money so far, and i am a good contender in the pvp elements. would highly recommend this to anyone who likes adventure/action games.",2
"i have been playinf warframe for several hours now, alone, with friends, with some random people now. graphics are really good for a free game. game mechanics are kinda repetitive, a lot of missions with the same steps to complete them. friends / online experience is really good, you can play with friends, they can help you with your missions, or you can help them just in 2 clicks. i got to say that is a 7 / 10, the game has history, and everything but the missions in some point become repetitive, i would anyway i will recomend the game to friends.",1
"this is a fun third-person parkour shooter that feels very fun. the controls are good, the graphics are good, the story is okay, the gameplay is great. overall, very good. i give it 2 thumbs up.",1

"first impressions are pretty good. gameplay is fun. its a f2p third person multiplayer objective based shooter and as far as i can tell there is no pvp. you can play alone or with with up to 3 friends and/or randoms. it has a league of legends style shop where you can either pay real money to get the stuff you want now with platinum or you can play the game and get credits to buy stuff. of course, there are a few things you have to pay for, such as xp and credit boosts, and some of the items you can only buy the blueprints for if you use credits and then you have to collect the materials ingame to make them. the graphics are pretty amazing and would probably be far better if my laptop could handle anything but the lowest settings.",1
"if you like grinding the same missions over and over again, then this is the game for you. p.s dont touch the pvp for a while, s broken, mang s i m p l y e p i c",3
"this game really struck a chord with me. it seems to be just the right blend of mmo and co-op shooter. excellent developer, excellent engine with superb performance even on my old hardware (gtx 660ti). engaging melee combat and gunplay, combined with an insane amount of customization through the ccg-like mods system really makes every battle a fun fight. mmo elements can be too grind-heavy for some, especiialy if youre one of the they will get my money from my cold, dead hand type of free-to-play player. if youre willing to drop some cash though, that whole thing is not a factor. player clan (guild) dojos can also be built, which definitely make you feel like you have staked a small claim in the game universe. its lore, while a bit underwhelming, is excellent when it is there. i could go on for a while with smaller details, but why still read when you can try it for free*! *not free as in path of exile",1

"fun and pretty, and those skin-tight suits are damn sexy.",1
"this game is very enjoyable. however, it seems the developers dont know where theyre going with it. some days warframe is brilliant and i love it. the next something could be changed or switched or removed or added. its impossible to tell. i still reccomend this game, but dont expect to know what itll be like tomorrow. i am editing this review about 8 months after it was first posted. the game has been going downhill since february, and has finally reached its death. the game is currently an unplayable pile of . so much potential wasted because of greed.",6

"i will like to recommend this game to everyone ... this game have some reality dat i have never expected ...",3

"definitely a fun and fast paced experienced for new players like myself. cant wait to hop back in and wreck some face.",1
"until this point i havent been playing much from the free-to-play aile in the videogame supermarket, but when i heard ye ole digital extremes were making a co-op third person spaceninja simulator that would have arpg-elements and would be free-to-play the only thing that made me not explode through the roof was the f2p-part. but all worries were unfounded; this game could be a 50 triple-a release and it would be great, so i cant complain about the free-to-play part. you dont need to spend money and you can play just fine without putting down any hard earned dough. gameplay is fantastic and the world it creates is superlative. this is just so much fun! and many of the free-to-play-problems are actually obsolete because its co-op (pve). theres no reason not to try this game. and come on; youre a katana-wielding ninja-samurai-assassin in the future! could it be more awesome? join the tenno resistance and fight for your survival!",7

"only 4 hours played, yet i can tell my life is over.",1
"i personally find this game entertaining. the criticism ive heard is that you repeat missons far too frequently and fight the same enemies over and over. any loot grind game ever?",1
"it is a fun free to play game and being free doesnt hurt either",6
"one of the best f2p games here on steam imo. if you like the fancy-looking sci-fi action third person shooters - definitely worth giving it a try.",5
"good game, but i am struggle about the comments of this game. they said that it sucks because the difficult before some armor forged and after is really different and it makes the game really hard in the beginning and easy at the final. i am a rookie of this game and i hope what they said is the situation before the update.",1
"warframe is the new standard in the pay to win games. thank you digital extremes, for making such a sweet game!",1
"f2p, not p2w. a little grindish but thats not bad at all when the games just flat out fun. first couple of missions can be kind of boring when youre by yourself(tutorials basically). but when you can start playing with others, it makes it so much better. game is worth having a price tag on it tbh",1
"it really isnt all that free to play and sure you can get the same stuff by both farming and buying with real life money.however if you just cash for the right weapon you just wreck everything.even for making things such as decorations for your clan you may require items that you might as well cash for.the game also forces you to buy weapon slots with your real life money so this game is pretty much p2w.however if youre willing to pump your money into it then sure it is fun get some friends,make a clan,cooperate and have fun",1

"there are so many good things about this game.....but theres also one big downside. lets start with the good things, for starters the game is free so you can easily hop in and play.also, combat is rather fun and you can choose to play stealthy or simply all out.but i mean really, who dafuq never dreamt of being a flippin space ninja? its genius! now for the downside.....the grind. yup, theres so much grind in this game that the only way not to get bored of it is to either play the game once a month or using the help of a little friend we call wallet. :/ the game has so much potential but unless they find a way to stop the game from getting repetitive then i dont know what will save this game. the reason im gonna recommend it is cause its free and its definetly a good f2p game, but yeah, im not so sure if its a good game in general.",1
"wicked awesome, easy to handle with controller too!",1
"warframe has changed so much since the release on steam. when it was first released to the public, it was fun being a space ninja, but the missions and battles were pretty repetitive. over time, warframe has went through sooooo many changes. some good. some bad. but heres the thing, the developers actually communicate with the players and ask what they want in the game. i have so much respect for them. everyone should atleast give this game a try. i mean, it is free.",2
"good action game, that evolves with every update. at the beginning it is a little lame, to have your wallet tortured, becuase you need money, to buy slots for your items. otherwise you would only have space for two weapons, and this is annoying, if you dont want to spend real money so fast... however, the game is good, but lacks of a great story... just the same missions all the time, but the progressing factor makes the game really enjoyable and it is the best game, for a long co-op session with up to three friends. the different powers of your characters makes teamwork be a quite good and fun making experience. however, after 750hours the game made me rethink the concept of the developers. the game is in beta status and instead of developming a release, the guys release a beta to other systems like ps4 and xbox one.... and the only thing that evolves is the money making updates of cosmetics and new weapons, or chars... and this sucks.... instead of developing the game, the creators develop updates with much more new bugs.... with the saying.. hey, we are in a beta... but why do they create new stuff, instead fixing the good old... after update 14 ive stopped playing, since i feel fooled by the developers.",6
"i love this game, its the best game to play when your bored",3
"its alot of fun easy to play even looks good on my older computer",1
"first impressions: i am only a few missions in to the game but their are a few things i would like to comment on. firstly, the game looks very good. i have a 2 year old acer aspire with low system specs and warframe runs well on low settings. i like the combat in the game but i do have a few complaints. firstly, the ai is really bad. they cover from you with half their bodies exposed to your bullets and sometimes run around like chickens with their heads cut off when they cant find cover. i think that the devs try to compinsate for this problem by having enemies spawn right in areas you just cleared and shoot you while your covering. luckaly, you have a lot of health and a regenerating sheild. warframe has a seperate button for hitting people with your sword which makes it a viable wepon in close quarters (i like that a lot) and quite nice shooting. the menu system, however is difficult to navigate and is poorly explaned. the plot is also not easy to follow as it throws a bunch of made up words at you with no background on the setting. i assume all this will be explaned later, but still... overall, i think warframe ( so far) is a good game. i will update this review as i play the game more.",1
"great overall game. fantastic graphics, setting, style. the combat has a great edgy feeel to it, but can be repetitive. same with the maps and enemy factions. i do love the dynamic missions aspect though, mission objectives can change in-game, which can be annoying, but it keeps you on your toes. also, the customization of both your character (your warframe) and weapons through a systerm of upgrades called mods. lastly, i love the fact that the creators have put such an emphasis on close-combat. you should definatly try it out, its free.",9
"a third-person shooter with mmo clan and regional chat/trade capabilities. an interestingly different skill/upgrade system (sort of rpgish, yet not). a very nice and versitile combat system. a cross between splinter cell, doom 3, bulletstorm and a few others. for the free-to-play games, this one might reside in your arsenal for quite a while.",1
"one of those games you can easily immerse yourself in at first. a good time killer, decent gameplay, helluva lot of customization (if youre willing to pay real money).",2
"an awesome sci-fi shooter with great graphics ad fighting, (bodies are kind of glitchy but thats me nit-picking) makes you feel like a god of war, slashing,shooting and destroying waves of enemies in just about any awesome way.",2
"it is a pretty cool space ninja simulator but, it may become a bit repetitive after some gameplay hours.",1
"from a founder till now this game have made alot of changes some i accept and other i hate to see changed but still this is a good game hope your find fun with wall running wall jumpremind me of old game this part fps shooling or if that is not your cup of tea, run in face to face and smash them with melee, hope you enjoy",2
"a good game for poor faggs with small dixxs and have been analy  like 0",1
"you get to play as a badass space ninja. what are the downsides of that?",1
"rating: 8/10 overall a fun game, but for new players it can be difficult to get into. for the first couple hours of the game, you will be using the same boring weapons until you buy/craft a new weapon using blueprints. you can run on walls, fly kick, slide, and perform devastating melee combos. fun game to play coop with friends!",1
"needs dedicated servers. a lot of lag when you join a game making it almost unplayable. get repetitive after about 25 hours in. good game though.",1
"so much fun. i start play this game when it was beta then some  happen and i stop play it. but please play this game ninjas everywhere....alien ninjas.",1

"warframeis one of the best games i have played so far. its really hard to explain what the game is but basically space ninjas in a way. the gameplay is very good to have a great replayability for all the missions. the game is better when you you play with friends. trust me it makes it easier to get stuff done when you dont have to over extend yourself.",1
"this game is genuinely really fun to play, theres nothing really more badass than being an alien space ninja soldier wielding guns, bows and swords. the only annoying thing is the constant glitching and rather consistent game-style.",1
"warframe is a really fun game that i would recommend to all, i recently started playing again and seen that it has improved alot with new areas and weapons. pros: its free, the game is really fun, all the weapons on the shop can be made without throwing cash at the game although it can take a long time, the game is also regularly updated and improved. cons: the game is very grind based, levels can get very repetative, and build time of items can literally take days to complete. space ninja... that is all",2
"great game and its free i highly recomend this game for everyone to play ive had so much fun on it with my friends :d",1
"this to totally recomended to all who enjoy two simple things....those things are ninjas.....and guns. nothing more nothing less.",2

"bio-tech space ninjas if john woo made the guyver, this would be the videogame tie in did i mention...space ninjas?",2
"this is a fun and fast paced sci-fi shooter with excellent gameplay. with a variety of weapons, classes and a unique level/ ranking system, its a good free-to-play time sink. micro-transactions can get a bit pricey, but taking advantage of sales as well as in game coupon rewards shouldnt make it a problem. everything that isnt cosmetic or an inventory slot can be obtained without dropping a penny but luck and being online at the right times plays a big part in getting some of the rarer items. overall a swell f2p shooter with good mechanics that is definitely worth anyones time. also space ninjas!",8
"fantastic game, just dont know why the metascore is relatively low. but in my opinion, its a gorgeous game with really high graphics. i especially love this kind of co-op shooter which emphasis on teamwork. in a nutshell, this is a really amazing and definitely one of the most awesome free-to-play games out there. rating: 8.5/10",1
"really nice game! playing with friends, and killing some bots! you should try it ^^",1
"1 of the best free game awesome graphics and easy to understand game",1

"this game is amazing i love it so much. highly reccomnend it",1
"great graphic, good variety in ennemy type and weapon. all in all, this is a great game",2
"great game, best cyborg ninja running and gunning simulator. free to play, although its much more enjoyable of you pay up front for more warframes and weapons, the progression is very slow.",1
"its like destiny, pretty good. the graphics are nice & its a face-paced game. ill put it like this: star wars enemies fighting ninjas from rise of the guardians. meh. lol. its pretty good. love it",1
"good game just better specs to run it at a good frame but other people should run it just fine",1
"greatest game ever (besides all batman arkham games)! this is a must play!!!! 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10",5

"cut guy in half twice when he was dead 10/10 runs to door gets knocked back by shield 11/10",1
"a very solid f2p third person game. yes, it is grindy. yes, each mission will feel remarkably similar to the rest. yes, the only real goal in the game is to gather resources to build new warframes and weapons. despite this, is it fun? the simple answer is yes. despite feeling like youre grinding a lot, the combat and features of each warframe and the modding system keeps players like myself coming back for more. slashing enemies up into pieces doesnt seem to get old! there is also a decent variety of warframes to build, though some will obviously be harder to get than others, they can all be obtained without paying money. however, you do only have 2 warframe slots to begin with. you could buy more slots with the 50 platinum (premium currency) that you start off with, at 20 platinum per slot, but this is the only major downside to the free-to-play model of the game as the rest of the platinum items are mainly cosmetic. there are still quite a few things that need improving, such as spectator mode. currently when you die and want to spectate, you cant even rotate the camera around the player you are viewing, making spectator mode feel kinda useless. there are also a few bugs in game causing you to sometimes not be able to melee, fall through the map, and other minor things. these things dont happen too often however and doesnt take away from it being a fun and decent game. overall, its definitely a game worth the download, and you might even find yourself getting hooked on it!",9
"absolutely awesome!!! fantastically done. and the best part is the updates. awesome work guyz, really love it keep it up.",2
"i had this on ps4 so i decided to get it on pc... before i got this suped up pc i couldnt play it. then i got this beefy pc. i started to play it, thats when i picked loki. i was playing online and got called a homophobic  because he died... 10/10 this game is amazing!!!",1
"great game but make sure you spend begining platinum on warframe slots",1
"fast, simple and fun co-op action. the control-scheme is particularly impressive, streamlined to make you feel like you look like you know what your doing at all time. less cowering behind low walls, more sliding along the floor in 3rd-person shooters, thanks.",3
"unless you are a huge fan of fantasy, then this game is not recommended for you. the graphics are o.k in the game, however the plot of this game is not great. as a matter of fact, i dont even think i understand the plot yet. i am not stopping you from playing this game, but i can tell you it will be a unsatisfying experience if you do not like fantasy. thank you.",1
"i havent downloaded the game but its probably real bad. thanks",1
"in this game you get to know how its like to be the last one in a race.",1
"a fast paced shootey, slicey ,runny ,jumpy peice of video game art love it",2
"game is gorgeous yet well optimized, compare to something like *cough* watch dogs, gameplay is fun at first, but a bit repetitive, especially if you decided to play alone. teammate can be helpful or dumb. theres p2w element off-course for a free game. nice one if you look over its flaws.",1
"best game ever! i hate how you cant restart character or have more than one character, but its still pretty addicting.",1
"once you touch this game, theres no cure for the addiction",3
"yeah its pretty good you get to be a space ninja or something i guess",1
"i didnt end up putting very much time into warframe, but when the intro missions are the way they are - full of idiot monsters (grineer) with poor ai, two weapon shenanigans, a regenerating shield to allow you as many mistakes as you want, a lazy soundtrack, and the most annoying guide character since alia in the mega man x series, its hard to justify putting in enough time to even get to the pay-to-win stage.",1
"i love it :o its the best check it out ... they also have ps4 version also so dont forget to check it too.",1
"i love this game now lol best free to play ive ever played",3
"i love this game it is awesome and great!! the first few missions are a bit tedious though. and the game is a bit confusing at times. but you should get used to it. have fun in warframe. ill be waiting. lol",1
"good 3rd person shooter with a distinctive look and feel. worth a try as free-to-play and paying is mostly for the impatient for cosmetics (without granting much that a f2p player couldnt grind their way to given time.)",7
"nice game, great graphic, but need high speed internet connection.",1
"not on for fps but i am liking this, more then a fps worth a look as a ftp",1
"another free to play. ill admit this isnt the best of games, but its a fun game to play for a couple of hours every now and then. lots of weapons and upgrades, but unfortunately youll have to pay some money if you want the really good stuff. all in all, its fun but very very buggy. full of glitches, but the constant updates are working on fixing this game up. time will tell how thisll turn up.",1
"this is one of those few games you find, that are not only creative and unique, but fun and a blast to play with friends. from doing mid-air slides while shooting a machine gun or stabbing mutants with a sword or axe, this game packs a powerful blast of action and indepth building of your tenno. i would highly recommend this game for anybody who is wanting to find a good free-to-play on steam or just trying to find a way to spend spare time. i would give this game a 9.5/10.",2
"its a pretty neat game for f2p. some pretty intricate combat with really neat weapons and animation. worth checking out!",1
"this is future ninja gameplay.....slash everyone!!!",1
"a good free to play game is you like 3rd person action although i recommend you play with friends and hey its free",1
"if you like fast paced games, then this should be right up your alley.",8
"space, ninjas, infection, co-op and free what else do i have to say.",1
"certainly one of the best f2p games out there. despite a few bugs and glitches (which is what you would expect for a game that is still in open beta), the gameplay is unique, the graphics are fantastic, great-looking character and weapon models, well detailed maps, and its fun to play whether you put money in to it or not.",2
"decent third person shooter/action game with impressive graphics for a free-to-play. much more satisfying in short bursts than a long session though.",1

"let me see your warframe! ok ew gross nevermind put it away",1
"while the grind for the highest end equipment can feel offputting the smooth gameplay is readily available from the get-go and constant updates gives plenty to do if you just want to have fun.",7
"graphics, combat and the whole conception is really good for a free to play game.",1
"where do i begin. this is honestly one of the best f2p games out there right now. its a really great sci-fi thrid-person-shooter mmo/dungeon crawler, and i honestly find it fun. ill split this review into a few sections to help you decision making. system requirments: i can play this on integrated graphics and a fairly high end processor on medium settings with 60-80 fps.the levels are really beautiful, too. honestly you dont need to worry about this aspect. gamplay: the game is really really fun to play - especiallyt with the awesome melee mechanic. you have a primary, secondary, and melee weapon (which, as i said earlier, is tons of fun to just swing around) and you have the abilities of your warframe (sort of like the class you play as). there are maybe 20-ish warframes in the game. it isnt hard to get one, though ive put quite some time into the game and have only just got my first non-starter warframe. you start with a choice of one from three warframes - and you can always get the starters you missed later on. the game isnt very pay2winsy too. sure, you can get almost every weapon (and every cool one) without dropping a cent. sure, it wil take a lot longer to craft/buy the blueprints and then get resources. but still its worth it. and playing with your friends makes this 100x better. overall, if you dont have this yet, id really encourage you to get it.",1
"great game,need more maps and less procedual generation",1
"great for a free to play title, really worth checking out :)",1
"hmmmmmmm.......well whats to dislike? well.......it wont run on mu laptop but does really well on my desktop. whats to like? well.......the physics engine is incredible, the way the lighting of different environments falls upon the character makes it one of the best games to admire your character and the way youve customised it. this game is one o the few free-to-play games whereby almost everything that you can buy through premium membership, you can craft for free, all that it takes a little bit of hard graft. now................this is a game about space ninjas...........but dont draw quick assumptions that the weapons and the fighting is all the same and boring.............there are all kind of weaponsfor melee, secondary and primary, and each weapon has its own variaty of fighting styles.................if ive loved a game it is this one out of my entire library (which shamfully isnt that big) 100% warframe",2

"i prefer the non-steam launcher but yeah is good f2p",1
"tps inaspettatamente sorprendente... molti peronaggi da sbloccare, armi da comprare o forgiare, approccio da tank, stealth, o sostegno, dopo poche ore rapisce!!! consigliato sia per solitarie che per coop.... da non lasciarsi scappare finche e gratis!!!! inoltre offre moltissimi acquisti in-game per gli impazienti",1
"this game is awesome go and play it but i never play it anymore cuz my laptop cznt handle the graphics :/",1
"dont buy thig game for a good shooter, or the story. god, not the story, that thing is a piece of . buy it for the fact that you and 1-3 or your average human riends, can, for a time, become ultimate space ninjas in space. this is not a co-op third person shooter. its a ninjioa simulator with a focus on the acrobatics. get it for that reason ,and for no other, because otherwise you will be dissapointed.",1
"its a 3rd person, space ninja multiplayer about killing monsters. put in a couple of sweet effects and spells and you have warframe, awesome.",1
"played 0.1 hours and only seen the awesome looking main menu... 11/10 - would play again",1
"its a good game overall but when i play i cant get the hang of the controls. despite this if i would rate it would be 10/10.",1
"fun game, if a bit mindless. shoot, dodge, collect, run, etc.; get to objective if you havent been blocked (or are too slow compared to other players); complete objective; repeat in reverse.",1
"one of the best free to play games here on steam. id reccommend you at least try it. its not amazing, however, but what did you expect from a free to play game?",1
"extremely impressed. especially for a free game. i would pay full market price for this. highly polished, graphics are incredible, interface looks good and works well. only minor issues are that the mod system could be more well explained and intuitive and the enemy ai could use improvement. i started off stealthily shooting enemies that were out of sight of other enemies until i realized that it doesnt matter. an enemy can watch his friend get nailed by an arrow and have absolutely no reaction unless he sees you or hears you shoot. other than that amazing game.",1
"fast paced, fn in multiplayer, visually striking (except for the lack of colour) but the mission ideas cold be a little more interesting.",1
"somewhat repetative, but the rpg element and leveling system is strong and rewarding. you will want to grind for hours. my advice: buy the 20 or 40$ booster pack at some point as they make leveling and farming very easy to begin with. wait till they go on sale. game is playable without paying, but a better experience if you do. good ballance.",1
"you spend most of the game waiting of the resorces you need to keep playing, just like in real life. 10/10.",4
"good game to play in group and why not alone with random people, i love how they have been developing this game fast and steadily.",1
"this game is amazing!! ridiculous amount of mobility in the game.",1
"warframe is an addicting and fun game. i mean come on, how can you not like ing space ninjas? the only one and major downside is that the game can be hugely p2w at times. you can obtain most items for free, but you need to grind a lot. other then that, the game has many styles. there is stealth, and there is also kill everything you ing see. i prefer kill everything you ing see, but i do love stealth for the challenge aspect. warframe is constantly being updated, and always stays fun. i would rate this game with 4/5 space shurikens.",5
"best freetoplay co-op game i ever played!!! everyone should check this game out.",1
"fast pace combination of 3ps with a mmo that includes a nice dose of meele combat , a bit grindy for gear upgrades but most content is available without spending a dime on it, nice overall power progression and mission variation with the addition of the perk/card upgrade systems make this one of the top free to play games. mechanic and content wise it is what destiny should have been.",2
"a sweet co-op pve ninja shooting awsomenes cant say more :)",2

"call of duty? battlefield? halo!? what are those!? 10/10 best shooter.",1
"this game is really fun and awesome for a free game and im suprised you dont have to pay at all for this but its worth it gett ittt",1
"simple co-op first to third person shooter. it is kind of refreshing to have an exclusively co-op game online. i like pvp as much as the next person but someone you dont want to have to drink 6 red bulls before playing an online game because you cant out react the other people playing.",1
"i started playing this game long before it made its way onto steam. it was great fun for a while, especially in co-op with a friend or three. but i stopped playing. however, as of now (update 14.8) ive revisited the game and played for about a month. and i love it! the game can get repetitive but its modding system (character progression and weapon progression) is great, there are lots of warframes (characters) to choose from with different abilities and roles. there are tanks, dps, supports, healers and more. though only three are available from the start you can get all warframes and all weapons in-game - without paying a single cent. even warframes that otherwise costs $50 you can get in-game by either trading or completing missions. the only thing that has to be paid for with real money are cosmetics, everything else is obtainable by playing the game.",1
"play for free, parkour combat effective space ninjas around until the lack of campaign wears you down then take a break until the next update comes out. the game lets you maintain 3? warframes and 10? weapons for free. crafting is unrestricted, as is resource and blueprint space. the game makes its money from cosmetics and players impaitent enough to outright buy new gear instead of spending some time farming for the less common raws. 3-6 uncommon resources (mission, event or semi-farmable boss drops), 1 specific-mob dropped resource 3 specialist weapon/suit upgrades/boosters that can be looted/crafted/awarded in-game without being forced to spend a penny. theres a chance of a discount on the freemium currenty in the daily rewards so i waited until i lucked out with a 75% off voucher and dropped a well deserved 8 on the game to cover my inventory slot needs for the forseeable future (am now up to 12 frame slots, 30+ weapon slots and 8? sentinel slots spending maybe 250 platinum freemium currency). in terms of progression even the starter suits are viable, weapons vary but at least half can be easily made effective and gear is made progressed/made better by applying upgrade cards (more damage, crit, proc chance, elemental damage, multishot, fire rate, reload speed, damage vs specific enemy type, ammo, etc). if you can live with a small inventory, enjoy fo free forever, or spend a few (discounted) pounds and load up.",7
"the best way i can describe this game is mass effect 3s multiplayer had sex with space ninjas, but didnt stick around to teach its kid the finer points of being a refined title. its fun, and theres no real reason to not at least give it a shot, but i lost interest fairly quickly once the grind hit.",1
"you dont have to spend money on this game. thank god. 8/10",1
"it was really fun playing with friends. if you dont have a core group to play with, random encounters can get broing fast.",1
"its a free to play and its my fav free to play on the market!",1
"i first saw this game when it was announced for ps4. i didnt think much of it at the time so never looked in to it. i expected it to be a disappointment but i was proven wrong. when i saw it was on steam i gave it a go and im glad i did, plan to put alot of time in to it. congrats to the makers of this game, and thank you",2

"great graphics and game play.play alone or with people.",2
"interesting game to play, only bad side in it is that its to repetitive. by that i mean the maps and graphics usual gets repeated into other maps... after a while it really gets booring, seeing all the things all over again. game is fun! but it needs new maps, new graphics and new enemies if possible. ( wink wink )",1
"get it!! (#) why? b-because..its a f2p / nop2w m*****f****** space ninja! vs mutated vegans and space zombies!? nuff said",4

"it feel like i poped out from a sci-fi ninja movie i can dodge bullets with my sword charge up with my blade to one shot one enemy stealth kills kunai blades and i have a super duper bow (optional you can have a rifle insted of bow) really really really good graphics medium requirements!! i suggest all ninja lovers out there play it!!",1
"its pretty good, but can get repetitive after a while.",1
"messes with mouse sensitivity. no option for unaltered input. unplayable. you have to sign up for an account to play it, too.",1
"loads of fun and replayability for a game with minimal gameplay modes; however, if youre a coward when it comes to grinding loot and gear - you should probably just sit in the dark, alone, and imagine life couldve been like if you were a space ninja. the various frames have diverse enough ability spreads to allow for endless funk. endless. funk.",1
"the mass effect 3 multiplayer and coop in borderlnads free to play.the game is still in beta but im hoping for an official version",1

"amazing co-op, multiplayer free 2 play game! good weapons! awsome frames. the game is really good! download this and have fun with your friends!",2
"having clocked up over 100 hours now i feel its only right that i tell all you lovely people about this game and why you should download it! warframe is one of the best games i have played in the past 2 years, at least, it combines great gunplay with beautifully orchastrated melee combat. there may not be as many different weapons as some games, but what you do have will more than keep you busy. the clan system is well thought out and balanced, so as to ensure that newer/smaller clans can still compete. negatives? well if you hate grinding then this is not the game for you... repeating missions and instances for better loot, more resources, or just xp is what youll spend a lot of your time doing. i personally didnt find the storyline that riviting, although that may just be down to me playing at 3am (usually). its also really really tempting to spend all of your money on unlocking weapons/warframes etc early (although that could be good? as it shows how awesome that stuff is i guess? xd ) final note... you can creat your own clan with a fully buildable and customisable clan hq (msg me in game if youd like to join kalifre assasins. small, noob friendly clan that i own, part of a large alliance ^_^ ) final final note: the game is awesome and looks set to keep getting better, 10/10, massive thumbs up!! potato",2
"pros: - its free. - space ninjas - lots of warframes, cool weapons, cool powers - lots of parkour. you can wall run, climb walls, roll, jump, slide and shoot while doing all of that. - lots of customization to fit your playstyle - you can stealth it, or go straight up guns blazing - match making is pretty quick - ordis is hilarious - great environments - its free. cons: - not much story or characterization - no skill trees or skill progression - no exploration, the game is mostly just go to planet a, do mission b. - is a tiny bit linear, needs more open environments - business model is a little restricting (to make a weapon you need a blueprint. components, and a timer, that takes alot of grinding) - little character interaction beyond the co-op missions. verdict: its a fun game, i definetly recommend giving it a shot, especially if you crave something like destiny or halo or the like. you got nothing to lose anyway, its free.",1
"in my mind, this is the best thing you can currently do for free with your gaming time, and shooter fans will love this game. it has its challenges, and its problems, mainly in the way of making new content feel new, but its a great game. so jump yourself out of your proverbial air duct, and give the game a try, you may be surprised with how much time you can lose in a game as great as this one!",9
"great game, but not for everyone. the estetic is really exciting, which is one thing that keeps me coming back. the gameplay is solid, and gets a little better with each patch. since its free to play, and you really dont have to pay to win, this game is definitely worth a try.",3
"what a fantastic game i have only played this game for 72 mins but i suppose this is my best online gaming experience ever!",1
"this game is excellent beyond human comprehension, anyone who says other wise is high out of their mind or just a silly goose.",10
"this is a very good fps/co-op shooter game. i would even say that it is up there with halo and destiny. i would highly recomend this game!",2
"this game has come a long way since it first went open beta just over a year ago. though dont get too attached to certain game mechanics, they have been changed and reworked and most likely will continue to be changed. my only complaint is the fact of the really drawn out open beta period, this game is certainly complete, the devs can always fix things when they release content patches.",9
"omg this game is so adddictive :o my friends told me to try it and i was *scare* because i though it would be boring, at the beggining it was...but after few levels, i got hooked up to this game and now i cant stop playing :d",1
"new content is being added every few months that changes the game significantly. somethings are harder to grind but overall a fun game to play with friends.",1
"pretty good game very solid and i like the charicter cusimizeation put some time and effort you will enjoy it and have fun.",1
"space ninjas that you can play dress up with. now with added pet accessories i love this game very much x",3
"great f2p game. you will be limited on the amount of some items you are able to hold on to at once, but besides that you get a lot out of this game for it being free. play it, it rocks!",2
"awesome game, ive logged over 100 hours, love the gameplay and the visuals, could do with less crashes after updates",3
"totally freaking awsome one of the best quality games you can get for free",3
"pretty darn good game, epitome of pay to win though. you can grind to get some pretty decent gear, or buy your way straight to the top. still not bad.",3
"why my computer suddenly cant access all warframe website? i would like to buy some platinum and its said access denied, why?",2
"this game has good graphics and is not pay to win its really fun i like it i recommend it its amazing",1
"you can craft shiiiit git gud m9 shr ekt for life 11/10",1
"gameplay is nice. but to get anywhere you need money, lots of money...and even more money....",1
"its just the funn of a dark sector-like game,those wo played understand,with new enemies craftable items and pretty good mission rewards plus the fun of the coo-op game.its fun to blow an enemies headbut its ten times funnier when you do it with your friend.so,yeah.you should totally give this game a chance.",4
"although this game have a low amout of diferent maps, the variety of weapons, warframes (chars). play modes, objectives....well in other words youll surely get addicted by just playing couple of times... its a game that ps4 adapted soooooo yeah its probably good uh? 3 platforms? ps4, pc and xbox? by the way you like awesome graphics? this is your game xd",2
"the game is really good and fu i mostly play it with my friends and stuff like that i strongly recommend the game! -mikey<3",2
"this game is amazing. ive only been playing for a little while - maybe more by the time you read this - and i already love it. youre a space ninja... need i say more? the way you play the game is completely up to you! you can run around hacking everyone to bits, shoot everyone, or take a stealthier aproach, its plain awesomeness. take that and add in parkour and you get this masterpiece. i dont know why the metascore is 68/100, because for me it should be closer to 95/100! its a great game, and its free! so what are you waiting for, just get it! edit: around a few minutes after posting this review, i parkoured out of the map. 10/10 edit 2: fell out of the map, but did it in style.",1
"space ninjas and racial genocide, whats not to love?",3
"warframe is an absolutely amazing game that is so riveting and exciting. the co-op mission are a blast to play and the lore is detailed and inticate. the amount of visual detail for an open beta is mind blowing and the game is just gorgeous. the environments and enemies all look appropriate for the alien esque theme that warframe is trying to acheive. the variety of weapons is immense and can suit any play style from stealth to running in guns blazing. overall, warframe is an excellent game and it is free-to-play, so there is no reason not to check this title out.",1
"question how does this game go from rated t for teens to rated m wtf then again i do know what drugs the esrbs taking but this is a good game it can be a bit gory if splats of alien blood and occassional dismemberment count as gore in some aspects it can but ive seen gorier games rated t for teen soo yeah.",1
"this is a fun game and i really enjoyed it except to get any gear or weapons that look cool you either have to throw money at the game or dumb in hundreds of hours and its just not worth it",1
"so, this game is nice. good graphics, good gameplay, decent balancing(?) i personally would recommend it to anyone who has extra time. this game requires you to replay or farm levels for certain resources. for instance, at some point, your weapons are too old to use them against newer, stronger enemies, so you set out to craft new ones. however, the amount of time, and work you must put into getting weapons that will carry you farther into the game is overwhelming. not only weapons, but warframes also require too much to craft. tkes me a day to get materials, or more, and 3 days to craft the actual warframe. now, you may choose to use stock weapons bought with credits, the games main currency, but the game insists you either buy platinum to get new weapons and warframes and whatnot, or craft them yourself, which takes a bit of time to do. though, judging from the majority of people on steam, i doubt time will be a problem. so, go ahead and play this game, if you want. its free anyway, what is there to lose?",1
"amazing game with great graphics, if you like hack n slash you will love this. has a shooter side aswell. kept me busy for hours and still going! 9/10 for f2p",1
"dont have time to write a review, too busy playing.",5
"nice game. awesome graphics and good story, but repetitive sometimes.",1
"very good game, it realy makes sence to how the phisics work and also the currency system is great. awsome game great job to whoever made it xd",1
"best war game i have ever played! - blaze from mccreatorco",3
"i thought this was free to play, took a break for awhile and come back and its no longer working...",1
"so much pew pew! so much free pew pew! this game is great, fast paced, pew pew a lot and pew pew a loot. what? yes! should you try this game? yes! but be aware of the massive grind. the online stores only purpose is to save you from grinding like a maniac. its a fun game but not for everyone, and not everyones wallet.",1
"well that game is for guys who got patience:to bugs and to endless repeat of mission.since u14 game got tons of bugs every update fix some of them and add more of them.story??well prologue got nice start then is free american.dont expect that ai is smart or something.all enemies go similiar ai similiar pattern of attack:go forward maybe u will live.community is the best i ever seen in games everyone can help u just ask.platinum and crazy time of build some weapons and frames and big con of this game.game is enjoyable is got pack of buds and luck that no bug will appear.just as i say if gonna start play bring with tons of patience or just create of beer like me:)",7
"wowww!!!!! amazing gameplay and grpahics, the style of the game given that it is free is so smooth! i am fully taken by the characters. i have only played the first part in the beginning i know i will be definately playing more. it out beats many games i have played in the past! frogger16 20140918 16:28",1
"addictive game , higly recommended to everyone that liked crysis and stuff like that . i am playing with xbox260 controler that gives an extra edge to the game , try it ;)",1
"as soon as i started to play this game, i was hooked. the graphics are amazing. for f2p, defientely, hell even for an aaa game. although you can buy most of the weapons and warframes with real money (platinum), it doesnt buy you the skill that youd need to actually use them. the learning curve is actually very evened out. you start off slow, and you build up your abililties playing the game, and your gear as you go along. sometimes you get lucky with the gear, most of the time you dont. but thats with just about every game out there. the variety of the warframes is very nice, with all of them being strong in one area or another, and some being strong all over. i suppose with proper knowledge, skill and gear, any warframe is end-game. and another note, if you like ninja genre anything, youll be pleased. 10/10 space ninjas!",3
"well decided to retry out warframe and when i did i feel like i wasted my time. i thought it would get alittle better, but i was completely wrong with it. but then again the pay to progress and win thing is in this which is ridiculous. i did like the game though it is rare to have alot of movement to run on walls and off them, use firearms and throwing weapons, and slash plus bash with melee weapons. i was harsh on thiss game yet i think they should have even two free warframe slots so a player can have 3 slots atleast in my opinion. but the updates are nice specially with the inner depth of the universe and story in it even if it is kinda bland in story. gameplay and mechanics are still solid and unique i guess i could give it a 7.5 out of 10.",2
"this game is great if your into stuff where you go out and find stuff to make more weapons...its alright, but i wish i could buy them with in game money/credits, but other then the hunting for items thing, the game itself is amazing! i love the graphics, gameplay, and all of what makes this game violent! if your looking for a game to kill stuff with your friends, then choose warframe! it has updated alot since i last played so im re-downloading it to see whats new. alright gamers i should wrap this up now so yeah, get warframe for massive violents, multiplayer, and so much more! im zero_thenik, and i will see you..in the game.",1
"so far best action mmo i have played for a long time. everything can be farmed in-game meaning p2p just speed things up but doesnt give anything that you cant get as f2p gamer. we know form all other mmos that to get good gear you need farm and in this game it means you need to re-level stuff from 0 to level 30 so you can but more mods (upgrades) to items (frames, weapons. kubrows, sentinels). good thing is its fast to level things up again. there is a lot of frames for many roles so there must have few that everyone likes. but be ready as for some end game stuff there are few preferred frames that should be / is needed with a group. atm im mastery rank 11 so i still have many items i need to level up until i can get closer for max rank, but i can already give good points for this game. my score for this game 90 / 100.",9
"this game is amazing. i have put hundreds of hours into it and still find new things, places, weapon combos to destroy life ect ect. if anyone likes sci-fi and cant resist ninjas with swords to maybe not so ninjas with hammers and a miniguns then this game is for you :)",5
"i have no idea yet i played it when it first came out now it looks amazing as ever i would reccoment it it is an awsome game but i cannot tell you what its like now my old computer used to suck so i dident really play.",1
"this game is free for some reason... but hey im not complaining",1
"im hoping the server would be more stable when played with alot of ppl in the game..",1
"in the beginning warframe wasnt really polished. but now. damn its one of the better games i know. only downside is that new warframes are hard to get. playing with you friends is the best experience i got in al long time.",8
"this game rocks. i would put this on par or better than a ps3 or xbox game. just love it. it is like mass effect in some ways.",1
"a game for badasses. cool cyborge ninja sword moves. ultimate stealthing game... i think i broke the ctrl key heheheehehehehehehehehehe get it? :)",1
"this is an awesome game that i recommend everybody to download and play, since i just cant get enough of space ninja parkouring and all other stuff you are able to do here, i dont see any reason not to download this game",5
"game is awesome,warframes creative and different,pay to win is present but its not hard to unlock stuff without paying.graphics are nice as well.if you want to avoid paying first youll need a weapon/warframe blueprint,then materials,then you need to wait for it to build.it takes about 12 hours to build a weapon and about 2-3 days for a warframe.of course you can speed up the procces but guess what.it costs platinum which you get by paying in real money.(you start with 50 platinum).big downside is that there is almost no different enemies.about three f****** races.but you still dont get bored.besides that there are clans,each clan with its of dojo.that is some sort of a construction that clam members are building.but again,to get an dojo key(which is required for entering a dojo)it goes the same blueprint system.all in all get the f****** game",1
"you may have to invest a little money bu8t the game itself is free so why not invest a little. 9/10 its awesome.",1
"such an amazing game! almost no limits to amounts of fun with warframe.",5
"+ = awsome graphics, excelent gameplay, the whole space ninja idea is awsome and alot to do in the game and very fun to play with friends. - = only thing thats is negative in the game is the cost of platinum ( the currency that you need if you like to buy gear, characters, resources faster), but its still a free to play game so it doesnt really matter",1
"awesome co op game. multiple weapons to choose from + good graphics. physx supported so if u got an nvidia card your in for a ride. free to play what more do u need to ask for.",9
"so much great things to say about this game, but the only real advice i can give is this. if you love 3rd person shooters with melee combat, wall running, lots of weapons, upgrades, collection... this game is for you. the community is very active and supportive, the forums are always buzzing, and theres never been a better time to play than now! i wont go into fantastic detail about this, just look at my hours on record (i havent even hit endgame yet).",3
"this game has good graphics, a good storyline and a good variaty of weapons and chatacters it is awesome",3
"this game is really good ! its littlebit like assassins creed but it is bether then that... i love warframe so much :3",1
"i think this game is such a clever and unique game. its almost alot of games fused into one, just with one story line.",1
"this game is good, fun at the start youll not know what to do but youll get the hang of this game. the game runs really well on a really shitcomputer ( i have a scool laptop) just turn down the graphics and its fine when u turn it down it still looks good so enjoy.",3
"ninja play free! play with your friend and farm everyday.",2
"great game, a new twist to any shooter game ive played, great mutliplayer and free to play. this is a free game, but you can spend money. the spending of money is not a rip off, but i would not reccamend it (also wouldnt not recomend) everyone should experience a game like this, so get playing! 9.5/10 (i had troubles moving through thenmission selection)",1
"this game have good graphics and work as wel i recomand to have a good graphics card like nvidia geforce gtx 720.",1
"need some friends to play with you at higher level instances. good co op shooter and free to grind.",2
"it still needs some work because it still crashes all of a suden but a very good work since the alpha",5
"this game is really addicting once you play it long enough. you dont even need to buy any of the guns. there are blueprints that you buy with in-game money, not real money. you can buy the weapons and appearance if you want to. but if you dont want to buy anything you can just use the in-game money to buy blueprints. so it is truly free",1
"this game is very fun. i like how it doesnt try to steal all your money. you can get a lot of the items for free.",1
"great game prefer it on ps4 i would give it a 8/8 m8",1
"warframe is a great game to play with friends and is really enjoyable. the gameplay is fantastic and i highly reccomend this game to others.",1
"i havent played this game for a very long time, but i think i can safely conclude that is one of the best games i have played. it sounds very generic (clones and space jews) and the build times certainly didnt appeal to me, but plenty of them are only 12 hours. make em, go to bed, ready in the morning.",2
"great game u should try it thats all i have to say",1

"warframe is a third person shooter free to play game thats all about marines, infested aliens, and space ninjas. awesome right?- right! it is a complete cooperative experience (you can play solo, too) and you complete missions through the story, level up your weapons and character to make them stronger, and you can also start/join a clan, where you and your friends can work together to accomplish missions, collect shared resources, and build an awesome dojo together! imo this game is a 10/10 on a free to play scale of awesomeness, replayability, and overall fun. update: since its first release as a beta, warframe has been and continues to be updated regularly to update the eye candy, the mechanics, ui, game modes, extra characters and weapons, and other features. the developers continue to work hard to make this the best free to play/cooperative experience they can deliver, and theyre doing an amazing job. and almost everything on the market can also be obtained through normal gameplay, with a little bit of farming. i continue to recommend this game to friends and i havent had a single friend be disappointed and not have fun.",2
"love it, but wish it was a bit eaiser to make blueprints",1
"great graphics, amazing gameplay, team building, and one heck of an adventure.",1
"space ninjas that jump like magic lebron jordan killing poorly funded space nazis. killing 2 enemies is enough to create a gore fountain. takes 10 minutes to thaw out a frozen guy. stealth is impossible. 10/10",1
"this game is awesome. really, really awesome. i got trapped by a horde of enemies, aimed at a big guy about fifty feet away, switched places with him, then commenced to shoot and slice my way through the swarm. also you can cut people in half. this game definitely has the best blend of melee and gun play ive ever seen in a shooter, and its worth a try just for that fact alone, because the combat feels awesome. switching seamlessly from dual fire pistols to twin glass swords to finish an enemy off with a horizontal bisection never gets old, and the parkour system is just icing on the cake. not to mention the amazing weapon variety, ranging from freeze rays to boomerangs. fair warning, though: it can get repetitive, so, unless you have friends to play with, it may only be fun in small doses at a time, but it is very fun.",1
"very nice and fast paced game. the story, animations are almost perfect. just the warframes...they are the best. i already have 3. excalibur, loki, and....crap. forgot him. he was the shock one. anyway. the game is amazing. just amazing. i reccomend this game to people who like these kind of games. p.s to all of you hating on the game, this game is new, and not old like freaking fo:nv.",1
"awesome space ninja game, would recommend this for yall. :p",4
"theres alot of fun to be had here, but to be honest, it isnt very good. plagued by tons of bugs, horrible monetization, and overall farming galore. i would rather just buy another tps than take the time to get into this one. seriously, it is really annoying and almost insulting at times. i dont reccomend if you are looking for a fun tps, but if you want an investment, this will work.",3
"love the game is incredible graphics best scfi ninja game ever and free to play",3
"well what is there to say futuristic ninjas enough said",1
"definitely, definitely add some more nooooooooobz support...also, please ditch controller support: its something truly shameful to have such a vast game, yet so few working configurations.",1
"this game is so good. theres so much to do, missions are never boring, constant updates keep the game fresh and exciting, the graphics are beautiful, and crafting and customization is always fun. would recommend to any shooter, rpg, and/or sci-fi fan, but its great for any pc gamer to play. plus, its free!",1
"you should play this game its awesome and 3d i know it might take a lot of memory and time but its worth it!",1
"lost my activation email.....warframe cant resend it......warframes support isnt online......cant even play,ci dont understand why it doesnt just link my steam account to the damn thing",5
"amazingly fun and addictive, once you get the hang with the crappy controls, the game opens up. fast paced group play, that needs tactics and actually teamwork very soon to reach your goal. you can go guns blazing, or melee stalk your way through countless maps. loving it! if you cherished warhammer spacemarine, this is your game without getting dull in 2 weeks.",2
"this should not be rated m it is worth t it is hardly gorey and just a little bit of blood.",1
"i just love the game so much <3 its the best game that i ever play =d i highly recommend this game.",2
"played this game before linking it with steam, been a member on warframe for a year, and this game is addicting and great to play, not only co-op, but there is a mode where players can fight players, i highly suggest every player pay $50 for this game if you want to save 6 months worth of upgrades. my tips: make a lot of friends, collect a lot of stuff, and be social.",3
"fun combat, worth the download time, but sadly its pay to win so glhf",1
"space ninjas with swords, guns and parkour what more could you ask for in a free game give it a real chance its better than you think!",1
"i only glitched through the ground about 2 times this week. 8/10.",2
"it okay but it crash sometimes but i highly recommend this game for probably the most epic ninja/shooter style game i play so far!",1
"see that trailer video? you actually can do that. you play a space ninja. third person shooty-stabby game with mmo powers on top. worth playng especially since its free. so its been about a year since de(digital extremes) started talking about coming out of open beta. theyve yet to do so. i still think the game can be fun for a while, but theres just no content after a certain point. what story is there is interesting, and theres a ton of -potential-. but the game itself just has not improved where it should have. the new uis are also awful, console-ish monstrosities that make it harder to get around to what you need when. its a solid 6/10 mmo game, with an amazing art group. the game -looks- very good, it even plays pretty well(bugs aside). it just has zero staying power. youll play for three weeks, stop for six months, come back and play a week or two to get hte new shinies, then quit again.",5
"i dont even know what to write about this game .. :d its so interesting, fun and good that i lost my words .. i recommend it to new and advanced players of this genre . :3 + its free to play",1
"fast pace, beautiful, action packed, ninja style, sci fi themed, addictive game. it can get a bit grindy at time, but for the most part, if you like ninjas, fps and sci-fi, then this game is for you.",2
"this game is very good so far. you can choose from multiple character builds, or tennos and you can customize them and play with cooperatively with others. just like most free to play games, you can get what you want much faster if you buy it with real money. there are still ways to get what you want though, it just take more time to get them. overall though this is a very good game, and its free.",1
"i reccomend this game to everyone on steam this game is awesome",1
"needless to say, some heavy grinding is involved in playing this game. but, if youre looking for some fun with shooting while sliding, wall running and being a space ninja, then this game is definately for you.",1
"is there any other word to describe it? awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"i love this game it lookes beautiful and it is super fun",1
"such a good game. it has such goof graphics and gameplay. especially the imense customization there is. very well made.",1
"great game. it costs money for xbox one, so to a next gen console game for free on pc is awesome.",1
"great game! good gameplay and its quick and easy to get the hang of.",1
"dont play with slow net (works with every online game)",1
"been playing this since the closed beta. its a third-person space-ninja simulator that plays kind of like borderlands would if it actually had good gameplay and didnt have to rely on a random loot gimmick to hold the players attention. good game, highly recommended.",1
"i have been playing the game for a while and it is a great game to put you favorite music on and rock out and hack and slash at people great comminity there very helpful.",4
"i love this game... its gotten everything you want in a 3person-shooter and from a f2p you may exspect hell of a pay2win consept but thats not here you see the worst kind of pay2win from my experience you can get everysingle item in the game without payin a single bit. and its also great for hooking up and playing with your friends. its gotten lots of different levels and you get a new version of every level if you go to it once more.",3
"very excelent game with epic gameplay grapics! this game is awesome inside and out!",1
"fast, fun, satisfying and free i sugest this game for anyone who enjoys a fastpaced hack and slash. some of the most fun i have had in a long time eventhough i am dissapointed that 3/4 of the weapons cost real world currency.",1
"if u love ninja and wanted to b space explorer someday well this is ur chance!!! xd",6
"it is good game becues you get to team up with someone and you an get a pt dog so then you can team up with a person and have a dog with you",1
"awesome game, even though im early in i will say i like this better than destiny already...now when destiny hits pc that might change.",1
"had fun for a few weeks then got bored... always more of the same... but its free so no try it if you like.",1
"warframe looks good and plays well, menus are presented so so nicely. theres much for players learn in the way of playstyles and controls, making you feel kinda like a space ninja. the campaign is decent and stealth is rewarded throughout the game, but as i said, there are many different playstyles to keep it interesting. what can i say? fun to play :) most fun ive had in a game in a long time.",1
"why should i download again from the first game?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! just because a few megabytes of updates added?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",3
"great game, amzing graphics (works on lower budget cpu), super fun single player, super fun multiplayer, and it free! ing download it! now!",1
"pretty cool game if you asked me for my opinion on it. just be sure to pick a good frame at the start, cause youll be stuck with it for a good while. oh, plus farming. nuff said.",3
"is very nice yes it is and i have shotted all of the aliaens",4
"this game is awesome, i cant belive its free. its on the playstation aswell and i heard its on the xbox 1 too.",3
"i give this a 5/10 because it crashes way to much for me... but it is still a great game. it looks great the gameplay is perfect i love it... so i recommend that you play this badass game... really... play it now... also it is one of my most faveorite f2p games ever.",1
"almost 200 hours and this game has more bugs than an f rated resturaunt... but...200 hours...",2
"this, no doubt i recommend. it is so great, and its co-op, so you can play with your friends, and it is just fun after you get the hang of it. trust me, play for more then a day, and youll love it.",1
"this is pumped up with lots of action keeps your mind so foucsed you cant tell what time it is so fun!",2

"awesome game very rewarding apsolotly free every thing can be earnd your a space ninja warframe is a must play",5
"very fun game, amazing graphics. this has to be the best game i have ever played.",1
"fast paced, agile combat? check. wide range of weapons? check. this game has a strong recommendation from me, and if youre a ninja- you play free. ;)",1
"great game fun to play lots of things to experiment with",1
"first the graphics are very good. check those in-game codec. this is not a pay to win game, you can get almost everything in game without spending real money. it doesnt even take long to get warframes. ill suggest to use your initial platinum on warframe slots if you plan to have more than 2 warframes. but the fact that the story is a bit linear still in there. overall, good game. lets say 8/10.",2
"this game is awesome. it just need more players so thet we can later on maybe have a s.a server ? =d =d",1
"very fun third person shooter! i have greatly enjoyed the game style. its perfect for playing with friends since it doesnt quite matter what missions youre on, you can always jump in and help your buddy, even if youre rediculously underleveled and only serves as a momentary distraction for the enemies. there has been some technical difficulties, but that comes with a game that is still in beta. also very great for people who want to play free. almost all content is accessible for free players but, of course, there are a couple perks for anyone willing to pay. all in all, a marvelous game!",4
"this is an amazing free-to-play game. anybody who likes action, 3rd person shooter... games, youll love it!!",1
"one of the best free 2 play games with nice graphics",2
"warframe has quite the steep learning curve, but makes up for it in beautifully detailed and oriented design, as well as controls. this game will have you hooked if given chance.",3
"possibly the best third-person shooter ive played",4
"a very fun third person shooter, the game play has elements from many games, and a good feel. completely free to play. the game will tend to get repetative for most players, but some have found fun in it, if you enjoyed me3 and borderlands multiplay aspects i would pick it up. or do so anyway and be a space ninja.",4
"super cyborg space ninja assassin mercenaries! if that doesnt convince you, its also free! get it. play it. grow a beard!",5
"ninjas? check. guns? check. swords? check. superpowers? awesome! sign me up!",1
"awesome! tons of action and its free to play! you also dont have to spend money to get the frames you want, just time. this game is fun one the best third person action games out right now in my opinion.",6
"this is a great very pretty looking co-op game. all i can say is sliding, flipping, wall running space ninjas for the win. the game can get a little repetative for right now with the grinding, but i beleive that more content and maps/missions will change this. over all the game is very well done and outstandingly free.",1
"play it on ps4 mite have fun play it on cpu just going to crash over and over does not seem to be fixed very disapointing.",1
"i really love warframe. it is challenging and easy to use with practice . love the visuals .. usually im alittle slow in these type of war games and get stuck alot. but this one is the best.",1
"one of the best online, free to play games i have ever played. keep up the epic updates.",1
"fun co-op mp game. movement is really solid, gunplay is good and its pretty entertaining. game is free to play, so im not going too judge it to harshely. only negative ive encountered are some glitches where my character will get stuck, and some lag. wish there was server browser as well.",1
"f2p, not pay-to-win, co-op and solo campaign and have a pvp system. swords, guns and power in many forms. and to top it up, an amazing story. one of the best games i have ever played!",5
"so what i first thought of this game was: what the  is this? 5 minutes later... i dont get it. 15 minutes further: damn, so much  to do! i mean really, aliens that try to stop a sort of resistance is really cool. crafting or buying weapons, new warframes to crush your enemy with. with the launcher you boot up the game is really handy cause you can see what updates came in the game. the fun thing is, people who dont buy the packs can also unlock the best characters with in game money they earn, but they have to be patient to buy some of those good stuff. you need recourses and/or a specific level to unlock the weapon or warframe. the graphics arent bad either, but you need a powerfull pc or laptop to run this on ultra graphics and then record it too. still its for me that the gameplay matters. in overall, a cool co-op shooter. wait i didnt say that for some bosses and levels you need more than 1 player. trust me, i know.",1
"i would highly recommend this game to anyone especially if you got a few buds and need something co-op to play. if not the community is awesome and clans are always recruiting. it is a little bit grindy but hey isnt that what video games are for, definitely not for those looking for instant gratification, but if you got the money you can get that of course. its not pay to win since its co-op and i played about 15 hours without any new weapons except the ones i earned in-game. i did spend 5 bucks and actually got quite a bit of stuff. the levels and enemies are varied and the bosses pretty ridiculous, very similar to old school games. the game has been updated with an excellent tutorial that even though i knew how to play played through anyway and got the story behind the game as well. definitely try this one out.",1
"its a completly free to play game that is also a pretty good 3rd person shooter. i highly recomend!",2
"unique third-person shooter game. i thought it was a mmo pvp battle, but actually its cooperative pve mmo tps game. the control is hard to learn, also the story is kinda hard to follow. but the gameplay is awesome, the graphic are sooo cool, it has crafting-like, also mods to improve the guns. but actually i hope it has pvp battle thing, because its going to be awesome.",1
"space ninja with magic. the only negative thing about this game is that the plural of ninja is ninja. and its sometimes buggy. but they just released an update where you can earna space dog. 12/10 goty every year.",2
"at first, i didnt like this game because it didnt have a very good tutorial at all in its somewhat earlier stages. i had to use youtube to understand what im doing lol. but once i got a hold of it, it is one of the best 3rd person shooter ive played since a long time. and now it has a storyline! plus the developers keep updating it and they have not yet disappointed.",4
"it is a very fast paced game that does take some considerable pc skills. learn it well and it becomes great fun for probably years, the start may seem tough but as you progress the more amzing things get. one of my favourite things about it is the fac that everything in the game that aids progression can be done without paying a single penny due to the crafting system. it is very much a team game and if you have friends to play with then hop along because some missions you cant do on your own. there is pretty much a warframe for all playstyles and it mixes gunplay, ability use and parkour to create an amazing 3rd person action game. my only warning is that make sure you have a comr that can run it well bacause fps lag can really ruin your day. on a side note if your mouse seems to float when you move it try turning down the resolution (helped me and my friends!).",3
"one word.. awesome. among all the free to play games out there, this i would rate to be among the top 3. a very good co-op game-play mechanics with frequent updates from developers makes this game a must play.",3
"this is a very good game. the graphics quality is great and the campaign levels, with clan dojos are amazing. the only problem with it is if you have a slow computer it probabley isnt the best game to get due to the game lagging. other than that i would definitly advise getting this game. its also free to download.",2
"fantastic game! different take on modern fps/rpg style genre. love the modding system, not enough games allow you to create clan halls either! at least none that are so important!",2
"this game is really fun to play with friends. the community isnt really open so its hard to meet new people and make friends on it however the matchmaking system makes up for that. i really enjoy the high level end game missions and the continual weapons released. learning new frames is always a lot of fun.",2
"excellent gameplay and characters. good hardcore missions and epic skills and weapons. this game is the beginning of a new generation of gaming.",1
"got a frame that controls air,,,, suffocated. 10/10",6
"do you like ninjas what about robots lucky for you a freak accident combined them into robinjas play",1
"this is probably the most unique game ive ever played. sure it has a few glitches, but it combines a sci-fi atmosphere into a combat situation where you must use stealth, hack systems, parkour, or just go guns blazing to complete the mission. also it has co-op online, character and weapon customization all while being free. i strongly recommend warframe as it will keep receiving updates to become the perfect game. my only complaint? it is extremely difficult to earn new weapons and characters, as they want people to use in game purchases. still, amazing game.",1
"the game is so bad it cant even install properly 10/10",1
"youre space alien batman fighting against clones and robots while looting resources from their planets... its ing alien bandito star wars 10/10",6
"interesting concept, stunning visuals, good gameplay. the background music sets a cliche samurai-faceoff mood (not that its bad). the best part has got to be its co-op play and clan support, such as the dojo. the sad thing about the game, is how it forces players to go though micro-transactions to progress in the game, such as the restriction of warframe/weapon slots. even if that is not the case, the level-scaling for the game is broken to a level such that over 90% of the weapons become near-obselete at higher level missions. and for a game based on ninjas, there is surprisingly no proper stealth mechanics set in place for any stealth gameplay. the game is too focused on gun-blazing action and flashy skills. regardless, it is still a great game worth playing.",3
"definately is worth the download, its fun and can keep you busy for a while. you always want to get materials to build things and always trying to get the top weapon in the game, one downside is the platinum thing, i mean really this ruins this game but if you dont mind not having the best skins and things like that, then youll love this game. 8.5/10",1
"i do not like this game whatsoever, its like halo where they throw every monster at you every 3 seconds and i personally did not enjoy the game whatsoever.",1
"out of the many games i play i still find myself drawn to warframe from time to time. it starts a long time after the game dark sector and the lore and the characters are simple enough for a child to understand. warframe is a must have if you are strapped for cash and looking for both a stealth and assault type of entertainment. the controls are fluid, the graphics are amazing and the overall feel of the game seems to be alive. warframe also sets a f2p point of genius by making almost every item in the store craftable freely. i wish more people would play and pay. this is one game that needs to last for dark sector and f2p sake.",1
"this game suck a$$ if you pay you have a chance other wise dont bother",2
"want to be a ninja? in space? with a sexy tight suit? then get this game, its free anyway. :d",1
"without a doubt one of the best games i have ever played.",1
"there is actually no reason not to get this game. youll be hooked into this indepth universe, and even if you manage to get out, youll come crawling back asking for more.",1
"its a free co-op game with clan pvp in the mix, alot of weapons to pick from as well as frames them selfs, each with there own powers, like some control fire, water, ice, lightning, others contol sound or good at healing the party have to say very good game, with alot of good clans",6
"great game, pretty large learning curve also but once you understand the game and start to aquire more powerful items the game does feel much better to play.",2
"good graphics, smooth gameplay, and great currency system + frequent updates & lots of content",1
"this game is awesome, warning, very time consuming, and very addictive",2
"best free to play game ive tried. you dont have to spend real money at all if you dont want and its great with friends co-op!",4
"very fun game! it can get a bit boring grinding out resources, but they keep bringing in new content and if you have friends on it, itll be sure to keep you for hours on end. i have over 200 hours in and not planning on stopping anytime soon!",4
"at first for me this game came off as a pay-to-win type of game, but with enough hard work you can almost everything.",6
"basically its very near impossible to just not play this game. like that one dubstep song.. i cant stop",1
"one of the best coop games out there, and a good one for beginners to play. great variety of weapons to choose from and upgrade. also great variety of different warrior types (warframe) to play as. this is a game that is complex but not difficult to learn. very addictive and engrossing where you can progress from one skill level to another. recommended highly for those into shooter and action games.",2
"its fun, but you can tell the microtransactions are designed to gank your wallet..wait for a sale or till they get desperate.",1
"this game taught me to parkur purkur phurckeur pleakeleahurachure",3
"a fun diversion thats ultimately ruined by repetitiveness and poor monetization.",1
"interesting third-person shooter, may be a challenge but definately worth playing. very fun with others, and pretty hard to get bored with. overall a good play :)",1
"love this. combination of ninja, space, alien, rambo, magic, gunshot, dynasty warrior , max payne, tenchu, etc. you will like this or you probably gay",2
"everthing is good about this game, especially the game play. the game play could be described as futuristic ninjas with space tech weapons killing aliens. the game itself is free to play, though there is a in game store that requires you to buy the majority of the items with real money. however, the amount of pay to use item does not offset the balance of the game, one can still enjoy the game without spending money purchasing items.",1
"ninjas vs aliens and alien ninjas with guns, quick gameplay, decent controller support (if you like that), free to play. dont really need to ask for more. definately one of the better f2p games ive played this year.",8
"small review for this game: its free. and awesome. think future inter planetary space ninjas. just so good!",1
"fun game,fun customization but can have a steep curve to it when paired with other players that are not so good.",1
"i have played this game for hours upon hours and it nevre gets old. the different warframes you can play as really change the pace of battle and the variaty of weapons is awesome, which only increases as you rank up. this game is an easy 9.5/10.",4
"cool game but has lots of bugs in it. always when i play with my friend im either stretched or spinning around but its still warframe and a good game. i would give it 7/10",1
"this game rules. its like an action only mass effect. grinding and all but worth it.",1
"great coop 3rd person action game, definitely play with friends.",2
"do you want to go fast for your space ninja tribe? of course you do . you can go bam freeze that lil corpus into a freeze pop zap punks fly fifty feet in the air just to kick a robot in the face welcome to warframe",2
"great game. (pillar of community) i highly recommend this one. i cant put it down.",1
"*must download!!!!* third person fps + rpg style gameplay + borderlands 2 super improved graphics + looting items, crafting and upgrading weapons, modifying skins and weapon colours, adding mods to weapons and leveling up! bored of rts and mmorpgs and mobas? give this game a try!",6
"y u so gud, no really this game plays well, feels well and is much fun with many people. i highly suggest that everyone try it at least once.",2
"really sharp graphics and particles. blows ps4 and xbox one away. the f2p model isnt bad either. you can craft all the items that would cost real money if you just have patience.",1
"its really good, so many things to unlock and alot of updates too.",1
"a great game for people that like to run and gun and stab, slash and parry from time to time. i dont know why youre still reading this, just download this game already!!!!",1
"really good game well put together. i found this game to be a lot of fun really well put together for a free to play game not all f2p games are this well thought out. down side if you play with someone who has cash to spend you may be a bit put off at how fast there growing and how slow your growing, but this is to be said for most if not all f2p games. i say play and have fun doing so.",1
"this game is one of the best out there and iam not just saying that. warframe is a freeto play game that you can earn everything that other people pay for with hard work no spending 20 bucks to get a little pony to ride and the game is not bout geting more monney for there community its fun and realy kick but.one of the frist thing i loved about this game was how you can move in and and the ways you look when doing it its just awsome and its a game that i think is realy out there and is only going to get more players in on it. well thats a nice little picce of what i think so i think its good so the lst thing to say is dont take my word or the words of tons and tons of players its free to play so there is nothing stoping you from trying warframe to day!!! so clike play game and see you later hopefully in game tenno.",2
"warframe is a good free to play game. you can achieve most, if not all of what is achievable without paying anything. however there is a ton of grinding involved if you do things that way. i liked using the controller much better than mouse/keyboard for this game.",1
"game is great, the only downside to it is the grind. to build new weapons you need to grind for materials and to get better mods for your weapons for your weapons and armour you need to grind. the grinding isnt that mad though, go online and hook up with 1-3 other players and its no peroblem. highly recommended.",2
"this game has good graphics, a good storyline and a good variaty of weapons and chatacters it is awesome",3
"this game is really good ! its littlebit like assassins creed but it is bether then that... i love warframe so much :3",1
"i think this game is such a clever and unique game. its almost alot of games fused into one, just with one story line.",1
"its a new style of combat thats easy to get used to, fun times to be had, its definitely worth a shot.",1
"fun game to play, especially with friends. amazing visuals, and a variety of roles which you can fill; whether it be an assassin, tank, disruptor or support, you can have them all. and the best part of this all... every weapon and warframe is free. just gather materials, and build them with hard time. trust me. its fun.",9
"its one of the few games i have that i enjoy on a casual level, great graphics for a f2p. not to mention the devs are always listening to the player base, which is always important. i personally give this game a 8/10.",10
"its fast, its gorgeous, its got ninjas and guns. best of all, its free. what are you waiting for? download now.",7
"all you really need to know is that there are free-running space ninjas in this game, which might as well make it illegal for people not to be playing it.",1
"so far its pretty good. i enjoy playing and i will for sure play this game all day!",1
"this game is one of the best free 2 play games i have ever played, you can choose to use money in the game but you can manage without money. play it aloot and really fun, manny diffrent weapons and warframes to use and for nothing",2
"fantastic game, gets lots of updates too with each time some new content!",9
"for the first few hours in the early levels the game is quite fun. you tend to notice that the graphics are spectacular and the gameplay is fun, intuitive and action packed. however as you progress through the levels, many stages i find virtually impossible without co-op partners. therefore i went to try and buy some better guns to complete them, but i cant because my overall rank is not high enough. but even after 8 hours of play time, whatever i did, i could not reach level 2. it is actually impossible. so the game turns into a massive grindfest and if you have the patience, (and real world money) then maybe it can be fun. i gave up to be honest. although if youve got no money and youre bored with your other games and want a few hours fun without a massive hit on hdd space, then give it a go.",1
"if you love to grind, and loved mass effect and halo, youll love this game. its a combo of all three of these things!",7
"warframe invokes the fun of the grind. if games like monster hunter and phantasy star online were the kind you enjoyed this should also be up there. through the updates more and more depth has been added to this game to make how you modify yourself and your weapons meaningful. with more warframes and weapons being added constantly this game shows no signs of slowing down. start playing, start learning, and start having fun because its worth your time at the price it costs.",3
"this game have good graphics and work as wel i recomand to have a good graphics card like nvidia geforce gtx 720.",1
"need some friends to play with you at higher level instances. good co op shooter and free to grind.",2
"it still needs some work because it still crashes all of a suden but a very good work since the alpha",5
"this game is really addicting once you play it long enough. you dont even need to buy any of the guns. there are blueprints that you buy with in-game money, not real money. you can buy the weapons and appearance if you want to. but if you dont want to buy anything you can just use the in-game money to buy blueprints. so it is truly free",1
"warframe, for all intensive purposes, should not be referred to as an open beta. aside from incorrect naming conventions, though, what we have here is an exceptionally addicting game that offers players a multitude of play-styles and game mechanics that keep things interesting. i love the concept, the art design, and the overall presentation of this game. i think it deserves a look, especially seeing as how it doesnt cost a single penny to pick up and play.",1
"ceelo: for the award of the biggest douchbag goes to.... justin bieber: i love  ! :d",1
"warframe is a good mmo and intense at times. the downside is that there is little to no free roaming or caracter customization, just constant raids and farming. alot more fun when played with friends.",1
"it always says i need a account, i tried to make a account but it would never send a verifaction email. i c0ntacted support but they didnt respond. waste of space",1
"this game continues to improve in leaps and bounds, looking and playing nothing like it did when i first played it over a year ago but all the better for the change. its fast, fun and free... you really have no excuse not to try it.",4
"this is a really fun futuristic 3rd person shooter with plenty of action and adventure as well.",1
"i typically do not like games like this. but a friend recomended it to me and i got hooked! i do not like how some crafted things take so darn long but the gameplay for me is simply amazing. also the engine works well with my computer... usually i lag out and cant play but this one runs smoothly for me. i definately recommend this game.",1
"this is an addictive game to play and you will stick to it even at the first 5 minutes of gameplay.i truly enjoy this game since it is free-to-play. although there are some premium features, you can get pass this by just playing. this game requires alot of grinding and knowledge about the game. the community is great and there are many people willing to help you suceed in the game. this is one of the best games i have played in a while.",4
"best game ever! easy then its gets harder lol , like playing online its fun",1
"still a pretty sweet game, and getting solid updates from time to time. rough to start out on though.",5
"if you have time to kill , and just wanna play somthing this is it! but besides that its more like p2w from my point of view",1
"this game is like no other game that i have played. its very well versed and all around creative. the community is wonderful and i enjoy playing it !!!",3
"pretty good until you realize they break the engine a little more with every update and the game consists of eternal farming with no sense of reward , progression or development. its just grinding for the grind",5
"very well done for a free game, the only problems i had with this game was that it was extremely hard to level up making it a lot more harder to buy weapons and other objects that would become useful to you during your science-fiction journey, and getting platinum to buy most things. there is no possible way to unlock platinum in the actual game itself, you are forced to waste your money on overpriced platinum on the steam store. this game was disappointing only for that fact, 6/10.",1
"space ninjas .... do you really need another reason?",2
"while its a bit grindy, this game is very awesome. constant hotfixes and updates are always good.",4
"for a person that isnt into many shooter games i really enjoyed this, but it seems ive grown tired of it. i enjoy the events and such but otherwise it was a good phase between my friends and i.",1
"awesome game!!!! but cant play with my friend pls fix it",3
"amazing game. graphics are pretty great,it has lots of tilesets and enemys to kill. ton of weapons to use and warframe to get. insane grinding though and lots of rng. still really fun though. platinum is a tad expensive but you dont need to buy anything if you dont want to. no storyline atm though because its still in beta. ill update this when they add a storyline. rate: 8.9/10",10
"pretty fun game, it takes a bit to get going but its a completeley free game with badass graphics and gameplay",1
"i recommand this game for who ever likes ninja games. yes it is hard to start off with but when put time and effort into it this becomes a fun game.",2
"this is the most awesome game i hve play it, thumbs up~!",8
"one of the best free-to-play games on steam! this game is very fun to play, and even more enjoyable when you have friends at your back! id recommend this game for anyone looking for a great cooperative third person shooter.",1
"great game, probably the best third person shooter game, with lots of cool and unique features!",2
"great game from the start its beta but dam best dam mmo i hav ever play actually feels like a game not a gathering of people selling stuff",1
"at first i wasnt sure the game would really appeal to me, as i am not a huge fan pf 3rd person games. but after getting into it, im hooked. after spending 24 hours over 3 days playing the game, i can whole-heartedly say this game ranks as one of my favorite pc games ever. i definitely recommend warframe to every kind of gamer.",2
"this game is laggy hardcore game that requiers skill.",3
"its a good game......that really all i have to say about it",1
"this game is the best thing thats ever exsisted as a third person shooter",1
"the game has great graphics, and the multiplayer is really fun. highly recommended.",7
"it is a awsome game for those who like si fi games and for tatical players its just a vary fun game",1
"i only have a few minutes play on this game, but i have found it to be very enjoyable. the amount of control you have over your avatar is amazing. i would love to see oculus rift support developed for this game if it hasnt already been. definitely recommend this game!",1
"even alcatraz would be jelous of the possibilities you can do in here",1
"very good sci-fi third person action shooter! it has fluid gameplay and smooth controls. the missions can be linear and buying platinum with real money can be a pain, but all in all this game is awesome. think power rangers meets the matrix using technology beyond mjolnir powered assault armor. 9/10.",1
"i cant stop playing. the first couple of days is the hardest but if you stick to it and play you will be rewarded with fun",2
"get the game, it is the best action, and free to play ever!",4
"this is a fun game of 4 people, and its fun to play with friends d:",1
"warframe is one of the most graphically impressive f2p games out there. the graphics, fun gameplay mechanics, and the nonexistent price make warframe a hell of a good game to play with buddies.",2
"nice game for co-op play and online action in war player-vs-enemy raids",3
"just gave this game a shot to pass the time, first impression.. awesome. ive heard mixed things about it and have yet to really delve into it, but i got very involved for awhile. i could see myself playing casually from time to time.",1
"solid f2p shooter. just get over the first 3ish days then you will be lovin it also the buisness model is fair and you dont ever have to pay for content. i havent spent a penny on it. hope you enjoy it as much as i did. 8/10",1
"the bugs in this game, every time they fix the game we get like 1000 new bugs and 1 thing fixed! :d",3
"ninjas in space? and i though it was an odd combination untill i played it, they also recently updated with the new kubrows and a ship for your warframe, i think its really cool, and you should play this someday, and this is played by a certain youtuber (which is me)",4
"very fun game if you have friends to play with, but the random people you encounter can be unpredictable. also trading is very difficult and the way the item system is set up you either have to constantly farm items non-stop so you can build your upgrades, or you have to spend your entire allowance/paycheck to buy what you need.",7
"its pretty fun to play. action mmo hack and slash game.",1
"diablo instant gratification with the fun of weapon and equipment call of duty style. fast paced co-op vs. ai see how yours and your teamates skills interact to create devastating combinations.",2
"this is a fantastic game for it being free. all the things you can do in this game is just amazing, its well worth the time. i give it a 9/10",2
"you are a space ninja. that is all you need to know.",3
"mothering space ninjas with guns and magic. seriously.",9
"this game is amazing. so addicting. movement system is really cool. 10/10",1
"a neat little game i stumbled upon while looking for free2play games months back. since the beta the game seemed fun, challenging, and cooperative. and with the addition of new maps and areas added after the release, the game gets even better. fun with friends, fun with random people online, and still fun in singleplayer if you prefer to be a hermit. the downside: it is a free2play game, and many of these games include microtransactions. in warframe, there are 2 types of currency. one is being the game points you earn through completing levels, the other is real money. everything in the real money store can be obtained through the game points store, although it will take you probably days or even weeks to grind for that one item you want, its still nice to know that you can get the same weapons, armors, warframes, and neat little accessories without spending a dime. (newly added items like the cool little scarf the tennos get do cost real currency, as well as color packs. and other aesthetic things. if youre not really an aesthetic guy/gal, youll be fine).",1
"as you can see i have played alot... and this is only the time that i have played while the game is on steam ... (not to mention my 300+ hours off of steam) any way, game is pretty good i guess, if you enjoy grinding in games. the game is based around completing similar objectives 100s of times in order to progress in the game. at the moment the game is a simple ok at best. the game still has potential and can most deffinently be saved. i hope the best for warframe, i hope the devs start heading in the right dirrection. my rating: 7/10",3
"i have not played any of the recent updates but based on what i have played its a very repetitive game but still enjoyable.",1
"i really liked this game. but i would love it on mac as well. we dont have any windows at home so we go to this gaming place. to play on there computers. but we would love it if it was on the mac. it would make it easier for us to play instead of spending 20.00s a day to play this game at the gaming center were at. pls mac listen to us, were really in need of help. all im asking is mac for warframe.",1
"i feel like an eva... an amazing f2p experience that has you playing the roll of a tenno (samuari ninja warriors in robotic suits in space). the graphics are amazing for a f2p and everything in the game is availible without having to drop a singe penny (they kinda deserve something though ;3) through grinding. every warframe has its own abilities and make the game feel new. this might be my favorite f2p of all time.",1
"having a lot of fun with this game. i have played for so many hours and i am still not tired. much better than i had anticipated.",3
"a very good, polished (even though currently in beta) f2p, with zero pay-to-win. its entirely co-op. if you enjoyed mass effect 3s mp, or enjoy third person shooters like red faction guerrilla/armageddon, then youll love warframe. also, they made dark sector.",5
"ermaguerd!!! so fast paced and intense. i played with my friends for a whole day/night irl cycle. this is the most fun and addictive game i have ever played. slightly bugged but for a free to play game the ninja moves are worth it.",1
"this is a gorgeous game which is known for its combat and the complexity of the game pls get this",3
"no idea how to start playing! have spent hours trying to figure out how to start the game! cant get past the setup screen",1
"like action game? play it! like shooting game? play it! like co-op game? play it! dont like all kinds of games? this game will change your mind!",1
"quite a fun game but needs some small improvments.",1
"keep in mind this game is still in beta so its clearly unfinished and very buggy. that being said im finding my self addicted to this game! this game in a nutshell: four ninja/commandos blasting through horde after horde of soldiers with over-the-top weaponry and abilities. the level of customization in this game is unparalelled there is easily something for everyone. the action is fast and i mean very fast! there is a single player option but ive found it a lot more fun to jump in the melee with 3 strangers and have fun. one aspect of warframe that i havent tried out yet is the dojo feature. its basically a clubhouse for your clan. you can build extra rooms and forge specific weapons and armor. there is also a pvp gametype as well. there is an out-of-game store to buy in-game curency, upgrades, weapons, ect. this is understandable as the game is still in development and its how the game studio is making money to finish it. its not totally neccesary to purchase in game money but i do feel inadaquite when someone blows by me and clears a room with far superior equipment. like i said this game isnt finished. right now the game is just the multiplayer missions and the associated menus. there is a lot of set-up for a great story. digital extremes, please dont let me down. flesh out the story and factions. give ths game some character. this has the makings of a great game, dont let me down at retail.",1
"phenomenal game for being a free, open beta. class varieties make games interesting as you decide the party to bring along with you",2
"game play is nice for this being a free to play game. really enjoy it!",1
"really fun co-op game which is small in size, but packs a huge punch (literally small in size (gb wise)). get this game, and get your friends to get this game too, for it looks and feels great. 9.5/10",2
"this is a free game and it dont look shity like the rest",1
"this is the best free to play game ive ever seen. gameplay is great, it looks awesome, pretty much everything can be earned in-game. it has loot, it has coop gameplay, it has rpgesque upgrades. it demands to be tried. give it a shot, tenno!",1
"most of the levels on the same planet are the same, some may say because its on the same planet but it takes about 1-2 hours to clear each and the crafting takes so much time to do (12h for simple gun)",2
"take the sci-fi action aspect of mass effect 3s multiplayer mode, cook it over a flame built from collectible card games and tradional rpg advancement, apply a thick pseudo-samurai glaze, and dribble guyver aesthetics over the whole thing. serve on a free-to-play platter, with a side dish of item crafting with a light trade sauce. add a guild base/bank for dessert, and you have a 5 star shooter experience. in all seriousness, good gunplay, sweet abilities, awesome melee weapons, a solid craft system, and a well-paced effort/reward setup allows and encourages grinding for specific item materials without making it a horrific chore, and allowing the purchase of key mats if you just cant wait. the ability to build your guilds dojo room-by-room, and individually decorating each room to your liking is freaking awesome. 9/10, most enjoyable f2p on my game list right now.",1
"who doesnt want to be a space ninja with magic powers?!",2
"i hear a lot of people saying the game is terrible because of the lack of mission diversity. still, warframe is really entertaining and since it is still in beta, its always getting updates with new tilesets. and as for right now, the number of weapons and warframes you can use is pretty large and has a lot of events going on. i recommend trying it, because the gameplay is fun (althought it might be repetitive at some point which is probably getting fixed soon with more and more tilesets), the devs are really comprehensive and put a lot of work into making the game better. if you dont like it now, try it back again when it goes in full release. 8.8/10",5
"i came back to the game after being absent for quite a while playing in the early stages of the game and now experience a whole new fresh rework and i do enjoy it much. the game always has been one of the games i enjoy greatly over a shorter period of time. i dont think the progression system works for a title to play over a long period of time but by adding more and more events they work around that quite nicely. still i think their micro-transaction model isnt well suited for a free-to-play title; its more of a play the game, then pay to play on kinda thing. if you wanna progress further than account-level 4-5 you will have to spend cash nomatter what, or decide to give up old progress you did (selling old items) in order to progress further. luckily they give you a certain amount of currency from the beginning but you easily end up in a situation where you are forced to spend in order to play. i dont know if the game offers enough content to justify that action. until then its one hell of a fun time.",1
"ninjas in space! that in itself should be enough to want to try this free game. unique leveling and damage systems are unlike anything i have yet to see. its worth it to download it and try.",7
"this one... is one... friggin best game i ever played!!! i would recommend this to my friend who hasnt played. they will like it.",1
"do you like ninjas? do you like space? well this game has the two combined, space ninjas! its free to play but not pay to win!",1
"they can take their crafting and building and stick it up their minecraft butts!!!! other wise shooting stuff is fun",4
"awesome you can upgrade almost anything in the game! and i love the game and items!",1
"warframe is one of the first online multiplayer shooters ive played with a story to it, though you only really see it at the start as far i can tell. i love the gameplay though, and the ability to swap between melee and ranged weapons is a great thing to have for when enemies get too close for comfort. great game, i only wish more people i knew played it!",1
"its a good game with good graphics. the game also shows incredible flexibility in the game mechanics. i highly recommend this game.",1
"pretty good third person shooting free to play game to hand out with friend but the fun wareoff pretty quick if you playing solo",5
"really fun! controlls are a bit tricky at first! multi class tenno to chose from.",2
"even though it doesnt have much in terms of story plot compared to other games its still a rather enjoyable game, especially for f2p. only thing id critic it for is how long it takes to progress anything and with money being tight your find yourself grinding hours just to make a warframe you would like to try out maybe.",3
"ha ho! this game is friggin amazing! its unique, fun, and you can play it with your friends and recruit people into a clan! another favourite of mine.",1
"great game when playing with friends, gets really grindy though and loses appeal quickly once the grind begins.",1
"fantastic free-to-play game. i completely recommend it to anyone whose pc can handle it. the game keeps you working too, if you want to make progress you have to keep working at it. it isnt a game you can master in a day. one of my favorite f2p games, easily.",2
"well first off i do like the out side the box idea that they have gone with here, i was a bit thrown off by the helms but now its all good, i love the damn game, lets go tenno!!",4
"one of the most anticipated games ever with awesome graphic and over 100 exilerating missions.",1
"space ninjas. need i say more? oh, okay then. lots of action, nice mobility, quite a bit of fun.",3
"just same maps, usles killing, if you want to get stronger and ect you need really boost your acc with money.",1
"space ninjas. what more can be said then that. this game is fun and has some amazing features. deffently worth checking out.",1
"it is a really addictive game trust me its worth your time",8
"warframe is a great game, it has a ton of content to enjoy and even though there is a bit of farming involved is way above any kind of free 2 play co shooter out there.",5
"this game is consists of mostly grinding resources, blueprints and mods to create your ulitimate arsenal. nevertheless, this is still such a good game. interesting weapons and warframes, maps and events. the game, at first, is a grind to get to your desired arsenal. but when you get there, boy is it fun to play. i do recommend getting some friends to play with you for double the fun.",3
"awesome fps for free! worth your time to look at it!",1
"i would definitely reccomend waframe to friends. its a fun, semi-cooperative third person sci-fi shoother. it has a great free to play system as far as free to play goes, its not pushy about buying and almost all items can be obtained without spending a cent. it also has content updates almost biweekly, with at least many updates since i joined in september/october. its alot of fun, and i would reccomend installing it regardless of if you want to spend a few bucks on it.",6
"great game, not pay to win, but you can get upto 75% off premiu currency as a log-in reward which makes it really worthwhile for extra item slots and accessories",7
"i think its the best f2p game for steam (and tf2) try its free so why not? :p shotgunrage18",3
"fun game but you must not mind grinding a bit. first off, the money. the game doesnt force you to acquire anything necessary, but it doesnt give you a way to get more weapon and warframe slots and you -will- want to buy more slots as you go along. the other thing youll want far more of than the game provides (although it does provide it through farming) is forma. it wont become an issue until you start looking toward farming late-game content but there will come a point in time where youll start looking at buying some forma. and its not particularly cheap. that said, fun game. lots of action, fun in groups, variety between the warframes and weapons. itll keep you occupied for a long while and if you put some cash into it (wait for a sale) it extends its life significantly.",4
"given time ,this game has the potential to be the best,great developers who interact with the players as well as weekly content, time constantly evolves the game making it much better when it first released and in the future,much better than it is now. good game with a briliant future.",7
"great game ! requires a good computer though but theres one problem with me and i think only for me ei am using windows 8 and for some reason after a few minutes after i play i have a purple screen with a screecching noise. anyone help?",1
"mega fedt spil iser nr det er med vennerne :d/ really ing awsome game great to play with yor friends :d",7
"this game is awesome as long as you have friends to play with. if you dont it gtes difficult quick and it is harder to move up in rank",1
"really, really good aesthetics. fun mechanics, its good to see an action game that moves like this. like an endless runner mixed with a shooter. but after that, well, theres no there there. in the end theres just the grind, and collect-a-thon, and droprates, and theres no more challenge or test of skill with the most pointless, dull, boring, pedestrian, level randomisation engine in this era of roguelikes. get spelunky instead. or rogue legacy, or teleglitch, or etc.",8
"this game is crazy insane and i would recomend this game to anyone who likes there games of stealth and there games of shoot em up!!!",2
"amazing game, currently only one in my sights. could not picture playing anything else at the moment.",3
"this is probably one of the best free to play games there is. yes there are micro transactions and they can help you get ahead but its not nearly as bad as most other games.",2
"havent played this game too much to give a in-depth review about it but it has pretty good graphics and cool gameplay.",1
"really awesome game fro a ftp. doesnt need much to run with doable graphic!",1
"love this game, fun and smooth controls! you can really do some crazy acrobatic moves with enough practice :) you can craft everything in the game, you dont have to pay a single penny! its free! try it out!",2
"very cool game, smooth gameplay and really good graphics. the customization of characters and weapons is fairly interesting along with the mods needed for some customization. on the other hand the platinum is fairly expensive, you dont hvae to use it but its really helpful with some things :) overall 4/5 :)",1
"a game that is heavily relied in teamwork!!! thumbs up for that",2
"man let me tell you, if you are looking for a game that will always be there for you through the rough times and the smooth times (smooth like coco butter on your skin). this game is a perfect 3 out of 10, enjoy.",1
"gameplay is great! but! theres a lot of problem with regarding joining or inviting someone in our friends list. please fix it. many thanks",1
"i know it may be a free to play game but i really enjoy it. its best in short doses with a group of friends and almost everything in the game does not require premium currency to bulid or make.",6
"a very good game i recommend to all who like fast shooters and striking with swords",1
"i highly recommend this game to those who cant buy battlefield or call of duty games",1
"this game is better with friends, but also you can enjoy it alones or with random people. ninjas, a lot of different weapons and styles, you can shoot everywhere or you can do it stealthy. different strategies against each faction... and is a reaaly good f2p what are you waiting for?",3
"i have played many ninja third-person shooters in my time, from gunz the duel (the first one), and many others, and this easily beats the rest. i was disappointed with gunz 2, as im sure many others are, and to me this is what gunz 2 should have been (obviously without the sci-fi aspect). this has quickly became one of my favorite games to play, and i recommend you give it a try.",1
"one of the most fun games ive played. very addictive and even though has in game currency that can only be obtained with real life money, still is very fun. a trade system in the game provides the perfect balance for those that dont want to spend real life money on the game. a solid 10/10",3
"i enjoyeds piral knights greatly when i first started into pc gaming. and when i see warframe it just flat out loks like sk for big boys to the people complaing about grinding thats kind of how mmos work if you dont want to spend time playing a game to level your gear and character then they have the cash shop but trust me on this when you spend a couple days working twards the item you want to complete a specific loadout but its so much more rewarding to put the time and effort in yourself to actually earn it and the whole using premium currency in the auction house is something sk did to help make it more accesible to players who didnt want to spend money on the gameso all i ask of you is instead of reading post after post trying to decide if you should try the game remember one thing its free to play so just download it try it out if you dont like it uninstall if you do mayb i will see you around",1
"good as . next gen gaming is so good. get this game right now.",1
"awsome game!always new updates with new zones,mods,wepons,warframes.the newest update is going to be awsome :d.you can play it the way you want to play it(single,co-op or multiplayer).",1
"this game is pretty fun, takes alot of grinding if you dont wanna pay for anything with real money. it has a pretty good amount of content for a free to play.",1
"fun action fps with skills and fun mobility, need to play atleast 3 hours to enjoy",4
"this game is very good and works well with older computers.i hope this helps and if you get this game you enjoy it!",1
"with almost 100 hours clocked into this game i can officialy say its ok i guess",1
"what always impressed me with this game was how the launch trailer animation is... well... just slightly dramatised gameplay. its literally what the game is, everything the ninjas do in it are actions you can do in the game (albeit animated slightly better), its not some ot korean mmo intro. its super ethical advertisement and i love it. overall its a good game and i suggest it. its free anyway so you lose nothing trying.",2
"this game is really fun and addicting. you should all play it.",1
"cool game! the graphics are ace. over all a cool game and well worth the download. be nice to see the finished version.",1
"warframe is amazing. awesome graphics and combat and character and weapon customization",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. perfect space ninja game. i give it 44 out of 6 space potatoes.",2
"suprised how good this looks and plays. your not gimped for not spending money, but i suspect the pinch will be soon. like the coop aspect. very pretty game. can see myself playing this for a bit.",1
"an excellent hybrid game that tries to combine all the good things of todays mmos, and does a fantastic job at it. warframe is enjoyable for hundred to even thousands of hours of gameplay, just give it a try i know youll like it. ;)",3
"space ninjas. ninjas in space. a bit slow to start, as most f2p games are, but hang in there a bit and you can have a lot of fun for not a lot of money. pros: -fun combat -very diverse weapons and warframes -most everything is aquirable without having to spend money cons: -it can get a bit repetitive, but taking a break from it for awhile seems to remedy this -you will have to pay money for slots to get more weapons and warframes",4
"i think this game so far has full potential and pretty awesome. sliding and pressing the melee buton making your twirl like a girl with a swords pretty arousing. the only thing i can say thats bad about this game is the fact you need platinum coins to do everything. and it takes 1,000,000 credits to get a blueprint, a whole month to get the resources, you spend more money, and you have to wait for it to be built. besides that, this games pretty awesome.",1
"this is a very great game if youre looking to just shoot and slice some dudes up. the only bad thing in my opinion is if you wanna make your warframe look really cool, then you need platinum whichcosts money, and the prices for it are kinda ridiculous.",1
"you cannot go wrong with this game. you destroy hordes of enemies, ranging from the block-head corpus to the space zombie infested to the always-in-your-face grineer. and the destruction never gets old. if you dont want to spend any money on things, but get somewhere in a free game, then this is for you. you can get damn near any weapon or warframe free, jsut takes awhile. thats how i get 90 percent of my items. the amount of missions are vast, and the random map generations makes sure that nothing is ever the same. not to mention the bosses feel like actual leaders, who have propper strategies and they always require actual planning to take them down, unless you want to go down too. all in all, you cant find more badass space ninjas anywhere. best of luck, tenno.",3
"youre a space ninja that develops new weapons, new ninja suits, fights bad guys throughout the solar system, and has a tasty pet kitten-sandwich!",2
"tis is a nice cool free to play shooter. it lacks in graphics but thats cause im useed to bf4 and crysis standards. overall 8/10",1
"shoot all the chicken leg men! good stuff guys, good stuff",1
"a great game that i play with my husband. space ninjas ftw.",1
"i must say when i first saw this,while it seemed fascinating i was skeptical of he quality. however after having played it i must say is a brilliantly done game.",1
"this game is robot space ninjas with guns and magic. i cant describe it any better than this. free to play, no pressure to buy anything. only thing im not liking much is the real-time delays on being able to rank up and make new weaponry and such.",3
"great pve n ocasion update . one of the best free tps",4
"great game, lots of fun, for the gamers who dont bother end game repeating! always introducing new stuff",2
"awesome, free, and fun. using super-alien-jedi-space-ninja-soldiers to shoot, slash, and blow up enemies, really if you arent sure, at least try it, cuz its free. progressing is a bit slow without platinum (premium currency), but youll get it.",1
"looks like a great game. unfortunately im not a ninja.",1
"its decent, while it gets repetitive after a little while its a fun way to kill time or something to do when you are bored. 7/10",1
"i would defenantly recommend this game for two main reasons and a few other small ones. the two main ones being; its free, and your a freakin ninja! other than that there are some other small aspects of the game that make it great, one the graphics are amazing especially for a free to play game. two everything that you can buy besides decorative items that dont do anything can be obtained in game. lastly that the grind to get these objects is strangely addicting. so go get this game and lets kill some things.",3
"absolutley amazing game with amazing graphics. the gameplay is amazing and the modding system is one of the most in-depth i have ever seen. 25/1",10
"hi i am the king on nigeria and as a proud nigerian i aprove this game",1
"its a pretty fun game. although i would say it feels like theres too much grinding, and not much to work for. worth a try, expecially for free.",1
"this game is very fun with friends and has lots of content to go through but the only thing that lets this game down for me a least is that there is not much you can buy in the in-game store with credites only about 5 or 6 guns and the rest you have to buy with platinum (real money).",1
"warframe is a cooperative (four player squad) free-to-play third person online action game set in an evolving sci-fi world. join your friends in player vs enemy raids across the solar system and master the power of the warframes. stand alone or fight together against enemies that threaten your world. master all weapons, both gun and blade as you battle with your squad against corpus, grineer and infested. always anyone to play, only things youll need to spend real cash on are warframe (one slot 20 platinum) and weapon slots (two slots for 12 platinum) , as well as cosmetics! the rest is possible to be found through free to play. as the game is still in beta there is constantly new content and changes being made. this is great place to create your own tenno sanctuary with friends.",9
"i love this game!!!! lots to do and the dev team is always working on it. this isnt pay to win, you can earn everything as long as your willing to put the work into it.",3
"one of the most rewarding and fun games ive ever played",3
"if you dont have a very good computer, the graphics in this game wont be perfect, but other than that, download it. it is one of the best f2p games out there",1
"this game is awesome. go stealth or just run and gun. its fun.",1
"so far best game of this kind to play with your friends.",1
"warframe is pretty good game, it has good graphics, cool guns and characters etc. the only problem is that the game is a bit repetitive and its not made for mac so one of my friend cant play it. :p still, i give this game an 8.8/10.",1
"epic co-op awesomeness. great team spirit - go tenno!",2
"this game is a very fun, ftp game. the graphics, even on low, look stunning. a lot of customization comes in hand, and many weapons to choose from. my only complaint is that the prices for somethings are absurd. i would like to see cheaper, but as most ftps have it as pay to win. this is a great game if you like slashers, shooters, and a relative mmo feeling.",1
"i love the gameplay and idea, but you have to buy gear with real money if you want to advance in this game. :(",2
"im a ninja with guns and superpowers. its mass effect meets dynasty warriors.",1
"overall this is a nice game to play whenever you have free time however the game itself is extremely tedious and occasionlly boring whenever you try to play alone. if you do want to pick this game up i advise that you play with a friend so that it will be more entertaining. otherwise here are the games pros and cons. pros: -nice diversity in characters & weapons to choose from and use - graphics are nice to look at (especially at max settings) - blood and gore is always a plus - can use in-game currency to buy warframes(characters) and weapons - you never feel like the game is pay to win cons: - in order to obtain new warframes and weapons in-game without buying them you have to buy the blueprints, obtain all of the materials to craft said item via the games crafting system and crafting times are fairly long ranging anywhere from 12-70 hours in real time also you have to do all of this with in-game currency. - level designs are incredibly repetative as you will see the same level designs several times over the course of your playthrough. - two leveling systems profile leveling/character&weapon leveling. yes in order for your weapons and characters to be at max power you have to level them up first also leveling your profile takes a huge amount of time. - certain weapons are level locked so in order to craft or even buy them you first have to level up your profile to the required level. - game can feel like a huge grind especially when playing alone.",4
"this is a great, fast-paced game! totally would recomend it for any hack and slash gamers!",5
"this game is by far the best free to play game of all time",2
"in most cases i look down on many, many free-to-plays so when i first got this it was simply because it was free, and well, i just felt getting more games in my library. from the trailer it looked slightly interesting to me so... i got it. little did i know how stunning the graphics were for a free-to-play and little did know how emmersive this game is. with many in-game attributes to your character and its customization (which im a big fan of in games) i was instantly hooked. although there are some ridiculously priced dlcs and some in-game purchases, it doesnt affect gameplay because its not pay-to-win. if you can, by all means give this game a try, it may not suit you as it did me but... who doesnt want to be a freekin space ninja! -8/10",1
"warframe is a fun, action-packed shooter that lets the player have control over what missions they go on, what planets they visit, and makes for a great co-op game. its jam-packed with space ninjas, grotesquely awesome mutated creatures, and plenty of content.",1
"great game for a free-to-play. however, the game can become boring after you begin to invest time into it, and the gameplay can prove repetitive. so far, warframe is posed as a closed beta under the guise of constantly being fixed, and the devs regularly add more weapons, characters, etc. in order to sooth the repetition of gameplay for veteran players. while this seems good at first, it quickly becomes a detriment to the potential of warframe. all in all, the game has fantastic graphics, and a style akin to me3s multiplayer. it is fun to play as a pick-up title, and i have high hopes for it. however, having invested countless hours myself, the game has grown boring, and the promises of constant updates instead of a legitimate story and endgame can be aggrivating. so if you want to play the game, dont invest any money into it, as it fits the free-to-play genre far better than one you should actually pay for. 7/10",2
"i love this game! but do some research about it and the characters before you play if your a new player it might help you think about what you want to be in the game!",2
"i love it just needs to get use to and some options tweeking and gyour good to go",1
"amazing, cant get boring and has crafting elements to it, the updates are often but small size.",1
"the missions get a bit teadious with the repetition. however, if you have a group of friends, this is a really good way to pass time, its fun and challenging. definately try it out.",1
"fast paced action game where anyone can be a ninja. use a variety of weapons, such as rifles, shotguns, bows, kunais, swords, axe, or your bare hands (bare hands not included.) the difficulty arises as you play through the game, and the boss fights are challenging (unless you are really highly equipped going through low levels), and sometimes, playing with yourself isnt the way to go. go stealth, or go loud!",1
"i really enjoy the game, the content you cannot get without paying is only changing appearance. also you can trade some things that you can get in game for the platinium so you can buy little appearance things if you really do not want to spend money. sure those who buy platinium can rush crafting or even buy the weapons already built, but it is a co-op game so it isnt bothering at all. the graphics are really nice for a f2p game, and the gameplay is fun. some may not like it because its somewhat grinding style, but not only. there is a nice variety of classess, weapons and everything. the upgrade system for weapons and classess is also a thing well done. the game gets nice big updates too, still evolving. i really recommend the game and im not planning to quit it any soon too.",4
"mixing parkour and third-person shooters, this game is one my all time favourite mmos and i recommend this to anyone looking for some incredibly good action.",2
"stop reading this and download warframe right now!",8
"its a very good game i like playing it and its fun very fun",1
"is game where u run on wall den jump of said wall and land on big bad booger man and staybe him in his booty with ur swoord. if that boats ur float, den mebe u pley dis game u kno?",1
"pretty fun game for a f2p game. well designed and tons of action. recommended.",1
"took me a few days to get into it and once in i loved it. well-balanced, decent replayability. few problems. would like to see some social content for sticking sake like player housing with personal uploadable content or some such nonsense. definitely will keep stopping by to play though.",9
"super addicting third person game. im not sure if i classify it as standard third person except with parkour, third person hack and slash, or completely new genre. probably that one. really fun and time consuming, i have a few complaints though. everything costs real money or takes days to get. you have to buy the blueprint, then wander the cosmos looking for the three different blueprints and the materials to craft them so you can craft the main one, which still takes 3 days to make. so lots and lots of time. two, i know its in beta, but it crashes. alot. and for the real money thing, platnium, as the premium money is called. its very expensive. the most expensive frame in-game costs 375 platnium, which is approximately the equivalent of 21 cad. ive dodged most of that grind by buying the cheap packs of platnium, then buying the materials needed in the blue print. all in all, its a very good and fun free-to-play game. i highly recommend it.",1
"having this game during the closed beta it needed a lot of work. coming back to it at about patch 8 and 9 this game has actually amazed me. if youre looking for a new game to play online with your friends and work on this is definately the one. this game may not be 100% perfect, but its fun to play and serves its purpose, on top of that theres a ton of missions to play and you can even craft new weapons, and the best feature in my opinion is you can change and craft other characters to play as. this game does work like other f2p games where it wants you to spend money to expand things, but they do give out free coupons and things which will make buying from their store a lot easier. recently i received a 75% off as my daily reward, i ended up buying about 1000 platinum (warframe points) for only $12.50 usd, which is normally valued at about $50.00 usd. i would certainly check this one out.",10
"this is a good game, futuristic setting and uses online co-op. the graphics are cool and the general feel is awesome. its free but you need to register by email so i reccomend this strongly. the dlcs are basically for lazy people who cant get good without them or want to get good quick. its like tf2 if ur sh!t it doesnt matter what ur accounts worth!",1
"everytime i play this game, it reminds me of mass effect series... amazing and very addicting, plus its free to download. if you want a spectacular 3rd person shooter game, i suggest that you should download it now!.. thumbs up for me",1
"to good man, played heaps luv vit thers not enough time in my day",4
"robot ninja samurai aliens in space, killing capitalists, and imperialists under the basis of being a peace keeper, without actualy knowing any back story. its still developing but of all the time ive pumped into this growing monster, i regret nothing. and admit to only enjoying it. though beware the devs do occasionaly break something... blame the devs!",6
"one of the best free to play games ever released. its free, why are you reading this? try it!",1

"the game is really fun to do if you are alone, but with friends it is even more fun. the graphics and environment are nice. the skills are powerful. i recommend this game to everyone.",1
"this game is awesome but there is a flaw the items i buy at the steam community market are not showing up in the game i hope this will be fixed or not this game would have been a 10/10 but because of that it is a 9/10",2
"i loved this game its so fun my friends had fun i recommend this game hope you enjoy :}",1
"take some ninja guiden mix it with some mass effect & sprinkle it with some crafting you got freaking space ninjas with swords, guns & modifying wepons, melee wepons & your character and one of the best takedowns!!!! i would recommend this game to anyone who likes alien games or ninja games.",1
"i throughly enjoyed it. i like the concept of using weapons and warframes (aka classes) to imrpove said weapons and warframes. from what i played, i really liked it. my computer, though it can handle other graphic intensive games, lagged during the action portion of this game. so yes, i recommend it if you have the rig to run it.",1
"this is game is very fun and although i prefer fps this game is one of my favorites.",1
"one word and one word only amazing enough said only flaw you have to wait for it to download :)",1
"warframe is immensly diverse in all aspects; from creating your character to just building something in the foundry. it has incredible team play and great missions types. there is also a real sense of comradery among players. theres so much to do and complete its no wonder some players have been playing a full year from its release and still have tons to do. the look of the the game is unbelievable,the graphics alone are top notch and pull you in just from the title screen. the controls feel fluid and absolutely flawless. aside from all the positive comments i can throw at this game, the only negative gripe i have is the connectivity to their servers when entering/leaving a mission when in multiplayer, and also host migration seems like it needs some technical tweaks. if the mere seemless possibilities to expand, explore, and create and over the top gameplay dont pull you in, then the 1gb download and free access most definitely will.",8
"its fun to play with friends, pretty addicting, and looks amazing. :)",1
"diferent style, different gameplay, different idea... i like it and i recommend it :d good game.",1
"a great game for players who like action and teamwork (or solo). with great graphics and a big arsenal of wepons and classes.",7
"this game is absoulutly awesome you its the best gameplay ive had in a while, deffenitly for those who like shooters :)",1
"i realy like the game, but this update fcked me and many many ppl big time, cant even log in for more then 10 minutes.... that is when im able to log in wich is not many times atm",3

"the game was more awesome before when the fusion cores werent that rare but i still like it for some rerason.",2
"very fun game, sadly i chose the wrong day to start playing as a glitchy patch made it hard to log in or even play so now im stuck in a loop whenever i log in, hope they fix this soon so i can play ;d",1
"because it is insanly addicting you have a lot to do and it is multiplayer and it kicks",5
"fast paced alien hacknslashnshoot. for any shooter fan. slicing enemies up with dual katanas throbbing with electricity... is quite satisfying. :d",2
"in a nutshell, its an online fast paced 3rd person shooter where you play as a genetically modified futuristic breed of ninja or teno and team up with 3 others to undergo plentyful missions across planets of the solarsystem. like any online game, its best played with the people you know. after completing a shedful of missions, they can seem a little repetative after a while, but kit yourself out in a completely different way, as the customisation is pretty diverse, and youll have a refreshingly different combat experience. its strangely addictive and also free! so what have you got to lose? play it now! its the only way youre going to see if you like it or not.",1
"warframe is basically an addictive mmoprg mass effect game, that should be all i have to say. but this game is addicting for all the right reasons, the loot. you just want to keep playing a little bit longer to see what will drop, usually it doesnt pay off but thats half the fun of it. it forces you to cooperate with others to play levels longers, to trade, and to go to the void as often as possible. i definitely recommend this game to anyone that loves the combat flow of the mass effect games coupled with cooperate yet at the same time competitive third person shooter game.",2
"awesome recommend it dawnload it if u want to get extreme fun baby",5
"this is game is awesome. 10/10 would waste my life again.",7
"warframes defintion- first person combat, impressive visuals, and vast combat customization lets it appeal to both hardcore gamers",1
"not bad overall, but, progression seems really slow unless you pay out for it. same with weapons, armor, and other gear.",1
"this game is amazing if you like shooters. it combines shooting in 3rd person, some parkour(which almost everyone likes) and the game gets better if you and a friend(s) go kill a boss or something. 4 stars+",1
"i think its a great game it has good, smooth parkour and a good teamworking game buts there are some minor glitches here and there, but otherwise its a fantastic game. now i wanted to make these coments short not like when you want to see a game and there are like walls of coments, oh yet again amazing game!!!",1
"great game. makes you feel so mobile and powerful. gives a good sense of comraderie as well",4
"warframe is the spiritual sequel of dark sector, and on this game we play as tenno, a race bound inside suits called warframes. little is known about your own past, and all you know is that a being or organization called lotus is trying to help you. you work as mercenarie bringing balance to the solar system, assassinating important targets from the rival factions and erradicating the technocyte viral infestation from space colonies. if you played dark sector you know what are the tenno. the gameplay is fast paced and the commands respond well, you can use a large variaty of weapons, from pistols to granade launchers and even larger selection of melee weapons. you can play as tanker running around killing and shooting everything or you can play as real ninja being sneaky. note that you must upgrade your weapons in order to survive the missions as you progress in the game. the game lacks end game content, but the des are updating the game and looking for fix it over time. the soundtrack is sometimes dark, giving a creepy feel to the game, and in other time it is exciting with all those naga drums. the graphics are gorgeous and it uses the nvidia physx. recomended, one of the best free to play game out there, 9.9/10.",6
"i like this game vary much just has a kinda well hard if you play solo so try to pay in a team rilly good game thow",1
"this is a great game if your totally looking for a game with epic action and even better gunplay; when you join a guild you can research the new equipment that come out in new updates, so its not really pay to win. you can meet tons of people all across the globe that can help you get started, even if their are those few people who are complete jerks.",2
"hey having some trouble. i can not download warframe from steam i click the play now tab and it is suppose to pop up with the download screen and it doesnt. is there something wrong with the launch button???",1
"this is one of mah fav games and if you like tps (third peerson shooters) and games with misions and lots of action then this is for u",1
"once you get the hang of the game you will not stop playing the game. it has bosses that give blueprints for tenos or weapons that are amazing. so if you do you will be addicted to it, but it has many updates which make the game even better so get the game.",5
"pick this game ~~ davy johns with a samurai sword and have power to summon tentacle. what do you want more? pick this game :d",9
"most of my time in this game is waiting for a update. 10/10",1
"let me clean my self, if u dont play warframe because it is not game like cod youre a dummy. warframe is solid f2p game with amaing gameplay thx to damage 2.0 and melee 2.0 wich are awesome upgrades because you can go and use a katana only wich has 80 slash- 20 impact- and 20 puncture damage wich is a perfect anti infeasted weapon but its weak vs corpus and grineer . best thing is that all op weapons etc are availeble for no extra costs like 10 bucks for some platinium.....all things that can improve your gameplay are availeble trough out foundry....only customization things like syndana, camos etc are exclusief for platinium. this game deserves the title of best f2p or even best game of 2014 and ratings 10 out of 10 for sure, after playing first time 8 months ago, until now, its not boring :d",2
"best free-to-play multiplayer game out there! loads of fun and you dont even have to spend a single dime!",1
"just awesome , youll never regret that youre playing this game. so much fun :d",4
"its free, its got gun and blade wielding ninjas, evil clone armies, robots and more! who wouldnt want to play it?!",1
"nice game, i reccomend it. always with new features, secrets and powerful power-ups!",5
"awsome game great graphics on a pc game ever must play now",1
"fun gameplay plus unlimited combinations for a fun multi player co-op.",1
"one of my favorite 3rd person shooters on computer. just wish i could get platinum through steam.",6
"a one of a kind 3rd person shooter, mixed with ever growing weapon selections, unbelieveable abilities with endless add-ons to suit you needs, costomizable weapons, armor, and sentials (kick- pets) that come with their own special abilites. enemies coming in furturistic mutated humans from a dieing planet, advanced robot humanoids that control the shipping lanes, or the ever growing infestation, trying to make you one of them; all there in a effort to stop you from completeing you mission. a must have and must play, choose your fighting style, up close and personal or long range and stealthy. its all up to you and your choice of the warframe.",9
"this game has both an exciting mechanic for movement and combat, however it suffers from relatively depthless (and seemingly vast) content. it felt very repetitious very quickly. it doesnt seem to have much of a sense of community to keep you too involved either. for a free to play it is good, but it is always annoying when it is necessary to spend hundreds to be on top of a game. worth a play, but either dont go alone or make friends with randoms quick!",1
"a great game for you and your friends to gather up and play together with the guild system in this game you dont even have to be in the same room! its a great game see you in the warframe",1
"this is a great game but the only down side that i can see for now is that the tutioral is very heavy on the processor but when you get pass that you should be fine for the rest of the game.",1
"pros : -good concept art/visuals/atmoshpere; -high variety of weapons and play styles; -the game has developed a lot for the past year; -good developers; -mod system; -community is fairly nice. cons: -you spend a lot of your time farming; -maps are recycled; -pvp system is disregarded; -trade system is ; -clan/aliance system is ; -craft system takes a lot of time; -anoying bugs (new maps usualy) -not so newbie friendly. overall: 3/5 *",4
"ninjas. with guns and blades. in space. what else is needed to be said?",9
"warframe is a game of pure awesomeness. it is fun, free, and good graphics. you dont have to spend a lot of money if you dont want 2, but be prepared for a lot of grinding and playing. try it out. this game won over smite in a tournament for best free to play game.",2
"looks nice and plays well, but farming for days if youre after something specific can get repetetive.",1
"lots of fun, the combat is really enjoyable and even grinding for resources never really gets tiresome. but if you ever want to spend money on the game, everything in the store is so damn expensive. so theres that.",1
"i highly recommend this game to everyone. it covers every aspect of gaming that i love; creativity, free running, shooter ect... one of the most suprising pieces of this game... its free. i very often question this due to its spectacular qualities. give it a chance if you hadnt already demolished the grineer.",3
"good game nice graphic totally recommend this game if you are into fps type games",1
"this game is awesome! i dont normally play games with a lot of violence but this is beautiful and it has ninjas :d",1
"its a good game which can be played alone, with friends or random people online. the multiplayer element and horde mode really add to the game in the sense that it makes it feel more realistic as well as discovering other ways to play the game. the only downside to the game is how weapons and armor are obtained, which either cost real money or a tedious amount of specific resources to build, and then they require you to wait some hours before obtaining it.. tl-dr; good game but expect to use the same weapons for a long time",1
"it is really fun fast paced tps which is very rare lately",1
"a very fun game where you play as space ninja mercinairies.",5
"great game, but out of curiosity, i just bought a steam wallet code. is there a way to pay for platinum using the wallet code in place of a credit card?",1
"i love this game!! it is so much fun and it never gets old. online mode however when you want to join a level it brings you to a clan that could be farther in to level and you dont start from the beginning. that is my only complaint. the scenery is so ammazing. how i would descirbe this game is halo but free. yes this game does have a lot of inspiration. art: halo, when you lose your health you fall down and a teammate has to pick you back up to save you: left 4 dead & call of duty. gameplay: mass efect. however these inspirations dont bother me. highly recomend this game.",1
"the game its very good,and you need to coordinate your team to win,its difficult,but good",2
"one of the best games ive played, gets addicting when you get a hang of it :p",6
"works best on pc, not so much on ps4. fun, good lookin game.",3
"holy crap, i enjoy this game. granted, you may need to put a bit of money into it in order to get enough equipment slots, but if you play your cards right, you can build almost every weapon and warframe in the game. yes, some may call this a violent farming simulator since once you get a certain distance, youre mostly looking for resources to build weapons, warframes, and upgrade equipment. that said, its a quality third-person shooter that--while not having any solid story like in a single-player game--it still has very good gameplay and plenty of potential to grow far beyond what it is now.",4
"dont be put off by that metascore, this is a very solid game. id put it more around 82-85 after having played for 150 hours or so prior to steam. even the default warframes they give you to start with are very fun to play. you can earn all the others, including all kinds of weapons, through normal gameplay. spending a bit of real money can, of course, speed things up, but it is certainly not required. this game has a very unique vibe to it that really doesnt exist anywhere else. from the ui, to the way your warframes move and fight, to the diverse environments you will battle through. the combat is fast-paced and fluid with fantastic animations and character models, and a very simple parkour system to learn and master. everything from wall running, to sliding along the ground while you shoot, to more advanced moves that allow you to perform flying kicks to knock down enemies, or sliding past a group of them and executing a spinning attack to take out their legs. you can play solo or with friends. you can be stealthy, or run in guns blazing. its completely up to you and your playstyle and the weapons and mods you select for your warframe. grab a group of friends and give it a try. you will not be disappointed.",3
"probably the best game ever. join me. its free to play. :)",1
"this game has some glorious features, my favorite of which is its well-formed free-running mechanic, which allows for extensive play with the levels after some basic familiarity is established.",1
"this is officially my 2nd favourite game, the 1st being borderlands 2. <3",3
"great game, best free to play model i have ever seen. worth checking out for sure if your looking for some fun run and gun co-op action while playing as a space ninja.",3
"warframe is a fun third-person shooter in space. like a multilayer version of dead space in a way.",1
"one of the best free to play games ive ever seen. fast and fun gameplay, along with superb graphics and great multiplayer make it worth the half hour 1.7 gb download, which is tiny compared to other games.",1
"warframe i just have one statement badass ninja kicking, jaw dropping and f2p defying game tis not for the weak",4
"this game never fails in adding new stuff and updating also the devs listen to what the community says, which makes it great on every updates",5
"interesting, but gets boring real quick. has your standard unlockables. give it a try, but dont expect playing it for verry long...",1
"fluid movement, co-op action paced, random level tile set layouts, craft, loot and grind, power ability ninjas. its damn gorgeous looking game, warframes are beautiful, sound, controls solid, deep gun and warframes tuning. 8/10 easy! (open beta) this game need story line and movie for sure. ps: content added in this game very fast, devs working great, check there yt channel. 35 hours review, update later.",1
"ninjas in space. what else do you need, really? free to play, although there is a slight pay to win element, if youre patient there is nothing to say you cant have exactly the same gear as those who just pay outright for it (some limits apply to cosmetics) pay to be lazy, moreso. still, a fantastic shoot and loot to play with your mates.",5
"i like how they have a wide variety of everything. there are several warframes, weapons, kinds of weapons, and accessories to choose from. you can build up your character however you want to and even have multiple characters. i recommend this game to anyone who enjoys shooters with a twist and its a great co-op game to play with friends.",1
"need to put some real hours into this game and a couple bucks where necessary. nevertheless, great game.",1
"the game is good once you start playing it, but gets repetitive after a while, weapons need a lot of materials to make which means a lot of farming. plus even if you cash in some platinum, it doesnt offer much. still a good game to try out.",2
"this game is really good. at first i was skeptical but after putting a few hours into it i love it. yea it can be a grind fest but i havent gotten bored or felt like it was taxing to get what i need. it isnt pay to win by any means but it is pay to save time. crafting stuff does take real time but overall you really dont notice it. download this game and try it!",2
"one of the best free to play games ever concieved, countless hours of grinding with wonderous graphics and a great free style combat system 10/10 recommended",1
"as a frequent player of this game on ps4, i can say this game is nothing short of brilliant. you play as a warframe, part of the group called the tenno, who have dedicated their lives to bringing sanctity to the solar system. fighting against the terrors of the grineer, corpus, and the infested denizens. some people might think ughh this game is awful it has micro-transaticions!-stupid consumer but they are wrong. this game does have microtransactions. however, whith enough dedication and love, anything that is microtransactionable, you can earn in game. you heard me right. so everything can be free. not that im saying you shouldnt use the micros. they are a handy way of paying the developers for this wonderful peice of work they have created. the games mechanics of shooting, using powers, melee, and parkour to traverse surfaces are incredible. it keeps the game fresh and replayable with all the content included including a working clan system with a dojo you can build from the ground up for you and your clan mates to make together. so to rieterate, warframe is a great game that you should definantly play.",1
"wonderful, much more enjoyable with friends, not nearly as fun solo.",1
"this is a must try for sure. i love it. it is player vs. ai tactical gameplay that rocks!!!!",1
"a remarkable game truly unique in every element i had some good fun playing this with friends some who have spent 600+ hours on this game. i almost shocked this is a free to play game. the graphic are amazing as is the gameplay for a free to play you can not lose on this one it offer awesome co-op game play!",1
"its a good game but im so  tired of deleting it every ing update since it always get ed up during the update process and then i have to reinstall, nonetheless its still a good game and worth the time reinstalling -_-",4
"if you like simple games and fully free to play aswell as have a good amount of time on your hands i would suggest no other",6
"i dislike that when you choose a type of character you can not reset to choose a different one",1
"fu**ing space ninja with magic, hell yeah ist worth your time",4
"great game, amazing graphics, this is a great f2p.",3
"i played this game and it worked 53% of the time. 9/10 would recommend",1
"yes epic gun time nija style platformer with amazing characters weapons maps and swords there is no pay to win effect on this game u should try it 10/10",1
"the storyline is huge , but i guess the levels need to be easier somewhat for newbies like me.",1
"this is truly a great game. the reasons being you can do some awesome tricks like diving, rolling, and sliding. i slide around so much on this game and it never gets old. also, the starter guns are actually decent. i use them all the time, and im on mars(i think, i havent played in a while.) now im going to take someone from youtube by saying this game is awesometacular!",1
"the game is full of action and has ton of classes which adds to the fun",1
"best game for relaxing after some work or some other game that puts your nerves on the edge just get in relax and start shooting and for those who like something to think about u have new equipment mods tennos (characters that u can make) etc. recommended",1
"i recommend this game to everyone because its easy to jerk the terk too!",1
"all i can say is, this game rocks!. try it and you will be hooked. enough said.",4
"i always thought that free to play games were always a ruse that would make you buy at least something in order to win. this game renewed my faith in such games. you are never forced to buy anything and its really fun to play. love the drop in and out multiplayer and it looks amazing. host movement is almost always easy and you never really lose connections. replay value is very high. there is always something going on that makes you want to play more and more.",1
"i would highly recommend this game because it is alot of fun and is a great game.there is alot of epic weapons and different playing styles. there is the ability to buy (through the currency earned in the game) blueprints for new weapons and make them yourself. to do this you need to earn the resources through game play and by visiting different planets. you can play the game in solo mode which allows for a more leisurely game or you can play by inviting other players (through private mode) or play online with other players joining when they want to. i personally like to play online because this enables you to collaborate with other online players on missions. you can also set up a clan or you can ask to join an already established clan. clans give you more support and great team work. you can buy (with game currency) special blueprints (not available through the store) from the clan research facilities through the clan dojo.",8
"awesome game i would recomend this to anyone of my friends",1
"holy crap this game is soooooo fun. i play multiplayer with my friends and it is verrrry gory.(nuff said)",1
"guys, cyborg ninjas...i shouldnt have to say anymore.",1
"since my friend suggested this game i was like what is this weird game until i played it alot and it was amazing c:",4
"a decent game, theres few bug but that can be fix since it stil in opb.. and hope it will improve in time..",1
"this game is perfect! to start off it is free, one of the best co op games i can join in and just play around on for hours with friends or make new ones all the time. the hard work, the slaughter and all the fun. this game should be in everyones game library. sooner or later you will get it, it may sit there and collect digital dust but you and everyone else will play this game at some point in time. it is spreading like wild fire, and soon when the update for cross platform play comes out, there is just no end to the fun they have brough us!",2
"a lot of fun! i am glad to find a game i dont need to spend money on to get everything.",3
"very fun game but spend your platnum on charicter slots",1
"get this game! nothing is better than space ninjas.",5
"warframe is a mixed bag for me. its graphics are amazing, character design is well created and combat is fast paced,each warframe has its own speacial abilities, styles and customization. however i found myself becoming quite bored of the repettitive gamplay and maps, im not sure exactly why but it just felt rather lacking....also when firing my guns it was rather dull, i didnt feel any kick from it and it was like holding a pea shooter doing minimal damage (yes i have tried the various types of weapons, the saloon cowboy style twin pistols being my favored choice). trying to get new warframes is also rather time consuming, the player having to complete different zones to get components (some which you wont unlock till a higher level) with a high chance of not aquaring what you wanted. however i did expect this from a f2p game. money is the easier root to get cooler stuff, luckly this is a co-op game because it is on the verge of buy to win. so to wrap it up in short i would recommend this game since its f2p, its enjoyable and fun but be ready to sink alot of time into it if you are not willing to pay.",1
"its amazing you just cant seem to stop playing it xd",1
"very fun game i would recommend this game too a first time pc gamer",1
"super fun when you play with friends or alone with op weapons",1
"really fun game i can highly recommend it. the feel of the game is quite good. theres a nice selection of diffrent types of weapons.",3
"though it is mostly pay to have fun, its got solid foundations as a shooter. just play through in online mode and you can watch your guns and warframe evolve with you and your playing style.",1
"a really enjoyable game.it really is a grindfest but is not that boring,is actually a lot of fun with friends.",1
"this is an amazing game. the only problem i can see is the fact that the missions get really repetitive. otherwise, i would recommend this game to any avid gamers out there looking for a free non-pay-to-win game.",10
"great game! took like maybe 1 minute to figure out the controls and is very fun. the best part is the fact that you are space ninjas!!!!",1
"what can i say? its fast, loads of guns, lots of cool ninja stuff to do. play it.",6
"66% on metacritic?! not sure what thats about. this game is fantastic with some pals. great maps, fun combat, great visuals, free to play; worth buying into, for sure.",1
"this game has ups and downs, one up is you can get started and play for days and months that type of thing. however some downs are that one: sometimes you get stuck and honestly you may be stuck there for a while. two: rare supplies needed to craft items are almost ridiculous to find and it often takes hours to aquire them. another is that the secondary currency, platinum is ridiculous to come buy and there is not as i know anyway to obtain it buy completing tasks other than spend real money. also sometimes the game laggs behind awfully, one could even say that it hinders this game for being a great free online game. nontheless it is an amazing game when it runs smoothly, the graphic and scenery put into it for the stage its in is actualy amazing, there are countless hours of game play that can hold you at the computer for hours. so overal this game is one that i recommend on the fact that its free and has so many options open to be taken advantage off in the future.",1
"good gameplay, but i would like it better if warframe developers bundled more updates into one group, instead of constantly updating warframe.",1
"played for a little bit but its just the same things over and over, kill all mobs then move to end, stay in one place and kill wave of mobs. it got boring fast, with whatever story they had going dying almost after the opening cutscene.",1
"possibly the best tps i have played so far go get it!",1
"its a great game i have around 300 hours on my record and only paid once like 5 and still using it",5
"i downloaded this on a whim, and its actually really sweet! i suppose that you can think of it as 4 player co-op with space ninjas, which couldnt possibly be a bad thing! it plays a bit like mass effect 3 multiplayer, but faster and better in pretty much every way. there are more guns and more classes, and despite there being clear advantages to spending money, its still enjoyable if you dont.",4
"aliens, ninjas, robots, zombies, and custom appearence. what else you want?",4
"its such a great game, if you like playing mass effect 3 multiplayer this games suite you. difference is this game is free :d. lol.",1
"this is not a bad game. the atmosphere of the game is great. youre going through several different areas, and youre killing these robotic like creatures. youre also a space ninja, and thats awesome. the gameplay is pretty good. you can either go melee, or just shoot your gun. the most effective way of defeating your enemies is by using the gun (atleast thats what i got from my experience), and the sword works well for opening various objectives such as closed vents. overall, i feel that this game is great, but it falls short on some other aspects such as additional warframes, different coloring of warframes, weapons, and other types of materials like that. most of them cost a lot of money, and the blue prints are difficult to acquire. the game lacks an indepth tutorial within the game, however more information about the game can be found on the internet. i feel that warframe is a great game, but what ruins it is the free to play model. the gameplay, and the games atmosphere is something that most games miss, and its a blast to run around the multitudinous zones, and kill various types of enemies. the game is really good, but due to the free to play model, it falls short on giving the players an easier way obtain the different weapons that the game has to offer and consequently, warframe is an okay game to play for a short while, but the end game content will definitely require you to spend some money to progress.",1
"pretty damn good for a f2p game. played it for hours",5
"amazing 3rd person shooter! it feels like a more futuristic game of borderlands mixed with the old ps2/xbox/ngc game i-ninja!",1
"awesome devs and community manager, constant updates.",9
"this game has you playing as ****ing space ninjas with shotguns. is there anything left to say? i would think not.",1
"this game is really fun and cleverly done. each warframe has its own strengths and weaknesses making the player decide which is best suited for what sort of gameplay. the same can be said for the high amount of weapon choices. you could have a frame and weapon for each of the three factions (grineer, corpus and infested), and mission mode. or aim to have your favorite warframe and weapon loadout tackle anything and everything. all in all its a great game. plus the staff actually works hard to resolve bugs and balances in a timely manner.",3
"unless you are a huge fan of fantasy, then this game is not recommended for you. the graphics are o.k in the game, however the plot of this game is not great. as a matter of fact, i dont even think i understand the plot yet. i am not stopping you from playing this game, but i can tell you it will be a unsatisfying experience if you do not like fantasy. thank you.",1
"this is an excellent game and i diagree with the meta-score it was given as it should be much higher! furthermore it is a very nice third-person shooter.",2
"so much farming. it hurts to farm this much. i give it a cabbage/10... maybe bump it up to a pumpkin/10 on a good in-game event.",4
"an exciting action game with lots of different weapons and warframes to choose from. interesting upgrade mechanics and addictive loot gathering will keep you coming back for more, but eventually the lack of mission and enemy variety will start to make playing feel like a grind. due to the cooperative nature of the game, and the fact that the items not available to free players are only aesthetic, it never feels like paying is necessary in order to advance. a lot of content does require a significant time investment to reach however, and the option to pay allows players to access things a bit sooner. overall a great game, and with updates still coming out, im eager to see what the future has in store.",7
"yeah its pretty good you get to be a space ninja or something i guess",1
"i didnt end up putting very much time into warframe, but when the intro missions are the way they are - full of idiot monsters (grineer) with poor ai, two weapon shenanigans, a regenerating shield to allow you as many mistakes as you want, a lazy soundtrack, and the most annoying guide character since alia in the mega man x series, its hard to justify putting in enough time to even get to the pay-to-win stage.",1
"i love it :o its the best check it out ... they also have ps4 version also so dont forget to check it too.",1
"i love this game now lol best free to play ive ever played",3
"i love this game it is awesome and great!! the first few missions are a bit tedious though. and the game is a bit confusing at times. but you should get used to it. have fun in warframe. ill be waiting. lol",1
"good 3rd person shooter with a distinctive look and feel. worth a try as free-to-play and paying is mostly for the impatient for cosmetics (without granting much that a f2p player couldnt grind their way to given time.)",7
"nice game, great graphic, but need high speed internet connection.",1
"not on for fps but i am liking this, more then a fps worth a look as a ftp",1
"another free to play. ill admit this isnt the best of games, but its a fun game to play for a couple of hours every now and then. lots of weapons and upgrades, but unfortunately youll have to pay some money if you want the really good stuff. all in all, its fun but very very buggy. full of glitches, but the constant updates are working on fixing this game up. time will tell how thisll turn up.",1
"this is one of those few games you find, that are not only creative and unique, but fun and a blast to play with friends. from doing mid-air slides while shooting a machine gun or stabbing mutants with a sword or axe, this game packs a powerful blast of action and indepth building of your tenno. i would highly recommend this game for anybody who is wanting to find a good free-to-play on steam or just trying to find a way to spend spare time. i would give this game a 9.5/10.",2
"its a pretty neat game for f2p. some pretty intricate combat with really neat weapons and animation. worth checking out!",1
"starts off as a fun game, but just becomes repetitive and eventually boring. prehaps make stuff easier to unlock rather than making us pay ridiculous amounts for platinum?",1
"this game is like borderlands 2 with xp and level up. a must try game, only 3.3 gb of download.",1
"very fun, fast paced, action parkour shooter. awesome game.",1
"when i first looked at it it looked like a completely new level of online action games but when i played it it dissapointed me as it was completely different to what it looked like",1
"game maps seems to be duplicate of each other and gameplay very repeatitive. game runs flawless and has nice graphics.",1
"great game, lots of powers and weapons, great fun :)",9
"this is one hell of a good coop game. and its free 2 play. been playing since the closed beta. its like mass effect 3 multiplayer but better and faster. with more weapons/ gear and levels. and for those guyver fans you will love it. i made a video on this game, enjoy...",1
"i really liked this game, i am sure i will play a lot after playing this game last night. thanks for the developers to bring something really amazing to us. in my opinion this is the best free to play game.",1
"interesting sci-fi co-op online shooter with progression, crafting, melee and other stuff. a bit p2w but not mandatory.",2
"nice game, good looking, fun to play alone and with friends especially with friends, free to play, pay to be op but be warned youl pay a lot, better just farm and let the in game money do its things",3
"though it does have potential and looks good, the graphics first off, when you turn your camera, or rotate, the screen goes insane and has like what look to be really long sideways water drips going across the screen, or movement streaks, which make sit almost impossible to see, also, you move so fast, in the beginning where it teaches you how to do things, you cant get your cursor over the enemies, making it close to impossible to shoot them. the game, lags a bit, not that much, the game has no options to turn off sensitivitey, also it is not much of one, but a bit of ptw game (pay to win). if you can see that i am the only one not recommending it, here is why, they all talking about after you get into the game pretty far, and after you get into it, and get deeper and play more of the game. at the beginning of the game, it is very difficult to proceed.",1
"an extremely well thought out and executed game. the shooting is tight, the weapons are numerous and unique, and the swordplay accents everything to great effect. thie game is incredibly immersive, offering so much more than your standard third-person shooter. a unique blend of shooter, slasher, and a few tips from the rpg genre, warframe will have you hooked within the first hour.",2
"best game ever top graphics and awesome powers the only problem is that it overheates my computer besides that this game has my 15/10",6
"the best things in life are free. this is better than the best because it has robot ninjas.",4
"still the occasional bug as it is still in beta, but excellent none the less",2
"still the occasional bug as it is still in beta, but excellent none the less",2
"hi, this is chris hansen from dateline nbc, why dont you take a seat?",1
"very fun, for anyone with any playstyle. dont have many hours because play it on ps4. c:",1
"a free-to-play multiplayer game thats not pay-to-win, and its about space ninjas. what more could you ask for?",4
"my rocket pistol shoots a random number between ten and twenty rockets per shot in a gigantic star-shaped pattern. i have a living lightning gun. and an arc welder. also a railgun. did i mention my wolverine claws? random parts of my body and weapons inexplicably glow. my founders shirt and headband have still not arrived. i mean all hail our de overlords! 11/10, will continue throwing $140 at every three months.",2
"almost fell into lava, held jump and ran along the wall like some space cyber ninja then sliced some dude in half. 10/10",1
"i highly recommend this game, i talk to people at work about it all the time. this game, as i describe it to others, is robot ninjas in space, with parkour, and swords.",2
"ill be honest, i hated this game at first, but dear god once you get past the beginner and default stage, it is just amazing, one of the best free to plays i,ve ever played, so worth it.",8
"combats pretty good, but the maps were designed by  alcoholics.",1
"great game especailly since i have a better computer to run it now intel quad core bfg geforce nvidia gtx 275 4 gb ram",1
"amazingly fun game, especially with friends. it is more fun treating the missions as a stealth mission rather than yolo, because it lets you experience the surroundings and create strategies rather than just hack-n-slash at enemies. it is still in open beta, and lots of potential as of 7/2/2014 and deserves 10/10 for its originality.",4
"where do i start with this game... the graphics are fantastic! the gameplay is so, so smooth. and the community is loving. lots of players online each and every day. the market feels kinda p2w with the guns and warframe prices, but you can craft weapons, warframes, ect. so overall 9/10 give it a try!",1
"great fun for a free game. is a grinding game and is not ashamed of that. digital extremes updates the game frequently and are very interactive with the community. end game is lacking apart from solar rails (not for solo players), once you have every frame and gun maxed there is not much else to do.",5
"liking this game for me, basically boils down to getting to be a damn space ninja. theres lots to love though. its got space robots, spehs mahreens, and violently infections space zombies. the game feel is great, theres lots of unique, interesting weapons, and cool stuff is always being added by the devs. best of all, its free. sure you can buy stuff with platinum, but the only thing you cant craft yourself is slots for frames and weapons. not only that, but the most sought after item (upgrade reactors/catalysts) comes out to a little over a dollar worth of platinum. i wont tell you that this game is perfect, because its not. i have had a lot of damn fun on it though, and i find myself coming back to this game more than others.",7
"adrenaline fast fun action. only disadvantage is, the game getting stereotype and less fun in time, regardless the suit u wear. i can recommend thou.",2
"o-0 very fun and addictive. thank you for taking the time to read this review.",5
"this games pretty awesome, good design and fun playing co-op :d",1
"really recommended for all player who wanna play a good f2p games. but kinda repetitive when you have done all warframe. so it gets really boring because the lack of competitive pvp like other action game. r.i.p. acrid",4
"basically this game is awesome, if you liked borderlands you should like this game too! i love borderlands 2 ive said it is my favorite game when asked what is your favorite game? by others. this game has grinding like in borderlands and has multiple characters aswell, theyre called warframes, and theyre is around 20 of them you can buy them with platinum (the games in game currency) or grind for theyre parts. all in all warframe is a great game that you should try out because it is free so youre not losing any money if you dont like it, while sometimes the game can get a little repetetive it is because either your playing too much (like me) or you just dont like it. im very happy with this game and decided to give it a 9/10 because it can get glitchy sometimes. hope you enjoyed my review of, warframe.",1
"one of the best f2pfps i ever played (such as tf2, ava(fuqin garena lost my funtown account), and some really good indie fps, etc) nice work~~~ <3",9
"its like halo just mixed with cool, card-collecting upgrades that is better for the pc. it has a lot of potentiel as long as they keep the fixes constant.",2
"this game is beast! all i can say, the game has great graphics. awesome gameplay, mechanics. however when thats said, it gets boring after some hours, and you get a bit mindblown from the prizes of the stuff. also alot of the things costs real money.",1
"its like space ninjas or ac on steroids. what else do ya need? 10/10",1
"really badass really fun to play alone or with friends",4
"great game nothing wrong with it for me i would recommend it to your friends",2
"one of the only games to keep my attention for so long definatly worth droping a few bucks on this to support the developers for there repetitive but adictive game. think mass effect 3 multiplayer (only better much better)",1
"free to play done right. none of the hey you need to give us all your money before you can really play garbage. this is just a really great, fast paced shooting game with an interesting and complex upgrade system. the developers get you to pay money because its a great game, not so you can actually play the full game. at no point did i ever feel i had to spend money. definitly check it out. its free after all.",1
"really good game for a free to play! new content is often and fun!",3
"its awesome if you like wall running,wall climbing and 3rd person shooters plus ninjas in space",1
"the solo portion of the game isnt something i really endorse, but! get a group of 2-3 friends, and the game has changed entirely, even with 1 other person playing with you over voice comms. far beyond that of any other cooperative shooter i have played, and everything in the game is obtainable through farming, save for cosmetics (duh?). 10/10",6
"games great. got good shooting, awesome weapons, awesome frames, updated constantly by great dev team, premium currency is expensive but rightfully so to prevent you from just buying everything, they do give you up to 75% off plat purchases through daily login so its not bad if you wait. everything can be bought with in game money ( mostly ). only a few annoying aspects like the limitation of slots but otherwise with proper knowledge and maybe a lil help ( can easily get help in game players are quite helpful ) you can get pretty far everyday. i always feel like i progress. game should have way more hype and following then it does.. i think the early days of closed beta threw everyone off the game has massively changed since then and isnt even recognizable. its about to go through another huge overhaul soon with update 14 with a quest system and completely new 3d ui. if you like hack and slash tittles with looting and pretty graphics this game should be top of your f2p list.",2
"liked: visual, concept, design all are great 9/10 disliked: the gameplay, i really love this game, but i hate the gameplay overall 6/10",1
"are you a ninja? do you want to be a ninja? how about a space ninja? thats what this game is. space ninjas that go around the solar system libarting planets. it can feel grindy if you dont want to spend really money to get some things but that feeling you get once you slaved to build it will be more enjoyable. doesnt take much of a computer to run. give it a shot!",8
"this is the best game ever. ever. for a long time. ever.",1
"best stelthy 3rd person shooter out the 5 stars out of 5",6
"absolutly fantastic, with little or no pay-to-win features, as all items can be crafted in one way or another without sepending real currency, a truly free to play game with fantastic graphics and several months of playtime, let alone a few hours of fun :d",2
"this is a great game to play with friends co-op i like the way you can pretty much play the game in your own style but complete the same objective as your friend for example your friend can go trigger happy but you can go stealth and hide in the shadows",1
"absolutly a game that needs to be tested. its free and very well made. it doesnt cost anything, so why not try it out??",1
"after days of playing this i can guarantee the fun that is in store for you. the learning curve on this is very linear and you feel the progress with every level you play. i definitely recommend this game!",1
"10/10 this game is my favorite free-to-play game, and it doesnt take much to get into it.",1
"if you like being a super powered ninja then this is the game for you! it features super suits that allow you to bend the elements (or the enemy) to your control, and gives you the ability to perform amazing stunts (like slash through 10 monsters at once). the only problem i can see is the time it takes out of your day to gain new items.",5
"great game, highly addictive, and still constantly evolving",10
"what can i say about this well it is fun dont get me wrong but at times it can feel like a big grind fest and at others it gets repeative but once you get past that this game opens up to a whole new world of fun with constant updates and the devs keeping hotfixes and things i recomend this to anyone that wants a new experence",3
"gravedigger fagus said it best: its a game about space ninjas destroying space nazis and futuristic ea representatives. i dont think i need to say any more here. you cant leave out the mutant zombie versions of said nazis and ea reps. its like this, you and your crew infiltrate ships and bases on various planets and   up (and thats just with the weapons)! when everything is done, your team rolls out like nothing happened. space nazis, what space nazis? exactly. seriously though, the game is extremely fun. you get your choice of primary, secondary and melee weapons, per loadout, from an assortment of weapons from each faction (with an option to go melee only). there are several warframes to choose from, each with unique abilities. you can customize the colors for pretty much everything! you aquire mods to make your weapons and warframes more powerful. you can have up to 3 different mod loadouts and color schemes for everything. practically every weapon and warframe can be attained through crafting. the game is updated fairly frequently, and most importantly, its free! so if youre like me and enjoy shooters, co-op, hack and slash, love ninjas and are flat broke, this is the game for you!",8
"you havent installed this yet?well then you arent a ninja!",1
"great game, especially for the ps4. it has great movment and the combat flows perfectly",1
"ninjas + space = space ninjas f**k yer! 10/10 best free game ever!",1
"good game, though ranking up is a bit of a hump to get over, considering you can do it once every 24 hours. still a nice game; one of the few shooters that i actually enjoy playing.",1
"badass characters and attacks, looks great graphics wise plenty of content to entertain for hours yes fun for a while, but takes way too much real money to progress your character at all. 75% of every game is a strait connection nightmare.",1
"its like halo just mixed with cool, card-collecting upgrades that is better for the pc. it has a lot of potentiel as long as they keep the fixes constant.",2

"its awesome if you like wall running,wall climbing and 3rd person shooters plus ninjas in space",1
"this is one of my favorite games to play with the hotline miami soundtrack. wall running onto a zipline and then shooting the  out of everyone below has never been sweeter than when done with knock knock blaring in my headphones!",1
"everywheres a slip n slide, and every once in awhile youll pull something off that makes you think youre neo.",1
"pros: fun, versatile combat, regular updates. its also on ps4. unique game all around, plus its free. cons: the missions kind of get boring and stale after a while. it just starts to feel like you are playing the same maps over and over again. and theres no compelling story to drive you forward.",1
"can u guys do somethign about the grafics like make it really poor? i have a 3.4 rateing pc is there anyway for lesser grapfics?",1
"warframe is an addictive, fun pve game that is worth the download!!",2
"> free to play > has probably spent more than $500 on this game > realise real eyes real lies its a fun game tho.",3
"super space ninja shooting power skills. nice game.",5
"although heavily grind focused and lacking diverse content, the gameplay mechanics here are smooth and well designed. give it a try, its free to play and rewarding if youre looking for a co-op 3rd person shooter.",8
"amazing game for free. only hope is that they improve pvp.",1
"pros: -fun coop gameplay -gorgeous graphics -a wide variety of warframes and weapons to unlock -regular content update cons: -i personally dont like how the warframes,weapons etc unlocked.you need to collect resources from doing missions and buy blueprints to build warframes,weapons etc.some requires you to join a clan,researched it first before u can build them -the game feels like grinding to some people -it has some inventory restrictions,u can only have 2 warframes unless u spend ur platinum to unlock more warframe slots overall: warframe is a nice game.who doesnt like to play as space ninja fighting s(i hate those enemies after knowing their lore)with friends? 8/10",1
"warframe is a very good game. you could make all of the warframes characters without speding any real money. the mission are not the same, there are all different. ninga kicks and flying kicks are cool in this game. there are lots of weapons and melle weapons to choose from which is cool.",2
"awesome teamwork based game. youre basically space ninjas going around doing flips and cutting people in half. amazing customization with tons of weapons and classes (not to mention the colors). get to extraction!!!!",1
"awesome game play, and great fun online with friends.",4
"it is just plain awesome! lol... sorry im bad at making things like these.... >.<",1
"pretty fun okay graphics controlls are good aswell",1
"fun, co-op shooter with elements of melee combat that set it apart from a lot of your other games of similar genres. the only real downside is the sheer amount of pay-to-win aspects of the game. you can acquire everything naturally in-game, but be prepared to spend a lot, and i mean a lot, of time trying to do so. if you can get past that though, theres a really fun game here that everyone whos remotely interested should pick up and try.",2
"fast action, on the fly multiplayer, a large variety of weapon and armor combinations topped off with customizable upgrades, the list goes on as to why the game is good. if you enjoy a fast paced shooter with a science fictions twist than this game is definitely worthy of your attention",2
"i had this game before it came out and the grphics are great and its alot of fun for a tps",1
"i got to run around as a space ninja and shoot things but then i shoot the glass and suffocated because space 10/10 would spend hours grinding for stuff to make items also got to make my own clan and have big empty dojo for myself",1
"fast, fluent action and its 100% free! a must play if you liked the mass effect 3 multiplayer. its that + many more maps, modes and customization.",2
"exactly what you love in a fps coop. a lot of ninja stunts and movement while still combining little strategy and ressource farming.",4
"love it nomal play on steam but love game nu less it fast in your face fun",3
"it will make your  larger... yes, even if you are a girl.",3
"great game free to play! explore worlds, make new weapon and destroy a lot of enemies with your abilities! ninjas!!!! 10/10",5
"this game is very much a grindfest but as a free to play game its very fun and well worth the download.",2
"since the beginning of warframe, the story and gameplay simply blew my mind. now, with the arrival of update 14, i can no longer find words to describe how much this game satisfies my soul. keep up the absolutely amazing work, digital extremes, you guys are awesome.",1
"it might not be pay to win, but its definitely pay to fun.",1
"so, other than my other reviews that make absolutely no sense and are pretty lame, i decided to make a somewhat logical review. i have lame jokes. dont hate. anyway, im gonna start with the good... im sorry... great things about this game. this includes: - a tutorial (which was changed in u14 to be somewhat helpful) which actually somewhat explains the game. - no main menu. instead, you get your very own ship. thats pretty much your main menu. - great animations. - great voice acting by the characters in the game. - amazing weapon mod system (i.e. give your weapon an explosion effect, make them get more critical hits, etc.). - very fun gameplay with randomly generated maps. - hours of content. - far from pay to win. - many more! however, this comes with a price, which includes: - can get repetitive a bit after a while. - most levels look similar, even though they have different tilesets. - movement can sometimes get a bit annoying. - you may have to grind for some resources. - etc. overall, this game is probably the best f2p game ive ever played. warframe is updated frequently with a very positive dev team and community. definitely recommended.",2
"plz allow restarting characters... i messed up and i want to restart",1
"seems like a fun f2p shmup. worth the download, though whether its worth paying for remains to be seen. ask me again in twenty hours.",1
"i love it and i constantelly find myself running into gun fight were only a true tenno like myself could beat the enemies.",1
"running down one corridor 10 billion times never felt so good, most innovative corridor design of all time 10/10.",1
"i give a thumbs up for a free to play game still bugs but very fun",6
"endless enjoyment. theres so much that you can do in warframe, so many ways to costumize your play style, and there are always new weapons to master - not just in rank, but in unique skills needed to use them effectively. at points it tends to grind, and being part of a clan opens up a lot of the game thats otherwise locked away, but this is one free to pay that is definitely worth the time, and even a bit of scratch if you can get into it. space-ninja-robot-assassins forever!",2
"bro, you can mad style on all the kids with this game. wall running? you bet your . flips? totally has em. guns? just wouldnt be the same without. wall running while doing flips and shooting people with your guns? you bet your  , son. get this game. its like vanquish decided to have sex with mass effect 3 multiplayer and had a child that spawned the best each of the two has to offer.",1
"i dont really understand what is happening when i play this game.",1
"one game that i have a little trouble with, when i first began. i like the co-op aspect of this game, and what the player is called teno. weekpoints to this game are: singelplayer is next to impossible in certain missions, some enemies hide and group together then proceid to  you, and finaly the freking stalker is a pain in the !!! the strongpoints are: good comunity, easy missions to rank up your character (save a few), boss fights, cool wepons, dual weilding wepons, and great clans. things that id like to see done: a better coumincation system, less creatures, and oxium bots not suisiding.",6
"this game suffers from mobile pay2win syndrome, otherwise known as you either pay to get x instantly or wait an unbelievably long time for it. that time ranges from 12 hours to 3 days. good game tho",2
"this is a great game, full of different features, missions and is constantly evolving, bringing new types of mobs, warframes, guns and all sort of things. spent a great amount of time playing it and do not intend to stop doing so",1
"this whole review is based off playing 15 minutes into the new update 14! i just gotta say wow they stepped up their game so hard that destiny looks like cheap trash. how does it feel that a free game on steam outstepped you so hard in one update. nice budget idiots(activision 500 million usd budget for destiny lol wut?). warframe is here to stay and update 14 can confirm this. i plan to put atleast 300 hours into this game now keep up the beautiful work dev team!",1
"can be tedious if you are not a pay to play kinda player but all in all still a great game.",2
"the game makes you feel like a badass and you have fun with it",1
"warframe is one of the most fun free to play games out there. the developers are hard at work trying to do everything they can to make the game better. if this is not the best free to play game then i dont know what it is. at first it may seem very overwhelming, but you get the hang of it. the best part is, you do not need to pay real money to get the best gear. you have to build it. finally, there are so many different ways to play this game, you can go in as a lone gun, be a supportive player, be a stealthy assassin, etc. the possibilities are endless. so i give this game a 10/10 rating. btw....ninjas play free!",5
"i really liked this game but i didnt have enough time to play it. i may play it again soon.",1
"this game... is the best!! look and click and the only negitive section in the reviews and most people who disliked this game is talking about a grind fest... *sigh* nothing in life is free an not even in games! period. you dont have to level up every warframe and weapons, and now there is a trading system for rare upgrades or mods. once you ma ster what you wanted at the right path you want to upgrade/mod your weapons, youre free to do anything you want until you get bored then you can choose to master another warframe/weapon. other than that, this game is just pure satisfaction! i would pay over 40$ to buy this game if it wasnt free! ill leave the rest of the experience and choice for you to download and try the game out yourselves, people who checks the reviews first before playing this game. because next thing you know it, youll be hooked! and one more thing... you dont know that youre getting into, so prepare for the awesomeness and watching over 3 years of youre life drain before your eyes!",6
"waframe, a game on which your are a space ninja that jumps around doing ninja like things. as for how the game plays it may feal a bit magnet to things sometimes, but if you can get by it it gets really flying everywhere. it may take a bit if effort to get good at the game but its worth it.",7
"i be very suprised when i watch this free to play game,its so good and i hope this game be better with more dlcs.",1
"good for goofing around with your friends, however i would never play this game single-player. thats just a bit boring. not much cooperation here either, but still fun to be a space ninja. crafting takes a looong time and a lot of patience and a looot of replaying. 6/10",1
"best 3rd person shooter, slicer, dicer, power blaster i have ever played!!! ashame that i havent played it from day 1, because i would still be playing it! enjoy the action and community. you got to try out this game!",3
"tenno-dono, the galaxy is calling for you. the blade is starving for the blood of your enemies =)",5
"absolutely love this game!! its so much fun to play. been playing since end of closed beta and the game has come such a long way since then. there are updates all the time with tons of new content and fixes. the games devs are absolutely amazing and when it comes to interaction with their community they are prob the best i have ever seen. the only negatives this game has is that it can get very grindy and is hard for newcomers to grasp the game. for me this is one of my favourite games ever.",9
"not only that you are a bad  ninja with a sub machine gun you can also play on multi player and slice bad guys up with your friends!!and all the missions there are can be solo are multi player and the parkcore in the game is unbalievable!! try it out",2
"this game is totally amazing! youll probably put superglue on your chair once you get ahead of this game... 10/10 super addicting...",4
"fantastic game for third person shooter fans looking for a farm fest as it has the farming qualities akin to a game like diablo but from the third person perspective and with guns and space ninja magic! need i say more.",7
"i give this game a 8/10. it is an absolutely fun and addicting game. it gets repetative yeah, but its honestly just mindless killing with a group of people. who could complain? well, actually that brings me to my big sorrowful point. there isnt much of a story. that is more of a personal preferance. i like a good story. it has potential. who are the tennos? what the heck happened to our solar system, etc. i definitely do recommend this to people who play just to have fun though. great game.",1
"i started a few months after the open beta began. i have not been disappointed in this game ever. every update adds more and more things to do and makes the whole game feel like a brand new one. it is the only free to play i have ever invested more than $5 in not because i had to, but because i wanted to. everything can be done without paying for it. everything. it is amazing and i think more developers could surely follow their example. gameplay is always getting better and the game continues to evolve into a more fleshed out and realized universe. in short, it is awesome and i think everyone should give it a try.",7
"while my game hours are seriously lacking compared to other players (also inpart to playing the non steam version) i hope you do not disregard my review. warframe is an intense experience. while seriously lacking a story really of any callibur, it still has captured a sense of doing something throughout the star map through events and special zones called dark sectors. grinding is almost eliminated unless youre going for the ever illusive prime weaponry and frames. (the best stuff in game) but! everything is craftable, and can be obtained for free (except for things like helmets and scarfs unless someone is handing them out) this is absolutely not a pay2win game. does it take time to build stuff? yeah. and have i put money into this game? well duh. but all in all warframe has made it into some of my top picks. good luck newly awoken tenno, and have fun.",3
"amazing mechanics, amazing gameplay. been a member for about 2 months now, and, you never get bored of it! the amount of content in this game is unbelievable! the devs are constantly at work with hotfixes, minor updates, major updates, etc. really in-depth parkour system, featuring wall runs, sliding, forward rolls, back rolls, etc. gunplay is a big part of the game, but melee is just as important. there are tons of weapons, items, and warframes on the market to build! everything that you can buy with real money in the game, you can make. except for some cosmetic items, but still, great game! 4 unique factions, each with their own weapons, looks, and, so much more! each weapon has its own type of damage unique to each faction. impact, too corpus, puncture, too grineer, and slash, to infested. 10/10, thumbs up, anyone who is reading this and hasnt played this yet, definitely try, because theres tons of stuff to explore in the game!!",3
"this game is 100% excellent. it runs totally smooth on my pc, maxing out at 60 fps, and never dropping below 55. i highly reccomend it to anyone whos looking for awesome combat, a great storyline, and of course, a challenge.",1
"i love the gameplay and idea, but you have to buy gear with real money if you want to advance in this game. :(",2
"im a ninja with guns and superpowers. its mass effect meets dynasty warriors.",1
"overall this is a nice game to play whenever you have free time however the game itself is extremely tedious and occasionlly boring whenever you try to play alone. if you do want to pick this game up i advise that you play with a friend so that it will be more entertaining. otherwise here are the games pros and cons. pros: -nice diversity in characters & weapons to choose from and use - graphics are nice to look at (especially at max settings) - blood and gore is always a plus - can use in-game currency to buy warframes(characters) and weapons - you never feel like the game is pay to win cons: - in order to obtain new warframes and weapons in-game without buying them you have to buy the blueprints, obtain all of the materials to craft said item via the games crafting system and crafting times are fairly long ranging anywhere from 12-70 hours in real time also you have to do all of this with in-game currency. - level designs are incredibly repetative as you will see the same level designs several times over the course of your playthrough. - two leveling systems profile leveling/character&weapon leveling. yes in order for your weapons and characters to be at max power you have to level them up first also leveling your profile takes a huge amount of time. - certain weapons are level locked so in order to craft or even buy them you first have to level up your profile to the required level. - game can feel like a huge grind especially when playing alone.",4
"this is a great, fast-paced game! totally would recomend it for any hack and slash gamers!",5
"this game is by far the best free to play game of all time",2
"in most cases i look down on many, many free-to-plays so when i first got this it was simply because it was free, and well, i just felt getting more games in my library. from the trailer it looked slightly interesting to me so... i got it. little did i know how stunning the graphics were for a free-to-play and little did know how emmersive this game is. with many in-game attributes to your character and its customization (which im a big fan of in games) i was instantly hooked. although there are some ridiculously priced dlcs and some in-game purchases, it doesnt affect gameplay because its not pay-to-win. if you can, by all means give this game a try, it may not suit you as it did me but... who doesnt want to be a freekin space ninja! -8/10",1
"warframe is a fun, action-packed shooter that lets the player have control over what missions they go on, what planets they visit, and makes for a great co-op game. its jam-packed with space ninjas, grotesquely awesome mutated creatures, and plenty of content.",1
"great game for a free-to-play. however, the game can become boring after you begin to invest time into it, and the gameplay can prove repetitive. so far, warframe is posed as a closed beta under the guise of constantly being fixed, and the devs regularly add more weapons, characters, etc. in order to sooth the repetition of gameplay for veteran players. while this seems good at first, it quickly becomes a detriment to the potential of warframe. all in all, the game has fantastic graphics, and a style akin to me3s multiplayer. it is fun to play as a pick-up title, and i have high hopes for it. however, having invested countless hours myself, the game has grown boring, and the promises of constant updates instead of a legitimate story and endgame can be aggrivating. so if you want to play the game, dont invest any money into it, as it fits the free-to-play genre far better than one you should actually pay for. 7/10",2
"i love this game! but do some research about it and the characters before you play if your a new player it might help you think about what you want to be in the game!",2
"i love it just needs to get use to and some options tweeking and gyour good to go",1
"this game is a good 3rd person shooter. it has good graphics and it has good game mechanics. warframe is fun to play with friends . in warframe you get to become part of this clan of space ninjas and you get to pick wich ninja you wanna be. in my opinion ill give it an 80/100 .",1
"fun and addictive co-op, and you cant beat the price.",2
"best f2p game ive ever played. still in beta with a monkeysbarrel full of content sure it has some kincks but for the deal its giving its a must get to anyone who likes space ninjas.",9
"dis is a fun game. defenetli get this game. its the best ftp game there is!!!!!",3
"after pumping over 200 hours and $100+ into this game on the ps4 i kinda wished i stuck with the pc version. over all warframe is a solid third person shooter. the loot lust is strong with this one. if you feel like you wished you could get into mmos but the combat is just too bad to get around, then try warframe. it has a steep leveling treadmill and enough going on to keep you coming back. if i had anything bad to say about it, it would be the free to play aspects. the realy money currency (platinum) buy options are a little expensive. usualy 5-15 dollors a gun/character but they are unlocked fairly easily. if you have time i would sudgest just farming for those characters and weapons and saving your platinum for cores to power them up. warframe is currently my guilty pleasure game and with de pushing out a steady stream of updates, i dont really see an end in sight for me will definatly keep playing",1
"amazing multiplayer and singleplayer experiences, with good gun feel and mobility through out the levels. sometimes the fact that a lot of actions are binded to the same button can be a bit finnicky, but is still fun.",1
"awesome game, if your new to steam and have likes to play games were you can be like a ninja but also a warrior at the same time play this game",1
"do not press the download bottom unless you like getting addicting with drugs. 10/10 best virtual drug on steam.",7
"this is a truely amazing game this review comes after i first started playing a few years ago when they only had 3 or 4 different maps that were recycled for each mission, how far this game has come the awe-inspiring environments, the ability to build your own clan hall, and the variety of areas are just the beggining. most everything in the game is accessable without payment however if you dont want to keep tossing your items you worked for when your done youll need to spend a little cash to unlock the inventory slots, but with the in game trading system it is possible to never spend a penny on this game and still enjoy its full potential. there are items that are usually only pay to get however there are regular events with these items as rewards over all very well done model of a ftp game in no way is it pay to win. this game gets an 8.5/10 from me the only thing that could help this game is a little more active lore area, such as more exploration and free wandering just to give the game a sense of a real universe which this company is working so hard to create",3
"one of the best games ive played. its amazing how great it is and its a f2p.",2
"warframe is fun. the only thing is you you only get 2 warframe slots total in the beginning and to get more slots you need platinum (and you need to buy platinum).",1
"its unbelievable to have a free game like this. most free games only hold my attention so long. i can play with my friends, game give me free money to open up a few warframe slots, and makes me few awesome playing. currently having some networking issues, but its beta still. #1 free game on steam in my opinion.",2
"another game i love, but its another excuse for a free to play game, when its also a pay to win experience. i played this on my ps4, and still may be able to play it again. while this isnt one of the worst games ive played, in fact this game looks really damn good with its designs, gameplay, weapons, and muiltiplayer story campain, it all dosent matter that you have to charge yourself to upgrade yourself. warframe is trying to be more like halo, without its genericness, but it ultimately it lost my interest when i have to pay real money for ingame items. so for a muiltiplayer shooter, i could recommand it if youd spend wisely for something fun, useful, and satisfying.",1
"its better if you play with friends. solo play feels like a long grind an people that randomly join go off and do there onw thing",1
"free to play. free to pay. there are other free-to-play games like dota 2 or counterstrike without pay-to-win and with a better gameplay. dont waste your time. the first five hours made fun, the other hours made me bored.",3
"this is a really good game who like fastpace, thirdperson shooters, and a little stealth. its at the point where you can be stealthy but its not a must. you can upgrade and buy new weponry. ill be playing this a lot.",1
"this game is amazing!!! the graphics are awesome, the weapons and warframes look sooooo cool, and the gameplay is complex but easy to learn. you can run up walls, run across a giant gap, and hang off the edge. and the way multiplayer is essential is also a nice feature. with up to 4 players in a game, it adds for a ton of fun.",1
"its alright. pay to win however. mostly a pve game with a third person over the shoulder game-play. enjoy.",3
"its a very amesome game, the graphics and game play are fabulous. it does an great job making ou feel god like but still chalanging. only down side is it can have a lot of grinding and as a result i have lost intrest over the year but i still play it time to time :)",1
"kinda different from most 3rd person shooters, theres always one guy with >750 hours steamrolling the place if you play with randoms. was not impressed 3.6/5",1
"it is a realy good game the only thing i would do to change it is add another invintory spot so you can hold your melee wepon like you would your primairy and secondairy and posibly adding in an assasin kill when you walk up behind an enomy (wile crouching) with your melee wepon inhand it prforms a one hit kill assasin animation.",1
"punched a corpus crewman in half -10/10 space ninja third person shooter. very fun, lots of grinding for things, though.",3
"i keep wanting to like this game but your character looks a bit like a rhino on legs. the speed of play is very rapid and this speed of play -its running, jumping, shooting & using various weapons, with a team leads to a bit of mild motionsickness. if you dont mind your characters appearance, and the rapid style of game play, this is a remarkably nice game worth a try. follow up: a little while ago i went back after the recent patch to try the new ui. i had an opportunity to choose a new basic character & resulting appearance while playing during the new game tutorial that leads into the main game. turns out that once youve played the game, you cant reset your profile. cant make new characters, and if you chose the wrong character type/class you didnt like while starting, you cant erase all progress and start again. further, warframe has no apparant options in the website where you can manage your account for any kind of account delete/reset etc. ultimately if you make the wrong character choice when starting you cant go back. oh well. didnt need that hard drive space occupied with the warframe install anyway.",1
"its my personal opinion based on that it wont patch. it says patch failed, download files corrupted and it starts over and over again and nothing happens.",1
"this game is worth trying out if your looking for a run-and-gun type. updates make the game better and better as time comes. if you dont like it nothing lost its f2p!!!",4
"it is a fun game but only if ur willing to open ur wallet up i dont reconmed this to players who are looking for a non pay-to-win game because in warframe u can unlock everything via crafting but it takes forever to build so this is a pay-to-win game essentialy but nevertheless fun ive always liked it but i realized that it was just to much to keep with with the new content so i only recomned this to players who are willing to open up their wallets to microtransactions do not try and play this solo or else u have to buy alot of platnuim at the start in order to solo even half of it so i do recomend this to players who can look past the pay-to-win part of this game.",1
"bad game, i mean, how fun could running around murdering people as outlandish space ninjas be? 2/10, would not bang. p.s. very fun, get this game",3
"before you read this review: warframe has great ingame mechanics and a lot ingame content to offer but is very time consuming! if you don`t have much time (in case you need to play other games :d ): please save your time and dont even think to install this game... i mean: it has great graphic, the gameplay is fun and the warframes (the name of the ingamesuits) are great and innovative... but please dont even look into it... if you are a millionaire ready to waste a  of money or you are a person, who is ready to sacrifice days of time this game is perfect for you... if else i want to give you a example: you can select 1 warframe at the beginning of the game... 1 main-, subweapon and a meleeversion after that its fun... as long you dont want something new... 1 warframe needs: 1 blueprint for the buildingprocess, 72h real time, a  of credits and mats and blueprints for helmet chrestarmor, legs etc.... but this subblueprints are only obtainable via killing a boss... now comes the hook... the bossbattle is only possible if you have a blueprint for a key to start the mission... the boss doesnt always drop a blueprint... for the key you need time, mats and credits... you see where this is going? (the same for weapons, extra stuff etc) nonetheless the game is great... if you have time or are willing to pay $$$ for ingamecurrency",1
"this game is both a grind and glitch fest. it takes forever to collect what you need just so you can craft something, and by the time you get everything you need to craft a certain item, its useless because you leveled up so much and upgraded your gear. this game makes me rage a lot that i ran out of complaints on why this is the worst game ive played. the sad thing about all of it is, im addicted to it! play at your own risk!!! 2/10 ps: the wall running, wall climbing, and jumping are complete disasters.",1
"i have yet to play this game but i can tell it holds great potenional",1
"parkor + being able to buy items but also unlock them! + guns + customization = happy people!",1
"if i wasnt having probles geting in i wouldnt have the time to write this in total i give it a 9 out of ten",2
"ive only played through the first couple levels, but the game was hot. i definately recommend giving it a try if nothing else.",1
"awesome free to play coop game, although you sort of need potatoes to get the most out of your kit.",1
"finally a good co-op game. perhaps valued more because of the scarcity in the co-op genre, but not a bad game by any means. if you grab one or more friends, this game can be hours upon hours of fun. and even when playing on your own, the extensive crafting and progression systems can keep you busy. its free to play, so no reason not to try it out for any co-op shooter fan.",1
"a formating game for an alien like futuristitc amaxing battle refrence, to a space like game compared to this would not beat it crafting and upgrading was weird but a game like this is great i recomned this game",1
"definitely a great fps game will definitely recommend it to anyone who love fps awesome graphics and gameplay",5
"all the enjoyment of living out of a van without any of the pot smoking or truck stop hooker ing.",2
"futuristic sci-fi 3rd person shooter? i dont know. just play it. its worth checking out and giving a shot at its bosses.",1
"future space ninjas!!! nuff said. the gmae is very fast and fluid, has a great balance of hack-n-slash/third-person shooter as well as the lack of pay to win. although there is pvp it really isnt fleshed out and focuses more on the co-op. #1 plus: a great and positive community!",5
"warframe is a fun game that isnt all abiout shooting it up, but strategy. really enjoying it. would highly reccommend",1
"ninjarobot <3 [ignore my hrs] after reinstalling the game, i noticed some huge changes in the game. gotta love the updates.",1
"great co op game with nice and smooth graphics really enjoy playing it 10/10",1
"gotta say ninjas and space are pretty good together",3
"this free to play game is amazing i would definitly reccomend downlading it and creating a account on it",1
"graphically engaging, fastpaced, dungeon crawler-esque, rpg elements, and overall a good time. if youre looking for those things, look no further, and download warframe!",1
"a fantastic game. this has great graphics and a great setup. i recomend this to anyone looking for a great shooter game.",1
"the developer of this game, put so much effort into making this game and though its free! i recommend this game to all of the halo fans out there though its not like halo but of course look alike, play alike and good alike, this game involves futuristic sci fi and third person shooting assault, a very good game indeed it is",1
"if you dont play this game, you are very lame. if you play this lame, then you are very game. game very are you then ,lame this play you if. lame very are you ,game this play dont you if.",1
"stomping the ground so hard that you stop time and space around you. love it.",4
"you jump, glide, slice, shoot, run. and the end of the day you loot and upgrading.",1
"love the game, even though there are so many bugs like files corrupting after each time playing. (as in my case. its very disturbing, id love to see it fixed.) it sure is a well-done game. there are many ways of playing with many different weapons and characters. still, personally i think the weapon blueprints a bit too expensive, there are weapons whos single blueprint is more expensive than the duo-wielding blueprint. i dont see the logic in that. still a very nice game, one of the best ive seen.",1
"warframe is an excellent game, and its free! you are a murderous cybernetic power suit space ninja dude going around slaughtering various evil factions to help bring balance to the origin solar system. the combat in the game is satisfying, offering high diversity of loadout choices with so many different weapons and mods that can drastically change the way you use them. the movement is top notch, with a well implemented parkour system (sometimes it can be a bit wonky, but thats mostly just funny) that makes the game very high mobility in a refreshing way. the story is not really yet developed, though the placeholders for one are definitely in place. warframe is a constantly evolving game, and will have something quite different basically each few months that youre playing! the sooner you get in on this, the better!",4
"you are a ninja. in a space. kicking a**es. just play it.",1
"i like the models in the game. they have some really nice polygons, sometimes im just staring at that rather than the actual game. those sweet, hi-def polygons.",1
"this game is confusing at first but once you learn your way around its pretty intricate. it has so many details but not overwhelming. the graphics are good but not great. and the free running and movements in-game are so smooth. this is a free game so you dont have anything to lose.",1
"if youve ever wanted to play a game where you can be a space ninja pirate with a gun and sword that can turn himself into a puddle, youve come to the right place.",4
"gameplay is very casual, co-op fun - in a similar vein to left 4 dead. only with cyborg space magic ninjas vs robots, infested alien zombies and power armoured humans. wall run, backflip, and slide your way parkour-style through levels. gameplay is very much style over substance - you repeatedly sprint, hack and shoot your way through somewhat repetitive levels - hopefully with friends. where it shines is the casual-friendly co-op, and surprisingly deep customisation. the tenno ninja suits can be equipped with a vast array of perks and abilities, and upgrading and swapping these is a mini-game in itself. surprisingly good for a free-to-play game.",3
"perfect game for people who are looking for a coop only game.",1
"this is a really fun game. all the challenges just give it that simple edge.",1
"its a great game that you can easily put a lot of time into. the visuals are great and gameplay is fast, along with a indepth mods system to really customize how you play.",3
"as a hoarder i hate having to buy inventory slots, but otherwise this is a fantastic game. grindy and a bit samey as far as gameply goes, but still, fun.",1
"it is fun and a very intersting universe to look and fight in.",7
"this is a fun 3rd person shooter, it has stealth and parkour elements wich makes it even more fun.",1
"its a free to play halo with ninjas, why wouldnt you want to play?",3
"great game, but its along the lines of halo at the fact that your a superior part of your species and you have to defend your planet from aliens from another world. very fun, but will take the money right out of your wallet. if i had to rate this out of 10, i would say 910. i recommend this game to any gamers.",1
"been with this game since the beginning, took a break and im surprised to see the changes etc that has made it worth while :)",6
"well, not that my short time playing this game amouts to the crazy amount of tme that some people put into this game(right now i have 70 hours in this ga time), but this is the best free game that i have ever played so far!!!!!! p( ^ . ^ ) the epic combonation of parkour, ninjas, aliens, robots, and the co-op/clans makes this game amazing!!! especially update 14 which was very nice btw.. xd even though ever single word of this is my opinion please at least try this great game.......well....its free so not that you have nothing to lose anyway....",3
"omg your new interface is so bright and it moves around so much! why the heck do you want to give people migranes? i got sick just looking at the pre-game interface. why did you botch up this game so badly? this used to be one of my fav games. now i cant play the intro. and please dont get me started on the blazing hot i-escaped-from-the-planet graphic. please, please, please change it back. or give ppl the option to not use that interface. its painful to anyone with headaches, seizures or neurological issues.",5
"a unique sci-fi fast-paced tps with cool customization options and in-game mechanics. fun game to co-op and pvp with friends. mods allows for diversity and creativity in builds that gives missions good replay value.",8
"ill punch you ill punch you good fear the mighty space ninja",4
"crashes constantly and really buggy but still good game",1
"it is free 2 play what else do you need to try the game.",1
"this game had me at space ninjas. its like a mass effect slash n hack game with tons of different ninjas (or technically called warframes) and weapons. with 500+ hours of playing i do not regret anything. can get a little repitive, but what games out there arent repetitive at some point? have to do a little bit of farming at first, can be hard to understand but after that first week youll be rolling in the money, ninjas, and good weapons.",4
"the most gorgeous game ever. coop gives a huge fun to all players.",4
"not an actual f2p title, its just free to download, pay to play. >mfw level 25 with a walking stick",1
"omg finally they updated this game it so amazing i love it so much i love the company!!",4
"pretty dumb if it says i have to buy it because someone else in my house is playing it. fix this  steam.",1
"its fun but just like most the online competitive free-to-play games here, this one would require some ching-ching for you to win and pls no i wasnt trying to be racist. also, most of the missions would require you to play with more than one person. about the game: i only played briefly as i have the wonderful world of dota 2 right after i downloaded warframe. basically what you are is an alien ninja species that can use guns as well, a species called tenno. the tenno are almost extinct because of a certain faction which i forgot the name. so, what youll do is to team up with other tennos (or you can solo if you buy powerful items using real ching-ching) and defeat the evil faction. there are also some other side missions where you do other stuff idk i havent played yet. keep in mind these: -if youre looking for a free to play game, this is a no-no because youd get bored. -even though my time was brief i enjoyed it and i had money to spare so it probably helped tremendously with my experience. -i didnt try surviving the game without money, so since its free and if you have time id recommend you to at least try it. happy gaming guys.",1
"it is a very fun third person shooter, with a very active dev team that is always working on the next big update and always keeping it fresh and new.",2
"i love how this games controls work and cyborg ninjas are epic",2
"played it a while back on the ps4 and thought it was alright. now i started it back up to give it another shot on the pc and it looks completely different. plenty to do and the environments seems pretty well done and quite different. just started out but would recommend to anyone with some free time. play alone or with others.",1
"think mass effect but with zero cover base shooting, and human sized robots. bit of a fun game, nice concept and animations. if you can move past the gooey interface (it really needs a sort by pricing options) and awkward controls (i really suggest you rebind them) itll be fun with friends.",1
"absolutely raises the bar in the free to play category. graphics are smooth, contemporary and optimized. gameplay equally so. unlike most games in the f2p genre, this one is considerably generous. cosmetic add-ons aside, the game gives you everything you need - free. modifications, weapons, in-game currency, and even warframes. kudos to the developers, although they almost certainly still make a buttload of dough. nothing about this game forces players to pay-to-win. if youre willing to spend real cash, thats your choice. at least give it a go. itll cost you nothing but your time.",1
"this game cant play in mac os!? why isnt you making for mac os?",2
"great game to waste some free time; best played with friends.",3
"i remember playing this 1 year, i came back 2 weeks ago and i am having a blast, they have done massive improvements, the only issue that i had was getting used to the game again, some of the things are explained, and i would recommend checking some guides, but its a game that rewards trial and error. just try new stuff and keep on going. fight on tenno!",5
"the levels are quite repetative and it takes a lot of effort and time to get the weapons/warframes you want. i played it for about a month or two before getting bored. it has stayed in the top f2p games for a long time now and im thinking of downloading it again.",1
"it is quite a good game with a lot of replayability. recomended.",1
"this game is great!, one of the best f2p gameplay balanced game(you dont have to pay for goods, unless you dont have patience to unlock). so give it a try for me,this game cant be play very long time, this game stuff are same over and over for me. that why i quit. so yeah..... every new class or weapons came out, have to train over and over same steps to train.",4
"warframe is a fun fast-paced pay to win rpg shooter, i recommend it to anyone who is willing to pay a bit or grind their pay to the top.",2
"this game, to me, is like a mix between halo and borderlands and so far i love it, if you liked halo, and always wanted it to be a free roam game, this is the game for you, download it, its free!",1
"this game is awesome but add more starting classes please.",1
"nice game with gorgeous graphics and very nice skill effect. awesome gameplay with different set kung fu style attack animation. cons is if you play long enough you will realize its a quite repititive and there are moment where you just keep hack and slash style gameplay. overall its still an awesome game to play",1
"if you enjoy co-op games, and flying around the map like a ninja, then this is the game for you.",1
"best game i have played, not withstanding the fact that it is a free to play. but the free to play structure done right. has regular updates with free content with challenge to get also not pay to win. de ihas set the bar when it comes to a free to play game period. great community of people to play with never had a bad experience yet. also update 14 has made new user experience a much easier entrance to the game so go ahead give it a try, ninjas play free. i whole-heartedly reccommend this game.",2
"space ninjas? flaming/electric/explody/radiated/infected/poisonous swords? yes. 540 hours of my life have been put into this game for a good reason.",5
"this is one of those games where you can play it on a crappy computer like mine (intel pentium no graphics card) at 60 fps on lowest settings and it still looks great. i recommend this game because no matter what anybody says this game is free. you can obtain virtually everything for in game money, but if youre not as patient you cant spend real money for platinum which is the real money equivallent. but i recommend the first choice because a.) its free and b.) it gives you a sense of progression. if you play this id recommend to get dual shortswords of any type and try stealth killing an enemy ;)",1
"pretty entertaining after playing a few hours. has a fairly good story so far and explains the controls well in the tutorial. ill definitly be playing this more!",1
"warframe is a extremely good game, the graphics, the art style and the gameplay mechanics make it a fun game to play solo or co-op!",1
"when this game gets its claws into you, it will never let go. 10/10",1
"great game that evolves and gets better over time.",1
"this game is awesome. for a free to play game it looks and plays really well. this is a sci-fi ninja style game wihich plays like deadspace. very enjoyable while completely free, and spending a few bucks has some worthwhile content. after about 60 hours can get repetetive, but devleopers release changes and new content frequently.",2
"this game is the best game if you like those games that are awesome",1
"ninjas from space do not need any recommendations. they are just that awesome.",1
"pretting fun and intence multiplayer co-op game. lots of content for a free to play, little bit of a learning curve but once you get the hang of it its pretty fun.",1
"this game is fun at first but not worth your time. because this game is online co-op all the other players rushed ahead of me, killing all the enimes, so i had a terrible experience. between the odd controls, which i spent half an hour rebinding so i could play well, and the bad totorial. the starting experince is terrible. if this game had a better totorial and a few levels, if not a questline, in single player i might play this game again. i just loved the first level one i got the hang of it, and the cosmization is very wide and unique, but i will probuly never play this game again. it is a waste of memory on my computer, i will defintiely be uninstalling this",1
"cyborg ninjas with guns and powers! enough said! this game offers amazing high detail graphics and well thought out gameplay. this rpg style, third person action game offers high violence and blood for all the gore feinds out there! its free, awesome, and beautiful. get it!!!!",1
"this game is fun. and free. a 3rd person shooter with melee and powers. and fun. kinda mass effect/jedi/space mercenary feel. give it a try.",2
"this is a very fun game. i remember playing it when it first came out. back then it wasnt much but now that they kept improving it i am very satisfied of the results. hope to see more from this great game.",2
"i havent played this game long on steam, i used the standalone version mainly. but it is goooood. it can be a bit grindy, but its awesome because theres tons of action. tons of weapons too, its fun to level em all up. and its free to play, which is awesome. so yeah, game is aweoesm.",1
"this game amazing get it. you dont know what you are missing. you dont even after to use real money to enjoy it. i upgaded two suits ( warframes) now and some weapons with out spending anything. ok you have to wait 8 hours or more sometimes 2 or 3 days to get everyting built once you got what you needed. but in the mean time you can still enjoy game. even has a thing for clans to :) amazing 90% not 100% why cos you have to do a test thing to unlock some items and you can only do it every 24 hours even if you pay for stuff. update 11 aug 2014 i just got back into game had a big update new ui and a cockpit for your ship and the 3d nav screen looks amazing. for a free to play game this has to be one of the best updates i seen. lot new and with new ui it feels like a new game. before update i got bit bores and now they working on a story mode which part 1 been added. it was missing a story but still a game worth checking out 10 out of 10 ( cos of this new update 14.0",1

"you can move your ship on the loading screen.... 12/10 ign",1
"you can 360 noscope enemy while sliding and shocking them, 10/10 would play",3
"amazing game... 10/10 and the best part is that the dev team really puts work into the game. also its not pay to win as the best stuff in the game is not accessible by throwing money at the screen which makes the f2p ppl very happy.",5
"you have not lived until you have played this game",1
"this is an amazing game, it cause you addict to play this game, trust.",4
"its a great game for players who like fast paced combat. it takes a bit of skill, but its worth it. the only complaint i have is that it takes a long time to level and the crafting is a bit difficult.",1
"this is game is amazing i highly reccomend getting it since it is action packed and super fun",1
"its a pity that i have to run warframe out of steam. for some reason the steam servers dont allow warframe to be run from windows 7. nonetheless, this is a gg!",1
"so i have been playing this game for about two weeks, started a guild, and did pretty much there is to do in the game. there are lots of levels, around 200 i think, lots of planets, lots of random events for random blue prints and mods and teno, also this game isnt really pay to win, i guess, because you can earn everything you need in game, and trade in game stuff for platinum, which is not required to win, but it can get you stuff you cant get without it, luckily there is a market of people selling platinum for items. also, the game is fun but repetitive and not enough people play, however it is very complext and entertaining at the same time, but there are serious lag issues in pvp, rail missions and things like that, so much so it makes me debate if these people are using hacks, because they function fine in the lag, where as you just end up dying and not knowing why or how. there are also a lot of bugs in this game, game crashes, falling through the map, enemies being behind the map preventing you from killing them and finishing the mission also. these bugs are rare, but when you come across them, and you will if you play this game like i have, than they will make you debate on writing this game a bad review. however, if you love rpgs, mmos and fpss than this game is worth checking out. besides the bugs, and the repetitiveness, i still come back for more, for now. its also free, so why the heck not.",4
"warframe is an awesome, fast-paced, co-op 3rd person shooter that is truly a thrill to play",10
"this is one of the best third person shooter games iv played in a long time. it featers intense combat, great graphics, alot of variety for every play style and most importantly balance. this game balanced its pay/free aspects perfectly, you can make all weapons and warframes in the game, the only difference is you have to wait. this is really good because pay to win players have no advantages over you and you can both enjoy the game the same way. it has lots of weapons, lots of characters amazing combat and is all around an exeptional game i played it so much im waiting for them to implement more content. and still im alwase coming back for more. for a free game thats incredible, plus you will earn discounts on platnium (pay for currency) and you can get up to 75% off, iv gotten a 30$ pack for 7$ and it is worth every penny. this game is exeptional.",1

"one of the best free to play games you will ever play it has amazing graphic arts and the gameplay is very smooth plus there is an entire teamwork based gameplay option that i love",1
"this is a game built upon its gameplay. there is no sense of plot in the traditional narrative structure and theres no supporting characters or anything that allows for a sense of empathetic immersion. as someone who plays mostly rpgs, i came in expecting a couple hours of entertainment then on to something new. what i did not expect was how fun the game is. it has extremely snappy and responsive gunplay and free running and you really do feel like a space ninja badass. however, the game does still feel incomplete. the newly added player ships feel like a small bandaid to the overarching problem of everything feeling disconnected, and the complete lack of subtlety in instancing and mission progress, show the medium a bit too much for one to be completely immersed in the game. however, its a damn fun game, one of the most fun ive played and ill continue to do so. the developer is very appriciative of their fans and incredibly transparent with the community. could not recommend this game enough.",2
"was in a mission around the pacific coast in earth, just walking around with my friends and killing some guys for fun. then some dogs showed up and refused to die, even if they took an arrow to the knee. climbed a stone and spent the next 30 minutes shooting at them with my pistol. 11/10 would play again.",1
"just awsome get it now its mostly pay to play but it is worth it",1
"when i first tried this game around v7-ish, the ui was a fuster-cluck of stuff. i had no idea what to do, who goes where, why the warframes even, etc. so, sadly, i gave up. as well, a tubor of a pc was no help either. come a few weeks ago, it is up there, in my opinion, with good f2ps like team fortress 2. it follows a pattern where you have to work for stuff, and buying things is not necessary unless you want to shorten build times. i like that, it is a sense of progression that even few p2p games give. i really like that. as well, each warframe is varied, and unique in each power. some are pure tanks, others are butterflies-of-death, and 1 is basically a self-repairing/energy siphoning queen, and another is the best for defense missions. as well, each wep feels varied, and looks unique, and few need certain prerequisites to acquire them. higher mastery rank, gives you cooler weps, and clans/labs allow research into cooler weps. aside from the occasional bug, i really love this game.",2
"when i started playing this i was really confused that how to play and its tough a bit in the start but in time when u will play, slowly, slowly. you will get it and like it much i just played this game much like in 7 days 80 hrs mayb even i dont have much time to play but still 80 hrs are much. :d you should try it, whom didnt anyways take care,",1
"this game is amazing the recent update adding kubrows really puts the arf in warframe",3
"its a nice game but its hard to find party in hard quests.",1
"these updates theyve done are fantastic. great game",1
"wow what can i say about this game title. its changed loads since i played it when the beta launched but what game doesnt. now this game has new fetures added into it on the recent patch  loving it  btw ftw guys keep it up. i recommend everyone to atleast try this as it doesnt force you to do anything ( pvp related ) if you dont want to do so . this game is again co-op an most you an 3 other friends or pugs running around a map completeing the objectives an killing all the al badguys its very shiny an most will agree it has to be shiny as its a sci-fi mmo with in my opinion has a mass effect feel to it at some points which is nice",1
"i remember trying this game a while ago and not finding it my type of game. something about it just didnt click (possibly the weird art style). then my friend told me to give it another try, and with this second try i got hooked. at first glance it looks like a simple run n gun game, but it is much more than that. one of my favorite parts of this game is how modding works. many weapons seem average at first but once you know how to mod them correctly, they become unstoppable. and then the fun starts. fully auto shotguns with higher fire rate than most assault rifles, grenades that explode into toxic/electric/fire/younameit aoe, and bows that shoot 2 arrows at a time, explode when they hit and also pin enemies to walls (but not before cutting them in half). you really can get crazy with stuff in this game and i cant wait to see what they come up with next. game is also regularly updated with an amazing and helpful community.",3
"free to play futuristic third person shooter that feels like what the new star trek game shouldve been!",1
"what can i say, i fell in love with this game. it is a game that was somewhat tailor-made for me. no clunky armor, master chief sci-fi space marines here... no console-ish mechanics limiting what types of moves you can do in relation to the environment. extremely responsive mod system: you feel the change on your character and weapons as soon as you start modding and upgrading the mods. best visuals on any free to play game out there. it can range from casual, relaxed missions to incredibly difficult and insane ones. i could go off and on but all i can say is that this game hit all the right notes for me.",10

"i reccomend this game to anyone who likes ninjas space ships sci-fi crap and all that stuff",1
"its like a chimera made up of left 4 dead, diablo, and mass effect. and it keeps getting better as the beta rolls on. expect even more improvements now that its going to be a ps4 launch title, and hopefully we can get some cross-platform action.",6
"to be honest, this is one of the best games ive ever played 10/10",1
"if you like co-op shooters then this game is for you. the fact that its free makes it a must play for any gamer. definitely one of the best f2p available right now. not your typical f2p game, it is based on co-op not pvp. this game is play to win, not pay to win. you can buy all the materials to make new gear for prices that i can only describe as extortion. if you put some good time into this game, you can find all of the materials you need to craft the different items and not end up spending 200$ on platinum which is the games paid currency. if you can get a few of your buddies or some good online teammates you are guranteed to have a good time playing this game. its free, its fun. try it. period.",1

"i cant believe this game is a free 2 play, it so cool",8
"this game i cannot lie is amazing, you can litterally do everything without paying money into it but just takes time. the ingame currency seems like it is very highpriced at least it did to me but it goes a long way for the money you spend.",2
"not much variety but its isnt a bad free to play game. you dont need to pay real world money to have fun but it will take longer to get stuff if you dont",1
"excellent game, great graphics, amazing team play and single player features, an all rounder.",5
"great game, loses most value after about 200 hours with repative missions. if you like grinding for gear and space ninjas this game is for you.",1

"its fun, fast, and challenging at times. this game is well worth it",6
"its a fun game but it crashes way too much, it happens about every 30 minutes or so for me.",1
"advantages: space ninjas regular heavy content updates events almost constantly weapons for days lots of game modes good community good customization options looks great no hackers disadvantages: steep (but short) learning curve for new players. heavy grinding for endgame-tier gear frequent updates cuase bugs overall its a great game if you have a fair amount of time to kill grinding for stuff.",1
"this game is fun, at least for me, for only about a couple of days at most, maybe a couple of hours... this game is a great ftp game and has lots of great elements. the gunplay is great, the parkour is fun, and the characters (tennos and enemies alike). the game has constant updates and active developers who ask the community for advice on certain matters. the developers are very interactive with the community of players. the game, since it is ftp, does have a lot of farming for objects though. and a lot of wait times for guns or frames that you would like to build. and there is a cap on how many warframes you have. unless you buy more slots, which is only twenty platinum, which is cheap. but that is a bit of a downer. i personally like this game, but do not adore it. the level system is not something someone blows through. this game demands attention if you want valuable items. and if not time than money. it does get boring farming items as it takes a long time and certain drops are rare and require multiple playthroughs of the same game type over and over. and a word of advice... play with people who are better than you if you are a newb. this game was meant to be played with other people, whether that be friends from your personal life or randoms over the interwebs....... 6-7/10...",1
"i was skeptical at first but this game really is a gem and i beleive that it will only increase in popularity as time goes on.",1
"a great game with many rpg elements. lots of fun if ur into grinding games. fun controlls and ideas. only bad thing i have to say is very glitchy",6
"fast-paced action, if you wanted to stealth it you would need to work hard but it all pays of",1
"really, really, glitchy... but one of the most fun fps games on steam and possibly ever created.",1
"a very good game i really like it. its fun when you play with friend thats why i take it.",1
"great free game! defo worth it, ashame not too many of my friends play it",1
"this game is amazing, des release new updates every 2 weeks so there is always something to do and you dont really have to buy anything if you trade with others for platinum :)",3
"great third-person free to play game in a extreme sci-fi enviornment. highly recommended for those that like mmo rpgs...",1
"too much grinding no real endgame, lack of competitiveness",1
"i found it to be very original, and always a good source for an hour of fun, then it simply stopped working",1
"great game. my only problem is that i cant restart. if you play this make your character wisely unless you want to have tomake a new warframe acount to restart. plus you can only have 1 account per email. that means to restart you have to create a new email so you can use it to make an account. other then that it a great game.you can be sneaky or go in guns blazing. probably best to chose the right build for sneak or guns blazing.",1
"its not the best fps on the market but its probably better than league of legends.",1
"very good game still need alot updates more  but very fun do and if it wasnt for half the  you need to buy it be better and if also wasnt so laggy sum of time im blame my laptop for it do it be great game need focus on the clan and story line also even if its mmorpg still need focus on the stuff that lacking most of it beening on the weapons and mods need new unique mod and if each warframe can have unquie skill that make stand out the rest of the other warframe it be awesomer",2
"its really nice game i recommended to you for play my rating is 8.9/10",3
"if you love grinding to get and create rare gear, you will get a hard on for this game.",1
"best 3d coop shooter on steam to date. gameplay mechanics are smooth and graphics are gorgeous. team work is very important in this game so make sure you grab your friends and be part of the tenno badassery. it gets progressively harder and more rewarding as you keep going. it is definitely not your run of the mill generic shooter. and now with clan system (guilds), clan housing and dueling the social aspect of this game is much better as well. digital extremes is doing a really good job polishing and improving this game with each patch. the only downside of the game ive seen so far is that it needs a lot more pve content for those who already beat all the planets (which is plenty so far but not enough) and some more variety andmaybe open world maps (less corridors) would be a lot of fun too. still i highly recommend it.",4
"best mmo ive ever played, love playing it since i first downloaded it. tenno for life.",10
"the way the game has evolved since the early closed beta is nothing short of remarkable. it is free ,visually stunning and has super powered cyborg ninjas in outer space, nuff said!!!",4
"update. still one of the most awesome ftp games your going to find. would still highly recommend this game. there have been many gilded ftp games, being fun enough on the exterior of core gameplay just enough to get you hooked before essentially forcing you to spend money to stay relevant. this is not one of those ftp games. the only aspect that bugs me atm is that you have to have platinum to unlock extra warframe and weapon slots aside from the default amount they give you. that is only if you want to own more than 2 warframes, and you can sell frames and weapons to make room for others as you try them all out. although some of the more in depth features, such as polarising your weaponry, and building a clan dojo require hefty grinds, with 3 other team mates they are fun. all around good over the shoulder shooter",5
"awsome game.... :d!!! you should try it ,its insanly fun people..",1
"recently started playing warframe. addicted. i love the style of the game. the parkour aspect, for lack of a better word, really pushes the game up in my personal favourites. 10/10 recommended!",1
"great looking free to play, interesting mechanics such as sneaking, if you really dont want to fight you can sneak your way through a map. which i found very interesting. the game consists of suits that your character wears called warframes and each one carries special attributes, such as stealth extra abilities cloak, etc. but is free what could you lose by giving it a try?",1
"farming, crafting, cooperation, clans, alliances, ninjas, space ninjas, ninjas with guns, parkour, melee, lazer guns that go wwwwwwwoooooooozzzzzhhhhhhhhh, tentacle space water ninja with a pirate themed looks and water powers! and lots moar! ive been playing this game for a while and i still think ive barely scratched the surface that this game offers. de is extremely supportive of this game and omg this game has changed so so much. this game is in no way a pay-to-win game. yes it has microtransactions but you can obtain every damn thing in this game besides cosmetics, although during special events de gives them out for free. but seriously play this game. its really good. like really, really good.",5
"fast pace, mind blowing fighting, if your into chaos and swords with fricking crazy guns, take this game",1
"very fun and interesting game. kinda like..... i dont really know what to compare it to. the missions are fun and interesting and each frame has its own interesting abilities. you can play missions online or solo, which is a plus in my opinion. the game is free (for now) so go ahead and grab it if you enjoy futuristic ninjas.",1
"this is like a really good game, but sometimes it really pisses you off!",2
"6/10 the game is fun at first but quickly becomes nothing but a grindfest. can be fun, but its definitely not for everyone.",1
"ninjas with guns in space, with alien es, zombie things and now with 70% added badass",1
"mmo with a cash shop for a pay to win faster button, but everything can be acheived without spending money, even the in game currency can be traded for with other players. the game itself is simple: pick a mission, and use your melee weapons and guns to achieve the objective, whether it be kill endlessly, survive in a low life support zone, capture a high value target, defend a zone from oncoming waves, or assassinate a higher value target. the game in depth is vast and as complicated as you can stand it to be, millions of combinations of modifications, hundreds of weapons, new updates consistently, very little reason not to give it a whirl",5
"it awesome,the graphics are great and the gameplay is perfect",1
"i stuck with one character, went all the way, crafted a bunch of stuff, ranked up a few times and im pretty happy. im not sure if i want to keep going and keep trying all the frames. this was loads of fun. its completely doable for you to level, rank, and not pay at all. just play, farm, go through the galaxies, collect mods, craft the next good gear and pwn with other teammates. the new update added a spaceship you can call your home and a pet that can fight for you and do other useful things like save your life or open up lockers. this is what pets should do. help out and not be vanity items.",1
"i really love this game, its filled with action, no shortage of enemies and challenges that would keep you on the edge of your seat. with its si-fi jujitsu and the wide range of up-gradable weapons its an action junkies wet dream.",6
"holy  so fun. i dont regret tanking my grades and spending 300 hours on this. bring friends.",3
"if youre into ninjas, spaaaaaaaaaaaace, and many many guns, than this game is for you. me: so youre telling me i can be an alien assassin with a burst rifle, a pistol that shoots bolts, and be able to wield, not one, but two scythes at the same time?! sold.",1
"takes forever to update, but its soooooooooo worth it ^_^",1
"this game is the best i have ever played. its a really well made game, and its fun to play with friends, and also play alone. amazing deals on the real world currency money (platinum) and good combat system. remember ninjas play free.",5
"an amazing game with tons to offer! is not pay-to-win, mostly all items can be obtained by playing. (even though this isnt a competitive game) lots of different weapons to choose from! you just have to wait to craft them... a awesome team of developers who listen closely to its fanbase. play it, now! i recommend playing with friends, it makes the experience much more enjoyable.",4
"the game is awesome, but gets monotonic after 50 matches. they should add magic.",1
"amazing game that has the gunplay of mass effect 3 and the boringness of it without any quests/storyline missions",2
"this game is good but you might wanna go down with the updates a little it sometimes give me lag and some others too",1
"if you liked the fun that was the third person shooter with random powers that was mass effect 3s online mode and if you like running the walls like an assassin from assassins creed....this is your game. pure 4 player co op",1
"awesome game with fun, fast paced gameplay and plenty of weapon and ability choices. can sometimes be a bit of a grind for materials and items for crafting, and there is a bit of a learning curve for new players, but it is always fun to play and offers a great community for getting help, and playing together. -also your a badass space ninja...",7

"warframe is a game that you can easily sink hours and hours into and still have more content to explore. although the game is repetitive there is new content being added regularly which helps to split up the grind. if you can find a few friends to play with i would recommend this game to anyone since there is so much to do and it is actually fun.",2
"this is probably the best free-to-play game that i have ever played. 999999999999 / 1",7
"i have devoted 250 bucks and countless hours playing and watching videos to this fantastic f2p!",1
"the initial grind may seem unappealing for this game, but if you can endure it just a little then the many oppurtunities and customizations of the game can give many, many more hours of enjoyment. the clan system also works effectively when combined with dedicated players to add group driven research and progression that unlocks even more unique weapons. regular updates with new and unique weapons continue to add to the games huge variety, allowing you to customize your style and play the type of space ninja badass you want to play. gear up with a couple of friends and play this game!",4
"warframe is a great game because it has a little something for everyone. the games warframes supplement each possible playstyle. a few bugs are present, which should not deter players since it is in beta stage. warframe has crafting for the people who like to make cool stuff, small puzzles for geniuses, a looting mechanic, the ability to make any weapon a total beast, and a variety of weapons to fit any playstyle: the sprayer, the sniper, the heavy hitter, etc. the music is awesome at first, but gets a bit repetitive after a while, but gamemodes are fun and are challenging if given time, even the first stage has challenging levels. bosses are a bit overpowered but drop great items. warframe is incomparable with other third-person shooters, you could say its a different breed.",2
"its a very good game, but it turns into a grindfest very often. aside from that, i highly recommend it.",3
"this game worked great when i downloaded it the first time months ago, since then i have not been able to play because it fails to update. it is a free to play to there is no real risk you shouldnt try to enjoy this game. just know it may crap out on you",1

"it was fun. it was a game that felt good to play and provided many objectives to reach towards. however, once i got the warframe and weapons i wanted, the game started to grow tedious. why did my friends and i need to grind materials for a clan base we were only going to use to grind more materials for weapons i didnt want to use? i slowly stopped playing and moved on to other games, but thats not to say i left disliking warframe. i have quite a few fond memories of playing warframe with my friends, going through the different levels with random people and seeing loadouts i could only dream of having. but then i became an overpowered character others looked up to and got bored. while that kind of game ultimately was not something i wanted to continue playing, i would definitely recommend it. its a free game, why not try it?",1

"havent got so caught up with a game for while, warframe is so much fun that it took out almost 12 hours of my time every single day~ it is a fun, its coop, hack and slash, and space ninja(freaking space ninja!!!) this game does have something i doesnt really like in a game, that it uses real time for a item to be crafted, even with that it didnt stop me from playing it. for people who like to have fun, this is your game. the thing that frustrate me from time to time are the bug and glitches, it sometime force me to abandon a mission because of it, though the game is still in beta, bug and glitches are to be expected.",2
"a really good f2p game, mostly co-op based missions but its also fun to play with random people. great graphics, good gameplay, you can get everything in the game but takes some time, but not like other f2ps this one is faster. the only bad thing about this that the platinum is so overpriced its not worth to buy. i would not recommend buying platinums, not worth it trust me, not on steam at least. buy platinum of the 49.99 and the 79.99 dollar version if you want to support the company of the game and get many plats and good in-game stuff to your account. dakra prime/10 (it means 10/10)",3

"watched a couple (what is) podcast videos from valkavgaming a few nights back. installed warframe a day or so later. reminds me alot of hellgate london in the sense of : get into a map solo or party , its a shooter, collect gear and components. love the secret air shafts you can take. ie: youll notice one of the 9 foot wide air shaft fans stuttering in place. shoot it and it might be a path, a dead end, or either with a storage crate. on the developers side ... looks like they have 25+ developer podcast videos and this has been out for a year? watching some alpha/beta warframe videos it does appear alot has been added to warframe.",2

"this by far the best free to play game i have ever payed the developers are constantly improving the game there are no cons about the game except that at times it can be a bit reppetitive but there slowly changing up so there is some diversity i give 20 out of 10 exceptional also ive been playing this game in early beta like right after alpha an all i can say its come a long way",6
"i wasnt impressed with the trailers., but its free to play, so i figured why not give it a shot. i have to say warframe is fast becoming one of my favorite games now. it is probably going to become my new main game. thats saying something. give it a try! character leveling, skill and weapon mods, crafting - if these are game features that appeal to you then you owe it to yourself...",10
"its great for a free to play. the pay wall is a challenge but not impossible to over come, as long as you have time. most good gear can be gotten through paying for it of course, but if you have the time most items can also be made through the games crafting system, it just requires a lot of materials that take a long time to harvest. the combat is great fun though, it feels much faster and more fluid than many mmos. however it is an instance mmo, not open world. its just a mash of match after match. at this point and time id say warframe, hawken and tera are the best f2p games out there. with a tie between warframe and tera for the best. this is also quite fun on the ps4, but it doesnt handle as well, wall running is a real challenge with a controller.",1
"omg was there ever a better 3 rd person? answer - no. i love warframe and am very progressed and good at it. i hope further updates will change a few bots though :d. 10/10 *****",2
"pretty much the only game where you can get litterally anything without paying a dime :d",1
"warframe is a fun third-person shooter where stealth, speed, and power are key to being a good player. if you really want to be a top notch player stay with the team and dont run off on your own unless your sure that you will not die and can complete an op on your own while the rest of your team deals with the harder one. i would reccomend this to the ninja-lovers, the stealth junkies, and even those who like just freerunning and parkour in video games",1

"very fun shooter with great co-op multiplayer. however, there are a fortitude of microtransactions which can be used to either further increase your charcters power or visually. the game is competitve so i wouldnt say play-to-win; just play-to-shoot-really-simple-ai-that-can-be-easyily-outskilled-although-will-overpower-you-in-masses-win.",4
"a awesome third person shooter with many things to do and great things to play.i highly recomend this game.play solo or with someone , either way this game will strike you as fun.after your first few missions, you cant stop playing. all in all this game is a great looking game, an initially interesting game, and probably one of the best.",1
"the coolest game ever, like ninjas in space :) with guns",1
"warframe is a very good third person shooter. were you choose from 3 classes and you can earn more later. it has high graphics. the main thing in the game is to eliminate, destroy, protect, save, assassinate enemies with your friends.",1
"amazing graphics. great gameplay. characters and weapons are highly customizable. did i mention that all this is f2p? besides farming for mods, this game is will keep you coming back for more. p.s. it always more fun to play with games! 9/10",2
"amazing love it  yea play it please you will love it  it touch it dream it",1
"other than physics issues and the insane amount of grinding required to get anything without premium currency, this is an amazing game. i reccomend it a whole lot.",2
"one day, little clem tenno looked at the stars from his potato farm on ceres and said i want to be a space ninja, mommy. then his momma screeched tenno skoom at him and bashed him in the face with her gorgon. little clem tenno learned something important that day; his beloved mother was grineer scum. ever since then, little clem tenno devoted his life to learning the arts of vaccum ninjutsu, gun fu and coptering so that one day, when the grineer screamed clem in the middle of being bisected by a corrosive-flaming-ice-scythe, he would know they were talking about him.",5
"as a f2p game, warframe is one of the best. the game controls amazingly for a space ninja parkour game. thankfully these mechanics make the repetitive storyline a lot better and the variety of space ninja guns and swords are so fun to try out and ninja parkour some space clones and aliens.",1
"warframe is a amazing game. its a experience that can be quite fun to many players. the thing i like about the game is the warframes. the warframes are people like beings that fight infested,grinner,corpus,orokin, ad much more. each warframe has lore that is amazing, like valkyr she ecsaped the zannuka project leaving her scared. althought the warframes can be a pain trying to get its main resourse, its all worth it. now, the warframes powers are just wow, each power is differnet from lokis invisablity to oberons smite ablility. the followers, as i like to call them are really helpful. the sentials and kubruows may be a pain, but like i said its all worth it. theres so much more that i want to explain, but i dont want to spoil it all download the game and experience the fun. ;)",2
"the best multiplayer game i have player in a while and even better its free! not a single thing in this game requires money other than customization features like syndanas but they are rather inexpensive and the other things like custom hemets can be crafted. overall this game is amazing and its amazing how much the dev team cares for its players.",8
"unfortunately, its pretty much a pay to win game, but other than that ... this games absolutely brilliant, i love everything about it. please make more characters and weapons for us :d",3
"shooty ninja it okay i give it a soft 7 and transition what did you guys think of it did you love it hate it why auvrea lyth warframe forever",1
"the menus seem a little awkard to me. the game play is pretty cool. i dont like the platinum system however i do understand that you need to pay for this game somehow.",1
"recommend playing, you will enjoy this game, i have no doubt.",6
"every update digital extreme puts out on warframe improves on an already solid, great game.",1
"describe this game in one word? o............m..............g!!!!!!!!!!!",2
"game is simple and funy and every update its geting beter and beter",2
"warframe is one of the most addicting games i have ever played. it is so fun and i reccommend it to anyone with alot of spare time on there hands. although there is still some glitches and bugs inside the game but they are just minor bugs they are not really bad.",4
"i love paraclimbing, the fun of falling from the highest part of the ceiling, shooting lightning as volt from that height feels sooo rewarding.",1
"warframe is a great game, it has so much to only be in beta. i cant wait to see what the devs have in store for us next.",2
"youre a ninja in space. if this concept doesnt excite you im not sure what would truthfully. imagine doing back flips, slides and many other nimble and graceful maneuvers while simultaneously slicing through a few grineer. also you are doing this in space. however i will warn that a major downside to the game is the grinding, while not neccesary, if you are someone who wishes to keep up with the newest weapons and suits you will either have to pay out some money or spend some time farming materials to build these new toys. also note that this game is almost entirely pve and team-based, if you are looking for a pvp or solo game, you wont find what you are looking for with warframe.",2
"an excellent free-to-play game. while there are plenty of opportunities to spend real money, the vast majority of items are available through normal gameplay, barring some cosmetic items. gameplay is sharp and exciting, with an unexpected tactical depth. the graphics are particularly impressive for a free game. to be fair, there are still plenty of rough edges, but patches and new content are added on a regular basis. definitely worth a try.",2
"this game can be really awsome if you play with friends. otherwise, youll get bored and a little frustrated because it can become overwhelmingly difficult to take on the enemies by yourself in this game.",2
"so gooooooooooooooooooooddddddddddddddddd download it i recomend it so funnnnn",1
"trying to get it to work on windows 8 i keep getting a update failed please someone help",1
"great f2p game. space ninjas can keep you entertained for a few hours without getting boring too fast.",1
"for a free game in beta, this is sweet  thing to play.",1
"only worth playing if you have a full team (4 people) with you. otherwise, dont play it since you will die a lot.",1
"refreshingly brisk action game. be warned - the in-game explanation of the ui and game itself is  awful. you _will_ need to read the wiki pages. there is also a small drawback in that grinding out cash/items for new warframes and weapons can be extremely tedious. however, these two small issues aside, its jolly good fun. it remains to be seen how they retain interest in their playerbase, as the procedurally generated environments can be a bit samey after a while, but so far its interesting. rock paper shotgun have a clan you can join, which i intend to do shortly.",6
"waframe is a fantastic f2p 3rd person shooter. the community is great and the new content is awesome. any money spent is will worth it especially when you get 50 or 75% off. $100 worth of premium currency for $25 and you are set for a long long time.",7
"fast paced third person shooter with instanced based missions and ton of weapons and suits (warframes) to find, piece together and then try out. not a lot of story thrown at you but there is quite a bit if you want to go looking for it. combat loosely reminds me of the mass effect series, purely based on appearance but the speed and mobility is probably only rivaled by something like titan fall or mirrors edge. only thing i would really knock about the game is the microtransactions are a bit much at certain points but once you make it over the initial hump of getting out of the first couple planets of missions the game really opens up and becomes a real blast to play. having put over 100 hours into it already, occasionally dropping a few bucks down to buy some materials or speed up builds doesnt seem out of line at all.",5
"its realy fun to play but its down right know sad face",1
"this game is the very meaning of f2p. never have i play a free-to-play game like this since the likes of global agenda. this game is the next step toward establishing what f2p should be, as well as, what future f2p games should be mesured by! any future f2ps that are less than this just arent worth play or paying for. warframe gives you the bag for your time and your buck, and just keeps getting better. be prepared to spend hours-on-end of action packed 4 player co-op fun that will keep you locked to your seat, screen, mouse, and keyboard. if your new to f2p games and/or warframe, this is a great starting and reference point for you to use to measure all f2ps by. if your a returning veteran, there has never been a better time to pick up where you left off. this is warframe! enjoy!",7
"great game, changed my way of thinking about f2p definitely check it out for a fun time. best part is that if you dont wana spend money you dont have to eveything is attainable in-game.",2
"great game. best gameplay of any mmo i have ever had grace my computer.",5
"if you wanna be a ninja, be a future ninja. thats the best type of ninja.",1
"not really a fan of the creepy ergonomic armor designs, but the game is great. there ought to be more mission-based pve free-to-play games like this.",1
"this game is one of the best games i have played ever. this free game is what it is free. the game basicly gives everything away for free, the warframes (classes basicly), weapons (main, secondary,and melee), sentinals (basicly like the pet of dungeon defenders) and accessibility to missons. the only thing you actual even need real money for ingame are slots to hold all your items, and some cosmetic stuff (color palettes, skins,etc.). the game is action packed and loads of fun, i have about 300 hours into this game and still loving it. this game could have easily been sold regualar aaa prices and would have sold loads of copies. it is avalable on ps4 also if your computer is not good enough to run it.",10
"awesome graphic, lots of explosions, gore. if you have a  youll love it.",2
"this game can is a bit boring when you first start, but afer a short while, you will get into a play to get new gear kind of game. it is definatly more fun than call of duty.",1
"pretty cool game feels like mass effect , would be playable for longer if it had tdm",1
"amazing fun, sometimes hard to start off but a soon as you get used to the controlls and you get used to the mechanics you will enjoy this game like no other",10
"this is a good game with awesome developers, but it is in its beta so expect a few minor bugs.... and it can get a little repetitive at times until you reach higher levels. bare in mind that developers dont have an ego and they do listen to the community quite good :)",1
"i didnt really like this game. it seemed very generic and almost like a dystopia copy. there is not much involved other than shooting and slicing people with your sword.",1
"it is really fun! it does take some work to learn the game so i really suggest reading the wiki or making friends in game to help.",2
"warframe is about the grind. ill get that out of the way now. that being said, warframe has no clear goal to reach for, so do what you wish. it has no clear storyline, so you make what you want out of what is given. it also has an amazing community of players and developers. de (digital extremes) has done wonders in regards to what the community wants to see. they communicate with us and constantly add new content. if you like the concept behind the game, warframe is for you.",5
"very fun game if you can grind the hours, you get so much content and with constant updates, you will thrive for more stuff, only thing is you have to pay maybe a few dollars for extra slots for warframe slots and weapon slots but very nice graphics and immense replay value for a free game if you have the time to grind",2
"this is a very fun game to try! you get to choose from basically 15 classes that are called warframes. that each have 4 unique abilities. after you pick that you can make different guns, side arm, and a melee weapons of your choosing. although making new weapons and new frames can take from a day to a week to finish if you dont buy with platinum which is the games real money cuirrency. which does stink but i feel it doesnt really take away from the game. id say give it a try and to play with friends as it is a much better experiance in co-op!",10
"a fantastic timesink, the developers are responsive, albeit a little slow when it comes to fixing critical issues, but they appreciate and use community feedback. late game becomes a farm-fest (which isnt neccesarily a bad thing) and the community is great for the most part. gameplay is fast paced and smooth and while the story is lacking, remember it is in beta (although in my opinion the little story it has is all it needs). overall, warframe a great co-op game that people of any skill level can pick up and enjoy.",4
"i would reccomend this game to anyone. the mechanics are fresh for a shooter and the customization is insane. however remember that the game is still in beta and there will be intermitant issues. other than that enjoy!",4
"alien ninjas in space im sold! huge level of customization from outfit to sentinel upgrades and weopon customization only a few games have matched in depth of character and required time to make a truly dangerouse warframe alerts and bonus mission every 30 mins sign on bonuses everything you can buy in game you can earn and build in game for free with time and effort",4
"i am normally skeptical about f2ps. they tend to deliberately misinform or inflate their attributes in order to rob people of their cash bit by bit. well, let me tell you that the big difference between warframe and all the rest (perhaps, excluding dota), is that it doesnt hurt to give digital extremes money: the game is actually good. first, it has the production values of a aaa title. that being said, it looks and sounds beautifully, while having randomly generated levels and a incredibly robust leveling and upgrading system that has nothing to envy to most rpgs. everything in the game is craftable one way or another, and the things that are not are, either cosmetic, or stupid cheap. the grind is present, but almost unnoticeable if youre savvy about where you farm. also, the sheer variety of warframes means its guaranteed youll find a frame that suits your style. like stealth? play ash. like hard hitting? try rhino. like to blow everyone apart? give nova a whirl. everything is there to be crafted, no strings attached. a fantastic game to play with friends or alone.",5
"is a fun coop game, that blends survival with teamwork. i suggest checking it out, its pretty fun!",1
"really makes you appreciate what a repetitive grind being a space ninja actually is.",3
"sweet game. you need a bit of platinum to get started though. 8/10",2
"im not a huge fan of fps games - that being said i really like this game. ive been giving it a go for a few days now... there is a lot more to it than youre average shooter. if youre like me and you play fps games for the campaign, you like stratagy games, you want some mission based co-op action and love lots of upgrades, give it a go. i think youll enjoy it",1
"warframe is one of the best games i have ever played, there is a uniqeness about everything you do and all the different mods, colors, weapons, and warframes really make it feel like your characters are your own. every time you play you look at your teamates and see what warframe they are and are able to fit in nicely with one another to really take down enemies and more importantly, just plain have fun. plus warframe is basically futuristic ninjas with guns, how could you go wrong",6
"in my opinion it is , unique style and even in the begining its incredible co op based and its kept me interested in it from the co op always needed in the begining but considering its free its a great deal for the gameplay and uniqueness ( lots of repeating i know but its incredible for itself it got over a million in the last 8 weeks making it 3 million players and counting fast) if you ask me its worth it",1
"this game ate up my week off like it was nothing, tread lightly or it will  you up.",1
"i play this game on almost everyday and i love it i can never get enough of it all the content to play with and build it incredible and the weapon configuration is always interesting changing it to different playstyles and chosing what to take where so you can do you best on a mission but with all the positives this game has it does have its downsides one of them being that it can get really repedetive grinding and farming for resources can be annoying but if you can get past that warframe will be a very fun and time consuming free to play game i highly reccomend it with friends and my one tip is to not waste your platinum (real money) on scarfes or immortal skins just use them on catalysts and reactors to make your weapons and warframes stronger.",8
"great game, single player or multi. the mission-based design makes it ideal for a quick action fix and the content allows for a stealth or run and gun style of play. some complexity keeps it engaging and the combat is simple and crisp.",1
"the game is pretty fun. i havent played it much but so far i like the story and gameplay :3",1
"you get to be a space ninja with superpowers.....enough said.",2
"if you have a computer that can handle this game its great but is not accessable for the average computer",1
"what can i say your a freakn space ninja with a dog that has elf ears and a bat nose. it is one of the best free to play games with microtransactions in it imo they implemented it in such a way where you absolutely do not need to buy anything with real money. the trading system needs to be in more games also the way you rank up through the mastery ranks, it makes you use everything until its fully leveled, not just get it and you dont like it so you sell it . gg 8/10 would play again",5
"such a legend game! space ninjas! and parkour! woop!",7
"good game for play 100 hours max. then it is getting boring",2
"i love fast paced action games, but never liked shooters. im more comfortable with melee combat. but with this game its a mixture of both melee and guns. the combat is so smooth and fluid i actually liked pulling out my hand gun and shoot a few grineers while wall running, sliding across the floor past a horde, or in mid-air after a high leap. this is by far my most favorite action game that i can just hop into and go ninja... with a gun.",1
"really fun while i was able to play it...played for 2 hours but now whenever i play for more than 10 minutes it always says evolution engine has stopped working.hopefully they are able to fix this problem cause it seems like alot of people have this problem too",1
"this game seems fun but i cant get it yet because my graphics card doesnt meet the requirments..",1
"teno or whatever basically means space ninjas. its dark souls for even bigger nerds.",1
"fantastic game! i love everything about this game from the brilliant rank progression system to the wonderful art direction.",1
"great game got stuck while looking at a weapon 10/10",1
"as a free game, warframe is a pleasant surprise. it offers dynamic gameplay is a fairly complete title and also fun if played with friends. it has some areas for improvement, such as control, which suffers from sometimes-vague, design scenarios and enemies which comes to be very repetitivo-, or fun to play alone offers something that causes it to lose much of its appeal-but those looking for a set of cooperative action and have no problems with free-to-play should give it a try.",1
"this game is simply mind-blowingly -twisting boob-clinching eye-gouging salad-raper pedo-bear mango-juices amazing",1
"a great game. it has a good free to play model as you can access everything without paying a dime. obviously it will have barriers such as waiting for items to be built and limited inventory space for your weapons and different warframes, but what would you expect from a free to play game? at least it isnt shoving necessary items out of your reach behind a pay wall. each item can be obtained in game. you just need patience, oh but dont over due it with the game, blaze through it and you will get bored of it just like with many games.",6
"this game is quite enjoyable. go gets friends thou",1
"spent all my hours played trying to get volt with my friends in a faction we spent all our rescources trying to research and then its made free for new accounts but still i dont regret playing it i mean cmon your a futuristic space ninja with abilities that let you take on armies",1
"omg i love ninjas to the warframe and i just have ps4. i have ps4 warframe game and its awsome free to play game. if someone make more cool free to play game i will get some games.",1
"this game its amazing. this game have a grate story and grate mobelity and grate grafics",1
"whats the best time to play warframe? tennoclock",1
"really fun have not had this much fun since gears of war on a 3rd person shooter.",2
"v much techno ninja yes yes v space ship much unts vvvvvvv pew pew",1
"great graphics and a fun co-op experience attempt to make up for a terrible ai system and repetetive gameplay and maps. controls work well, yet there isnt many combat options. this game would be definitly recommended for anyone who is broke, has a bunch of friends, and some time to kill. 6.8/10",1
"the game is good but its ing  for me why the game crashes when i attack or left click it just straight away crashes last time i played it about last year it doesnt crash thanks to the new update the game just got a pain in the .",1
"i have to say before warframe i have had a bad experience of games in beta and was hesitant to get it.however so far the game has run very smoothly and i have had a great time fighting with other players.considering that its free theres no reason you shouldnt have this in your library",1
"amazingly awesome! deadly space ninjas. nough said.",2
"plenty of different warfames, weapons and missions to choose from. no real story but who needs story when you can shoot, slash, whip, kick, punch or have a bat-doggy chew your foes to pieces! my advice is to dive in, play for a while and enjoy the graphics and customization.",4
"hella entertaining, such a departure from the traditional mmo pvp weve all gotten used to. the devs really communicate with players and continue to innovate upon already solid gameplay.",1
"a+++ stunning graphics, smooth combat and intuitive gameplay. taylor recommends.",1
"the game is ing awesome..!!! specially i like the graphics ..",1
"this game is a money grab and a pretty bad one at that. if you want anything other than the basic weapons, it requires tons of grinding, a blueprint you can buy, and a very long wait period to build it. or you can spend a lot of money in the microtransaction store to skip all the work. enemies dont really serve much of a purpose other than infinitely spawning brick walls to hinder progress, unless theyre the main objective. if youre fast enough, you dont have to fight any of them. the free-running just seems to be a gimmick, as its very limited and buggy. teamwork isnt encouraged because it just seems to be a mad dash to the objective then the evacuation point. not a lot of good points to this game other than how good it looks with such little requirements. unless you have lots of money and dont care about overpriced weapons/armor/equipment, stay away from this game.",1
"this is a good game i ever play is most like counter-strike but this game more fun . i hope the product of this game will make more update on weapon and more item and quest so those newbie can easyly learn how to play it",2
"warning: this game is slow at first, but it rewards the player with grinding. as long as you find a good clan, all will be well....",1
"i have to say this is the most fun i have had playing a game in a long time. it is hard to believe this is free? the combat system is so fluid and unique. if you want to have a good time and you dont have any money to spend, this is the thing for you. even if you have all the money in the world, this is a great game to play. it has great multiplayer interaction to include arenas and co-op play. i will say there is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to terminology among the community, but there are great resources on the forums and on the website to get you up to speed. hats off to the developers, well done.",1
"dont play it. youll be addicted because you can have a scythe and slash many infected and deviously decapitate plasma-shooting space d-bags.",1
"i really enjoy this game with its variety of weapons and characters. also like the trade feature and alert missions. a very addicting game for me. bonus logins are great too.",6
"very unique class system, allows you to pick and choose which skills and abilities you bring to the battlefield. options are extremely diverse- 30+ classes, primary, secondary, and melee weapons. the beginning might seem like a slow grind (little choice in weapons and classes until a significant amout of time has been played), but it opens up around 5-7 hours in.",1
"very very good if nigas were in space this is what you would get!! :d (just dontt be a enmy)",1
"if you love ninja, then you should try out this game",2
"warframe is, in my opinion, a great game with a lot of potential for the future. this potential is strengthend by the fact that is now available on xbox one, ps4, and pc. is it perfect? no. it has a ways to go but i believe that it can become a truly great game.",2
"this game is super fun but i wish it was for mac and linux but what ever this game was awesome... while i could play the story",1
"this game is very awsoame i like it its pretty good its good to be a ninja in this game and after update it was amizing to play.",1
"even despite the small problems this game has it is very addicting slaughtering enemies and leveling up your warframes and weapons, and this game is only just growing i feel there is a lot of promise here",5
"great game, reminds me of a space type of call of duty, but different, i totally recommend this for gamers who love shooting games.",1
"pretty badass and loads of fun if you got loads of time and money to buy in game currency but pretty good for a beta and a f2p but really grindy. the graphics and gameplay is nice a real good sci fi kinda 3rd person shooter action rpg game nice with friends and lots of missions but kinda repetitive.",1
"warframe is a very specialized game, focused on action, flare, and fun. and boy oh boy does warframe nail action and fun. with over a dozen unique warframes(powersuits used by the player, each with their own unique abilities and stats) to choose from youre sure to find one that you really enjoy .",4
"i havent played this game fully yet, distracted by shogun 2, but the times that i have played it, its has impresed me with the styl the design and the good ai from the apponents in the game it self. very well crafted carackters, game and design lay out. i like the free wepoan give away to selabrate the first year that this has been going for. for thous who are knew to this you must try it, you dont have to spend money to play but it does speed up your carackter development witch makes you a more powerful fow for the enemy.just used my dex furis today ! 22 apr, just going over some old sections to get more combat experianc, what a weapon !!!!! good for closee quarter contact, just what you need in a tight place like a corridor or a room. the lay down of fire is phernominal, it sure get`s through the bullets !. the mag`s just dont hold enouph bullets, you have to watch the bullet count, or you could find your self in a place that you might not be abel to get youself out of. the sound effects of the gun, its just write and the effects of the action when its under fire just oresome. you can take out a cluster of the grenner solder or any of the other apponantes, they have to be generaly close to each other, found this out by accident. havent tryed it al long rang will leave that to my trusty mk-1 braton.",6
"awesome game, althought it may take some time to get all the good bits from it , still its really fun with shooting, using teamwork and being strategic! 8/10-only minus is for the $@ hosts sometimes, make sure to host everything to get the most our of it!",5
"reduce your enemies to bloody chunks spiraling into the event horizon of a singularity you spawned. spend hours of your time dressing your characters in different colors and hats, then design, build, and decorate a dojo. after 300 hours lose interest and stop playing. come back months later to see the game updated and all previous problems solved. spend 300 more hours discovering new content and new ways to forcibly dismantle enemies. the best 3rd person shooter i have ever played. great support from developers. new content added constantly.",8
"i still cant believe this epic games is 100% free!",7
"pretty awsome game, great game.i am actually suprised that its f2p game. if you get it you wont be sorry for it.a must have game for every fps and tps gamer.",1
"its awesome, if you are looking for a epic 3rd person sci-fi shooter. this is it!",1
"nice game actually gfx pretty smooth and kinda original would prefer more of a pvp side too it but there is a great ammount of co-op missions and a lot of cosmetic customization. would recommend + its a f2p cant complain at that",1
"one of the best co-op games, after borderlands2 ofc :p",1
"this game can be lots of fun once you get past your initial warframe and have at least one orokin reactor and one orokin catalyst. it is free to play and anything can be made with a good clan dojo. you are a space ninja fighting in our solar system against the corpus the grineer and the infestation (much like the flood in halo). you have shields armor weapons and modifications to outfit yourself and goto town on the maps. good gear comes from the doing void missions and orokin derelict missions.",2
"completely unique and incredibly addictive, nothing else like it out there.",1
"great game for f2p lovers. even though theres not much strategy in this game, but still it provides great team coordination and communication between the 4 players. a bit expensive to purchase platinum and materials to find are harder than expected for those blueprints. but thats where the challenge comes in. ciao.",1
"fun game, seems to improve every month or so.. still has some bugs but thats to be expected. would def recommend this game.",8
"great graphics and sound. seemed incredibly dull in the beginning, but after discovering how powerful and interesting the mod system is, i was hooked. the game is very repetitive and some items require considerable grind, but its definately a good distraction if you have a friend or two to coop with.",1
"its on ps4 so..... i guess it did pretty well get it ps4 its on the console version naww games can honestly get boring and repetitve",1
"great game o_o you do not even need to pay any money... money = pritty... 10/10 graphics 10/10 game play 6.5/10 pvp 8.5/10 pve 10/10 team pvp 10/10 co-op 8/10 clan/guild/alliance in total... 63/70 get it now []_[]",2
"i have been with this game since it went into open beta so this review should be pretty accurate. when playing this game it is very easy to forget that it is still a beta. the third person co-op and high action missions make this feel like a finished product. however at times you will discover near game breaking glitches that sends your warrior into the vastness of space. these are not common by any means but they will happen. this is also one of the only free to play games that allow you to get almost every item for free as long as you dont mind grinding. in the end, warframe is a great game that is always changing and if you want a free to play game that has a lot to offer, you should give it a try.",6
"warframe is a good game. its easier to play warframe with other people than play the game by yourself.",9
"its a game based around getting drops in the way that diablo ii is, but this game mixes in the best movement since unreal 2k4. super fun to just run around the environment, and a great game for mindless fun. not much of an end game, but thats what you get with loot-based action games.",2
"a huge amount of missions and bosses. an arsenal fit for a warlord. very good game adventures its even more fun with friends!",1
"very good game for a f2p. some minor glitches, but mostly itll run fine. this isnt really pay to win but it is pay to get-things-istantly-instead-of-over-3-days.",2
"this game is just amaizing and free i really recomend it as a fun game to play for a long time",10
"a fairly steep learning curve with a robust leveling, item upgrade, and modification system. however, once a few hours are invested and you either have someone helping explain things to you or youre using the wikia page to research the game on your own, the game becomes incredibly addicting. third person shooter mixed with fast-paced melee combat, all with fully customizable warframes, weapons, and sentinels (flying robotic followers) is definitely a huge thumbs up.",2
"suprisingly good game, wont go too into depth but every level is unique due to the tilesets so it makes for some interesting not super repetitive gameplay. tons of content, probably worth a few months of gaming.",1
"a lot of fun so far and looks like it will be that way for awhile. just wish it was a little more user freindly for noobs like me.",1
"great online community and many hours of fun! best mmo i have played because its co-op (a.k.a. pve) not pvp.",1
"i do love this game a lot but be warned, the crafting of guns weapons suits etc, takes a very long time there is a lot in this game to be fair and it can be a lot of fun, i love it personally. yet the in game real world purchases of platinum is way over priced the lowest which is i think 3.99 only gets you 70 plat and the average price of a new warframe is between 250-300 plat and they go up to 375 plat so yeh i dont really wanna be paying all that money for one character that i can make but if you deal with having to wait a long time to earn new gear then this is definately a game you should download. also you can make your own clan dojo and build new rooms with research labs in and build decor around the rooms but this takes resources in game to do and myself and my clan mate have only recently got into this but it is a really nice touch to the game.",1
"ok for the first few play-throughs, but it gets repetitive kinda of quick.",3
"beatiful game love the weapons and creation and the design of the game itself it has more than this to come and i wish to see a never ending game that proves it is the best 10/10 c======{}::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::>",1
"this is the game weve all been waiting for! join, its free!",5
"imagine a battlefeild in germany during the second world war. you and 200 other people are fighting the nazi regime in the age old strategies of war. now, forget everything about that because youre a ninja in spaaaaaaaace!!! along side of 1-8 of your closest tenno friends you help rid the solar system of factions of homocidal cyborgs and infested warrioirs. restore balance to the galaxy with stealth, oh and lots of shooting. now go you have a mission to complete! 11.5 out of 10.",2
"very amazing, love the guys working on it! one of the best games iv ever played, but you need to play it right, take your time...look around, it really is a beautiful game, and a great story. a story you create",5
"it kept glitching out on me, and i would fall through the floor. other than that, it looks great, albeit a bit confusing",1
"best free-to-play game ive personally ever played. nearly everything in-game can be earned without jumping through 30 flaming hoops or microtransactions. the dev team does a great job of keeping the game fresh with constant updates, and is very passionate about their game (unlike the swine that abandoned tribes: ascend to make a f*%#ing moba). ive been playing the game since the closed beta last year, and havent thought to put it down since. 9.6/10",2
"this game is amazing, i can barely run it on my computer but i love it to pieces, if you have a gaming laptop or pc, get this game!",1
"awesome game love to play it i just wish i had someone to play with so please download and try it if you like it send a message and we can play",1
"this is an absolutely great game! the part that makes it better is that it is free! this game is basically about space ninjas. you are a tenno and you must help the solar system. during the process you can also upgrade your equipment to make you the ultimate tenno. it also features four player coop which is extremely fun with friends.",6
"i love warframe ive logged more hours than i care to mention (wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy more than i should) excellent graphics and epic options.",6
"game kicks  it is a multi player version of mass effect 3 love it",1
"3rd person sci-fi action rpg shooter with parkour ninja moves, tons of weapons, and a development team who is very active and listens to the commnity. definitely recommended!",9
"lens flares, aliens, futuristic technology... enough said",1
"free! and fun. a fast paced action, wanton destruction and did i mention fun?",1
"great game, good graphics for a free to play, lots of depth if you want to get into it.",1
"loved ir , im not a big fan of this type of games but this one blew my mind ! fast paced heath beating adrenaline boosting tps. recommended a lot",1
"beautiful. best graphics and never lags. reccomended for anyone how likes sci-fi.",1
"this is an amazing game 4/5 the only reason i dont like it is that u need to dedicate to it and in the beginning ur weapons suck [if u choose the wrong one] the game has a story but its not a very good one. though the gamplay makes up for that you can do pretty epic parkour and if u want more of an hack and slash instead of a third person shooter just dequip ur primary and secondary. the game may look like a complete charm at first but evantuly u realize its just farming enemies until u get better stuff leading to boredom after a long period of time. [also if u get it i dont really reccomend a kubrow if ur not extremely dedicated cuz he will die if u dont care for him. pros: epic gameplay and u can play with ur friends as much as u want. cons: bad story, wait times for items and constant farming. its a fun game with addictive attributes and i do reccomend it if u like rapidly killing enemies with a bladegun] pros: epic gameplay and u can play with ur friends as much as u want. cons: bad story, wait times for items and constant farming. its a fun game with addictive attributes and i do reccomend it if u like rapidly killing enemies with a bladegun]warframe powers",1
"this is one of the better hack and slash games that i have played. i definately like the storyline in it, although its too much action; i wish that the developers would make a more distinct storyline and have more cutscenes. im not asking them to change anything (thats rude.) im just saying what i see potential for in this game",1
"i love the fact i can run around with just my melee weapon",1
"its a good fps you can play by yourself or with friends.",2
"total addiction for me i love this game but i will be taking a break whrn destiny comes out on september 9th 2014",1
"really good game. im not a very experienced gamer and i found this game challenging yet playable. as slightly confusing to start with but once you get the hang of it its great.",1
"if you enjoy diablo and mass effect multiplayer. this game will blow your mind.",1
"ye, i tested it once again and its improved a lot. i wont mention what is the big plus of all that, because it is self explanatory and if you dont know, play the game! it sure is worthy, for now. hope they dont destroy it. old: played the closed beta, dont believe the trailers, the game itself isnt as great as they show it, though it is worth to play, especially with friends and alike. maps are boring tho, enemy ai is this games weak point.",1
"most of the time its great. gameplay fun, i love the theme. clan and alliances add to it. the downside it that, starting out your have a limited amount of slots for your warframes(your characters to play as) and weapons. it also experiences frequent bugs. most of the things wont bother you as you get platinum handouts now and then(platinum=the bought currency) and just one handout is usually enough to buy you enough slots for your warframes and weapons. it definitely is not a p2w game. youll enjoy this game a lot. that is when the bugs dont interfere. for me they arent extremely annoying yet, theyve only been rather minor. good game, fun, creative, 9/10",1
"a very good game for sci-fi fans out there. also very good for parkour fans.",4
"really a lot of grinding, but a lot of fun. hmu: foob ;-) *smooch*",8
"this game is awesome, played it a ton. although after 70-100 plus hours (yep) it can get pretty repitive. although, the team behind this game updates it frequently so it adds a bunch so you never really run out of stuff to farm for, but this game is farming. that is all it mostly consists of. so if you do not like farming and the occasional boss fight iwould reccomend but if you do enjoy that kind of thing like myself give it a shot :d",1
"great game over all amazing it requiers enviormental use and planing ahead love it",1
"for me this is one of yhe best games i ever play on a pc free to play",1
"a free game where you can be epic space ninjas reking other space things. 10/10.",1
"i honestly dont know how to rate this game. you grind to grind and the grinding isnt even the kind where an erection is expected. drop rates suck, players suck and trading in this game? id rather inject meth directly into my testicles and skewer my eyes on rusty thumbtacks. that being said; if you enjoy this game and how free! it is youll want to spend money on it, youll feel an actual need to, just to avoid spending 5 hours mindlessly copypasting a list of 20 or so mods you want to sell for half the price of what people usually ask. but you can go fast, there are lots of colours and latex body suits with some nice butts in them. i give it a 9/11",5
"such an awesome game but mostly need money to become stronge because most item need platinums to be purchased and thats a problem for player from diffrent country.",1
"i recommend, but with the caveat that it needs more work. the initial instructions on what to do are kind of shoddy, which leads you to be matched up with people who have absolutely no clue what the hell they are doing. 10 minutes later youre screaming at them to extract just so you can end the mission. i am pretty sure that after i get out of noob central i shall enjoy the  out of this game",1
"i simply love the game ! stunning graphics , great frame roster , lots of ablilities , teamwork means a lot ! a great variety of landscape, hi-tech maps to the ancient remainings of the earth, many kinds of mobs , lots of weapons : from the deadly close range shotgun to the 1-shot-kill sniper , to the ninja weapons : bow , crossbow , hikou (aka shuriken) , kunai ... many kinds of melee weapons : from the basic sword , to the double axe , the scythe , even throw disk (aka glaive). the mods you add to those weapons are simply terrifying! it takes a while to upgrade the weapons and get the mods , but the result is deadly (for the poor enemies that are forced by the ai to attack you... many get so scared that they get stuck just to prolong their short life spam , which is kind of annoying , mostly in survival and defense missions). simply put : marvellous ! i havent even begun to talk about the melee weapon stances - which give you formidable combos ! pack that with a bow , kunai / hikou and sets of mods at each of them and you are the perfect ninja assassin ! this game deserves 10/10 in my opinion , obviously there are many features i havent even mentioned , you should go find them out for yourself ! meet me in game : x3quan8",1
"i would recommend this game to anyone. it is always becoming better and you should be able to come back to it.",6
"as others put it so very well. ninjas...in space. this exciting fast paced shoot-em up run-and-gun styled, third person squad ( or solo and anywhere inbetween) parkcour simulator will leave you with your wrist stinging from playing several hours longer then you intended. and beileve me, if you get into this you will play it untill you drop. the hours ive spent in-game were well spent. doubley with friends. it can get grindy. espeically for good weapons and warframes ( new playable characters ) but the time spent normally passes quickly ( again with friends ) and the rewards are actually worth it. my reveiw is a doubled handed thumbs up. i found the game to be action packed and intense, albeit a tad glitchy at times. but thats where the funny, funked up magic happens ( fallout players will know what i mean ) but by far, the very best part of the game that i like, is the very thing the game advertises  ninjas play free. all weapons, warframes, mods, and as you play through a year customization options are all avalible for absolutly free. the option s there however to buy it, and get it without trying. but cmon now who has fun pushing the a button to win? so in conculsion. warframe is a ninja game. a free tp play. non-pay-to-win, ninjas flipping in space action packed splosion festivel anygamer can enjoy.",4
"you are a integalictic space ninja call a tenno that can block and deflect bullets best game ever 10/10 except that you have to wait real time to do things.",1
"if your the sort of person who doent need to validate their existence by being better than everyone else then this game is great. there are pvp arenas but noone cares about them and they dont give you anything special. the only other competition is to see who kills the most ai and again it makes no difference how much you contribute. the equipment you get given at the start is more than good enough to get you going, and if you dont want to spend money you dont have to, apart from appearance only items pretty much everything is makeable/findable without paying. dont want to play with other people? thats fine just turn solo mode on and be the lone wolf you wanna be. overall its a great co-op game with a lot of customization and lots of variety.",3
"science fiction. team shooter. squads. chat. tech. weapons. modifications. different warframes, controlled by you. upgrades. foundry. make warframes, weapons, gear. clans. with a clan dojo. active community. ai and dog-like companions. more mods. what are you still waiting for?",6
"space ninjas..... wtf dihs ihs awsum xd this has got to be one of the best games ive ever played! tha warframe classes have pleanty of diversity and their powers are badass. yes, some of the content is accesable thru real world money, but it is only required if you are not the pacient kind of person. all content can be earned in game but it takes forevah. yime to unleash my inner dragon...",3
"this game is fun to play by yourself or with your friends! if you like alien shooter games then this might be the game for you. :d",1
"this game is super! theres nothing like running and gunning with a little ninja action. teamwork is a must, so you have to band together and use your warframes abilities tactically.",1
"you can play as a space ninja-samurai who stabs people in space. 11/10 wish it was an organic creature so i could birth its children",1
"for a game that is still nominally in beta, i have had ridiculous amounts of fun in warframe. squad-based 4-player mission instances across many amazing tilesets, with an incredible range of weapons and frames (exoskeletons) to use. multiple mission types, looting, crafting, mastery ranks, clan spacestations, clan conflicts, events, and more. the dev team is highly connected to the playerbase in a way i havent seen in other games. updates are normally weekly, hotfixes are rapid when theres an issue, and lets not forget the devstreams. who doesnt want to be a space ninja? whether you are bending the forces of magnetism, setting the world on fire or teleporting to every enemy in the room and backstabbing them all at once, i hope you enjoy your new addiction.",9
"this game is one the best free to play game over u have to get it because i say so and it good",1
"they update a lot..... but they fix bugs i didnt even know existed, yet they leave major bugs lingering in the game for way too long. 0/10 there incredibly pay-to-win but its damn fun.",4
"i recommend this for everyone who likes ninjas, yeah! ninjas in space! how cool is that? plus! free-to-play!",1
"this game is so good you dont want to stop playing and f2p... o mama!! 11/10",5
"fantastic gameplay and weapons, hope more stuff comes!",4
"i recommend this game bicause of the cool grafichs end the easy gameplay",1
"if you love third person shooters, or shooters in general, you will love this! even if it is still in beta i think, a great game and has a great future as well. i give a 10/10. a few bugs here and there, but i highly reccomend this game.",1
"one of the most impressive free-to-play games ive ever played. graphically impressive, with uniquely designed weapons, enemies, and characters. its a little light on story, unfortunately. also, unless you want to grind for hours for certain weapons and extra characters, be ready to fork over some real life money for some platinum (warframes premium currency).",1
"yeah...unless you want a game thats different the more you play it, its very fun in the begginning but only gets grauling hard and reptetive in the late game, personally i conquest for weapons and the like, but the replay value is hard to brag about. also, one of the resources is near impossible to get.",3
"this game is epic i really recommend you guys to check it out",1
"eight hundred and twenty five hours cant be wrong",8
"free to play in its purest form. you can get everything by playing. if there is something you cannot get by playing like more inventory slots for weapons or warframes, you can still get them by playing because you can farm items (recipies) that other players want and sell them for platinium (currency used for real money purchases). plenty of warframes (classes) to chose from and a crazy amount of weapons that are nicely balanced. you can build your character as you want. you can use primary + secondary + melee + abilities or only melee or only primary weapon or whatever you want. i have even seen a guy with no weapons, only relying on his ulti ability and energy regeneration. play as you want. dropkicks and frontflips everywhere!",5
"for an f2p game, warframe is unreal. it has great gameplay and if youre ever after a game that offers the opportunity to play in short bursts or sink some time into developing your profile.",5
"it is amazing! the concept of it and the graphics along with the fast paced action co-op and powers is awesome :d",1
"just addicting...you wont stop till after you hit a certain planet and then youll be like god, im a loser. then switch too dota 2 or league cause you have nothing better to do.",2
"interesting game if you have a passion for sci fi games but even without the passion for this kind of stuff i still belive its an excellent game and i will definitely recomand it to anyone that wants to have fun with friends or alone.",4
"i like the vibe game play and control, but i hate that i cant play this on my mac.",1
"i love this game i played it even on my old cunputer its a realy fun game you guys sould get it :d",1
"if you can handle the graphics, this game looks and feels amazing. the mechanics is well detailed and the trading system is great.",1
"great game - fun action, flexible builds, lots of weapons and warframes to choose from and customize. easy to get into missions and co-op is a nice change to typical fps multiplayer. bit grindy for some higher end modifications but overall minor complaint. devs also work hard to get useful upgrades on regular basis which is refreshing.",2
"this game is excellent for too many reasons. de is responsive and takes tons of player feedback when creating new content and it is absolutely wonderful. they recently incorporated tons of player designed weapons, however going beyond that the game itself is already amazing and only getting better and better. i have been playing for almost two years and am still not bored. there is always more that you can do in warframe. besides even if pve isnt for you the pvp is excellent and extremely challenging.",6
"this game has great graphics and awesome game all around. 10/10",1
"i recommend this this game, but it has to much stuff that costs money!",1
"space ninjas. what more needs to be said. a great game to play with friends. fun if you like grinding and farming. its a ftp that can legitimately be free.",6
"absolutly love this game! it just keeps growing with new content and fun. loving mele 3.0 and the clan wars thing. fantastic",2
"this game is pretty cool! the biggest point why you want to try is that its a free-to-play game. comparing to many other pay-games, this game is way better with good graphic interface. its fun with more friends because its a shooting game.",1
"its a space ninja sci-fi shooter runngun slash em up f2p co-op adventure dungeon grinder! at least one these points must have gotten u excited :p",2
"by god. more than a year strong and this game never fails to impress me.10/10.",2
"excellent game, many hours have been put into this game, and intend to play many more hours more on top of them as the game progresses and gets much better.",4
"i play a warframe that destroys enemy bodies by crushing every single one of their bones. 10/10",7
"great game and great graphics! this is such a good game!",1
"i enjoy collecting and upgrading, this game fits me, however, i dislike how somethings are removed like weapons (boar (normal) snipetron, and now stat helmets). however, everything else i enjoy greatly.",9
"this truly is the best game i ever played. its a third-person shooter and very fun, because its not killing other people instead you kill a.i. in different levels and missions. the co-op oriented gameplay is very appealing to me and has many benefits to it, than the traditional pvp games. if you like something different and unique, i would recommend this game to these who do. this is a 10 out of 10 for me.",1
"this game is amazing and challenging. for those who want a battle this game has it all!",5
"fantastic. if you have a bad gaming computer, you can run this at 30 frames easily. thats what call of duty is at, and that game isnt bad frames wise.",1
"so addicting and one of the best games ive ever played :d (and one of the games im really good at xd) 5 star",1
"ill break it down for ya. a. this game looks sexy. peirod b. you play a cyber space ninja... thing. c. its f#ckin free d. a+ game design, sound, and writing. e. its f#ckin free!!!! so if your comp. doesnt explode on install, give it a shot its pretty awsome. mallers rating: $-$-$-$-$-$-$ 7/10 maybe a 8 if you like grafics more than solid gameplay foot notes: - not open world, quest based gameplay -multiplayer usaly 4 players permisson -lots of customisation -updated twice since i started playing 2-3 weeks ago ( not bad for free to play) -mic enabled but not commanly used -best played with a controler ive read 360 and ps3 work the best (wall running and other crazy  moves you can pull off are tough with a keyboard) -this game will work your grafics card over like a red headed stepchild unless you turn down the settings... or if your rich enough to buy a beast one, which i am not :( -join or make a clan, makes the game better + you get a dojo son,",1
"i love this game its fun when you play it with your friends",1
"this is surprisingly good -pros ninjas lots of content spaace -cons cant fly that  spaceship cant customize that  spaceship platinum is too  expensive.",1
"why wouldnt you enjoy being a space ninja with guns that can slide in awesome ing poses?",1
"game has many different routes of playing. worth spending time on",2
"i like this game. its like halo squad mission but faster run speed, melee stances are so fun, and trading platinum makes players like us be able to spend money early and earn plats later without spending money, and gets stronger and stronger with the mod upgrading system. try it if you like fast paced first shooting games-ninja style.",2
"its a good game if u like coop gamemodes or good grapics but it would be much better as a mmo",1
"a lot of fun, good grapics and your over powered from the get go. awesome.",1
"an extremely addicting game to jump into at first. it makes you feel like a badass ninja who can jump around and well, be awesome. the thing i have against it is that it takes a long time to actually get decent weapons and swords to fight with. and at first you really feel jealous of how other people who have much more amazing stuff and who are more powerful are way better than you. its pretty much just grinding and showing off. theres a few glitches here and there but you must keep in mind that the game is in beta. it has great potential and at the moment is amazing. overall great game.",2
"i love this game. cant get enough of it. i have lost quite a lot of sleep playing this game. its got guns, explosions, nice graphics, excellent physics, space ninjas and lots of fun. its also extremely well balanced and the community is always willing to help. i never felt like the missions were too easy. while it can be a lot to take in at first, you can easily get the hang of the mechanics and be a warframe pro in no time. in sum, its a fun game and can be very addicting. if you dont believe me read what others have to say or try it out yourself. after all, its free.",3
"jesus, for something thats free to play, pretty friggin good! sure its a p2w, but hot damn is it fun!",1
"you can even run it with geforce 210 on highest with 20-30+ fps",1
"warframe is basically a game where space ninjas are assigned missions to different places on the planet; whether it is to destroy reactors, capture a high value target, defend a cryopod, or assassinate someone of importance. warframe has many different aspects to it, including creating a clan dojo of your own; living a code of honor that you see fit. in essence, you can create any weapon that you find the blueprints for, and about 85% of the items in the game can be found while going through the missions on each planet.. is warframe worth the download? if you enjoy stealthing or running through killing any and everything in sight, creating weapons, doing parkour..then yes. by all means, download warframe and give it a try.",7
"this game actually is very cool. the graphics of this game are just unbelievable! i would recommend thsi game to everyone who likes shooting and enjoying good graphics.",1
"absolutely amazing havent played a game this good in ages",1
"this game is pretty good. it needs some work, but its free to play so its definetly worth playing. i like the co-op game play, but a few things to fix: -sometimes the achievements dont work -personally, i think the melee button is in a bad place -make the waypoints less confusing",1
"a great game to play if you want a relatively cruisey third person shooter. unfortunately, higher levels tend to lots of grinding/farming, but plenty of content before that plateau is reached.",8
"in warframe, you get to collect mods for your warriors, and this upgrades their skills. you also get to customize your player/warrior. the gameplay is very simple and user-friendly, and you get to play solo or with others to complete missions. you even get to have an epic storyline along with it. it is worth your time to try out!!",1
"if u want a good games where u can shoot things and have a nice campaign while eating beef jerkey, get some other thing but this one is freeee!!!",1
"play as parkour space ninjas 12/10 would shoot cameras again",1
"great game to explore new ways of gaming while being a bad  ninja",7
"its an fantastic game, where we can pick up a lot of characters and i like the styles of warframe, and the graphics i like very much this game",2
"this is one of the best third-person shooters out there and i recommend it! :d",1
"i shouldve reviewed this a long time ago but i forgot okay guys! anyway... addicting. very addicting. everything on the table. graphics are great, though style is a little dark/moody and might not be for everyone. gameplay. is. amazing. the mechanics work so well in sync to bring an enjoyable experience of kicken royally kicken  (until end game that is). youre a space ninja that can run on walls while pinning someone to a lamp post with space bow, or annihilating swarms of enemies with a grenade launcher while soaring through the air menacingly. the special ninja movement skills like wall running and sliding all trigger really smoothly (some more then others but whatevs :p), and the community is really great for a current f2p. the team stays really active within it, for instance prime time, their weekly thursday night live stream talking about current happenings. honestly i totally support the community. theres also a decent amount of gear customization with their modding system. oh also for an f2p its not even pay to win because all of the best gear isnt even available for the real money currency, platinum. however i will say sometimes it feels like theres a little too much farming. also ive spent too much money on this for a f2p title. just saying its fun and addictive. so go play it why are you still reading this rediculous review!",3
"so grindy not even tony hawk can pull off a rail like that. 4/10",2
"it was fun at first but since i didnt want to pay money it got way to hard",1
"i dislike the fact the a hacker fired my 8 all most nine hondered dollor labtop and i had to get a new 1 other then the fact i wish i could find out hum did it the games prity good i reckon",2
"fun, doesnt require you to buy currency, and has many events. downsides: grind heavy, some guns are seriously outdated.",4
"fun tps until you realize that youll be stuck grinding for materials.",1
"10/10 best free to play i have played the awesome stealth kills and the intense combat make it more awesome",1
"this game is beautifuly made. although difficult at first, after a few hours you get the hang of it and the game becomes ver rewarding. only one problem with this game. the ammount of platinum you get for your money i believe is not enough. 10.00 gets you around about 150 platinum and for a new warframe its around about 250-600. other than that, this game is very well made and has amazing graphics for a ftp game. highly addictive and fun to play!",2
"game modes from assasination to defense, offline and online, not to mention tons of power up cards to enchance your arsenal, a worthy game to spend my time on. though its not the best, but definitely in my approved list.",6
"really fun game, its a nice game to play with your friends and its good to play with other people. i love how nothing in the store is over priced and everything you get in-game is faatastic. epic game.",1
"mixing parkour and third-person shooters, this game is one my all time favourite mmos and i recommend this to anyone looking for some incredibly good action.",2
"stop reading this and download warframe right now!",8
"its a very good game i like playing it and its fun very fun",1
"is game where u run on wall den jump of said wall and land on big bad booger man and staybe him in his booty with ur swoord. if that boats ur float, den mebe u pley dis game u kno?",1
"pretty fun game for a f2p game. well designed and tons of action. recommended.",1
"i loved this game look at my f#king hours! but in all seriousness its pretty damn awesome excluding the slight repetitiveness but you can oversee that while youre hacking and slashing or if youre a normal person shooting is good too. not to mention the game is not a p2w you can get everything excluding cosmetic and slots but that shouldnt stop you go download this game right now.",6
"warframe is an excellent example of what a free to play game should be. its not pay to win, though if you find you dont have time to play and grind for what you want just pay with cash. there wont be any cash only items, so for those who dont have the money or prefer to earn it youll be right at home. this sci-fi third person shooter is a great game for anyone to have in their steam library. though this game is 100% more enjoyable with friends rather than playing solo. so stop reading and go embark on your quest in space new fellow tenno!",1
"very fun and action packed, can be a bit repetative at times but still very fun. if you love action and or sci-fi you will love warframe.",1
"farm. farm. farm. 630+ hours in and im still farmin",8
"this is a great game. i would highly recommend it to others!",1
"great game! but... the price for things are little to high!",1
"good co-op experience! , new content almost all the time, time consuming in a good way ! paying will only make you look good, no stat or damage increase in any way ! everything can be unlocked without paying ! well some stuff are for people who have played for a long time. overall, its fun to play, but more fun to play with friends ! ( and girlfriends / boyfriends )",8
"holy space ninjas, this game is pretty great to say the least. you always seem to be in a firefight, plus you get to customize your weapons with mods to make them all powerful. overall, great game i recommend playing this! :)",3
"great game! although many a times dont find groups :( but awesome fun!",1
"this game is really cool and has the most innovating controls ive seen in a while",1
"it is a pretty good game. for a while. i put over 700 hours into the game and for the first while its fun. 700 hours later and the game kinda lost its touch. it has plenty of weapon and warframe options and stuff, but i feel that the missions are all boring now no matter what i do. most of the game follows the same formula: >select warframe >select weapons >select one of the missions youve done 100000 times >complete objective the most exciting thing to do is build a new weapon and warframe but that joy only lasts about five minutes. i still dont have all the weapons but i dont plan on getting them because i find it really boring and unplayable now. i recommend it for the first while but dont expect to keep playing it after youve done every mission.",7
"sliced a guy in half then chopped his head and arms off 100/10",1
"its reaptitive but the point of the game is to unlock new stuff like charcters,weapons,ect.then you hve to rank up and unlock planets by beating the main objectives of the other planets amd so on and there are still the updates which and new stuff so yah practiccally endless",1
"pretty sweet, but pretty complicated as well. tutorial is a great addition. the game is much better if you have a friend or two to play with.",3
"dosnt let me play when i go on to the game is says udates failed all the time can someone help :d",1
"i have played this game on ps4. and i have to say on pc it just feels odd and the controls are not smooth this game is very fun on console and i truly recommend it to anyone who is willing to sacrifice frames and controls for fun",1
"warframe is very repetitive, but what you will repeat wont just be the same mobs, or that familiar looking map, what you will also repeat is having fun with the awesome combat mechanics of this game, and slashing everything that stands in your way with your melee weapon, or shooting them with your guns. 10/10 its okay - ign",2
"this shouldnt be free but its great and it should cost money its great to get when first starting off your steam account",2
"would recomend thid to anyone looking for a fast thrilling shooter and is really brilliant for anyone who enjoys third person shooter games :3",1
"this game is very under rated. try it out its free.",2
"free to play, many hours to put in, and a wide variety of ways to play. plus, it is updated regularly which is always brining in more content, giving it even more hours to put in. theres an unfortunate lack of story, but if you dont care for story, that wont matter you anyway. there are microtransactions, but you can get the platinum (the mcirotransaction currency) from other players by trading them items in the game, so essentially, you can work for it or just pay for it.",1
"i play this game a lot and its awesome i use the bow a lot",1
"played for a while , no issues , what is there not to like xd?",1
"very cool game create new items warframes good graphics good animations love it all",2
"the game is a free to play, not pay to win. at least give it a shot",2
"game is awesome, crafting, playing powers. i recommend this game! ninjas play free!!",2
"fantastic gameplay i must admit it. but i dont like the pay-to-win sistem.",1
"okay lets be honest here. warframe is an excellent free to play game. the graphics are beautiful, gameplay is phenomenal, and the weapons/items differ from those that you would see in other free to play mmos. this is absolutely a must play for gamers who arent looking to pay $40 or $50 on one game",1
"new content every week (almost). third person shooter unlike any ive ever seen. want to reach the top without spending a single cent? definitely possible. beware the rngods, though.",4
"its like a futuristic diablo and borderlands 2 made a third person crack baby",2
"i wish it would work so i could play it!! :/ tried restarting computer, reinstalling, etc. i watched my brother play and was excited to play also.....but now :(",1
"i really enjoy the warframes unique and stealthy mechanics, the many ways you can kill an opponent, the various and unique weapons one could use especially the games mod system. this game starts slow but once you reach a certain level any playstyle will be playable by any player thus there is no one playstyle a player should follow, thus i praise this game for that very aspect. i dislike the fact that most warframes are press to win warframes and would like to see warframes with more mobility based abilities like ninjas would. i give this game a 9/10",8
"great and ever changing gameplay. i have spent over 400 hours on this game and i love it. the weapons are great and different and the suits are amazing. hit me up ingame!",2
"great co-op game with above average graphics. this is not pay to win. very fun for f2p",1
"one of the best and most entertaining games ive ever played. very recommended",1
"currently this is my favorite game! extremely good. i love warframe!",4
"looks amazing ingame and the new update has made it even better!",1
"it cool you can have a kubrow pet wich is kinda like a mutant dog + robot flying pet and some other charater with new skills so play it out it amazing",3
"this game is crazy as  and very addictive :d,dont play it if you dont have hours and hours of your life to ,,waste on it :d",1
"i love this game, the interface is fun and not too complicated, the game itself keeps me entertained for a long while and when you actually come across other fun players, its even better!",1
"its fun for a time then you get bored(best thing to do when you are board is just stop playing and wait for an update) you eventually come back to the game though",5
"its a nice instanced, co-op shooter. be sure to read the wiki as there isnt alot of explaination about some useful stuff.",1
"very good game i would play it for countless hours if real life didnt barge in.",1
"warning!!!if you download this game you will never see the sunlight again!",1
"digital extreames. you might know the name looking on the back of the startrek game of 2013. they did awful on that, so this has to be the same right? if you think that warframe is the same as startrek, please, download this game to see how wrong you are. startrek had some hype to it. it looked good, but playing was not the same. warframe didnt have much hype when i first downloaded it. it looked too good for my computer, and so after turning down the graphical settings, i finally got to experiance this bliss. im not going to drag on with this one like i do most of my reviews. itll be as quick as it did to make me fall in love with this game. so graphics, ive never seen anything more beautiful. controls are tight, resposive, and swift. map design is ingenious, with corridors and platforms, different goals for ships, and loot a-plenty. pay to win aspect is pretty much not there. its more of you can earn this item but its also avalable for purchase, making handing over money an option rather then a task. the bouncy shoot-n-slash combat is mindblowing, sounds are the best ive heard ever, and over all warframe is something you should download right now. im not one for the whole rating system, but i have to give this a 1010. it is amazing, and whoever is curious to download it, please get a better computer or a ps4 so you can experiance the tubular graphics while playing an off the hizzy game.",1
"if you like aliens and ninjas well this is a space ninja with gun blazing and a bunch of stabbing ! of course youll have fun and dont need to spend money at all cause everything can be made for free with or without friends. matter of fact who needs friends when you can solo this on your own and if you do! dont worry theyll bring people who dont talk to you and just to make things better ! they got infected fighting and trying to kill you and everyone else rated r for rad :d also dont listen to echodang his review sucks ;d",2
"cut ugly people in half, good message to the kids. 10/10 for kids.",1
"has a paying system but this game is so goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood.......sorry about that i just needed to write like that",1
"warframe only has room for improvement, while yes it is still in the beta phase of development, the community for this game and the way that the founders of the game react to what their players say is astronomically better than any video game i have ever heard of. its fluid graphics and wide range of cuztomizeable gameplay is well past what the games of today have to offer besides its mother ing space ninjas",4
"id recommend it assuming you have a party to work with, otherwise itll be tough soloing. platinum is really only worth spending on inventory space, that or on valuable mods youll need for your stuff. however, the market place does allow for trading of platinum, as other players have managed to earn a nice sum of it from just selling valuable stuff. at the same time, bugs abound, but the devs push fixes weekly if not every other day.",4
"the gameplay is pretty solid, if you are looking something flashy, you are not going to get it here.this is a game with a lot of customization,you make your weapon, your hero and you paint then, this is a massive multiplayer third-person shooter based, with a really large variation of weapons. there are a lot of levels (planets, and galaxies), and this is really enjoyable game, i highly recommend this game",1
"warframe...maybe one of the best free to play mmo/rpg/fps games ever. the advantages: updates every month with new weapons/items/warframes/mods variety on warframes and abillities / weapons you can built your own clan/dojo exchange possibilities within the dojo you have the abillity to change into melee fight conclaves/pvp many modes to co-op with players very nice graphics many planets to eplore everyone is equal ( platinm accounts-normal) the disatvantages: there are not many multiplayer modes to fight against other players there are still crashes and bugs",10
"ive played so many hours and reached level 8. now i changed to a faster isp and they wont let me play. this really sucks big ones. not sure what to do. ive spent money here and they wont let me change my email.",1
"a must play. with each patch it is quickly becoming one of the best 3rd person shooters in gaming today. thumbs up for this free to play model. thumbs up to the developers.",1
"one of the best games of all time play it i bet you could like it if not play a little bit and you might get into it i know its awesome cause i played it and im kinda a pro at it if aanything i bet 90% of people would agree with me",2
"overall a great game, although (lovingly) called bugframe by many, each update brings cool stuff...and how can anyone resist a game about space ninjas? plus, its free so you really dont have an argument not to get it.",3
"worth the time to try it out. for a free game, the battle system is not bad.",1
"at first glimpse warframe is an amazing fps experience. its fluid and highly customizable. the clan structure and method of pulling drops together motivates team play. one of the best fps games i have played to date.",1
"youre a space ninja wizard. youre probably evil. youre going to love the 300 different ways you can kill a man.",2
"slow on start up, but once you start to experience middle and late game content, it becomes incredibally addicting. devs are great and listen to the community and they add constant updates to fix small and large problems alike. 9/10",8
"warframe is a very unique sci-fi third person action shooter game. you play one of many different warframes each with their own unique abilities and looks. your main weapons consist of a primary weapon (usually a rifle) and a secondary weapon (usually a pistol). but you also have your sword in which has fast paced hack-n-slash action. mix all of these together with equally fast paced gameplay, satisfying loot drops, and deep weapon and skill leveling and you have one hell of a fun sci-fi game. this game is absolutely addicting. its so much fun, i would recommend this to everyone. free to play? cant beat that!",1
"i wish that this was on mac. creators make a mac version!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"technical warfare, abilities, custom guns oh my! great game.",1
"fun an addicting clans are very acitve get it an start playing but u will never get off",2
"this game is a load of fun, not to mention it takes time to progress through this game which i enjoy. the platnum is way to expensive in my oppinion. and the time you gotta wait to build stuff is insane...like i am talking about the lowest item i have built was like 6 hours for christ sakes. so to sum it up here pros: -lots of stuff to do -updates keep coming and making it better -easy to play -different ways to play cons: -plat is expensive -waiting time to build stuff too long -need a mid-high end computer spec in general great game and i hope they keep making it better by the month",1
"warframe is a very good game it has very nice tps so very recomended",1
"the game lags but has nice graphics best game ever 9/10",1
"amazing fourplayer co-op gameplay, this is, my favorite game. while some people (like my brother) call it stale and boring, there is plenty of action. those that say that it is repetitive are just so used to being dragged along by an all to evident and forced plot.",3
"one of best but weapon customisation needs it be something i know there are weapon card add on but im talking about physical changes to the weapon for example a sword can get a better grip increases speed and looks epic or aiming sights",1
"i would if it would let me download it so frustrating",1
"fast game play, ninja style but in space ship!! and even on planet in solar system. best free play for ninja!!",2
"im still kinda new to this game but i already love it. sliding around and choppin bad guys at the kneecaps makes this game feel like youre friggin unstoppable. gonna say it; this game is pretty much 3rd person halo but constantly having a sword plus being able to wall run all over the place. sadly, there are next to no practical scenarios where wall running is needed unless youre trying to rank up. stealth is almost never required and is impossible unless youre playing alone or with a closed group who knows what theyre doing. the environments are really detailed but feel really tight-packed with too many narow corridors and hallways, avoiding lock-on missiles this way is impossible. thusly, this game is all about killing everything in a given room as fast as possible before enemies can mobilze a propper offense. the enemy ai seems a bit... off... and can be really cheap at some times. i still have no idea how to use mods propperly and ive watched like 3 tutorials on youtube and ive read the codex. whatever, i still managed to do okay. my recomendation, play in a group and dont treat this game like halo. stay as evasive and fast as possible and youll do fine. let the higher leveled guys kill the bulk of badguys and stay as backup till youre leveled enough to get better gear and mods. fun as hell play it",2
"this game is just awesome! one of the best f2p multiplayer game i have ever played and i will recommend this to anyone. you don;t needd to spend any moeny to get items or weapons at all. just enjoy the game and chill out. i will rate this game an easy 10/10.",3
"warframe is fast paced co-op ninja-ish fun if your looking for a nice quick shooter warframe is your game the graphics are great the skill effects are a little clunky at places but nothing to damning. another aspect i have to mention is the card system which is how you upgrade your warframe im not a hardcore player so for me i dont go in depth in the upgrading and customization of these cards but for the serious stats junkies this system will keep you grinding for days. all in all this game is great and free to play. only real complaint is man is this game expensive when you do want to pitch in its like they dont want you to buy things when its literally easier to just grind for the items you want lol",1
"this is a brilliant game. it provides all of the trailer footage gameplay and offers way more as you progress. i personally find it shocking that it is a free-to-play as it has a: brilliant graphics, b: smooth gameplay, c: choice in character (the ability to be brutal or sneaky) and finally, it is a multiplayer game that can prove to be difficult. the combat system is very fluent and has a wide range of both melee and ranged weapons plus, you dont have to pay anything to keep up with other players. with the updates coming in every so often, it may soon prove itself to be a massive multiplayer. i think that the game has a better experience than some pay to play games. all round a very good game.",1
"for a free game its preety addicting once you know what your doing",2
"warframe a game where you never feel satisfied with where you are at an always wanna play more an more. at every turn of this game i felt intertwined with the world of warframe from the graphics to the amazing gameplay. its free to play an has a in game store which you need platinum for but if you find yourself playing for more than a year i believe you will buy some with real money. as the game stats in its title you play as warframes an you can craft every single one or you can buy them all but thatd cost you some hefty moola. it is very satisfying to make your warframe as you find yourself more inwraped in the game world as you make them. you feel accomplished after you spent the hours farming for the nessasary materials to make the things you need. an nearly everything in the game you can craft just cost credits which is what you can earn by just completing missions. from guns the swords this game hits the spot for action an if you like hack an slashing game or more gun approach then this game is for you. i found myself putting hours into this game an only wanna put more. ive made 4 warframes an bought 2 an i only wish to get more. they all add a different role to the game. if i did a review on this game id give it a 8/10!",2
"little repetitive, but love the huge customization possabilities, great weapons. love it.",4
"such a good game sure you have too wait 12 hrs to craft  but hey you can get any weapon for crafting aaannnyyyyy you can also craft warframes,sentiels, for the standard plat. oh and the combat hollyy  it is epic.",1
"i was a pirate that turned into a puddle... 10/10! but seriously this game is fantastic. the best free to play game that ive played and it has me playing and playing. this is a great game thats action packed, pakour ninja running, slicing enemys in half and so much more. it has tons of weapons and has warframes which are the things you controll that all have theyre unique abilitys (a pirate based frame is one of them). anyways i suggest that you get this game because it is amazing and endless fun",4
"great game with constant universe and content expansion, everything is accessible through simply playing, and space ninjas...",9
"casual enough for a quick run whenever theres time but with unexpected depth in terms of customization and crafting. pugging with strangers is perfectly feasible (other than with, say, payday2 where i consider voice comms essential). its definitely not pay2win as you get most items with credits earned by playing the game. only certain weapons seem to be real-money exclusive. as are slots for additional warframes, but the initial 50 platinum will buy you 2 free slots already, for a total of 4 warframes. pretty good package, gorgeous graphics and level design and immense amounts of fun. 10/10",2
"warframe reminds me of masseffect game which i addicted to :d",1
"its a fun actioner that you can play mindlessly if you want to blow off steam, but with plenty of crafing and levelling to keep me fiddling around! i definitely enjoy its co-op nature.",2
"its cyborg ninjas, in space! highly recommend. if youd be willing to help me out, please use my referral link!",2
"you get to be a sci-fi sword wielding agile jedi ninja..... its all my sexual fantasys at once + the game looks amazing",2
"its a realy good game.i play it whit my friend only one thing is anoying the maps are every time the same.",1
"this game is a blast, great dungeon crawler 1st person shooter style. ( update ) after many hours of play i had a lot of fun but that fun has ended and i moved along, besides releasing a new warframe to try out ( as updated content ) it became a borefest same maps same gameplay same mobs, in the end nothing is there to keep you playing very short lived. however i would recommend giving it a try it is free after all, ( just keep your wallet in your pocket you wont be here long )",5
"awesome canon sequel to the dark sector game and legacy of de.",4
"its a pretty good game i just didnt play it as much so it seemed boring",1
"amazing game with great effects. im glad theres more to do than just kill.",5
"i would highly recommend this to any fans of 3rd person shooters, you can be a fricken space ninja, whats not to love about that? its got a huge weapon variety with loads of different primary, secondary and melee selections to choose from, and the warframes are pretty unique as well, each warframe has a different playstyle, setting them all apart from eachother allowing you to play however you want to, and the co-op is fun to get into with your friends, and with strategic boss fights, you can have tons of fun, ive already invested alot of my time into this game, and i can say it does not disappoint. and they have alot of do with parkours, which i personally enjoy, and with lots of exclusive weapons only available through clan research that will require friends, its fun to get to know people in this game, and the games creators are always putting out alerts which are special missions that only show up from time to time and give you quite rare blueprints that are only available through alerts, such as rare weapons, warframe blueprints, character customization skins, or equipment to enhance your gear, and they are always interacting with their community, and they actually answer you when you ask for support! now isnt that rare for certain games nowadays? i would overall recommend this game with a 9/10 rating, the only issue i have is the game requires alot of time if you want to actually get good gear, but if you invest the time, like i have the game is extremely fun.",5
"this game is really fun to play with a bunch of youre friends. its got lots of co-op missions and other fun stuff to do. i would reccomend this to just about everyone.",1
"warframe is a fantastic game free-to-play cooperative third person shooter video game. their are lots of great elements about this game that just make it stand out. the weapons are tons of fun to play with but need a lot of work to craft or if your not into crafting, you can use your real life money to buy them which is abit meh but it is a online-multiplayer game, it needs some economy. the clan dojo is probably my favourite part of the game. it is just so fun to click along the walls and explore new rooms. there are a lot of glitches in this game, ill be honest like a phew times, i do glitch through walls and invisible barriers but they can be solved easy. but yeah, good game. i recommend it to people who like third person shooters with online functionalities.",1
"really good game about space-motherfapin-ninjas ! cmon guyz its epihc !!!1",1
"the best free to play ever. no pay to win aspects.",4
"fantastic game. interesting and unique abilities and warframes. solid mechanics, good pacing, really fun movement and satisfying sword/gun play. there is no paying for power, the only things purchasable with cash (platinum) that relate to power can be found or crafted in-game. cash exclusive items are as youd expect purely cosmetic. the only downside (which in my opinion is nothing worth crying about), are the waiting times. when crafting items the wait can be either 12 or 24 hours depending on the item being crafted. [a whopping 72 hours if crafting a waframe]. this can of course be rushed for cash much like a mobile game.",2
"9/10. this game is truly amazing. though it takes a helluva long time to get every single achievement (which i am not going for), it doesnt take away. from mercury all the way past the kuiper belt, the action and fun never stops. the best part for me is executing captain vor on mercury (im only on venus, thats why!). i reccomend for people who are checking this out.",1
"great game for free you can unlock everything in it just takes time. i dont right reviews really anymore, no one honestly read my wall anyway so eh.",1
"my experience with warframe has been very fun and pleasant. i recommend this game for many, many reasons, and i will list a few so you can get the idea: astonishingly relaxing and fun to play, allows fun and unique co-op with friends, has so many different combinations to play and test around with, while providing a fun experience overall. overall, download this game, its so amazing especially for f2p, worth your time. you wont be disappointed.",2
"garrys mod?sure.loadout?definatly.warframe? yea es!",1
"warframe is an amazing third person shooter with pulse raising combat, a wide array of classes and weapons, and stunning visuals.",1
"its amaaazing, definitley recommend. great fun and not too hard to figure out haha",1
"i stopped playing this on steam because of the embarassingly large amount of time i have spent playing in a relatively short amount of time.",2
"warframe has a learning curve to it, but once you learn the basics, or join a helpful clan to put you on your feet, youll love this game! it has kept me up late when ive had exams, and gets me to wake up early to test out new weapons or frames that i have built. this game is very addicting and with such a large and great community, whats not to like?!",7
"have you ever wanted to be a ninja? well heres your chance get this awesome game!",1
"if anyone is looking for a good f2p this is a good choice, would suggest. its pretty grindy though, but its pretty fun even with the grind. space ninjas and parkour. it looks good, sounds good. 9/10 (also the females are pretty hot but you know)",2
"i downloaded this and never played it until today. all i can say so far is. 1. it looks promising and fun. 2. the controls just feel right. 3. one of the few fps style games ive played in a long time and enjoyed right off the bat. the mouse is still a little buggy in the menus however, but other than that i love this game already. overall - 9/10",1
"for a game thats still in its beta stage warframe brings a lot to the table in satisfaction. although the currency system could be a bit cheaper. warframes mechanics, like acrobatics and parkour, bring not only a cool aspect to the sci-fi shooter but pushes the player to perform amazing kills that would never be done in any other shooter. the weapon side of warframe is a bit basic but does show some variety. guns that impale or lasers are pretty much standard in sci-fi but the way melee is done is phenomenal. swords, axes, and staffs that brutally smash and slice your opponents all over the screen is great. with warframes extensive levels and dynamic comabat system it is definitly a game worthwhile. 9/10",1
"probably one of the best free to play games ive ever played. doesnt force me to pay actual money to play, (everything ive bought was due to my own impatience), ive put over 100 hours into the game in only a week, and just wow on the fact that its only a beta just surprises.",4
"insanely good i loved the gameplay and the ninja style is just crazy coll",1
"futuristic alien cyborg space ninjas. hell yeah i recommend this game. its free to play, incredibly fun to play, and has and absolutely amazing appearance. ill say it again. futuristic alien cyborg space ninjas.",1
"lighting and effects were great. however many maps were repeated, hopefully they do something about it in the update 12!",1
"there isnt really anything to say about this, its just grab your gun, kill, level up, kill some more. really addictive free-to-play.",1
"this game is a ton of fun. my only beef is that grinding is terrible. you have to grind forever to get anything. (of course, since ps4 just got it - i bet its a lot different from what it used to be a year ago).",1
"absolute awesomeness. words dont do it justice, you gotta play it. if you dont waste money on platinum and you prefer getting all the items in this epic win of a co-op shooter, youre bound to have years of fun with it. youve gotta experience being a tenno. best co-op shooter ive ever played yet.",5
"good game just dont go playing to much at once and burn out as your only allowed to level up once a day.",6
"just get it.its play to win, meaning you get the best armor/weapons/mods by playing as opposed to just buying them.you can buy the warframes/weapons already built but you get a certain satisfaction if you actually farm materials to build them.its an awesome game and even through most environments/missions seem repetitive, if you play them with friends, they turn out to be great fun.also the community rocks, so yeah, thats another reason to get it :d",2
"i was a awsome coop and single player game lots of fun.",1
"one of the best and most addicting games ive played. especially as its still in beta. soo much better with friends. hit me up for a game :)",1
"at first, i was like hitler did nothing wrong, then i was all like atleast michael phelps could finish a race",6
"worth it fun shootem up, with choices to upgrade gear items and all sorts of customization",4
"this is a great open beta game. love the different character aspects. im playing nyx right now, her abilities arent really that great. hope the developers make different maps eventually for the differnet planets. they are too similar.",1
"is pretty fun actually, give it a go if you like them fast-paced shoot em up games",2
"if youve ever played mass effect 3 online, imagine that, not as intense, more of a challenge, and all around a giant, fun, exciting universe full of missions that you can play in with up to 4 people, or by yourself. although 90% of it costs real money, if you can get past that then this will be a really fun adventure, by yourself or with friends/strangers (as long as the stangers know what theyre doing)",1
"this game is freaking wonderful! easily one of the best free to play games and the game mechanics and parkour is incredible!",1
"way more fun than i thought itd be. thankfully not pay-to-win. give it a try.",1
"i think the game itself could use a story but other wise its awesome i think space ninjas in space is just plain awesome you can get all items in the game (a few are excempt) by merely playing the game or finding alert missions plus you have awesome graphics 9/10",5
"i really like this game. it has all the action i want but lags when i play online. i mostly play solo just so it doesnt skip. even then there will be times when i jump and the game seems to push me back for no reason. but i feel like that is to be expected every so often. if you are looking for a game to pass the time and have a decent story line, this is the game you want. the missions are a bit longer than i expected. missions can get a little repetetive. gun control and weapon control do very well with a controller.",1
"great game, youre nuts if you dont try it! plus its free :)",6
"really cool, you must have this! its free to play!",1
"warfreme is like a drug, you try it, you like it and you can not leave it",1
"best coop game ever!!! i cant stop playing...this one is must play!!!",1
"very addictive game but still depends on personal choice. some of you might get bored easily, but overall still a good multiplayer online games",4
"warframe equals mate. feed. kill. repeat. repeat. repeat. repeat. repeat. repeat. for fans of smash em buttons games. i recommend this game. fast paced actions over you.",9
"gameplay is very fun, especially when you get used to all the ninja moves! i like that the developers make it a point to keep updating and improving the game based on the player feedback in the forums.",4
"its a great game to kill time and also a great choice for achievement hunters like myself. lot of stuff to collect and do, level up, unlock and try out. surely the levels get repetitive really quick and that might bore you, but then again as mentioned before its great for killing time because you know what to expect (in most cases). can be played alone, with friends, or with a bunch of random players, which is a big plus!",1
"im lazy playing this game but its cool. exept fighting a level 4 guy when you are level 2. exept from the around 10 rounds we had i beat him only one.",1
"warframe its realy my favourite free game!!! its coop, free and i love its plot!!!",10
"its propably one of the best free to play games ive ever played.",7
"i started to play this game when i got into the closed beta and i still play this game till today one of the most addicting and straightforeward games ive played so far. only downside i do feel is just the grind is strong with this one.",10
"epic game. includes a lot of things like crafting and skills and classes and slaying monsters and such. has an amazing progression system, a very good game.",2
"almost 70 hours of play, and still so much to do! feels like it just gets more and more interesting. even though like most ftp games its base is quite grindy, but god is it fun! firt time i have enjoyed a gear grind.",2
"regularly updated, very optimized (runs fine on my not so good computer). great game, takes forever to get everything! awesome!",4
"its unbeliveable that this game is free, very good game.",4
"i have a problem getting starting with the game ... i have downloaded it but unfortunately i cant login .. the game says to me no user matching this email address .. i dont know why?? i need help plz",1
"even though this game is still in beta, it is amazing. and because it is in beta it means there are hundreds of possibilities to be added to the game. it is going to become so much better.",2
"cool game with lots of weapons and customisations but there should be more warframes. overall its a very good game!",4
"its a ok game i wish the controls was a little easier to get use to but cant complain this was my 1st pc game lol",1
"well i cant say the game is bad,is a good co-op game, i can see whay many people like it, if you looking for a good game for you and your friends but you dont really want/can buy any, so try this.",1
"fun game and all but im not too keen on have to wait 24 hours to rank up my tenno once. plus making your character counts as part of the that time. everything else is fine. its like a 3rd person objective based moba. im only going to recommend the game because i hope they fix that issue about ranking up only once daily.",1
"while graphically beautiful and high twitch and fluid action this game lacks a variety that keeps the continued play value that i usually like to see. basically if you wnat ot log on and kill a bunch of stuff, then this is the game for you. they attempted to provide variety with collecting and building different weapons and power ups however this merely turned the game into a grind, looking for item components.",1
"get this game! nothing is better than space ninjas.",5
"warframe is a mixed bag for me. its graphics are amazing, character design is well created and combat is fast paced,each warframe has its own speacial abilities, styles and customization. however i found myself becoming quite bored of the repettitive gamplay and maps, im not sure exactly why but it just felt rather lacking....also when firing my guns it was rather dull, i didnt feel any kick from it and it was like holding a pea shooter doing minimal damage (yes i have tried the various types of weapons, the saloon cowboy style twin pistols being my favored choice). trying to get new warframes is also rather time consuming, the player having to complete different zones to get components (some which you wont unlock till a higher level) with a high chance of not aquaring what you wanted. however i did expect this from a f2p game. money is the easier root to get cooler stuff, luckly this is a co-op game because it is on the verge of buy to win. so to wrap it up in short i would recommend this game since its f2p, its enjoyable and fun but be ready to sink alot of time into it if you are not willing to pay.",1
"warframe is an amazing third person shooter/slasher that gives you the chance to run on walls and kill a multitude of enemys and bosses in space as a warrior (space ninja as some say) with special abilites. while it may not be the best game to play in 12 hours periods of time it is the best game to hop on and play for 1 or 2 hours a day with friends, although when new updates come out (and they come out on a fairly regular basis) you will find yourself racing to get the new warframe or weapons that came out. the community is great and the developers keep the player base in the know about what they are doing and actually caring about the communites opinion and taking it into account. bets f2p game in a long time and everyone should at least try it out at some point.",3
"8/10 great game, perfect for hack and slash fans and 3rd person shooters :d",1
"warframe is one of the best if you have a chance play it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1

"great online community and many hours of fun! best mmo i have played because its co-op (a.k.a. pve) not pvp.",1
"i do love this game a lot but be warned, the crafting of guns weapons suits etc, takes a very long time there is a lot in this game to be fair and it can be a lot of fun, i love it personally. yet the in game real world purchases of platinum is way over priced the lowest which is i think 3.99 only gets you 70 plat and the average price of a new warframe is between 250-300 plat and they go up to 375 plat so yeh i dont really wanna be paying all that money for one character that i can make but if you deal with having to wait a long time to earn new gear then this is definately a game you should download. also you can make your own clan dojo and build new rooms with research labs in and build decor around the rooms but this takes resources in game to do and myself and my clan mate have only recently got into this but it is a really nice touch to the game.",1
"just started playing warframe,i usually play xbox 360,so the computer games i have really not played in a long time i see that have came along since last time i really played a game on the comp,i mean its been a while i used to play, metal marians and silent steel,war frame is a nicely designed game would be better if 1st person could be used but all in all i love the game the graphics are good smooth play and killer special fx i give it a 10/10.check out my you tube peace all.",1
"ok for the first few play-throughs, but it gets repetitive kinda of quick.",3

"very amazing, love the guys working on it! one of the best games iv ever played, but you need to play it right, take your time...look around, it really is a beautiful game, and a great story. a story you create",5
"it kept glitching out on me, and i would fall through the floor. other than that, it looks great, albeit a bit confusing",1
"thisbgame is awesome, recomemded to all who wish to be...uh...space...ninja...gunners....yeah...",1
"truly a great game. from the first time i played, i was hooked. collecting all the weapons and frames is extremely addicting. the gameplay is very fast paced and responsive. a great mix of 3rd person shooting, melee combat and platforming. being free to play, you can get the best equipment in the game without spending a single penny. just time and skill.",2
"amazing game, movement relly fluent and fits peoples play styles. patch 12 is a bit buggy, makes my steam and game frequently. still recomend it though.",2
"requires good hardware, but overall great gameplay",1
"i highly recomend this game to everyone as it has the best progression and quest system out there on the free to play market. all items can be got if you play the game deligently and you dont need to spend at all in this game . great concept awesome graphics true f2p model updated frequently customer value the best staff most awesome devstream and its hard to believe its still in openbeta. 9.8/10",9
"warframe is an amazing free-to-play mmo game centered mostly around co-op gameplay. it has some of the best graphics ive ever seen in a game that is free to play. i absolutely love this game and recommend it to all my friends.",2
"best f2p third person shooter game in the world . it is so addicting that i spent all my with it but one thing annoys me which is platinium i mean you cant get it as daily login reward or any reward",2
"love it, brilliant and really fun. graphics perfect, mechanics flawless but can end up being a grind.",4
"its kinnda weird when you wait in the lobby but this game is awesome",1
"i wasnt convinced id like it, then thought hey its ok, it may keep my interest for a while....i seem to be totally addicted to it now; very solid mechanics and devs who arent afraid to try stuff then go back if it isnt working. im surprised but i am still enjoying it. fun game, good company running it.",8
"dont know why people call this a grindfest when there isnt really a endgame or a objective. its only a grind if you make it one yourself, all the guns are well balanced and the game isnt that difficult. the main goal of the game is to have fun and enjoy the community.",5
"this is one of the best free-to-play games out there. i have played others on and off, but this is the only one i have ever stuck with.",2
"while the concepts and lore are interesting, the gameplay can become rather repetitive and sometimes it feels as though the game is forcing you to play with others in order to overcome a particularly hard mission.",1
"very good game its free and there is a lot of upgradable things. you can play solo with friends or radomly join others in the fight against evil.",1
"robo ninjas in space!!! wallrunning!!! shooting!!! melee!!!",5
"cool game. it is fun to watch your weapons level and add damage to them",1
"i honestly didnt believe i would like this game, because its not really my type. but its a lot of fun! you start with one class (warframe) and your mission is to conquer every planet in the universe. you are provided with different missions, for instance: defence mission, spy mission, rescue mission etc. while youre at it you can save up materials for building a new class (warframe), weapons or other items. you get mods which strenghten your warframe, and you can choose exactly how you want it to be. you can choose to solo, invite some friends, or join some strangers in your fight against the other races.",2
"this game by far is one of the best games i have ever played, best yet its better than more than half of my games ive actually purchased 10/10",2
"i do and when all of my friends get it we will all join a guild togather and master the game and collect all riches friends get this game",2
"play this for long periods of time. that is all. thank you.",1
"this is the best free to play on steam (not including tf2 and dota which are made by valve) it may be slow to start with, especially if you dont have a friend to help you, but i can assure you, once you get to mastery rank 4, this will be your favorite free to play game (once again not including the amazing valve games)",6
"really love this game ,but now i play on the ps4 because my comp sucks and now i have to start all over ;-;",1
"oh wow! these were the first words i said aloud as i started this game. let me sum it up, you play as space ninjas wielding magic(?) powers to destroy all in your path. running/wall-running/spinning/jumping/flipping/slide attack! oh wow just moving around in this game is a blast! this game is free to play and everything in this game can be earned by simply playing and working hard at it too. image running through an armored ship killing and looting as you go, when the wall next to you explodes as troops from another faction poor out of a pod and rain hot lead in all directions! the ship is being bombarded and ripped apart throwing everything into space. the only thing saving you is your ship that gives you wings to fly in space! humming your favorite star wars tune as you whip through what is left of the massive ship to continue your goal. so what have you got to lose!? its free give it a shot!",6
"one of the best games i have every seen. playing since closed beta. its a game when you leave it and you come back a month later you will fall back in love with it",3
"kinda great. first time playing fps with that rpg kinda feeling though but great experience.",1
"play warframe its so good youll be slapping yourself silly",5
"decent, lots of grinding, and enjoyable if you willing to wait couple days for item crafting.",4
"warframe is a really good game, i just wish that i had a different laptop so it can run fast",1
"this game is really fun. between firefights and kickass sword fights its pretty neat.",1
"great game overall. if you havent played this game yet then you need to play it. this game set the all time high for great f2p games. my only problem is the motivation in the game. as you can see by my hours ive put some time into this game and have had a lot of fun with it. though, once you get to higher levels unlocking the higher weapons and frames that you want it gets kinda boring to play. since they have put in quests that makes the game a bunch more motivating to play, but they dont have many and unless you are playing with friends you will probably get bored of the game at higher ranks too. trust me though when i say that this game deserves a play if you havent tryed it yet because this game is awsome.",1
"have you ever wanted to start your own farm? well if the aswer to this question is yes warframe is the game for you. even though, you dont really grow any vegetables of any sort, or have animals (well except a dog, a weird one though) the main thing in the game is to complete missions over and over again to get recources or parts for weapons. a good and short review of this game would be farming simulator with space guns and bad guys, who you kill to farm, to steal the last drip of the material you are gathering, from the cold dead hands of your enemies, while their children watch in fear as you cut their parents to pieces, and take their wallets. so basicly a family friendly game overall. 10/10 would farm again",3
"unless youve got either patience or a load of cash youre willing to spend on a free game, then youre not going to have a fun time with this one. tl;dr - its time, money, or both with this game. overall, warframe is of decent quality, expecially for a free game. ive been playing it for the past week, and my only beef with the game is how long it takes to progress past youre default weaponry. first, youve got to buy the blueprint, which in some cases is relatively expensive. then youve gotta get all the resources, typically by farming. last, you have to wait anywhere between 12 hours and 3 days. unless you buy platinum, the real money currency in the game. then you can rush the process, and complete it instantly, for a fifth or less of the cost of the warframe on the market. or, you could just flat out buy it from the marketplace ingame.",3
"i definately recommend this game to everyone, its absoluetly amazing! i just cant get enough of this game, ive only been playing it for about 6 days now and i have lots of time put into this game. for just a free to play game, this one is a lot of fun, and it has amazing graphics plus it runs really smooth. some people say that you have to buy platinum if you want decent stuff. but actually, the only time you have to use platinum, is when you want cosmetics (i.e. helmet, syandana, better colours, etc...), more warframe/weapon slots, or to purchase something right away. now, i would recommend using the 50 platinum they give you to start off with, to buy more slots, because the cosmetic stuff isnt really that important, where as slots are. basically everything else, you can get blueprints for, then go around to the different planets and missions to gather the materials to build them. some blueprints (warframes for example) require that you fight bosses more than once or go into the void so you can get things such as, the helmet, chassis, and systems. yes, this can take some time, but its worth it in the end. overall, i think this is a great game! the only negatives i could think of, is how some maps are used more than once, even though youre on a totally different planet, and the fact that you have to buy more colours with platinum. but, other than that, this game is great, and if you havent already, try it out! its free :d",1
"an great action game u can use swords and guns best combo in game ever see!!!",1
"an open beta, but not just any open beta. warframe takes on a third person and tactical challenge. being very successful so far by climbing to the tip of the top of the free to play games, other than tf2 of course, it has been played by many. i like this game for its unique and cool content. the game my be a little hard to understand at first, but once you get it, you get it. i recommend warframe to all players that are looking for a tactical shooter.",1
"amazing get it now you fight npcs and buy gun blueprints then find the stuff to make the gun!!!!!!!(or buy it) yay=5 star",1
"this game is so awesome! most fun ive had with a multiplier game in a while. customize the  out of your character, weapons and  and have some ing fun dude",1

"best free 2 play game i highly recommend you play it. its free cant agrue with that",1
"this is a great free to play game that is vary fast past, and fun!",1
"the game is still in open beta for more than a year, the improvements made so far is astounding and the potential to make it better is tremendous. a real f2p and not pay to win. stunning gfx, tps like a real ninja. cant wait for melee 2.0, new warframes, the hub, the alliances, the badlands, solar rail, the katana and may be new planets, solar systems and factions !! there is some minus obviously like the chat system, the dojo, the main ui (not the hud while playing) etc.. but they dont interfere with the fun",3
"if you like action based multiplayer games this is one of the best choices you will ever choose. really fun to play with friends and kill some bad guys!! you will find one of the best co-op experiences in this game. in terms of graphics it looks amazing for a free to play game and the combat system its simple and very good. i defenetly recommend this game to everyone!! maybe ill get a few boobies with this game xd boobies!!",1
"man ..... if you ever wanna play a mmo game.... just pick this one up ..... its the best and is ranked no.4 i started 2 weeks back and now my record is 116hrs :p if u guys wanna join me just install this game and add me as friend... my account: heatoff",6
"extremely repetetive grind festival and a money grab as well. game is quite un-enjoyable with at least some basic stuff bought with real cash. after that it is quite playable, untill you are bored of the repetetive gameplay. you end up unlocking all systems in the game (youll be bored before that) and grinding the same, most lucrative missions over and over and over again, to unock best mods and lvl up. and to lvl up you need new weapons and warframes (characters). to do that you need to grind more, or pay more, etc. basically never ends. it all depends on you. wether you dont care if you do same thing all over again like a machine... graphics wise, it looks awesome with physx and settings on max. but it is easier to play with those effects turned off, as particles can cover up whole screen with lighthing effects. depends on you. initially a good game, but the art style is very basic and un-naturall. all characters look like ugly union of a robot and a bug. it all holds up, its just a matter of preference. the random map generator is not worth the mention. you will quickly remember all the areas that are showing up. they just connect in different places (maps consist of series of blocks, which are semi-random).",1
"seriously? i need to convince you to play a game where badass robot ninjas shoot guns and do parkour to kill aliens? youre hopeless. go home, steamer, youre drunk.",2
"its like assassins creed but with guns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"i love this game. just wish it didnt take so long to craft stuff xd",1
"a game where you play with your friends ... so go on and download it .. and you know who you are, friend!!!!",2
"i think this game is cool but could there be a update that we are going against other players then the game would to me at lest be more fun",1
"warframe is a lot of fun, and the developers are constantly getting feedback from the community. major game mechanics have been totally overhauled to make the game more fun and inviting, and they are not done changing things for the better yet. the game is f2p and almost anything you want in game you can get without having to pay a cent. you can even trade in-game items for the real-world currency (platinum) to make it possible to get what ever you want. all in all, i think they did a good job on the game, and it deserves a fair chance.",5
"i would say that warframe was a game for grinding, and while this is very true. a lot of in-game resources are hard to come by, so you sometimes ahev to keep doing the same mission until you get what you want. im not going to lie, this can get annoying, but the combat sure as hell makes up for it: minor parkour, abilites, cutting enemies in half (can be turned off), the gunplay is suprisingly fluid and entertaning, which is kind of hard to acheive all the correct net code and things like that (i often ramble) the only bad part is that at a first glance at the market, this game is pay-to-win, but this isnt really true. while a lot of the best weapons and warframes (combat suits) are probably easier to get if you just buy them, you get a much better sense of satisfaction from playing the game and crafting them.",3
"i love to play warframe i telled my firend to play the game and then like 10 mins he was haveing fun and we play it all the time and we have fun playing it",1
"its a dungeon crawler in third person. enter a dungeon, get an objective, do the objective and kill everything in between.",2
"you spend alot of time farming for stuff and the grind is real. but those arent really bad things because you do all this while being a space ninja with 4 powers to destory your enemies with as well as 3 weapons a primary, a secondary, and melee weapon. i will say the game will get boring if you play without friends or a clan but with them the experience changes quite abit but ill leave that for you to find out.",8
"well at start i was thinking that this game is just anoter ussles shooter.but when i try it ,it supresed me.its awsome,there are all kind of weapons,this race-s look cool.best future shooter. you should try it.!",1
"you see.... its not a good game until you get a lottttt of platinium......but nice game. :d its a good and not good game.....so i will do- yes xd",2
"this game is totally worth your time. go & bring some friends along with you while playing the game. this is a rare free-to-play mmo game which focus on co-op instead of leveling system based rpg. the controls are fluid and the game is surprisingly addictive. there are tons of customization for you to make your character a badass alien ninja. there are lots of content for you to explore. go download it now! 8/10",1
"i became an anti-social, bad graded ... 11/10 would ruin life again",1
"one of the pest f2p games ive ever played. its a science fiction mmorpg that is very high paced and always keeps you busy. i like to compare this game to destiny, except youre not trying to farm for gear, youre farming for mods and new frames. its a great game, worth checking out.",1
"cool third person rpg shooter. nice way to pass time.",1
"fast paced alien hacknslashnshoot. for any shooter fan. slicing enemies up with dual katanas throbbing with electricity... is quite satisfying. :d",2
"in a nutshell, its an online fast paced 3rd person shooter where you play as a genetically modified futuristic breed of ninja or teno and team up with 3 others to undergo plentyful missions across planets of the solarsystem. like any online game, its best played with the people you know. after completing a shedful of missions, they can seem a little repetative after a while, but kit yourself out in a completely different way, as the customisation is pretty diverse, and youll have a refreshingly different combat experience. its strangely addictive and also free! so what have you got to lose? play it now! its the only way youre going to see if you like it or not.",1
"warframe is basically an addictive mmoprg mass effect game, that should be all i have to say. but this game is addicting for all the right reasons, the loot. you just want to keep playing a little bit longer to see what will drop, usually it doesnt pay off but thats half the fun of it. it forces you to cooperate with others to play levels longers, to trade, and to go to the void as often as possible. i definitely recommend this game to anyone that loves the combat flow of the mass effect games coupled with cooperate yet at the same time competitive third person shooter game.",2
"awesome recommend it dawnload it if u want to get extreme fun baby",5
"warframe is the spiritual sequel of dark sector, and on this game we play as tenno, a race bound inside suits called warframes. little is known about your own past, and all you know is that a being or organization called lotus is trying to help you. you work as mercenarie bringing balance to the solar system, assassinating important targets from the rival factions and erradicating the technocyte viral infestation from space colonies. if you played dark sector you know what are the tenno. the gameplay is fast paced and the commands respond well, you can use a large variaty of weapons, from pistols to granade launchers and even larger selection of melee weapons. you can play as tanker running around killing and shooting everything or you can play as real ninja being sneaky. note that you must upgrade your weapons in order to survive the missions as you progress in the game. the game lacks end game content, but the des are updating the game and looking for fix it over time. the soundtrack is sometimes dark, giving a creepy feel to the game, and in other time it is exciting with all those naga drums. the graphics are gorgeous and it uses the nvidia physx. recomended, one of the best free to play game out there, 9.9/10.",6
"i like this game vary much just has a kinda well hard if you play solo so try to pay in a team rilly good game thow",1
"this is a great game if your totally looking for a game with epic action and even better gunplay; when you join a guild you can research the new equipment that come out in new updates, so its not really pay to win. you can meet tons of people all across the globe that can help you get started, even if their are those few people who are complete jerks.",2
"hey having some trouble. i can not download warframe from steam i click the play now tab and it is suppose to pop up with the download screen and it doesnt. is there something wrong with the launch button???",1
"this game has quite a learning curve in that it took me a bit of time to get truly used to the controls and movements. but ive never felt so ninja. many warriors, many weapons, and a s*** ton of baddies to kill in any way you so choose.",3
"awesome game i love it played it for 153 hours and am loving it",1
"this game is great only downside is that ou can only play online and that it has so many updates tha if you dont play for month youl basicaly re download the game.",1
"not as good as i expected but still cool.the game has some bug issues and the missions are often repeated.this is clearly a game that you should play with your friends,considering the single player sucks.in the other hand,warframe has big variety of weapons,customasasion,charachters and many more.worth to try it.(btw sry for my english)",1
"this game may seem a bit complex at the beginning (that was in my case), but thats just because it offers so many possibilities and personalisation. but once youre into it its simply awesom ! ^^",5
"this game is really uniqe, both in gameplay and in style, here are some of the things a new player might want to know: 1: alot of different weapons, sawblade throwers, shotguns, bows and more awesome weapon 2: a fair f2p model where you can obtain anything in the game (since the trading system was inplented you can trade platinum these days so it wont be a problem. also, the ones who only costed plat was cosmetic items) 3:alot of different playstyles to choose from, you even build your own frame, which is awesome 4: lovely graphics 5:alot of gamemodes, all from extermination to defense 6:quite nice community note: the only downside with the game is that it is quite alot of grind sometimes and generally there is a couple of buggs aswell but aside from that this is a great game.",6
"a great game without cracking open your piggy bank. for a free-to-play game its actually really fun. its not a pay to win, its more like pay for swag. all weapons and warframes are obtainable in the game, unlike combat arms where you need to rent weaponry or buy for ridiculous price ranges (seriously, $30 for a m4a1?) graphics are phenomenal, no question about it. i beleive its one of the best ftp out there and will stay so for a long time. 9.5/10 rating (sometimes the game gets repetitive.)",9
"warframe is by far the best game i have ever played outstanding graphics and detail i would of payed 10 pound for it",1

"this game is awesome. even though this game is free, i would pay for a game like this. very in-depth combat system, trying to level all your weapons up is fun also. definitely worth the instal.",1
"its a very cool game you get your own ship you can craft more then 100 weapons and more then 20 warframes and the new archwing is just awsome this is the best free game yet",6
"soooooooooooo grindy. i recomend playing this with some friends as opposed to solo on account of how grindy this game gets if youre trying not to put real money in it. fun game.",1
"this game is awesome, the graphics are superb, the weapons are so cool, only one problem its hard to get money and not regular game currency thats easy but i mean that spesal type of money thats somehow in everygame pretty much but other that that its great!",1
"+ gameplay is easy to get to grips with (tutorial doesnt tell you to hold spacebar to wallrun though....best 20 minutes ever) + graphics wise, their astonishing, even on a low end machine like mine that runs a 2.0 ghz core. + customisation is insane. + variety of weapons to suit your playstyle; bow or assault rifle? bo staff or sword? handgun or ninja stars? endless! + questing in order to farm? yay! true f2p standard. + team-ups are fun and make life much easier. - contains a majorly intensive freemium aspect; i mean really? have to pay to get platinium just to expand a ******* color palette to change the color of my warframe or weapons!? **** that! the prices, yeah, there alright, but theres no harder alternative. - buyable warframe blueprints require pieces; not explained where they are or how to get them....pay!?!?! verdict: its not forced on you to buy platinium, so go ahead and shoot/sneak/stab  up!!!",1
"honestly? this is the best game ive ever played. the physics are fantastic, the graphics are off the charts, the teamwork is optional but fantastic, the weapons are numerous, the economy is fun but not mandatory... honestly, just play it. its the best decision youll ever make.",2

"this game kicks so much  i stoped playing other game all together!!!!!!!!",6
"this game is very open, with the customization reaching beyond charatcer, weapons, and move sets. it has a hack n slash, and fps game waiting for you, a very clever combination not used often. basically, you are alien ninjas called tenno and you need to be rid of the opposing alien breeds. they have many many missions, ranging from wave battles, to take out all the enemies, to complete objectives. i do not need to say anymore about this amazing game.",1
"while playing this game i stoped doing my homework lost all connection from the outside world dont talk to friends anymore this game will take your life away i cant even wipe my owne buttcheeks because im hooked",3
"+ devs + a lot of content + winning without paying - repititive",2
"its really good but really difficult. it is similar to the avatar game (but better) its mainly for skilled gamers or people with a few friends that will help them kick butt. its really both i wish they did tone down the difficulty a bit though, some enemies can kill you single handedly and these enemies are basic cannon-fodderish enemies that appear everywhere. (sniping them and shooting them in the butt is fun) overall an amazing game. (i hope ill get past the 4th level soon[yep its that hard])",1

"i played this some before and without having a lot of hours onto the game i can say it looks promising i know people who have played this to much for their own good. also i like the fact that unlike most mmorpgs where you do not really become badass untill you played for a long time here you are a flippin ninja from the start! cons: it is still an mmorpg which means it includes grinding which i am not a big fan of it can sometimes be unclear with where you need to go as with all games where you can fly around (not literary fly) you will get stuck. in general though i recommend atleast trying it :d",1
"do you think being a ninja is awesome? how about being an alien? well, what if i said you were both an alien and a ninja? thats how awesome this game is. for a free-to-play game its very well made and allows co-op for those difficult missions. i have been playing this game for a while and i know that its one of the best games i have played. if i were you, i would download this.",2
"play this if you like running, gunning, swinging a weapon, doing flips, and using special powers warframe might fill the void. while the gamplay is fun it is definitly a freenium, you can work for a $5 dollar item by continously grounding for hours and some times days, then wait for hours to days for the item to be constructed. its only a shame when you done this work for a sub-par machine gun or a frame you arent particulary fond of so i reccomend looking up what thing does what. levels/enivoronments look nice and rooms are randomly generated so youll start to see the same environments after awhile. while the bosses are varied and vary in terms of annoyance, enemy types are few inbetween with gun guys and melee guys and robots. despite some of those issues you can have fun without spending a dime. it is especially fun, and in some casses neccessary to have a friend(s) to tag along on missions depending on what frame you/they are using. i played significantly less on account of the endless grinding and me being satisfied with the weapon/frame i already have but it was fun little distraction that is free to play while it lasted.",1
"a great combination of ninja and science fiction i love it alot.",1
"who need cooperative gameplay against monters, this is best of all. graphics cool. try out",1
"like the game and its free what more can you ask for.",1
"grinding: the game basically not even pay to win, pay to play less. warframe is a grindfest and doesnt stop for anything. if youre a weird grinding addict this game will be your new gem. i lost faith in it though but thats only because of the kubrow egg drop rate. i havent got a single egg after destroying over 800 kubrow dens. i really really despise the game for this. but you obviously have better luck than me so go ahead and try. this game might just suit you.",1
"best free to play 3rd person in existence dont let the meta score fool you, the first hour or so is a bit difficult to get into as you feel under powered but if you stick with it you will soon realise how much this game has to offer.",3
"this game is awesome the fact that its free makes the game 100% awesome",1
"i bathe thee ether in the blood of my enemies for you are my tool, and you are my blade formed to help me with my one purpose; a bloody end to all. may he who hears these words smite grineer with extra proficency. and slay corpus with a ritcheous swipe.",2
"jumping around like a ninja and killing tons of enimes with guns, grenades, melee... sign me up",1
"i have searched for a good combat mmo game aside from the popular console call of duty/halo ect. for a long time. and i have finaly found one. stratagy, combat skills, construction, critical thinking, lore, all in one game. the devs are always coming up with ways to add to the game or expand the games lore universe/gameplay, so the game is always evolving. the user base is for the most part supportive and friendly, and unlike most games i have tried, the elitist jerk few cant set up roadblocks to the common player base and make thier gameplay miserable and unfruitful. a word of warning, becasue the game is always evolving it is natural that bugs come with that territory. players affectionatly call it bugframe or crashframe becasue of it, but in my opinion the rewarding gameplay is worth it. a word on its free 2 play status as there is much critizism especailly after 15.0 update. although there are some limitations at trying to running it f2p, it can be done. game currency can be earned thru the player trading system, game currency only items can be earned in the game although takes more time/in less quantity, and certain items can be traded for things you want but cant get. if you do decide to put some money in the game, a little goes a long way, and there is discount coupons all the time.",8
"grinding on top of grinding rolled up in grinding, yet it is by far my favorite game in a long time. it features a multitude of weapons and warframes that suit any play style, from stealth, to tanking. although it is a f2p game with 2 currencies, a multitude of weapons can be crafted from blueprints either purchased from the store, or from a clan lab. these weapons gain experience as you use them, and the higher you rank them, the more mods you can apply. these range from elemental mods, fire rate, damage, etc. which further enhances combat. combat is fast paced and easy to pick up, and plays much like other stealth games with wallruns and other cool tricks. overall, this game is fantastic for a free to play game, with many features any gamer wants. pros- easy to learn, hard to put down (sorry for the cheesy saying) matches a variety of play styles customization devs are funny (poke fun at their own mistakes) fast paced cons- grinding, grinding, grinding trading proves difficult, one player must have a clan no servers, everything is from the host stalker is an , and only appears when you have unranked stuff equipped",2
"updated: well, its been a long time since i last reviewed warframe and its amazing how much better the game has become since then! its smoother and much more optimised (although me getting an upgraded pc helped) and there is so much more content than before. its still basically the same old grindfest (and its still almost impossible to find pick-up groups for normal mission progression) but with so many new mission types, areas, enemies, factions, the archwing (which reminds me so much of zone of the enders) theres actually a hell of a lot to do. the game still goes out of its way to screw you if you insist on trying to play for free, but you can get around if if youre bloody-minded enough. a tentative recommendation.",4
"good game if ya like rng, grinding, guns, waiting, space ninjas with superpowers, guns and sword play, flying around space with butt-thrusters, using an attack dog that will cost you an arm and a leg, not having to pay money to actually advance in the game (though it helps later), and having crapmed fingers from all of the fun your having, this is the game for you. its the poor persons destiny",6
"fun game, great graphics. you can jump really high.",8
"so the thing about warframe is, its really free. all contents are available without using cash, no trap, no catch, no nothing.get the game, find some friend or clanmates and have fun. well you can spend cash on cosmetics and rush those weapon but its your choice. the updates are always there for fixes and new contents. the other day,a friend of mine rushed their archwing but due to sever issuses, they couldnt login. in the end, de compensated him with the platinum he used to rush, so the customer services is really well and alive. the community is very friendly here and even in pubs you can relax, nobody will blame you for not doing well. also some alerts missions occuring at random times give out powerful mods,cool helmets and my favorite the potatoes! so yeah, you cant really complain about warframe in anyway. its a great game indeed. thanks de.",5
"best game ever :) wonderfull it made me a ninja expert lol.",1
"what to do in warframe: -play -pick the lightning swag dude -learn that u have to make use of the shift, ctrl, and spacebar to move fast -jump kick -spinny crouch jumping for miles -die -get 1banged by the stalker -kill stuff -use all of your daily revieves -make stuff and wait 3 days for it -grind -never end",1
"this is a third person shooter that incorperates free running, ninjas, and pseudo-magical abilities (explained with scientific reasons). it is a great and fun game that i love with all my heart and support. i do have to warn however that it is very buggy and glitchy but i feel as though that just adds to the fun of the game, but some people would disagree. it is however limited since it is only 4 person squads but the multiplayer aspect is the best part about the game. so grab some friends and go kill some stuff in space with swords, guns, n stuff!",5
"this game is one of rthe best if not the best free to play game i have ever played. it has its boaring moments, i have gotton board of it a few times but i have jumped back into this game.",4
"killing stuff is fun. sneaking up on people/things and killing them is fun also. so even though i have to admit that i have no idea what warframe/gear is best, or even how to get it, warframe is fun. im still using the same junk that i started the game with, running around killing things, defending things, and grabbing things and then running... lots of running. and i can do it either singly or multiplayer. its that single player bit which got me to try the game in the first place... not a big fan of online shooters (and the in-game chat channel is as dreary as in most online games). the game is perfectly fun without groups, though i imagine theres plenty of content you couldnt do without help or at least uber gear. but for me, its fine. i wont spend any real money on warframe, so i have no idea how the lack of platinum affects your options in the long run, but for what it is, its a great bit of fun which can be had for free.",1
"possibly the best f2p game ever. unlike many other force to pay games... in this game you dont have to pay, but still could have fun. awesome. 10/10 8 for the quality and another 2 for the way they run the game.",3
"this game is addicting. seriously, someone should start a warframe annonymous group... then again, whod want to stop playing this game? the game itself is a sci-fi third-person shooter set in a distant future. a group called the tenno is on the brink of extincition, and use cyber-suits called warframes, which give them powers no one would turn down. so, basically, you are a space-cyber-ninja-of-awesome. the gameplay itself is high-adrenaline, fast-paced co-op shooting, slicing, and basically doing space-cyber-ninja-of-awesome-stuff. the powers have a wide range with the warframes and weapons you can choose from. if you like going in guns-blazing and soak up damage? (very unninja-ish, amy i add), you can do that with the rhino warframe, which is built like a tank. like being as versatile as possible? the excalibur warframes wide range powers would do the trick. want to sneak up behind the front lines and eliminate a whole platoon? try the loki warframes stealth-oriented powers. or maybe you like a support role? try out vaubens engineer playstyle. theres a warframe for every palystyle, ability, and type of player out there. you also dont have to pay a cent or more if you dont want to. well, a game like this has got to cost something, right? look at the pricing. yeah. have fun, rookie, and welcome to warframe. worth a download. 9/10 would be a space-cyber-ninja-of-awesome again. ps if you do paly this game, turn off motion blur. it can get pretty hard on the eyes.",1
"very good free to play game.. amazing graphics and is in no way a pay to win",5
"lacking in legs its just one long grind great if you love that kind of thing. i dont.",1
"this game has a very nice gameplay for both single and co-op, from running and gunning to ripping apart your enemies up close with a sword, gotta love such a futuristic game that contains ninjas.",1
"this is definitely one of those games that, once you start playing, you will find yourself gravitating back towards after you think youve grown bored with it. the developers have done a great job of injecting new life into the game with every update. there are a great many places to go, and while the novelty of the mission types will wear down eventually youll keep coming back for the challenge of new content and game modes. while pvp does exist in this game its not the games focus - working together to overcome the challenges of the environment or mission is what makes this game great.",7
"what can u say? the game is mmorpg. theyre all about space ninja called tenno. this is the coolest mmo i ever played in my entire life.. it doesnt require too much money like other (simply not a waster) so i say just play it , learn and go try whats inside this game ! cuz ur gonna love it.",4
"space ninjas, psychic people, a rhino has everything in this game. and best of all, its free!!!! of course you have to pay if you want to get your warframes, weapons, etc. faster, but you can always do it in-game. so why pay for it? try this game out.",1
"although there are cartridge-based weapons, still prefer a true ninja styles: bow, arrows, kunais, and of course, katana. ive died many times because of that. 10/10 - would ninja-ing again",1
"this is the game to try out if your looking for a fun free game",1
"its an awesome third person shooter. i especially love the parkour abilities in this game. you can even tic-tac jump! although it does lack a few elements, i do say that it is pretty awesome and i recommend this to anybody who like shooter games!",2
"this game has a good story line and even greater game play to it and the game has it own orignal idea. the devs puts out a update regalerly and hotfixes with in the hour of findding out there is a bug. the only thing most people will have a problem with it thats 12 hours to make a new gun and about 3 and a half days to make a new frame but it is well worth the wait. the combat is fast and the map are randomly put to gether with perset tiles and no map is the same as the last. the grinding can get slow and boring at time but if you get some frineds or random people you can make it less of a grind and more of how long can we last in a survival mission. there are alittle over ten different mission types from defence where you protect a cryo pod to killing a hvt and survival where you need to keep the enamey busy for as long as you can while keeping you life support levels above 0%. i recommand this game because of the different and origanal idea it brings to this current game marcket where you only find zombie survivals, fps and over all strange game types.",7
"a pretty good game, a bit grindy, a bit buggy, but a pretty good game none the less. think of warframe as a game you can dump infinite amount of hours in (as long as you arent bored) every once in a while. its like, the 3d version of the cookie clicking game.",8
"quick review: if you like skill based mmos then you should try this. lengthy review: as of writing this review, i spent around $35 on cosmetic equipment only. you can buy certain things for cheap and i bought a lot of cheap things. that being said, you can pretty much get everything in this game without having to pay any moeny. this is a great game. the free to play aspect of it is great and it is done right. it forces you to buy colors if you have an obsession with accessorizing like me so be weary of that. this is mostly skill based and im sure if you paid enough money, you could get the best equipment, but youd still need skill to use those items effectively. note: if you are lazy like me and dont like to use a mouse and keyboard (blasphamy!) there is controller support; you may have to tweak some things. pros: -great gameplay -visuals can be great if your computer can handle it -almost everything can be obtained without paying $$$ -there is a warframe for almost every players play style -there are tons of missions with a lot of variety and difficulties cons: -can be time consuming to get some things -some items, mainly colors have to be bought -some minor glitches can occassionally happen but arent usually harmful",1
"a fun game once you get to play with an interesting art direction and unique style thats hampered by artificial wait times and a business model that rewards purchasing an item from the market versus investing time into crafting. theres fun to be had here, you just need to invest some time into it. recent updates have made the game new-user friendly.",4
"its like a mix between mass effect 3 multiplayer and tench z............ in other words entertaining and worth a play if nothing else.",1
"really great game, can get through the game without needing to buy premium currency (platinum) only used to rush builds and for asthetic items",6
"really liking the plat trading system... now you can actually get any item in game for free even cosmetics. very grindy though",2
"they this turned from an amazing game into a  console port. such a shame, it was an amazing(although grindy) shooter and they turned it into a game with the sluggish aiming only good for controllers, awful hud which only good when you flick up or down with a controller instead of using your mouse, and extremely downgraded the lobby system, making you have to walk to stuff you could just click a button for with no loading before, and turning the planet/level tree into a circle and pile of squares. they should and might as well made the current game a warframe 2 just so pc players could of kept playing the old game.",1
"this game is by far the best free to play game out there... this game deserves a at least a 9/10 but i will give it a 10/10. you should play this game!",1
"very fun and exciting game, although, i wish you didnty have to spend as much money as you do if you want really good weaponry",1
"extremely fun tps [third person shooter] action packed and exiting :d",1
"it amazing i played it when it came out but my com broke so im getting it fixed and my freind cant wait to play with me",1
"fun and addictive mmofps to play, mixes in some rpg elements like levelling up and item/weapon/character creation.",1
"this game is great in many ways. it has many guns, swords, warframes (a suit), and many more. but i must say this game to get a bit farmy so get ready but he has its ups and downs or give it a try you will love it.",2
"run. shoot. collect. rinse and repeat. compete until you have everything. while this is what the game is, it becomes so much more once you begin competeing with friends, joining the talk in region chat, and going head-to-head agaisnt other players in clave. ninjas in spaaaaaace",3
"warframe? haha, grindframe more like. ... helpmeicantstopitstooaddicting",4
"this game is so amazingly great, that it has pretty amazingly  characters, that are ugly compared to other mmorpgs! the controls are so ing terrible, the camera needs to die so badly! there are not ing amazing spells. the ing game mountain simulator is ing better than this ! the effin tutorial is so ing long, takes like 60 hours! ing piece of trash game. i recommend it! <3 volvo fix pls",1
"ninjas high as ****, thinking theyre space ninjas or something. going around with armors and guns and killing things, with other ninjas - totally worth a try especially if you like mass effect style of action gameplay. very fair game reward system and decent gameplay overall. just try bring a bro or two with you",5
"ok ummm well its nothing but a grinder and the only reason i would play this is if your one of those peaple that really like graphics and even at that there not the best my rating is a 6.5 but i still think pleaple should try this game out",1
"i love this game if i hade a beter computer it would be baller",1
"great game. co-op multiplayer is extremely fun. the variety of warframes to play are extensive and unique. the weapons all seem great so far. looking forward to more and more content.",1
"do you want to play a game with space ninjas, in a third person shooter with powers? check this game out, you might just love it. pros. -fun gameplay. -satisfying melee kills, and assassinations. -unique looking warframes (characters) with unique abilities. -nice community. -loads, and loads of melee, secondary, and primary weapons (from kunai, to pistols, rifles to bows, and daggers to greataxes/hammers/swords!) cons. -can get repetitive. -lengthy crafting time. -prices for buying stuff with platinum can be a bit high. ive been playing this game since closed beta, with over 50+ hours on my account, and only 18 hours on steam. this game is great, i highly recommend playing with friends, since it makes the experience much more better than it would be when playing alone.",2
"i really like this game! it onliy need player versus player :d",1
"warframe is a great game. not everyone will like it because of the 3rd person shooter aspect of it, but even so its a good game worth getting.",1
"pretty fun but kinda repetitive and grinding but you can do lots of fun tricks in all levels and the weapons r great plus all the different powers r really cool",1
"very good game ! well even tho u go back and forth in the same levels! still a awesome game ! really recommend playing if u want to have fun for free !",1
"havent played much at all but this game look and feels really cool overall, i like the style of play and would highly reccomend friends to download this game",1
"love this game but i wish i could play on my mac book pro ;(",1
"its an action oriented hack and slash rpg mmo, featuring ninjas in powered armor doing parkour. if you arent sold yet on that alone well.......its not bad when it comes to grinding items, and even when you do, it doesnt feel like work because of the pace and intensity of the game. so far its one of the kinder communitys i have encountered in an mmo. give it a shot, its free and its fun.",7
"the game is very fun, with great gameplay, a interesting story and you do feel like a ancient powerful warrior striking down his foes. plus its a four player co-op game which makes it even more enjoyable.",3
"very atmospheric and pretty. action is fun and fast. has cyborgs n .",1
"here is warframe pros: weapons= swords,guns, bows, kunai, shurikens, claw type weapons, fist type weapons, skills= (too awesome to describe with mere words) classes= tanks, supports, fighter, range, etc. community= cool, helpful, cooperative,[ inster other nice words of your choice] and the occasional troll clans= dojos, clan wars, etc cons: cheats= some clans make alliances and cheat the system to keep hold of dark sectors rank= fix the rank button i wanna trade and get out of rank 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"man this game is so addicting, theres not one day where i get home from school waiting to talk to my warframe buddies wreck the void. and with archwing, things got better, and a hell of a lot more buggy. ive started crashing a lot, which pisses me off, but i plan on reinstalling soon, soon as in tomorrow. i love this game, and you will too.",10
"lots of fun and plenty of hours difficult to find anything negative about this game other than the limited choise of starting warframes",1
"its like destiny... but free... and actually on pc!",1
"today, my space ninja shot an arrow and decapitated six people, then i ran up a wall, did a backflip, and cut some guy in half while my wolf/dog bit his buddys face off. this is the most dangerous of animals - multi/solo viable, persistance, progression based, action oriented, visually appealing, and playable in bite-sized chunks or long game sessions. a lot of people should probably avoid it. i should probably avoid it.",3
"fun at first, but got old fast for me. probably better to play with three other friends.",1
"this game is so sick, the gameplay s awsome you just gonna feel like a badass ninja. you will never finish to evolve, to discover.the only bad point is that is a bit repetitive but this game is surely in my top 5. dont mind my fault im french",2
"let me just start out by saying i love love love this game. however, (and as much as id like to support the guys and gals whore developing this masterpiece) i cant afford to make many financial investments in it, seeing as im a student. also, i might be classified as a more casual player since im too busy to have long gaming sessions very often, so my review might be a bit skewed. now that thats established, on to the review! in my experience, not having money to spend on warframe has in no way diminished its playability. sure, you have to wait a while to have weapons, frames and the likes forged, but because im so busy the time just flies by and im back in with a new piece of kit. the drop in-out multiplayer is awesome (sometimes i bite off a lot more than i can chew with the missions, so im glad for help), and the sense of community throughout the game is incredible. not once have i been belittled for not spending money on vanity items; its all about your skill level. a bit more about the actual game: the fluidity of movement is amazing. ive never been much of a third person shooter person, but watching my vauban doing flips and back-handsprings around the enviornment is nothing short of just plain sweet. if youre into virtual parkour (with guns & swords & powers, of course) this is definitely the game for you. to sum it all up, this fabulous game has sucked up over 200 hours of my time, and ill continue to pour many more into it as long as its around. cheers.",2
"the more i play, the more i cant stop playing. all of the best things in the game cant be bought with real money through the market, which means you actually have to work and farm for the best gear, so it isnt pay to win at all, as some would have you believe. survival & defense missions are surprisingly addicting, and the replay value is obviously there. i would however reccomend not playing the entire game solo, as the matchmaking is fairly solid, and the game is more rewarding when playing with a full team, and laying waste to swarms of enemies. great game with some small issues, but i look passed them overall. recommended for people who are loot junkies and love a good crafting system. the real fun in this game comes from building your gear and ranking it up. as you can see, i like warframe, and i actually plan on spending money on it, which most f2p games dont get me to do, but im enjoying it a lot more than i thought i would.",5
"do you see this game? why is not game of the year? you get to be an outer space robot with ninja like skills and guns and swords and . holy . i came from just looking at the screenshots. you can customize your kickass robot in any color. this is free to play. do you know what that means? you dont have to pay for anything. 10/10 would totally .",1
"okay, so ive played a ton of this game, so as a founder, i find this game wonderful. the graphics are sweet, the guns are cool, the gameplay is fast. but, for a newcomer, i dont know how it would fair. try it out for a few hours id say. i personally love it and have weekends where its all i want to play, but the grindy feeling of it is not for everyone.",2
"loved this game. it is fast. easy to learn. shame it is not available for mac.",1
"good game and since it sync with ps4 make this game more interesting",1
"nice game! can more better, but have a little hard in control.",1
"this is a typical free game in which you can pay to level up faster or pay for extra weaponry instantly. however, it is possible to play every single aspect of warframe without putting in a single cent and it will still be an enjoyable experience. 8/10 a good mix between grinding and fun.",1
"10 minutes in and im like..holy crap.. shut up and take my money.. oh wait, its free! i must be dreaming (pinches self) nope, not dreaming lol seriously, get this game..you wont regret it.",1
"for fun.  story, ier music. but fun knifings and pewpew.",1
"ok game for f2p model and.... ninja space?? hell yeah!",3
"didnt think id be able to say this: warframe is the best game ive ever played. even the best wallrunning, gunblazing, trickstering action with stunning visual (and highly scale-able for older rigs, even on-board vga intel hd4600 works!) gets boring and repetitive at times but regular updates keep things interesting. despite my positive view, the balancing is far from logical especially in pvp mode but the game focus is more about diversity and co-op action: some tools are better for certain situation than others and player skills make things viable.",2
"a game i would recomend to everyone. great gameplay, very fun, fast paced, evolving. the developers are great as well, constantly updating, upgrading, adding, and actually fixing things.a true f2p you can buy stuff, but most of what you can buy with real cash can be obtained through gameplay and events. the developers listen to the players, and are players themselves, which makes it more likely to be up to date, they also are very interactive with players doing quite a few live shows, answering questions, and taking suggestions, they are a fun group to interact and watch. i would give this game a 10/10 very few will ever compare in this rating, but they deserve it. if nothing else try it out, i cant see many being dissapointed.",4
"game is highly adictive, lot of veraity in everything except maybe enemy types , fast paced, team based but solo players might have some fun with hard runs. you can earn everything in this game except cosmetics though they come on ocasional alerts so patience is vertue. those who dont mind grinding will find this game to suit their taste.",3
"i want this game but my pc is to old for it :s im so mad :(",1
"this is the best online shooter game recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",1
"patience simulator 2014 10/10 would play in the next 12/24/72 hours",1
"this is one of the best f2p co-op games that ive played. great game to play with a group of friends. pretty amazing looking for a f2p and interesting fighting styles/warframes that can accommodate anyones playstyle - damage, support, tanky, etc.",2
"this game is fantastically fantastic! a game that satisfies you to bring out your adventurous self and makes you always feel at the tip of the iceberg. intense but fun. 10/10 recommend playing this game. also, reminds me of destiny for some reason...",1
"this is my first game that ive ever played and i can say with upmost confidence that this game... is truly fantastic! not only playing by yourself but also playing with your friends. there is so much to offer. ive been playing this game from the early stages but had to stop playing for school. however i will be returning back to this amazing community with amazing youtubers having gameplay of new features almost every single day. i just hope that my pc is able to run it, since im sure there has been graphical updates since ive left to make the game more beautiful and stunning that it is now. im also so glad that i can play this game on my ps4 and also play it on the pc, the fun never stop whether im downstairs or upstairs on my computer. the way that warframe has truly expanded is breath taking achievement. for it to be such a huge success as it is, featuring as one of the most popular games and yet still be free to play it yet again a huge achievement. i hope to see warframe become a more of an excellent game as it is at the moment.",1
"great game, but full of bugs and the netplay is rubbish sometimes... other than that its good to play with friends",1
"its a great f2p game very cool designs and locations, must play game.",1
"very good sci-fi third person shooter, lots of characters and weapons to play with the potential of lots of game time.",9
"a great underrated game although a bit time consuming and new content is always being added. i have nothing to complain about.",2
"this game is amazing with friends. if you are thinking of playing this game do it with friends. its great! even when i get bored i still end up playing this game again....and again :d",1
"this game is freaken awsome even when it is in beta stage",1
"an interesting blend of platforming and third person shooting that is constantly evolving, thanks to an active community and a development team that communicates with said community. i look forward to seeing where its going, as well as helping it get there!",6
"its like gears of war, mass effect, vanquish, ninja gaiden and dynasty warriors all had a baby. its beautiful.",1
"i dont like concept of this game, its boring and confusing.",1
"94h of gameplay and played since closed beta or beta i think, anyway this game is a great game for people who like teamwork,tactics,parkour and making friends fast id say this is the best 2013-2014 free to play game so far, i hope you make more games warframe, amazing!",2
"firstly, this is not a p2w game like most of the f2p games out there, just pay2rush. all items can be bought with in-game currencies except cosmetics. second, it offers great graphics and even greater optimization that allows you to run the game smoothly everytime. third, lots of weapons and customizations. fourth, the developers are hardworking, expect multiple hotfixes and updates daily or weekly. if you care about the in-game and steam achievements thingy, its currently broken but who says it wont get fixed. lastly... just go and play it already!",1
"the space nija game haha warframe is a fun fast paced fps and it free to play you can craft evrything and you can pay to seed up the crafting time or not its up to you",7
"fun and addicting, however to do anything you have to grind way too much. also on the rank up missions you can run out of ammo and energy and be left completly unarmed?? seriously, why? the enimies drop massive amounts of rifle ammo but almost no arrows so i cannot even complete the first rank mission becasue i run out of ammo and auto fail. fix this. the game is an 8/10 but could be 9 or even 10 if you fix the little things like that.",1
"this game makes you feel like tenno skoom. achievements are pretty wonky, however. sometimes they dont seem to register.",1

"a good game if you enjoy endless grinding. invest twenty or so dollars in unless you want to since 50+ hours grinding for weapons and other items. still an enjoyable game. do not play alone though because it can get un fun very quickly. i would also suggest a decently good computer to run it.",1
"dont judge the meta score. most of it is outdated since the patch. i tried it the first time a long time ago and i hated it. but i came back after some time and wow! it amazes me that this game is free to play. i absolutely recomend this game. if you look closely at the meta score it only scored average on the critics side out of a few people. look for the user reviews, then join me in glorious space ninja action!",1

"another really good f2p game that isnt pay to win, the trading system within the game really evens out the odds for people complaining about not being able to afford the premium currency. the community is very cooperative and non-toxic compared to other f2p games out there currently, and is defintley worth a shot if you have lots of time you want to kill.",2
"this game is porn for ninjas what is good about this game: combat weapon choice graphics character customization awesome ship to walk around in what is bad about this game: brutal enemies long wait times for a squad join you cant do the mission solo unless you hide a lot weapons are hard to find or too expensive",1
"very polished gameplay for any game, not just f2p. i put more hours into this than any other game in my library. definitely recommend this game.",3
"86/100 excellent graphics, intriguing storyline, good matchmaking system for pve and very hard to put down the game if you like being a bad@$$ space ninja with machine guns, rifles, magnums, pocket smgs, compound bows, katanas, whips, kunais, throwing stars, etc... the only complaints i have are that there is no offline mode where you can still be a bad@$$ space ninja and slice up your enemies (and slice up the already-sliced-up body parts in midair) and that you have to grind so much if you cannot or will not spend money on a game. edit: forgot to mention that single-player is very difficult. seems like with more players in a mission, the mission can potentially get exponentially easier, but the possibility of lag goes up at an almost equal amount.",1
"i really dig the play-style and the flow of this ftp. not to mention the graphics are really neat. definitely woth looking into if you are low on cash as i am.",1
"i recommend this game for multiple reasons... lets start with price. its free. now that that is out of the way, i think this game has a great story to it and it isnt obsessively repetitve and boring. this game also has good graphics for being free to play and i would actually pit it against serveral pay-to-play games. the modes of play on this game are somewhat limited but other features of this game make up for that entirely. warframe gives players a massive personalization platform from which to work and idealize their gameplay. this game isnt the best thing that exists, but it is a very good game that has lots of appeal to a wide variety of gamers. another side note would be to overlook the fact that this is a 3ps. when i saw that it looked like a major detractor from the outside, but once i started playing, it really opened up my mind. this game does still have its minor glitches and issues, but the team behind it does a fantastic job at ironing out the problems where they can. i highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to experience something you dont normally see in a shooter.",3
"for a person that isnt into many shooter games i really enjoyed this, but it seems ive grown tired of it. i enjoy the events and such but otherwise it was a good phase between my friends and i.",1
"awesome game!!!! but cant play with my friend pls fix it",3
"amazing game. graphics are pretty great,it has lots of tilesets and enemys to kill. ton of weapons to use and warframe to get. insane grinding though and lots of rng. still really fun though. platinum is a tad expensive but you dont need to buy anything if you dont want to. no storyline atm though because its still in beta. ill update this when they add a storyline. rate: 8.9/10",10
"love this game! if you like games where you get to kill tons of enemies, try different builds, and mess around with your buddies, then give this game a shot! it takes time, but everything can be done without paying a dime (if you need to save!).",6
"its a really fun game but i only got it for ps4 so i dont play it on pc at all :",1
"first and foremost: free. that virtue alone gives this game a huge plus to being recommended. you have nothing to lose by trying it. graphically this is one of the best free games ive played. its right up there with many top notch (as of 2013) pay to play games. the distant future ninjas in space premise isnt delved into very deeply lore wise. true lore and story gamers wont find much depth here to stimulate the imagination. players who prefer solo play will have fun for a while, but it will get repetitive. the game really shines in its multiplayer. group up with some pals (up to 4 of you) and ninja your way through a level as fast as possible annihilating the ai, picking up drops as fast as possible - its a feast of visual, reflex, and team work video game fun. it really serves strongly those gamer who love to min/max and find the ultimate way to manipulate the mechanics to make your team of pals godlike in its slaying, looting, collecting, building items glory. - solo/lore players i give this game 12-24 hours of game play enjoyment before boredom. - multiplayer co-op power gamers up to 100s of hours.",1

"a free-to-play game worth all the time and effort. a variety of items to use, to build, to get,... you can never tire from its gameplay. ever expanding, only time will tell when it will stop. worth all the money too if you were to spend on the in-game items.",4

"i had this on my old computer that old peice of junk and this game was absolutley astounding! it played on that old toshiba i had, but seriously this game is amazing you dont even need a beefy computer to play it. this game is an astounding 8/10 for me. i recomend this whole heartidly.",1

"this game starts of kinda boring and har because you dont really now what you can do with your weapons and frame (modding). but as soon as you got the hang of it it is a really amazing game, alot of content in the form of different frames, weapons, mods and randomly generated mission areas. it is best to play with friends though since the hosting system aint perfect right now. so play and it gl hf",4

"good for quick action, very fast paced, however it can get very grindy as you progress and start looking for specific drops.",1
"warframe is a very smooth game and it is in beta, but i know that the makers of the game are doing a very job at keeping the game to how the community wants it to be. warframe is all out space ninjas which you dont see everyday. the tenno (your player) are very skilled in the art of parkour. they can run on walls, do flips, you name it. they added a new one to the newest update 11.0. the tenno as well carry a primary, secondary and meele. i usually go sneaky and go with the bow and kunai but you can do whatever you wish in a mission. warframe is a free to play game, but they have it balanced to suit the people who dont want to pay. there is a blueprint system where you can buid the items by farming in the planets that have the necessary items. warframe is a good game overall and i wish that it will be very popular on the ps4.",1
"too much fun. kind of frustrating with the logitech f710 controller, though.",1
"this game is pretty fun its hard if you play alone so i advise you find a couple of friends to play with you. its kind of like mass effect 3 multiplayer",1
"first thing you will notice when you start warframe (for the first time) is that its different then any other mmo or f2p. the visuals are stellar let alone the artstyle ,the combat is dynamic and fun ,the athmosphere is fantastic and even the universe in general is very interesting. normally none or just a few of these things are in ordinary mmos or f2ps. but warframe has them all cause its brave enough to deliver a triple-a experience as a f2p game with fair microtransactions ,even when the market is currently overpriced. however warframe is still in beta so everything is subject to change until it gets fully relased.",3
"one of the best f2ps ive played in a while, if not ever. the idea of it being co-op based makes pay to win almost impossible, which is great! only problem, is that even though its technicly still beta, theres a lot of bugs/glitches. hopefully by release that will be sorted out.",1
"variety, fun, great co-op opportunities, lots of features and you dont have to spend a peny to enjoy the game, by yourself or with others. definitely a must-play for anyone interested in f2p games.",4
"this game is epic if u got nothing to do,its just a have fun game :d",1
"nice free fps. high pace combat and fun to play with friends. missions tend to repeat themselves.",1
"love this game. it can be a bit of a grind tho, fun, never the less.",1
"do you like calises on your wrists? do you like carpal tunel syndrome? do you like your fingers twiching involuntarely, causing acidental key presses? if you answered no to any of these questions, this game is not for you. seriously addicting. the grind can be rough, or very rewarding. you can be the poor soul spending 100+ hours to farm for one missing component (like me) and have one of your friends get it in 30 minutes. the graphics are nice. eyecandy is always welcome. it is a little glitchy. ive joined games where im stuck out of the boundaries of a room, or ive slid one inch too far and been catapulted out of the map. sound is nice, though i mute the music. epic ninja drums can only be enjoyed for so long. my one complaint is how expencive the cash shop is. $20 for a single warframe? i can get 30 days of game time in most games for that kind of money, with all of the goodies included. also, you will need to either farm a lot to get some platinum, or sink real money in here, because you will want more frames than you have room for, and you only get room with cold hard cash, or platinum. overall, i quite enjoy this game.",5
"its a pretty awsome game but the 5 missions to get everything you need on your ship are a little bit dumb the game is good the graphicks are great,you still need to stay in training wheals to get the hang of somethings i r8 it 9/10",1
"this game is awesome!!! so much fun to slice people in half and have blood go everywhere. :) 11/10",2
"despite initial promise, the developers have given up any pretence of fixing the game or adding content - choosing instead to flood as much cash store content as possible. highly disappointing.",6
"its so so and lost playablility after the first few missions. to me it all seems the same.",1
"great overall game, lots of variety with warframe customization and weapon selection. when you start off it does seem extremely grind oriented though. after 900+ hours, i am still enjoying the game :)",8

"i had low expectations for warframe and thought i would never get hooked in any other free to play game than the almighty team fortress 2, i was so wrong! ( bought and played since 2009. 4400 hours of pure fun ) warframe is extremely grinding game (be warned) yet it feels like it has the absolute best progression system ever, its highly polished and addictive even the first 30 mins of the tutorials. its not open world game yet it feels like you have freedom ! i dont know how the game designers achieved that ! 8/10",2
"a bit more lag than id enjoy, but overall i enjoy my time playing this game and at the end of the day i will be found playing defense missions for circuits",2
"although i do recommend this game the replay is not very high. very repetitive, if you play online everyone just rushes through levels at super high speeds, best played solo if you want a challenge. lots of mods and warframes so the customization is there. if you do spend money on this game use it to buy weapon and warframe slots because what they give you doesnt allow you to stockpile much.",1
"now this game is a good game, but not for everyone. the game is more like a grinding rpg then a arena shooter. the purpose of this game is simple, fight in the game to get better items so you can fight again with better items. its a cycle, and a loot shooter. it also takes a while before you can get any good items, (without paying money). once you put about 24 hours into the game is when the game gets fun, you have lots of warframes and weapons and abilitys. you collect cards which boost stats to you and your weapons, and this game is very fun if you have a squad to play with. there is some different game modes, (which is about 8), and different daily challanges. get this game if you have a lot of time on your hands and want to put some time into a great co-op game with a steep learning curve.",1
"this game is ing epic...ancient space races fighting for the galaxy,breathtaking graphics,nice customization and weapons too.the gameplay is great.you can go pve solo,with a group or public.then you can create a clan and go pvp or play public pvp on conclaves.great great game i love it so much.the warframes are really awesome too.unique and powerful if played well.my fave is loki.you should try him out",1
"its a game with pyschic robot ninjas in space fighting evil communist space pirates. it has cool combat with realistic katana combat and cover shooting that is a delight to partake in. it also has all the sliding you can have. best part? it is allows you to play missions with your friends (mostly) seamlessly. the only problems that i can really say is that it can be repetitive at times and some missions are buggy but the developers frequently update this game so problems are always fixed. try this game out with your friends preferably and get ready to have to goofy ninja fun.",1
"i dont have a lot of experience with sci-fi games... the only games of this genre i can remember playing and liking is the deus ex and mass effect games... i cant recommend this game as a full-time-sink... at least not yet... :p i have been playing warframe only for a few days, but have enjoyed the experience immensely (lets see how it goes from here). the art style is something fresh for me and very detailed (even the loading screens have theyre nice touches and its fun watching them, especially when you have a squad). there are a lot of warframes (or classes that satisfy i think all of the play styles) to choose from. as a new player you get to choose only from 3, but dont worry you can get the rest by collecting materials, blueprints through the game and then creating the option to use them. i think that the customization options are enough for a free account. you can add mods that enhance health, abilities, armor and setera, weapons (not in the beginning), add sentinels (or pets if you like)... the combat is fun, its flashy, even tactical, but not too strategical (since everyone just runs and shoots their magazine out as fast as possible :d), sadly repetitive (since the enemies are always one and the same)... the abilities are fun, at the beginning you have to choose which ones to take for which mission (or maybe its just me :d)... co-up is fun, but you can also play online if you dont have friends to play with or go solo... and its free!! :d",1
"since update 11.0, warframes taken a much more interesting turn; its damage 2.0 system allows for interesting elements to the gameplay, giving real depth to weapon customisation and forcing a player to have a variety of weapons to counter any setbacks. the games newest boss additions have been positive, allowing for a more team-based element without compromising the single player experience. at the end of the day, single player is still enjoyable, though harder missions are incredibly difficult to do. the core gameplay is rock-solid (with the occasional bug (portforward if you want an easier time connecting)), and mostly satisfying. there are still a few glitches in the game that hinder it slightly, (ui problems, animations bugs) but they wont seem so big. the game also encourages players to be social; clans offer bonuses, nightmare modes require teamwork to get through, and pvp offers a fresh break from whaling on npcs. weapon and warframe variation is impressive, to say the least. weapons, warframes, gear, equipment, powers; all these are important for your build and your playstyle. if you want to experience ninjas in space, this game is most definitely for you.",5
"very good game. graphics are superb, gameplay is fastpaced and satisfying. the only down side is that there is little endgame other then: level up more weapons and warframes.",4
"space ninjaaaas!! in spaaaace!! or sometimes not but that doesnt matter fun game, lots of killing, can be repetitive and items take a while to get...",3
"action-packed based in a great sci-fi/space enviroment. great free-to-play model. frequent updates. very smooth combat animations with beautiful overall graphics. the good: graphics, animations, models, weapon variety, enjoyable endgame content, sounds. the bad: maximum of only 4 players per mission, no dedicated servers(yet).",3
"not really a fan of the creepy ergonomic armor designs, but the game is great. there ought to be more mission-based pve free-to-play games like this.",1
"this game is one of the best games i have played ever. this free game is what it is free. the game basicly gives everything away for free, the warframes (classes basicly), weapons (main, secondary,and melee), sentinals (basicly like the pet of dungeon defenders) and accessibility to missons. the only thing you actual even need real money for ingame are slots to hold all your items, and some cosmetic stuff (color palettes, skins,etc.). the game is action packed and loads of fun, i have about 300 hours into this game and still loving it. this game could have easily been sold regualar aaa prices and would have sold loads of copies. it is avalable on ps4 also if your computer is not good enough to run it.",10
"awesome graphic, lots of explosions, gore. if you have a  youll love it.",2
"this game can is a bit boring when you first start, but afer a short while, you will get into a play to get new gear kind of game. it is definatly more fun than call of duty.",1
"pretty cool game feels like mass effect , would be playable for longer if it had tdm",1
"wall running gliches u over the place once in a while but in all its a good game, its my best game",3
"the best game ive ever played so far, exactly what every gamer wants and needs, its free to play in which you can get everything inside the game so it is not considered to be pay-to-win for any reason even though you can pay and get platinum but even without paying you can trade items and obtain them. it has swords, it has rifles, it has a lot of stuff to do, just epic, i recommend it to every single gamer out there!",3
"ninga mixed with science in space do i need to say more and pets",1
"game is amazing, almost perfect in its genre. trying to get better upgrades, or upgrade your upgrades though, a little bit of a grind. also run out of things to do after a while, but there is still plenty of gameplay. right now the game is around 8.5 / 10 another update or two with more weapons and frames makes it an easy 9 or 9.5.",1
"warframe is a awesome multiplayer game but make sure you have a good p.c.",1
"60 hours in and still only through half the planets. there is at least 100 hours of content in this game.",1

"one of the best casual fighting games ive ever played. free to play, friendly communities and team spirit is highly valued. the only downside is bugs... they do exist. however, we can look at it on another point of view... this is a work in progress game. always adding new stuff for players! well done guys!!!",10
"this game if fantastic on only visualy but the gameplay itself is amazing but the only problem i got with it is the internet if you know how to fix this problem then comment in my review but yeah its worth checking it out",1
"lots of fun, but it does get old if you play it often like i did.",1
"i love it already only played for 5 hours so far but seriously a great game, will happily pay for add ons because its so good! also players are more friendly with each other and there are no real haters :)",1
"this is one of the best f2p games ive played, great for coop with friends. does get repetitive though.",2
"some people said that this!, its the free-to-play version of destiny...",1
"if you like ninga type of games..then this is the game",2
"this game is getting better you should try it its free,seriously.",3
"fantastic co-op shooter. you can play solo if you prefer and there is still a sense of challenge. rank up your warframe, weapons and minion bot and add mods to customise their damage and shields. clan dojos you can build up together with materials that drop in missions. the item store is purely for cosmetic or to rush getting weapons/warframes. everything in the shop can be acquired in-game.",2
"recommended. its really a great start for a f2p. plus it has so much fantasy to offer. the graphics are really that great. boss fights are really okay. role playing and third person shooting combined. the only thing lacking is the storyline and environment. gameplay, excellent for my opinion. go on, try it. see for yourself.",3
"great mmo with a mass effect feel to it. it may become repetitive, but im sure theres much more content to come over time. its always fun slicing up enemies with a sharp blade!",1

"pretty fun game. gets repetitive but it is still quite enjoyable to play.",1
"amazing game! love where de is taking the game. im mastery rank 11, love some of the new warframes and weapons that are being added.",5
"a very good and enjoyable game with wide options and things to do.",2
"this game takes a lot of getting used to. there is a point where you go from squishy little soldier to blood-hungry powerhouse so dont let the beginning scare you off. there is no pay-wall short of cosmetics. its still in beta but youd swear its a complete game. it run fantastically short of a few hiccups. overall id recommend the  out of this games. its too much fun.",10
"i really like this game and i recommend this game to all of you guys :d (^_^)",3
"you know whats fun, acting like a ninja. you know whats funner? killing things while being a ninja along with your fellow ninjas.",4
"this game doesnt work properly for me. i keep redownloading it and either it fails downloading the game or the game itself starts when its still downloading which gives poor gameplay, missing textures, longer loading-screens.",1

"did you ever want a game that was so easy and threw a bunch of xp in your face? well this game is definitely for you! they even have a lot of mods to make it even easier! for people who want easy, this is for sure a 11/10 game. for people who want a little challenge with their game, a game that actually feels like you are doing something and not just running around tapping the e key, this game is bad. real bad. 1/10.",1

"this is the best grinding then wait an hour simulator ever",1
"its a very good fast pace game,combining melee action and shooting in one package.so,for those who prefer both of those,warframe is the right choice",1
"its a pretty decent game, but it gets boring after awhile, being that all the levels are almost completely identical. the game is good to kill time, but if you really want to get into it, its a pay-to-win game. if you pay, you will really pay a lot being that everything you can buy, that is usefull is 20$ and up.",1
"my dreeam came true -mmorpg+fps = who need girlfriend when u can play warframe?!",1
"truly a wonderful free to play title, its a bit on the grindy side, and can overwhelm you when starting out, but youll find a friendly community and engaging co-op gameplay behind a very generous f2p model.",3
"game is great pretty much warfarm ill give it ten os",5
"its so good. they even made warframe p0rn. google it :d",2
"awesome game, really good gameplay and story about the tenno and what not but very buggy like ive only had 12 mods but id meant to have 100+ so can this very annoying glith be fixed because my shilds and health are not enough now",3
"after all these hours hooked into the game, i gotta say i recommend it, a lot! the games focused on pve and youre really able to get everything but cosmetics for free (skills!). there are also a lot of pvp occasions stabilished in a 4v4 format. until now, the communitys being amazing, ive only encountered 1 or 2 anti-social/troll guys. also, i feel like i never get stuck. whenever i feel somethings too hard, i can always try alternate routes, kill bosses for other warframe parts, farm materials for stronger weapons, buy a sentinel... i think this game does honor to the f2p format! (so much i invested a bit in it!)",2
"highly recommend this even on the xbox one it is simply amazing xd",1
"the main question is warframe worth downloading? answer yes this game offers both single player and multiplayer experiences. with the clans you can join up with friends to complete missions together. the void offers good credits (money in warframe) for you to buy blueprints and build the weapons you want. foundery is the place where the building takes place although you can rush the building process along by using platinum (you can buy with irl money) to speed it up. overall warframe is a game i have enjoyed playing for a while with my friends and still do.",2
"spess ninjers, alien dogeh, arcwing duck. whats not to love.",1
"this game is incredibly good for a free to play. it runs fairly well on computer with a dedicated recent graphics card and has the most detail i have ever seen in a free to play game. highly recomended that you download this game adn try it out!!!",1
"everyone is different, even our opinion. i really enjoy this game even if it could be titled as boring by others due the amount of grinding you will need to do to obtain a new weapon, warframe, upgrade your current one or get a mod and upgrade that. and the best thing in this game is if you just want to spend 10 minutes before you go out with your mates or wait for someone, then you can play for only 10 minutes but if you want to spend your whole day, you can play in this way as well and it will be rewarding if you do it well. the only problem with the game is the hosting issues. i havent got a bad internet at all, but im unable to host because everyone will have terrible lag and there is many disconnects and it can be really depressing when you spent 45 minutes in a t4 survival or you were at the 40th wave in odd (if you start to play, you will learn these thing quickly) and you will be dropped back to the menu (which is your ship and looks awesome) losing everything you were fighting for. except this thing, the warframe is a brilliant game. give it a try!",4

"well, i have warframe for the ps4. i put about 100 hours into it, so i feel quite obligated to do a review on the game. i have to say it is probably one of most fun games i have played since, the borderlands, mw2 times. the game is sorta based off of space, where you play through missions in all planets. there is usually a boss or two at the last mission in a planet. the planets get harder and harder as you get around space. there is no real story, or maybe just not any effort into it. i could see a possible story. but of course it would be confusing. there probably is a story, but again its confusing. you can build weapons, buy them, customize your warframe. there are many warframes; excaliber, rhino, etc. trust me there is alot more than what i listed about the game. i honestly reccomend this game for all gamers whether what preference you have or not. a flawed, but a great mmo. flaws could be easily fixed with an update or two. so, therefore beyond the flaws. warframe is an amazing, truly beautiful, fun game to play especially with friends. very time-consuming. 9.5/10.",1
"warframe is an instance based mmo 3rd person action game in which you take the role of a tenno controlling a warframe (powersuit) and go on missions around our galaxy in the extreamly distant future. the game starts you off with a quest line that gives you a very basic understanding of the lore. however the rest of the lore is pretty blurred and if you care for that, youll be figuring it out on your own and if you dont care, then it isnt in your face past the first mission set. pros: -diverse weapons and warframes allowing any playstyle to be fully relised -modding system allows even further tailoring -rng missions will never give you the same layout when running an instance -in-depth damage mechanics allow for rich and complex combat builds -pay to look cool/pay to hurry up slightly. everything that is game changing is able to get without dropping a dime cons: -early game feels quite grindy if you arnt in love with the combat -ui can glitch out, fading to being barely visable or disappering completly. not a hard fix but can get annoying tl;dr: in space ninjas",4
"space ninja! now that rather new. good graphic, good effects, nice system, more like grinding to maxed your suit and weapons but in a fun way. 9/10 from me :)",3
"probably one the of the best free to play games currently available on steam. great support by the developer and fun and addictive gameplay. one of the few free to play games i dont mind giving some money to in order to support this. highly recommend this to any one who likes 3rd person action shooters and fast pace action.",4
"a great looking game that only gets more fun when you play with friends. it is a true free to play game, you can make anything in game except for a few cosmetic items that dont do anything. you can get a shortcut using platinum if you arent patient, but i think the journey to make a new warframe, weapon, sentinal, etc is more fun to do that just getting the item itself from a store. really fun game modes and some challenging enemies. clans are also fun to make and hang out with your friends in your clan dojo, a customizable space station built piece by piece by your clan. hope you get the game so the community gets even better.",1
"what a pile of rubbish controls are clunky and slow to respond the multiplayer sucked so bad you get put into matches with people 500% above you that fly trough doing everything while your still learning the controls then they get annoyed because your not where they are... not worth the time of day tbh",1
"its a very very very good game the first few hours are abit  but when you get into the game and start understanding the game [i suggest watching some videos] you will love the game and as far as the free2play part of this game is, in the game you can get all the weapons and warframes everyone has access to all the weapons and warframes the premium currency is plat and if you dont buy plat you can still get the same stuff as other people it requires a blueprint and the items to craft it and theres a crafting time weapons take 12-24hr and warframes take 3days if you buy things with plat you avoid all those steps and the item is just added to your inventory. i see no pay2win in this game theres only a tiny bit with cataylist and reactors but they are alerts for them all the time.",3
"its a fun shooter, but only if your into shooters. for me its a game i come back to. this game wants you to work as a team without talking. it can become a pain not be able to talk to your team. what hurts the game for me is my online connection because i got 1mb/s to 654kb/s and i get lag. i dont blame the game on that because a buddy of mine has a connection at 5mb/s to 2.5mb/s at its lowest. has no lag at all.",1
"awesome game, i just wish they would put in a full on story line!",1
"yes, is a free2play, but not so pay2win (even if for obtain all good stuff takes so much time... and when i say so much is so much)",1
"the biggest draw back to this game is it seems pretty much p2w although qas far as i can tell there is no actual pvp. the warframes are neat, and i dont like the fact that to play as a female i have to spend 5 dollars for a female warframe pack wth. the mission are ok there is very little tutorial about anything in the game imho, and i think it would be fun to spend an hour or so every once in awhile with a group of 4 friends running through a few of the missions",1
"1. monday = omg so boring, next tuesday = um its ok, wednesday =oh gosh killing in it! :d, thursday 24/7, friday oh my gosh best game eva! sun and sat i played 24/7 two days straight. :p",1
"its a scifi game where you shoot people in the face and cut them in half. whats not to love? 10/10",1
"think of a 3rd person shooter. now add space, now add ninjas, now powers like in dishonored, now add weapon customization and unique gameplay and beautiful graphics. mind blown yet?",6
"this has been the best free to play game so far! the developers are really close to the community and the graphics are great! as you can see, in my profile, this is my most played game... 500+ hours!",5
"i can, without a doubt, certainly say, that warframe, is okay. better than most tps/co-op games out there, plus its f2p, so its worth it. but, its still only okay. great with friends, but otherwise... dont bother. get friends to play with you or dont play at all.",1
"warframe is overall a badass online co-op tps, once you start to play the game and get used to playing it trust me you will not want to stop playing the game. the game has different types of modes that go from survival missions to defending the objective from enemies. there are three types of factions 1.corps 2.infested and 3.grinear. the game runs smooth when running on medium setting and even if its on medium setting the game animations and everything. you can join up with friends and create your own clan witch you can challange them to a spar to doing projects on guns, melees, bows, and ect. you can build warframes, melees, guns, bows, and ect. i have a problem once i downloaded the game and i tried it i cant stop playing i even pulled an all nighter playing the game. im just telling you once you download this game and play it... you will need to go see a doctor..",6
"this is probably the best game ive played since skyrim. all i can say is, what a ride. i havent got to the point where theres excessive grinding yet, so im still kind of in the honeymoon phase with this. the graphics in this game are exceptional, the gameplay is amazing, the levels get a teeeeeny bit repetitive, but not too badly. i started as excalibur and i love it. obviously, when you start off, you do have to pay some real cash to get new warframes or items immediately, but how else do you expect a free game to get their moneys worth for making the game? i have heard people say that you can buy or trade for things in the in-game player market. overall 9.5/10 all day.",2
"two words: space ninjas. its an awesome game especially with some friends. give it a go if you havent yet.",4
"a repetitive grind fest but yet still fun. a lot of different warframes classes and weapons seem to help keep it interesting. i would recommend it for some good mindless fun/killing.",1
"an addictive third person fps with a unique blend of sci-fi and mech elements. this game does not require grinding at all and most of the contents are easily attainable without having to pay . all in all , for a f2p game , this game is a must for those who seek an adventure in a modern sci-fi universe.",1
"for a free to play title, this is one of the best youre going to get. hell, it hold its own with full price retail games in my opinion. extremely solid shooter mechanics mixed with thousands of updrage combinations for each weapon make this the definition of replayability. the leveling system works well, with newer players slowly getting intorduced to new concepts of upgrading, and the ability to powerlevel new weapons/warframes once you get a solid grasp on how the system is designed. the crafting system in the game can feel like a bit of a paywall, but only for a few select things, such as the nekros warframe, but with enough time, every item in the game can be crafted, so in theory you can unlock every single thing without spending a dime of actual currency. all in all this is a phenomonal game, and because its free to play, you have absolutely nothing to lose.",3
"i highly recommend this game. its fun as hell, and the graphics are amazing. only downside is that its grind-heavy and the in-game shop is run mostly on real money in the form of platinum other than that, its damn great.",3
"diablo + crysis + space + ninjas = warframe. give it a shot, as its completely free (aside from cosmetics). grinding and repetitiveness plague it, but if you like dungeon-crawling-loot-hunting-monster-slaying-pseudo-rpgs, it comes with the territory.",3
"it has great combat mechanics and even funner with friends. if you wanna feel like a badass play this game.",1
"mass effect 3s multiplayer is the closest thing to compare warframe to. youre a ninja. ninja in space. space ninja.",1
"really fun game to play !!!!just give it shot maybe youll like it!",1
"this game has its ups and downs but all in all its a good shooter",1
"this game has a unique combat style that is almost like mass-effect but much faster and more exciting. its highly customizable and its also free! co-op is great fun too with a friend. main problem is the amount of grinding you have to do to get some gear without outright buying it.",1
"space ninjas this game was terribly fun, running on walls and the other ridiculous things you can do kept me laughing so hard. since my (rather long) hiatus, which was pre-update, i seem to have lost myself in this game. i still have my stuff, but the interace, gameplay, and difficulty seem to have all changed on me. i used to be able to fly though the missions i was on, and now i am dieing as soon as i open a door. given, it could be that i am not in-tune with the way i had played the game previous, but something seems to be off and it has got me unsettled on this game. too many young arses and spamming for my taste in chat at the moment, and trying to find someone on a similar planetary system is all but common now.",1
"best co-op fps game i have played yet, if you dont play it you should!!",9
"warframe is a very fun game, while it is geared to be easier for people who pay for their warframes and weapons, you can get everything weapon and warframe without paying. using the crafting system allows you to get everything you need, although it will take longer. i havent payed any real money, but i play the game just as well as anybody who has.",1
"game idea is good, but bad thing that as always u need to pay money for ultra mega wtf game cash and with that ultra mega wtf game cash u buy weapons, warframes and other cool stuff.... yes u can craft them (cool stuff i mean) but for that u need to play 24/7 (i mean u need to play this game a lot) and thats what game creators want... and this trick is kinda bad for f2p game like this... so yeah, its not bad but neither its good...",1
"it is a good game with excellent dynamics with a good addition as of the middle of the battle and the mobility of the characters and do not forget about mods to all weapons and armor that makes the game more exciting",4
"cyborg space ninjas with high powered weapons and machine space familiars. if you dont think this is tight, get out of my face.",3
"fun game, easily accessible paid content for those who wish to play for it, and a blast with friends. includes voice chat in-game as well, which makes communication a breeze. a little buggy, but its to be expected from a game so varied, and they get fixed every week, if not, added new features, too. 8/10",5
"first f2p game ive played that isnt entirely about in game purchases. theres certain shortcuts or cosmetic items you can buy, but the rest of it is attainable by playing the game. theres no insane handicap (for example slower leveling) put on players and no one will have an advantage over you just because they paid. as for the gameplay itself, its crazy how you can go for melee or gunplay. theres a lot of warframes you can build (basically playable characters) with varied abilities and looks. after a while you depend heavily on farming (like any rpg) but it doesnt feel like farming at all. the number of combos, skills and weapons you can use always keep the game fresh. theres also flight combat gameplay you can unlock by doing a quest at a higher level, which i havent unlocked but really shows the ammount of depth this game has. anyway, i barrel rolled off a cliff and headhotted an enemy with my bow in mid air 10/10",3
"a fun third person fps [so long as youre playing with friends]. there is depth to the game, but not enough to make it feel overwhelming. wall running and using abilities on warframes make you feel invincible and makes time start to flow, but at its core it is still a shooter genre and will eventually revert to that. i would suggest this to any hardcore shooter fan, and anyone looking to mess around in a game to have fun (because the early levels deff. supply that urge!)",1
"awesome first person shooter! fun to roll and shoot and wall jump and slice up people with your luminescent sword.",1
"i totally love this game. but it is soo hard to get to know everything. the game is very vague on what to do and how do it. so thumbs down!",1
"great game. you can play the game completely free and just pay for pimp factors.",1
"very fun so far, ive put in about 6 hours. the movement seems pretty clean. i especially like the wall scaling elements, as long as you notice them. i plan to put many more hours into this game.",1
"your a in space ninja with unique individual powers. oh and did i mention you can do parkour?! wall running, wall hanging, all kinds flips. and thats not all, the weapons you use are just as cool. you got big swords, little swords, katanas, two handed swords, daggers, daggers with swords, two daggers. the guns range from the classical shoot with bullets, or ones that have a rediculous amount of fire power, some shoot saws, others shoot sticky white things that explode (kinky developers? i think not!) and shotguns. as well as secondaries, but i cant name them all as to my hands for being tired of typing all of this. anywho, give this game a try, i fell in love with it the moment it was teasered i believe in january? yes its still in beta, but the full version will be free either way. this game is far from being completed, but even farther from being boring. exuce me, my tf2 has finally downloaded.",1
"wonderful game. lots of fun. but i do really wis it was easier to get some of the better equiptment without having to buy platinum.",1
"warframe is a instresting multiplayer/singleplayer action game.i have never seen anything like it before and i think its pretty good in almost all aspects.",1
"surprisingly adictive and full of decent content, gameplay and lore for a free to play game.",1
"this is seriously one of the best f2p games ive ever played, it keeps motivating you, the idea of playing a high-tech future samurai is awesome, and even though its kinda hard to get money and better equipment (like always in a f2p game), you just want to keep on playing for hours. you can either rush into the enemies and kill them with rifles, pistols and your sword, or you can just avoid the enemies, sneek through their lines and kill them from behind. all in all a really good, motivating and fun game! highly recommended!",1
"warframe is an optimized game to run on low or high end rigs. its draw back is the large mircro transaction system where you can not play the full game unless you pay large amounts of money. this is a pay to play, pay to win game.",1
"very fun game despite the grind. can get monotonous, but its still great for some relaxed, mindless face rolling.",1
"fun with friends. a little boring soloing but still fun. community is helpful and talkative. everything is farmable even the cash items (most of them) clan feature isnt so bad but very costy... levelling is halve bad and nothing is tooooo overpowered overall a good game to try out with friends :d",2
"im only a few missions in, but i can see myself sinking a lot of hours into this. good music, tight controls, endless customizations? yes please.",1
"simply awesome...requires a better playstyle though for this slash game.",4
"this game is really good and very unique to play. i recomended you guys out there to play it.",1
"best game by far!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! amasing!!!!!! great to play defintatly recommend it",1
"i have to say that for a free-to-play game, this is really fun. if you like to run/ slide everywhere whilst slicing up enemies then this game is for you. if you like to just shoot them then this can be for you too.",4
"truly a awesome game i have only been playing for a short time and im already addicted cant believe its free to play",1
"best f2p game ever, ive put at least 100 dollars into this game and it was totally worth it.",5
"awesome game!! wish my laptop can handle it so i can play all day long!!",1
"great game! might be hard in the beginning to understand though",3
"warframe is a sci-fi 3rd person perspective game where some space ninjas run around and shoot, slash, and all sorts of other sci-fi stuff an evil empire and a company bent on capturing you and making you look like frankenstein(ex. valkyr). so if you like fast action, intense gameplay and the occasional weird bug or glitch, this game will knock your socks off. not literally though, so you dont have to be worried about that. oh and it has cool graphics. thats really all i have to say.",1
"play in small chunks of time, do not binge on this game. watch your wallet closely. its okay to maybe spend upwards to $25 for the average gaming budget. the game focuses alot on the bait and reward f2p business model. grind and reward, grind and reward. have fun for awhile then take a nice couple days away from the game. that set aside the game itself is very entertaining to the action gamer. hordes of brain dead enemies with many a crazy weapon available to stab, crush, maim, impale, dismember, incinerate, freeze, and electrocute them with to your hearts content. this is also where the game can hook you and then drain your wallet. yes there are plenty of items, but they all require massive amounts of grinding to obtain. or you can pay $15 for that shiny sword instead of playing many ours to obtain it via ingame progress. that being said do not stick around with this game if you dont favor the combat too much. because thats what warframe is, combat, all day everyday. and i ing love it 7.5/10 8/10 with friends",5
"digital extremes is pushing farther and reaching new heights. the game gets a little repetitive at times, but with friends it is never boring!",4
"normally i dont write reviews for f2p games but, this game is a really great game to play! the graphics are pretty good for a f2p game, that ill give it a 8/10. the gameplay is fast pace but, most levels are the same which i believe the reason is due to the enemys base or home planet but, it does change once getting to the outer solar system and ill give it a 7.5/10. i am glad that his game isnt just only a pve only kinda game but, it also has a pvp which gets pretty fun. the best part of this game is that it gets updates almost every day which is really surprising and that ill give a 10/10 on how active the developers are!",5
"warframe is a nice game considering that it is a free to play. dont get it wrong in the beginning: when you start you are underpowered but then you become a nightmare for the enemy. the community is incredibly nice also. the only downside is the repetitiveness of the missions",1
"what really gets me to play this game is the controls. everything really is based on how you can move yourself. after that, customization of you warframe and weapons using mods. from then on it was a perfect mix. it has taken a lot of time away from me, but i do not regret it one bit.",10
"fun for a while, then it just gets repetitive. same maps and modes over and over. then there are times you cant beat a mission because theres no one else playing it. no storyline to speak of and no tutorials. this game has a steep learning curve to do anything other than point and shoot. lots of potential but thats about it. weapons and warframes cap at 30 and still feel rediculously weak when all modded out and fighting enemies half your level. game balance needs a lot of work. leveling up just doesnt feel that rewarding. it reminds me of wow in all the wrong ways, but its worth playing for a few days if you are looking for a free to play, i have seen worse. sadly though i dont see any reason to spend money in the game. after getting everything to lvl 30 and getting my but kicked on some difficult missions with enemies half my ldevel i am glad i didnt spend any money. could be a lot more fun if the devs worked on the game itself and not dumbing down the graphics on the level selectiuon screen! i saw a video of what it looked like at the beginning of 2014 and it was way better than it is now. the level selection screen is one of the most basic and boring interfaces i have seen simply due to poor layout. enough bashing it though, thats the worst of the game, it plays well and it only gets repetitive after putting in 20+ hours, so its good fun at first. maybe it will get fun longer to join a guild and play with more people.",1
"best game ever if anyone want to know how to feel like a ninja and this is the most epic game i ever played",1
"love it. you need to have a quite load of time to be able to gain a lot of stuff though. grinding all the way. and for the record, this is not p2w. you can get blueprint for stuff.",1
"i cant wait to play more of this game its great and the recent updates have made it better!",1
"grindy, fun, addicting, not the norm, weapons feel different to each other all check play this game now the only thing you have to lose is time.",2
"awesome game although i would add a few more weapons.",1
"im recommending this but not passionately, pros and cons are my opinion pros: + nice optimization, not so high system requirements for amazing graphics + gear modding isnt actually a pain but fun + nice fast paced action + good variety of warfames and weapons cons: (remember these are my opinion) - especially least in lower levels game should someway give you some starter < x < medium level blueprints because i had no idea which weapon i could or should craft, i ended up buying many blueprints i cant make or i dont want - i often just got carried by a higher level player and missions are impossible to do alone - i got lost, not knowing what to do, game doesnt seem to have a progressive quest system or any missions of any kind after first short quest - i got stuck with same weapon for ages",1
"this game is awesome. i enjoy every moments inside the game. you feel like a hero that can do everything in your fingertips. thumbs up !!",1
"huge respect for digital extremes, for making a aaa game and give it to us for free. if some money-whoring game companies made a game with quality like this, im sure theyll put $99 for the price. the graphics are outstanding. it runs smoothly on my laptop when other games with worse graphic quality cant even run 30 fps on very low settings. the movements and effects were so beautifully rendered, sometimes i wonder if its really free. my first 4 hours of gameplay was interesting. i didnt explore much at this point, so im gonna say its good enough. the premium item system is quite balanced. half of it was cosmetics, and its not to gamebreaking. another respect for the developers for not using pay2win way. play it. its worth your time.",1
"if you dont enjoy grinding for every element of the game, this game isnt for you.",2
"grindfest... but god is it addictive or what. action game but you choose your playstyle. stealth, shoot, melee, group or solo. i dont like 3rd person games but i will make an exception for this. oh, and ninja like abilities are definitely a bonus",1
"one of the few games where you can run on walls while throwing lightning and stabbing peoples faces, and shooting them. while your friends are shooting them, and running on walls and stabbing things and using super powers. basically super space ninjas in space.",3
"very excellent freegame. watch the trailer and be amazed",1
"great for people who like: sci-fi environments having alternate characters fast paced action learning advanced mechanics color customization guilds/clans loot grinding for rarer items horde modes not recommeded for people who like: a story driven campaign (i believe this is under fruther development) playing solo (without random other players or friends) a melee-only game (while possible, its not easy) exploring every bit of a map (most groups prefer to run through missions/levels)",2
"this game is freaking amazing!!!!!! 5 stars 2 thumbs up!",1
"this game is like phantasy star online but with ninjas! best free-to-play title ive played so far!",1
"its pretty decent, but too much lagg for some reason.",1
"i love this game if you enjoy grinding and getting to feel like you got an awsome reward for that farming then this is your game if you keep up a fast pace and go like the ninja way you can kill every one. the mod are plenty i have been playing for almost 500 hours and you start to see that they put in some filler. if you put the game on ultra for the graphics it looks like your playing a future type tv movie. the lore is lacking but they have said that they may put in some more into it.when they make an update like for version 14,15 exc it always has somthing amazing to offer. the old tutorial is crap compared to the exclent one now for example you can get to chose your own guns and weapons insead of having the crap mk-1 braton,skana, but the lato was good. the mission and events make it so that you cant get bored and when you play void survival it feel like a battle to the death and your fighting and endless wave of enimes. the defense is a bit less then the survival but you have a less priority of caring for your life. the weapon selection is huge i want to try and make all the guns but i have only schratched the surface. the warframe make it so you can adapte to any situation. i recomend if you do get platinum you should save it either to get parts resouces or getting some stuff from the trade tab.i recomend fully that you get this game and even though your bored from farming just for a bit the reward after is the best thing you can get",6
"warframe is an awesome 3rd person shooter action game, many hours of gameplay, some may be repetitive but to play something like this with all the abilities makes it fun, what makes it even more fun is playing with your friends that you can talk to, be it skype etc... there are downsides of course, sometimes server lags and/or glitches within the game that could be fixed, other than that its just an awesome game all the way through. i hope you ladies and gents have fun with this awesome game :d 9/10!",1
"awesome game requires a good computer to handle graphics thou 10/10",1
"this is game is amazing! i have never had so much fun since i found dragon age. if you like the fps genere this is your game!",1
"in my opinion this is a pretty good game. it kinda reminds me of destiny and its got decent graphics, especially considering this is a free to play game. overall this game has hours of bow sniping awesomeness to offer.",1
"i like going right to multiplayer i just dont like singleplayer missions, thats just me but i do like the game it has nice graphics and good customizable characters even the guns too.",1
"its a pretty good game, you can play solo or co-op, cool custumization and weapons, nice work guys",1
"quite fun until you reach a terminal level, then monotonous. i would only play this if you have someone to atleast duo with, otherwise grindy.",1
"very very nice game.if you really need a free and action and graphicy game.this is s nice game for you guys.please play just this game.thanks steam and warframe.",5
"badass mixture of amazing grahics, extreme co-op, third person shooter mechanics and epic parkour",2
"its so very awesome! this is free to play game !!! third person shooter !!! and ninja! that is my category of gaming for me! cause i love ninja, and in the game it was amazing! because there was an attacking style, combos and other ! i love this game!",1
"very fun co-op game with quite a bit of utility, also a great game to play and do stuff with your freinds",8
"as far as free-to-play goes, or even multiplayer games at all, this game is top notch. ive already put a ton of time in and feel like i havent scratched the surface. im also broke and you dont need to spend money on this to enjoy it. really unique game play that goes really fast but you get to plan out the things you craft, the mods you put on your weapons, breeding your dog, and a bunch of other stuff. lots of different kinds of missions and enemy types. mostly shooting or slicing bad guys with other good guys on your team. the maps do get a little repetetive but with alerts and infections things can get changed up alot. highly recommended",3
"great game! fun to play if you have good team-mates, but it is fun to play solo too.",1
"it looks like ninja with nano suit and futuristic weapon, very cool",3
"awesome game! who didnt tried game yet ,should really try it ,from update to update its just getting better and better ,be sure to try it.",5
"a grate game... if u are searching for a 3rd pesone shooter with unlimited movment variations, seacrets, grate combat system and a grate comunity cooperation then this is just the game for u. hury up and start playing!!!",7
"great game, though missions start to feel samey at best",1
"once you get into this game, you cant stop. though there are a few graphical bugs, the overall graphics and storyline are culivating and match what third-person-shooter-lovers will look for.",1
"this game is fabulous. i have no idea why it is free (it should be at least 10 dollars) but hey, i am not complaining! sometimes it lags when there are a lot of things going on, but if you are a true ninja, no lag at all.",1
"awesome game. everyone should download it and try it.",1
"fun game if you like to jumping off walls, slicing of peoples head and 3 people (including you) to have a fun time.",1
"very good game for a free to play franchise. the graphics are stelar although do require a good machine to run their full potential. definetley a fun game to play with a friend or party. that is definetley were i got more enjoyment while playing it.",1
"to get to game play you must load the launcher, the launcher checks for updates, then launches the game, which takes a brief load. you must then wait for it to load some more for, sign in, and get another load screen. over 5 minutes of loading to even get to the game. after getting to the game, you must do the tutorial level, which, if youve already played the game and uninstalled it, you know how to play already, and you can not skip. you also do not get your equipment from your previous install, so you have to learn how to use the weapons and warframe you may not even have. after finishing the tutorial, you are then put on your ship, where an mmo like chat is happening in the bottom left hand corner. the chat was an awful place, with people being awful. all in all, i give this game a rating of why are there so many controls, and why did i just do a backflip / 10",1
"best game i ever played. have 650 hours of gameplay and im love it",9
"this game is fun, however it can get repetitive quickly",1
"if you arent playing this game, youre missing out. its still in beta, but its absolutely fantastic. space ninjas, john woo-style gun-and-sword-play, squad-based combat, inventory crafting and upgrades, class-based warframes, and its all for free and still growing. if nothing else, give it a try, because ive been playing it since i downloaded it and its just plain damn fun.",2
"its tons of fun. i admit, the enemies look rather silly, but its really satisfying with all the slice n dice. there are plenty of pay-to-win items and abilities, but most can be forged with a few days patience. overall, id give it an 8/10!",1
"good but requires faster speed and more creativity 4/7",1
"this has been the best game i have played in a very long time. im usually picky about online games but this has took the cake for the best online multiplayer game!",3
"warframe is the only game that is not a play to win but very much worth the money paying for!!! only game ive spent money on besides dlc for other games.",7
"tons of fun, well worth the time i invested in it. though kind of a money sink if you are lazy like me.",1
"warframe by far exceeds is successors, it is a legendary game that is finally out of beta! i cannot wait to play it again after my brake from it. if i can give one tip, sell your weapons when they hit max level, and craft them again. (thats how you level up)",7
"ninjas in space what can be better this is more fun than iv had in my whole life gaming new updates almost every month with new weapons warframes bosses and more dont miss out it is stupendious",2
"best free to play action game ever for me, i hope the developer improve the character movemement action for better parkour.",2
"space ninja simulator in essence but more of a grindfest in practice. want a new character? better kill that boss a few times and prey to rngesus for the correct parts. want a new weapon? go grind for money to buy it, then grind for the materials to build it. its a fun game, dont get me wrong. the guns and characters are fun as heck but its pretty dang repetitve. this game would be unbearable if you played alone; make sure you play with a friend who knows what theyre doing, so that they can lead you through the basics. also, the devs are great people and work on bugs and issues (which there are alot of) constantly.",8
"i do recomend this game. ive played it for over 800 hours and its a bunch of fun. only bad thing about this game is no end-game like content, solar rails kinda but thats not quite the raid or big boss battle im looking for. just saying, needs something big for long term players like me to come back, the mesa update is fine and all but all the same, archwing was cool, but just more the same, in sppppaaaaaaaaccccceeeeeeeeeee. the update where they added the ship and overhaul of the ui was cool, but just another way to see/look at the game. mmorpgs have raids to top it off, to give somehting for the high end players to do and look forward to, not saying warframe needs raids, just needs something more interesting for the vet players.",7
"this game is really really good but the biggest problem is pvp",2
"its a really good game visually and mechanically. even though there seams to be p2w features you can earn everything through gameplay, but expect a lot of grinding. and pay attention when it says you are leveling up.....cuase not only do you level up....but your equipment does as well all on seperate occassions rather then just your main character....it gets confusing thinking my character finally reached lv 10 and notice that its still at lv 3 >,> even though i cant get into this game cause i cant afford to waste little of my time everyday to grind, i highly approve getting it. if it helps then buy one of the starter patches cause everything aint easy peasy. its a very competitive game.",1
"love it, such an elegant feeing to the game, wonder what happens in the nexxt update! only thing that pulls it down is the bugs, but hey, every game has them right, best game so far award from me!",3
"laggy on amd prossesor acer aspire 5532 thumbs down",1
"the game doesnt seem to be working on windows 7 professional",1
"a game with amazing graphics, constantly being improved with new missions and events, amazing customization in weapons and warframes, it is very difficult to play the game throughout only with the stuff they give you for free, but i havent spent a dime on this game and i own almost everything by playing the market correctly. fairly innovative bosses though a bit lackluster at some points (one of them is literally a standard enemy with a sword who just hits really hard, no abilities or anything). the game is famous for being a repetitive grinding machine, i find this depends on what missions you choose to play, but yeah if you want to progress with your weapons and frames and get stronger you will have to do the same thing over and over alot. probably the greatest feature of warframe though is the fact you can literally be a alien wizard ninja with a jetpack. my biggest concern with warframe that almost made me click downvote is that they have a tendency to make big updates that suddenly make the game 35x harder to run. i once had to stop playing for a wohle 2 weeks because my computer couldnt load their new fancy animated loading screen......... they like to put random crap into the game that is unnecesary that kills fps. more of a game dev problem than the game itself however. 8/10 i suppose (potential 10/10 if they ever stop messing around and fix the obvious connection problems)",7
"great 3rd person f2p shoot the best fun i have had in awhile :d",1
"played for over 500+h in game and still dont have everything, aka 500+h playing the game and i still have stuff to look foward to. this is one of the best, if not the best, free mmos that is not only fun but difrent in both gameplay and game items and modes and custimazation.... you get the picture. 10/10",4
"loved the game to death till they changed the os. now i cant play because i have windows seven only, was there a legitimiate reason for the changing of the os? i do recommend it if you can actually play it, but because of the os change im going to have to say no to recommend it.",2
"yes very fun game hard when you start but as u get better the game does aswell + its still in beta so there will always be something new try it <3",1
"its still in beta, but its awesome. the best part is, its still growing. more warframes each update,and occassionally gameplay changes. theres bugs, no . but still, its a good game. give it a try.",3
"update failed! the preprocess pass appeared to crash (ect) the update will begin again shortly! (like 7 minutes later) update failed! the preprocess pass appeared to crash this is all im getting trying to play this game and i think its only me whos getting it",1
"i believe this game would be well suited for those of us who have the patience to wait 12 hours to build a weapon, or put up with grinding all the resources out of a mission to actually have the option to build said weapon. unless you have the money to buy everything in the game. in that case go nuts.",1
"i once spent 3 months trying to get a frame that acts exactly the same as its not prime counterpart just cause it looked cooler 10/10 best destroy-social-life sim ever",2
"very unique game that has a playstyle for everybody. much fun",3
"was in the mood for some fps while getting the feeling of a grind/progression. this game was it. i played 5 hours straight off the bat, and look forward to playing some more. its free to play, so you have nothing to lose but your own time. if you have an itchy trigger finger i highly recommend this game. oh and  s  s /",1
"papa told me this a good game, i played for 10 hrs and i was like wow papa im ninja.",1
"really good game, its the 1st game that ive ever put money into fo in game currency simply because i feel like i owe them money, so i highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a game to play in their spare time :)",1
"one of the best free to play games out there.. you can basically get everything without spending a dime on it..",6
"i have been playing this game for two years, great game and has come a long way.",5
"great singleplayer and co-op, with stunning visuals. game runs nicely, with no faults (noticed). 10/10",1
"warframe is one of the best games i have ever played hands-down. the game is gorgeous, the gameplay gets you addicted in the first hour, and the storyline keeps you guessing. this game is not pay-to-win. you can craft any gun or tenno in the game without paying real currency. tons of mods to custimize the gameplay to your preference. 10/10 download the game while you have the chance! fyi: to those of you who do not have an intel core i5 or higher, and a graphics card equal to or above the nvidia geforce gtx 8600 series, you will experience some lag, and rendering will not be amazing, but the game will play. fyi 2: for those of you who have a crash report when they hit the play button on the game, please read on! when you launch the game from steam, and the launcher pops up, go to the little gear in the top right hand corner. ( directly to the left of the minimization button.) click on it, and a window with a set of check boxes should pop up. uncheck directx10 and directx 11. click ok or save and click the play button again. the game should launch normally. hope this helps!",1
"10 out of 10 would waste my life again. if you get bored with warframes pve plz go try out conclave(pvp)",10
"warframe is simply one of the best games i have ever played. i dont know what else to say. there are always new things to learn about the universe and new items and mods (upgrades) to strive for! the devs update the game at least once a week, but on average there are two or three updates per week that add new content, bug fixes and adjustment. this game has a very shallow learning curve and is easy to get into, then the challenge is always great! 730 hours in and i only took two breaks from warframe that only lasted about a week each. not even starting to get bored of it yet! i love warframe and best of all: everything in it can be gotten with not a single payment . this is not pay to win, but the option to pay is always present as a time-saver.",10
"this free game is probs the best ive seen in a long time!",1
"pretty laggy. i have a laptop that is 4gb of ram... but still amazing game",1
"warframe is a great game and and id rather die than not play it. if my mum were to take away my pc i would kill myself.",2
"i started game and it was loading to checking for new contact and keep runing.... why?",1
"so im nearing 600 hours on warframe and i dont regret a minute, this game is insane fun with friends and is also playable solo. the community is kind and usually you can trust them. 9/10",6
"sweet graphics,awesome gameplay..what can i say u spend ur hours grinding without noticing how time flew by just to get the item u want to stay in the competition...slots are also hard to get so be sure to use ur plats carefully",5
"i want to play it because it is awesome. but since i cleaned my computer, i cannnot open the internet to create a new account. also, it freezes when i try to do a mission. still good. :)",1
"played baseball with a hammer as a baseball bat and enemies as the ball. 10/10. also, constant updates.",3
"very fast paced fun. lots of ways you can play this game. can be a bit grindy but the combat is satisfying",4
"fun, with a but. for the hack-n-slash types out there, this game is for you. get yourself a rhino warframe and have at it. for the stealthy, sneaky assassin types out there, this is also for you. get yourself a ash warframe and go nuts. basically, this game is faultless...except, there are major faults in the game. you are thrown into a game that tells you the basics of how the game works, but with no actual help along the way. unless you have someone in the game already, who knows what to do and how to use certain mods, also gives you certain mods and helps you level up quickly, this game will tear you up. proceed wih caution ninjas.",1
"laggg, lagg alot! i cant even play well because of laggg, even i set to lowest setting even its lagg, but i still play it alot because its fun! :))",3
"for an open beta this game is phenominal for its current content! i strongly recommend this as a game and the best thing is that it is free to play. it has evolved this far to has me in awe and im sure you too. and, from what i can tell, with future updates it will soon be a contender with the big ones such as grand theft auto, call of duty, assassins creed and many more outstanding games. i may not be a game critic but rather a teenage boy but i know a brilliant product when i see one. there is much expansion for this game and i can see it becoming your favourite as it was quickly mine. fantastic for a free game and to be honest it shouldnt be a fre to play game considering the fun you can have here. i highly recommend this game, whether you like third or first person shooters this combines solo and co-op gamemodes with ease! altough you will lose your life to the hours of farming and hours of fun i am perfectly happy with where warframe sits in my life, in my favourites tab on steam. i hope you enjoy it as much as i do but more promptly, hit that download button right now! ~maycontaincrazy",4
"this game is one of the best f2p games if not the best. i use to be a competitive gamer in both mmos and fpss. looking for a casual game to enjoy and stream, i chose warframe. ive been in and out of the game since beta, even before it was on steam. the devs are very thoughtful in the content they pump out and, oh do they pump out content. if your looking for a fun, engaging fps/mmo, this is it.",3
"do not play this game it will burn a lot of your freetime and it will take your life too",7
"wow, amazing gameplay! great to pass by hours of boredom! :)",1
"this game is awesome! ive been playing it a lot lately, and it just never gets old. it is finally a high-end mmog that actually has a well-built singleplayer story. definately a great choice for people who love games such as halo, dead space, and mass effect, or for someone who wants a pc alternative to destiny!",1
"warframe is being a space ninja, having solid (albeit simple) stealth mechanics the pace is in your control i really want to say 10/10 due to amazing graphics the multiplayer system is impecable and the opption of lone wolf completes it, its got a range of classes and weapons all of which are customizable (colour and attachments), although the real issue with the game is its a nfpf (nearly free to play) although it costs you nothing to play it, for those of you who dont mind throwing around a bit of cash the bill will rack up quickly, all customization options cost real money. however its not all doom and gloom all the weapons and armours and kit you need can be bought with in game currency this does however take alittle while (mainly collecting the rare resources) and it can be very tempting to spend that little bit of money just to speed everything up. i do beleive that this game makes up for its nf2f status by being all round pretty good 7/10",2
"its great if you dont mind turning the grind to 11 and spending a little bit of dosh on it.",4
"warframe has an element to it that no other free to play game has ever captured correctly. it blends beautiful combat and animations with a complicated, but intriguing story to bring you an insanely fun to play and extremely addictive style of game. there is truly no other game like it, and it is unique it its own ways. if you can push through the steep learning curve this game will grasp your attention, and if you like it enough, maybe even your money. free to play done right.",1
"well i wantend to play destiny but i dont have a ps3 or 4 nor xbox etc. im so glad i run across this i dont care about destiny now i got warframe this game is awesome!!!! a++",1
"fun for awhile but after you get everything its kinda repetitive. although it can be fun if you have friends who play it its also fun to play alone. alot of the better features are pay to play really. its worth a try if you want to try a unique game with decent graphics, fun mechanics, and a constantly changing universe.",7
"tl;dr an amazing f2p you should give a try, but a little grindy this game is definitely worth a look. one of the best free2plays i have every played, if not the best. the game is super addicting and youll find that youll be logging an insane amount of hours in this game. one great thing about warframe is the constant updates/patches that all add amazing new things to the game or fix some of the present bugs. there are also tons of different warframes/weapons/companions that you can choose from to help suit your play style. my one problem with this game is it is super grindy. if you want to get all the parts for a new warframe/weapon or get a specific mod/resource (im looking at you oxium), youll probably have do the same mission or types of missions over and over just to have a chance of getting it. nevertheless, this game is amazing and definitely worth at least a try.",2
"this game should seriously not be free. the graphics, the lore, and the gameplay just blow my mind. i would recommend this game to almost anyone out there. sometimes some of the gameplay changes, but it is always for the better. overall an amazing third person shooter.",4
"this game is amazing! no seriously,try it.are you not playing it already? man you suck in a serious note,this game gave me a feeling that i hadnt felt in many other games in a while,and i think it is very under-rated. its pretty much an f2p without almost any p2p content.(more like pay to skip),i love it,and if you are new to this you are probably going to have a blast just learning through the game. and the best thing i like about this game is that it evolves over time,new updates that may bring new modes/change the whole game completely every few months.it is truly majestic",7
"this game is amazing i had it on my other computer my current one cannot run it but my last one did so i have to say yep its worth the download. 8/10",1
"awesome game, this is pure grinding but very very fun grinding. focus on the journey, not the destination , in my opinion warframe is all about that!",1
"this is honestly one of the best games ive played in a long time. the closest thing i can compare it to is the multiplayer from mass effect 3. it takes a couple of level before the game starts to pick up the pace (should be faster now with the streamlines ability mods). the team at digital extremes adds content on a weekly basis and releases major expansions quite often. even if you dont put any money into it right away, you can hold off as money is only needed to store more equipment in the arsenal. everything that is bought is either cosmetic or just pay for convenience.",10
"this game is just outstanding and has a beautiful layout",1
"awsome and can be plaed again and again for more fun every discovery",1
"its a great free to play game that has a ton of customization options, different areas to explore, and equipment to pursue. it will get you hooked pretty fast and you may want to shell out some actual money for the game because it allows you to unlock and customize more and do it faster. by no means is it pay to win, but just putting $20 or $40 into the game is nice and something you wont regret.",1
"this game is really fun to play, if your into swords and badass stuff then you should check out this game.",1
"warframe, as a game currently in open beta, is hard to review because there is so much changing all the time. simply i will say this: its improving drastically. new content consistently, bugs always being fixed, new developments being made. yes, it can be grinding at times, but i feel like the amount of weaponry, equipment, and modification potential makes up for it. space ninjas! yeah!",8
"this game....100+ hours and counting. best free game i have ever played, hands down. they did a great job with it, and it has gotten nothing but better with every update. 9.5/10",3
"everything in this game is just awesome... im still green but thos platinum sure can get me annoyed",1
"great free to play game if u wanna start pc gaming :)",1
"i think it is a awsume mmo and i reccomend every1 to get it",5
"very good game with few issues, best part of the game is the extremely active devs. theyre constantly keeping in touch with the player as well in multiple forms of both social media (youtube) and actual in game content.",3
"honestly this is one of the best games i have ever played its absolutely awsome at detail design and the devs work hard on fixing something imeadietly after it messes up. most of the games in steam have hackers,cheaters,etc. but this game there is almost no possible way to do that without someone noticing in other words i extremely recemend this game to everybody.",5
"a game worth to be recommend... start farming and happy hunting tenno... the patch is fast... and the most and most important... free to play...",6
"if you dont want to be addicted at this game then dont play it.. once you get to the middle of game u will never stop playing this game trust me. its non stop fun. and all weapons can get buy not buying cash. and never buy prime access. because some of them are not worthed trust me. and u can get 25/50/75% discount platinum so dont ever buy pack in steam. its not worthed. first week: this game guns is hard to get. second week: okay, it;s really easy to get guns. third week: hard to get character four week: get the hang of it five week: ohh 75% discount 4,1k here i come. six week: yea prime items seven week: orokin so much fun. trust me you cant stop playing this game once you play it. its really damn   fun.. sorry for swearing lolol trust me go play this game instead of tf2 no offense. tf2 get bored easily and its not a fun f2p game. this is the best f2p game ever. ninja be freestyle .. 69 style oh yeaa",2
"want to play more but the launcher is horrible. first time? worked. second to 50th time? failed. renstal to play. i mean the game is good, but the launcher is bad, i will try the none steam version.",1
"the game offers more then alot of content for a free to play, the melee and ranged combat are stylishly combined and the randomly rearranged levels, bosses and random events makes the game maintain my attention for the long hours, you can join a clan for even more features but i will admit i had to spend money to keep my interest in the game but after the awesome space ninja combat fun i had with the game for 30 or so hours i felt like the game deserved my money. this game will be fun for you it is just up to you if you will take advantage of all that it offers (for free) that will determine how long it keeps you interested, the best way to play is with friends but the online co-op works well enough. update: its been a few updates since i played, the new content is very cool and the ship hub is a great system but once you have made it to the point in the game where you have rank 30 (max) gear the game does become a massive grind for mods, money and resources that being said you only reach that point after many hours of a fun great free to play and there is still plenty of content to explore. positives: great gameplay, mixture of melee and shooting, parkour and abilities many locations, mission types and randomized maps customization of all of your stuff negatives: mod system is still a headache at first grind gaming after a while",2
"i like this game. its best free to play game. i recommended it.",1
"literally one of the best 3rd person shooters ive ever played. #katanasareawesome",1
"the game is cool but has a lot of glitches, the map wont zoom in on planets, sometimes revives will forfeit the mission, etc.",1

"its the best game in the world if only my computer would let me play it! :d",1

"this game is awesome, never had any issue with it, i love it mostly because the producers keep it updated all the time, you can get anything in-game without pay 1$. shortly this game is great in any kind of way, also great quality and high fps <_< but after playing it like 2 years or even more ( played before it came to steam ) finally something bad heppen. the game crash all the time. i couldnt finish even 1 mission this whole week! bottom line - this game is great in any kind of way but untill theyll fix it, it crashes more then jc2mp ( the game crash if you crash with your car too hard... so yeah that means alot ) so for now i give it 9/10 cuz theres only 1 issue but anyways im not gona try to enter the game untill theyll make an hotfix.",3

"for a third person primarily co-op free to play game, warframe is fun. pros: co-op, free to play, 4 player co-op, controller support, moderately low system specs needed to play, tons of weapon options and content. cons: high grinding for good items to craft which can take up to 4 days, adds and cash shop with stupidly priced items ex: a weapon is about 10-15$ usd. repetitive gameplay can get dull. lack of customization unless you purchase it via cash shop.",1

"this game in one word is addicting. very addicting. i started playing it and they i eventually found it hard to stop, in fact the only reason i took a break is because i was tired. this game is an mmorpg that you do not want to pass up. especially since it is free! in this game you can purchase things in game so that you have the tools you need to be the best tenno that you can be. the first couple missions warm you up and tap into that killer that lies dormant inside of you. you progress and as you progress you can purchase new things and become a better tenno. all in all i think this game is great and i have not even finished it yet. i liked this game and i think most people would too, so just give it a try and who knows maybe you will like it. i give it a big thumbs up and a huge five out of five stars.",1
"warframe is a fun yet not entirely filling game. you play as a tenno an alien space ninja being that has to grind through levels with one to three other players obtaining items to build other warframes or other items like weapons or small minions. the game does look very impressive for a free to play title and level desighn from what i have seen is very captivating but with one flaw its repetitive you will find yourself in the same level more than once and after a while this becomes bothersome thanks to the nearly endless pattern of obtaining items to build better gear. in conclusion warframe is a fun fast paced third person shooter that is a nice addition to any game library",1
"in little over a month, i racked up over 400 hours. i no lifed the  outta this game for a while. gotta say. i love it. while the nessesity of plat( in game currency bought with real money is platnum) is annoying for all customizable options (or waiting days to months to get) or to rush things that can take up to thre days to build, its a good game. people sy you can just get things in game and sell them to others, and while you can, getting enough play to get what you want is very rare, unless you get a few lucky drops. that being said. i enjoy shooters. and not being a fan of pvp shooters, where things like cod are located, and most other shooters leaving a  single player that does nothing for me, this is a good game to fill that void. though not much of a story if there is one, just being able to bust some corpus chops, its pretty nice. no need to angry about spawn camping here. so if your wonder if you should try it, if you like shooters, and pvm, play the game for a while. you get used to things. and if you like it and got the money, its better to buy plat then try to earn it in game or will take you near forever. tl;dr shooty shooty pew pew magic people",6
"this is an amazing game that has only gotten better since i first started playing.",2
"grinding simulator 20-whatever. literally hours of grinding just to find a dog egg (seriously a dog egg?) or whatever it is that you need to continue the sad excuse for a campaign that this game has. or you can always buy it (which you will most likely need to do) along with any characters, weapons, or literally anything thats in the game that you want or need. should have just called the game microtransaction because thats all there ever is when you play it.",1
"i cant recommend this to people... i played it for 6hrs and in that 6hrs i had fun maybe once. too much of a grind, unless you want to pay real money of course which means you get whatever you want, but untill then you have to grind, for yeeeears.",1
"this game is what f2p should be like. everything that can be obtained in game can be obtained without spending a dime (save for a few skins, but thats true of many f2p games). theres a wealth of different mission types, lots of items to obtain and build, and action never gets old.",5

"its kinda grindy, the controls kinda wonky, multiplayer squad play leaves much to be desired, the damage system is complicated, and everything becomes kinda of samey. its an amazing and beautiful concept that i would recommend to play for a few good months, but it gets boring fast.",3
"this is a very, very good game; for a free-to-play third person shooter, it blows away any and all competition, and you dont have to pay a cent to get powerful. its smooth, sleek, looks great on pc. its intense, action packed; you will hardly have a dull moment. and its only in beta. i want to see how this game plays out as a full-fledged platform for free action; it has my attention in all earnesty.",4
"amazing free 2 play ! you dont neet to pay for win and regularly updated ;)",1
"its fun if you like ninjas, space, or anything involved with this game really.",1
"amazing grinding game. not meant for those who hate grinding",1
"definitely the best action game out there in the market considering it to be free",2
"amazing, played for 2 years now and its incredible how much its developed. still not sure?, go to their website and get it anyway.",4
"disregard framerate; acquire kills. but seriously, this game runs absolutely beautifully. i wouldnt expect a game with half a million particle effects going at once to manage 50fps+ in full heat of battle, but it does. lots of fun, can be played casually, and can be no-lifed. 10/10",3
"this game is like a mass effect mmo but with a boring storing line. you customize your warframe and you go on missions. not much to it. you will either like it or hate it. just comes down to taste.",1
"a beautifully deep and engaging piece of art about the futility of persistence...it made me question my entire existence. 10/10",1
"feels like a third-person co-op a la kill all the enemies and win. left 4 dead comes to mind when thinking of ways to describe this, but thats immature, since im sure a lot of games before it and this one have done the same formula; the same can be said of all genres of video game. despite that, the designs are pretty neat, and the fact that the tenno suits are skin-tight give the females a very alluring look, coupled with random technological protrusions that sometimes scream fashion disaster. all-in-all, a fun online hack-n-slash for quick bursts, but suffers from the plague of microtransactions and dlc if you want to get into it seriously. cant really recommend it, unfortunately, but dont want to turn it down.",1
"one of the best games i played in a while. add me if your going to play it :cookiejump. its either pay to win or work ur  off to win haha. u have to harvest specific resources to be able to build weapons , warframes , sentinels and many more things. its a great ninja space shooter. sometimes it feels like mass effect , which made me like the game even more. its a great game . *best to play with friends.",1
"this is good co-op game its more of a strategey than shot em up like your every day cob you have to work together to finish the tasks",1
"ir has a steap learning curve at first but its wasy to get the hang of. already within 21 hours im a level 30. another con is the difficulty for new comers, your starting weapons suck which led me to put it 50 bucks which is more than enough for everything youll ever need. this title was reccomended to me by a friend, take it from me i dont play a ton of ftp games. but all in all its pretty damn good.",1
"this gamee is fun and it takes timee to apreciate all the work that has gone into it.",4
"mission-style gameplay makes it a little bit repetitive, however i really like this game.",2
"warframe - one of the best hack n slash, action-packed, parkour-ridden games ever created. the graphics are splendid, as it goes with a space, star-warsy feel. it offers a wide variety of arsenal that can be used in battle. different kinds of characters, wide array of weapons, paints, and many more. in a nutshell, this is a must-try and a will-stay-and-love game. hands down to the devs and creators of this game. youve made the one of the best games in existence.",1
"tons of weapons and customization, frequent update and eventfull, its like pokemon for adult.",5
"its an awesome 3rd person shooting game. add me! :3 ign: --q--leviticus",9
"its not a bad game, but doesnt feel like it has too much in the way of depth. good game to kill time, and you cant beat free.",1
"i think this game is a very good and fast game. the characters look a bit weird but i think its not so hindered the gameplay. a lot of stuff you can craft given it a lot. that is megbirsz get almost everything so quickly and easily you can acquire stuff. continuous updates are what make the game more enjoyable. i can recommend it.",1
"parkour! space zombies! space ninjas! what else do you want?!",3
"this game provides everything that i needed to really get into computer gaming.",1
"warframe is kinda like mass effect 3 multiplayer. except not .",4
"fun, action packed, free, and microtransactions do not mean you win. there are items you cant without paying, but they arent super uber powerful broken duuuude.",2
"slow preogession, good graphics, almost always wants u to buy stuff, good multiplayer/co op. needs first person its like a 7-6 out of 10: you need to pull thru for baout 15 hours before u get anything good",1
"the best free-to-play mmorpg shooter available. metacritic score is not appropriate anymore since the game has improved drastically since it officially launched.",2
"this piece of s**t is better on next gen consoles.",1
"youre a ninja. in space. with superpowers. best free game ive found - put 585 hrs into it at the time of this review and just now running out of things i want to do in the game. pros: excellent parkour system, nice weapons, highly customizable character/weapon loadouts, top-notch graphics. on one level its a pretty simple kill em all style fps, but on another level youll dig into the complex mechanics of damage types and modifying gear and combining players superpowers (abilities) to complete missions. the unique abilities for each character are pretty badass. many weapons have unique mechanics, too. you can solo most of the game if you choose, but id recommend joining a clan to make things easier when you do the missions that just cant be done solo, and there are many veterans like myself around to help out newer clan members. its free-to-play, but not pay-to-win. you can literally get everything in the game without spending real money due to the trading system, but that depends on your patience with farming. cons: ive played through a few major updates and have come to the conclusion that the developers are a highly talented team of visual artists who lack the skill to fix the persistent bugs and theres nobody in the company thatll speak up and say that an idea is akin to going full . they do listen to their community and ultimately fix most of their blunders though. the game involves a lot of farming/grinding which can get tedious.",7
"was fun with a friend when i played it two years ago, although it did become very repetitive in missions and areas.",1
"i swear i thought i made a review for this already. guess not.. anyways! this gem of a f2p is the most spectacular f2ps ive played in a really long time! 10/10 - graphics 10/10 - gameplay (not pvp) 10/10 - playerbase (most people are over 14) the devs push out a lot of content on a very regular basis.",3
"9.9/10 pros: +ninjas +space +spaceninjas +good gameplay +ninjas +spaceship building +ninjas with guns +bows cons: -loader takes too long to check for updates -no water",1
"if there was a maybe option id give it that- the game is graphically pleasing, and the concept of basically being space ninjas is great, but the game falls into all the traps of the mmo genre which completely wrecks the gameplay. you will be grinding for the sake of grinding in this game, and while fun at first, it wont keep you entertained for very long unless youre okay with mmo style grind.",2
"waaaaay too much farming for items such as mods/warframes/sentinels/weapons that require you to do more cycles of repetitive gameplay.",1
"the free to play aspect can be completely ignored if you put your time and effort into the game. it really isnt hard at all to get the items you want once you know what youre doing.",3
"well done. nice game very good graphics, but boring when no friends online",1
"this is a fun game that is mostly free. youll pretty quickly run out of room for more warframes and weapons, and will need to buy inventory slots for them with plat. you get plat with real money or by trading things for it with gullible rubes. the game itself is full of cool things that youll have to grind for hours to get. for a while youll be able to get by just playing the game, but soon enough youll need to go to one of the big grinding spots and sit around while high-level players end worlds while you watch enviously. good luck finding players for anything but grinding! there are tons and tons of missions to do with lackluster rewards, but chances are nobody will help you with anything but bosses. all that said, its a pretty good game if you can keep away from the mind-numbing grind and just have fun shootin stuff. the game looks nice, the controls are sensible, and most of the warframes and weapons (that ive tried) are just fun and satisfying to use. if you want a co-op shootems game without having to pay anything upfront, this is a pretty good chocie, imho (in my honored opinion).",6
"this game is a phenominal cooperative experience. i havent had this much co-op fun since perfect dark for the n64 back in the good ol days. this game genuinely surprised me, dont be fooled by the graphics. the game runs absolutely flawless on most computers despite having beautiful realistic visuals. im running the game on full 60fps with 0 lag and 4 bars of connection with only a $400 asus computer with intel i5 and 4 gigs of ram; you dont even need to have a gaming computer to experience this game fully. this game is awesome.",1
"good game this game requires a good computer.... that is a warning...",1
"it takes a long time to level up and upgrade, but its amazing either way, good game overall.",1
"warframe is one of the few shooters that are enjoyable. it is nice to see the tenno you play as in the third-person. the variety of play styles makes it so that anyone, with a weird or an aggressive playstyle can enjoy it, muiltiplayer is required for the first few days of gametime, as its difficult to solo, and that one bug where it wouldnt unlock the next node, the game can be abit buggy at times, but otherwise, enjoyable, i recommend this game for any player who enjoys shooters.",1
"if we excluse the donation(s) its a fine game... if we include them back...  it. its a pretty good game but man... i hate the waiting times for my items and missions to be complete... but hey, its free!",1
"amazing game. lots of action, adventure and more action. very thrilling to play. the free-to-play thing kinda makes most of the better items or characters in the game harder to get because you need to buy them with in-game purchased currency or you could just try getting it over a long period of time. overall its just an amazing game but can be limiting sometimes.",5
"everything about this game is simply yes -the missions -the enimies -the crafting -the multiplayer they even do microtransacions right, its not play to play, its an option to bypass crafting the item to just get it premade this game is the life and death of me",1
"i played it and liked it or a while, the mechanics were a bit confusing and at some times doors that needed to be open would close and not allow me to progress. but other than that it was a pretty good shooter/hack and slash game.",1
"its a really entertaining system where it really rewards those who dedicate some time to it. sure, grinding is a really fundamental part of the game but it really makes time pass really quickly if youre in a competent squad or clan. get the bow though, tons of fun to use. :od",1
"the game is a massive grind, the missions seem to be copy and paste maps with similar objectives across the board on all planets. however, this doesnt mean the game isnt fun becuse its very fun, and its easy to lose hour after hour to it. striving to reach that shiny new prime weapon, and feeling so accomplished afterwards only to see something else thats shiny and grind for that as well. the devs arent greedy either, theyre very generous and kind to the fanbase, 10/10 would play.",2
"its great free and you can aquire everything in the game for free 10/10 would download",2
"great game, and the only ftp play that i bother to play as of this writing. its totally ftp, paying money advances you faster is all. everything is doable with out money. check it out at no cost and get hooked.",2
"a good game to spend time with. its ninjas with super powers parkouring all over the place and killing hundreds of aliens. it will get a little repetetive farming for mods and materials. but there is a wide variety of frames and weapons to experiment with. the community is friendly, and is usually willing to help with missions if you dont want to fly solo. the cash shop is reasonably priced with good deals and sales at regular intervals.",2
"its funny but one round of game makes you too tired",1
"this game is awesome, just due to the fact that it is free and that the archwing staff care about their community. try out the game for yourself, this game is worth it.",2
"strangely amazing. really suprised me, especially the fair f2p stuff.",1
"it is a solid game that is fun to play with friends",1
"an enjoyable games. somewhere between pso and unreal tournament. nice graphics and free to play. 8.5/10",1
"its a great game. not too easy, but also not too hard. its a simple and not complicated game. you go in missions, kill, loot, upgrade and tune your warframe. if you dont want an over complicated system of tuning, fun with friends and a great shooter with some melee counter-part, warframe is exactly that.",1
"great little co-op shooter. you can jump about & get some nice style kills & if you dont want to pay for any thing, you can make the gear you what.",1
"this is one of those games that makes a weir combo of sci-fi and ninjas wich is awsome. the game dose have a few minor problems with initial settings but all in all it is a good co-op game.",1
"love the graphics and smooth gameplay, but i wish there was a bit more story and lore in game. it seems you just go from fight to fight. and what really pulls me into a game long term is the storyline and lore.",5
"this is a great free-to-play game, nice graphics and gameplay.",1
"pros: +awesomely realistic graphics +physx support +the first 30 minutes contains grrrrrrreat fun +awesome gameplay cons: -starts getting pretty boring after 30 minutes -extremely hard in solo mode -hard to level up this game is highly reccomended if you like shooters. i played this game a lot, but a high shame its hard to level up. 8.5/10",1
"space ninjas with guns and pet pigdogs vs angry mutant people that cant aim vs robotics engineers that are somehow both intelligent and idiotic vs zombified versions of the latter two.",1
"wings, space ninjas, magic powers, high octane action. wait, free to play? this game might cause moderate to severe happy fits.",4
"played for a little bit, definitely not addicted to this game",6
"i heard about this game very seldomly and when i did it was, yeah its alright. my eyes were stupidly focused on other titles with more paid advertizing and a massive legion of fans. the thing was, those titles were either disappointing or there was some level of fun but i got bored really fast. warframe is amazing, astonishing and somehow made me like shooters again. i simply could not believe it. i was waiting for it to get bad at some point and i waited for that moment and prepared to be disapointed. the oh so this is why people dont talk about this game and it isnt a massive hit, or so this is why the critics were average on it, and finally so this is why no major mmo site talks about the game. well that moment never came. its amazing and one of the best games i have ever played. the cash shop is fair, the graphics are beautiful, better than any mmo in history for my money. the developers really care about its players. so between this, marvel heroes, and path of exile. my gaming rotation is completely made up of under rated games, the average gamer doesnt know much about. so you can have your destinys (ill pass on the pc port in march), you can keep your diablos, and indulge in your other aaa shooters and mmos. ill be playing great games like warframe.",1
"this is very fun, but time consuming unless you spend moeny",1
"i barely started playing this game and what can i say its amazing! the graphics are well done and beautiful along with the story and way of play i highly recommend this game to all.",1
"can anyone please fix so that i dont make myself do 25 minutes of survival just to be kicked out after the 2nd time being there not getting anything and lost everything in addition but overall i dont mind playing for it coz how its a fun game and stuff reccommend playing with friends for more fun",3
"i never thought a free-to-play game could put the top-of-the-line titles to shame. this game kicked , never gets boring, and is constantly updated to continue kicking  in new and exciting ways. you dont even need to spend a dime to be good; there is no paywall to break through, and i love it. 20/10",1
"the only f2p where you could play and never spend any real world money on it.",5
"best. game. ever! you play as a freaking space ninja! download this game now! seriously, though...this is the best game i have played in a loooooooooong time. i am hopelessly addicted to it.",2
"early thoughts (still playing): warframe seems like a fantastic game! looks fantastic and has great gameplay. the controls are quite a handful however im sure the more i carry on playing this game, the more ill get the hang of it. i definetely recommend this game to anyone who loves action games and for anyone else it is definetely worth at least a try.",1
"i would give this a 5/10. the gameplay is fine, combat is wholly rewarding. i understand the devs have to make money, but does the difficulty have to increase so darn quickly? one minute i was kicking grineer but, the next, getting sawed in half in no time! if any devs read this, which is unlikely, and furthermore if any devs take what i say into consideration, which is even less likely, please drop the difficulty, atleast to a very marginal degree? its free, so it will occupy some time, believe me, and the coop is amazing, but dont expect to go very far without shelling out some of the green stuff.",1
"warframe is very good game.you can shooting or use your melee attack in this game. 8 out of 10 for this game",3
"fast paced mmo, switch between guns and cqc with easy without having to stress over complicated controls. long story and replay value at the top of its class i would recommend this to those who wish to have a fast pace game and good firefights.",1
"a really great game!!! if you download it please reffer me! you wont regret the download omg!!",2
"i recommend this game to all of you.. very beautiful looking game with easy controls..",1
"this game is becoming one of my favorites quickly. i dont play it all the time but it keeps me coming back!",2
"its grindy, but if youre into collecting things this is probably a good game for you. there is a codex that sort of works like pokemon snap, and there are lots of weapons and frames to unlock. like most pve games, once you learn the mechanics and behaviours it starts becoming dull.",5
"space ninjas, running around grabbing rescources and completing missions, for free, whats not to like? pros: -missions are good fun, repetitive, but the different environments makes them fun enough for you not to notice -wide variety of weapons, from a massive two-handed sword to a automatic rifles -fleshed out clan system, where you can build your own base with duelling arenas, research areas obstacle courses etc -combat is simple, but fun -warframes and thier powers make combat even more fun (mags upgraded pull causes her to ragdoll enemies around the target, sendng them flying, always awesome) -free-to-play -im no graphics expert, but ive always thought that this games graphics are gorgeous cons: -microtransactions, most stuff is possible for you to get, but it takes a lot of time, farming bosses, getting a new warframe will take you a very long time. -graphics may make it lag on some pcs (my friends laptop lags) in conclusion, a good game, but microtransactions let it down",2
"this game will rock anyones socks. may be a little complicated, but if you stick with it, you will be all set.",4
"one of the fairest and most kept up to date f2p games of 2013, started off pretty rough and wonky but the amount of polishing thats been put into the game made it really worthwhile and you should defninitely try it out. one of the downsides of the game? considering its a f2p game you will be slightly limited in the amount of warframes/weapons youll be able to stock up. but if you spend as much time playing (and loving) it as i did, that would just be a reason to support the developers and throw some money into upgrading your slots. major downside? the bloody chat is still pretty awful.",5
"this is a good game so far amazing graphics and all!",1
"just started playing this game about 2 weeks back and it has been a blast so far. i would go into great detail on what this game is about, but that would take too long, so here is a few words to describe it: space ninjas, guns, powers, robots, aliens, swords, lots of other cool , and...its free. what more could you want?",1
"warframe this is a great game to play for free with a the game i like another one.",5
"best game ever 10/10 if your not a ninja you have to pay but its still good",1
"this is a really fun game and i would recommend it, its good if you like co-op games and would like to play with your friends however it is repetitive at time and if warframe was a payed game it would get a 7/10. although it is a free 2 play so i give it a 8.5/10 the only thing holding it down is the repetitiveness of the game.",1
"life consuming. something for everyone. nothing for you? of course there is.",1
"i dont play this game alot but when i do i can play this game for hours on end without breaks so if you want a f2p this is the one you should be putting your time into",1
"this game is the perfect game for anyone for like me who likes fast paced 3rd person shooters and where you are a space ninja on action packed missions. i recommend this game to anybody who is a gamer.",1
"if you like ninjas... welp youre ing set this game is basically a saints row with ninjas! ninjas in space",2
"played for an hour to get 621 circuits which are resources, my internet went down lost all of them. 11/10 would play again",1
"i really love this game. when i first got it it was a little laggy but then it wasnt. otherwise the graphics are awsome and the campain is great",1
"this game is so so so awesome for me it was lagging as hell for maybe it becoz of playing on a laptop but the graph are so beautiful make me want to be out at space",1
"feels repetitive...but it has such good design and gameplay. i want to play it, but i get bored. hopefully warframe will update a bit more to change my mind. for now, id say its pretty good. pretty cool gameplay.",2
"awsome game lots of stuff you will never get bored updated almost evry week fun and did i said awsome yet i did well thats all its awsome",1
"great and addicting game that will make you sit on your chair grinding resources until you dont even realise its been hours of gameplay.",5
"really great co-op game, try it and youll easilly get addicted to it!",1
"all i can say is... odd....odd....odd........... for lots of xp! 10/10",1
"love this game my only problems are the day /2/3 day waits on weps and warframes when crafting and they fact that u have to grind so damn long for just a few things and some times u wont even get them stil a good game thow",2
"this is probably one of the most fun, amazing and swagalisious games ive ever played. this game is also free and has lots of options to do in it with a wide range of an arsenal to pick from. ill say this game is a near perfect game (besides the bugs, grrr!) ill give it a 10 outa 10 :d",3
"i recomment this game to everyone who likes shooting , action more shooting and more action.... basicly ....my new favorite game!",1
"warframe is a great game with a few bugs but it is still in beta, i strongly recommend it.",1
"i love it but i dont like the fact that you have to buy some things with real money the fact that is free makes it worst but over all its a great game",1
"if you have epilepsy, dont play this game because its too epic and probably causes epilepsy",1
"its a free2play game that was not a pay2win and your a ninja in space with a fancy color in a armor suit that killing all the bad guys accross the system and duh.. u can fly too ... nice game . good graphic. 10/10 addicted.",3
"this game is just awesome. its a really good game that everyone should play! what will they think of next?!! so start downloadin and playin warframe!!!",1
"great f2p game. space ninjas can keep you entertained for a few hours without getting boring too fast.",1
"for a free game in beta, this is sweet  thing to play.",1
"only worth playing if you have a full team (4 people) with you. otherwise, dont play it since you will die a lot.",1
"refreshingly brisk action game. be warned - the in-game explanation of the ui and game itself is  awful. you _will_ need to read the wiki pages. there is also a small drawback in that grinding out cash/items for new warframes and weapons can be extremely tedious. however, these two small issues aside, its jolly good fun. it remains to be seen how they retain interest in their playerbase, as the procedurally generated environments can be a bit samey after a while, but so far its interesting. rock paper shotgun have a clan you can join, which i intend to do shortly.",6
"this game highly recommend for people who looking for ninja gameplay with future stuff",7
"you must play this game with your friends. and if you can now i mean if you can find someone you should play this game immidiately.",1
"10/10 best time sink whats also nice is that it seems like the developers care about the game as a whole",4
"quite a fun and interesting game, mainly for having a lack of story. but it is very entertaining with plenty to do and grinding /farming is not at all boring.",1
"a bit hard to learn the advanced tactics and find the tutorials for that matter, outside of that, brilliant graphics, easy to play the basics. grouping is effortless and the music is great also. the only dislike i have, is that it seems like pay to win at the start. dont know at the end game how it is, but.. crafting and leveling is interesting enough, as is the class mechanic. wholeheartedly recommend.",1
"great game. give it 10/10 and would recommend this game to others.",1
"fun, and smooth combat (if i remember correctly), but can get a little repetitive not to be played over and over without break",1
"it not pay for win but pay for awesome item in game. #hyped",1
"play this. new players will find it challenging. old players may find the updated versions improve gameplay. try it out (again if need be) and decide!",9
"fighting mechanics easy but enjoyable, ais are not intellegent can stand in front of them and they just stare back. lots of fun though cool storyline and works well on low spec machine.",1
"only in this game can you play as an electric space ninja with a mustache, dual swords made of ice and a golden gun that shoots rail spikes, killing every future-armored enemy that dares cross your path. then a moa eximus comes up behind you and you curse the name of every corpus deity you bothered to learn the name of.",1
"warframe is one of the better free to play multiplayer games on the market, since most of the items can be acquired for free and the grind isnt -completly- terrible (but can still be a turn-off to some) compared to most f2p games. it has a unique artstyle that makes it fresh and fun enough gameplay, especially with the newer editions like the new melee system and jetpack segments. playing the co-op with friends can be really fun. there are issues with repetitive enviroments though, as well as a confusing and unfriendly ui. the game also isnt really single player friendly. it is a option but the difficulty spikes up really hard for a single player in the later levels, and even when you start out the first levels can be hard because the weaponry you get as a new person is utter trash. i recomend you upgrade your gear as soon as you can. the pvp also wasnt worth mentioning last i played, expect a entirely co-op experiance.",2
"fuuuuuuunnnn only if your computer can handle tho!",3
"great game and by far favourite free to play game with fun fast paced combat",1
"one of the best free to play online shooters ive seen so far graphics are great you dont have to pay yea it helps if you do but you can still build the stuff missions are fun i like everything about it",1
"cool gameplay. wallrunning, killing enemies while sliding etc. stylish visuals.",1
"my character has a wind-up key on his back, shiny gold skin, and a large attachment. recommended.",1
"i will ing recommend this game for awesome purposes.",1
"very fun game, co-op aspect is really fun and is feels actually like what a co-op should",1
"at first i was ive played something like this before..... . . . . gotta play again",1
"recommend this game cause you can have plane like ufo and you can make item from blue print",1
"totally awesome game, i was playing it since the closed beta, but something happened and it wasnt funny for me anymore. just, i highly recommend this game to everyone! try it, its ing awesome!",2
"this is the first game i got steam and it is very addictive and fun. i recommend this to all tps players. the only problem i have is accesing other wepons apart from the ones you choose at the start of the game. this game gets five stars!!!",1
"i hate the repetitive side....... but its fun............ the only  thing i realy hate is that you have to buy black/gray/white.... seriusly! black gray and white? anyway its good... you can get op real quick thats what i like...",1
"this game is awesome, i spent some money to buy good stuff ( it was really cheap when discounted) . i can play it all day",1
"i enjoy the game, though the controls are a bit odd compared to what i am accustomed to. it definitely took some getting used to and a few key bind changes but overall its a good game. there are missions i prefer to avoid, that defend the point ones as the amount of mobs can get a tad overwhelming when youre just starting out. overall id recommend this game.",1
"this game is awesome.you are a ninja in space with magic!!!",1
"new update crashees no launch plez help me someone",2
"this game is awesome but i grew tierd from it i has everything a space guy would like killing idiotic greneirs or the smart  corpus maybe even the corrupted infestation mutant but sadly now they nerfed stuff so it might be harder but to compensate they have added some cool and awesome stuff that really helps this game have parkour sliding and flying kicks into enemies to stagger them this game have axees schytes whips fist weapons bo staffs swords dual swords and daggers and a bunch of epic weapons i recomend this game for those gamers that have patience in building stuff in collecting material and slaying enemies with their team or for those that just like to waste money on getting stuff quickly and whiping  like a badass",4
"probably the best free to play game out there, i think its great and i have two new releases (shadow of mordor, lords of the fallen) and i would still rather play warframe :)",1
"best game ewar 10/10 -good graphics -good desing -godly weapons -fun gameplay -very creative - awsome updates ewery thng s avsome",2
"my girlfriend left me because of this game... 10/10",3
"every day i play this game. every day for the past 1 and 9 months. being one of the first thousand and seeing this game grow brings a tear to this gamers face. i recommend this game to anybody and everybody i meet who is a gamer. its just too good to not play.",4
"only played a very little amount of this game but already i know what happens if you mix mass effect with destiny. this game has been widely reviewed to be better than both so if you enjoyed either of those games, youll probably love this.",1
"this game can be fun, fast, annoying, but is mostly fun. that thing in games where you cant get around fast enough? warframe lets you flip through air (without slowmotion), jump kick, slide, run up walls, stab people while they are on the ground, and some other maneuvering things that i probably havent discovered yet. you can play without paying (but it is kind of tedious) or you can pay and get stuff faster, but it is not required. and a tip to new players is to trade some of your 50 platinum in the beginning for some good weapons, which come cheap compared to their store price. the default warframes are also pretty good. i use volt and it is great for crowd control but you may want to pay attention to your energy bar the other warframes look cool and do other stuff like loki will turn itself invisible and it can duplicate itself. all in all, it is just a generally good game (except when it gets annoying)",1
"after 300 hours, and $30, put into this game, i think its fair to say i recommend it. the graphics and physics are amazing, the missions challenging with plenty of combat options, huge list of weapons and equipment (some of which are exclusive to paying customers). while i cant really comment on the new archwing pack (havent built it yet, so going according to pre-patch). as far as story, its decent: you play a kind of void-preserved warrior from an old era of war, and then put into stasis as you were no longer needed. its now centuries later, and the system is being torn apart, so your skills are needed once again, often at the behest of the enigmatic lotus (remnant of the old era?). so, yourself and other players wake up and start the never ending struggle of saving the system. so, the story is a bit loose and open to interpretation. but, the part that stands out the most is the addition of new weapons, mods, equipment, and armors (seems to be new ones added every 4-6 months). so, the combinations for mischief and mayhem are boundless, and thats where this game shines the most. overall, i give this game an 8.5/10, as they are still improving the game.",3
"still very glichy i tried to enter a game and i got stuck in screen with no head. got killed wilst not moving and still loading/ used my last revive and was still stuck in game. i had to crtl alt del to get out of game. and plus the archwing levels are to few where is the rest. why make it so hard to get the archwing for only 5 levels to play it with. hopefuly you can respond to my review or send me a bonus or somthing to make it more playable and the warframes are to hard to put together i thought when you bought a blueprint it came with the parts to build it. what a rip. how the  are you supposed to get anywhere when it takes forever to get a part.",2
"the game is solid. ive been playing on and off since early beta and the developers have done nothing but improve this game. the only problem i personally have with this game... is the amount of farming you have to do if you dont want to spend real money on the game. which is reasonable for a f2p game sooooo.",3
"a free shootum up with maps that change both over time and depending on who your fighting for, or what the type mission is. this game is alot of fun, crushing huge waves of enemies. with many different objectives and 3 different factions to contend with its damn fun for no investment. get your space commando on and experience the mirad of weapons and mods as you fight your way towards your goals.",3
"this game is super fun, except for the bugs. keep crashing, passed the mission but they say i fail.",1
"its just like spiral knights, but with jumping and flying mechain instead.",1
"o_o this, this game, it is explisit, lol whatam i saying, its a great game literally, vast maps and diverse weapons/frames, its awsome, id recommend it to most people, now then, if yeall excuse me, im going back to my limbo farming...",4
"been addicted to this since day one playing this game.has nice graphic, soundtrack, leveling system is great and also who doesnt love space ninja. grinding for this game is fun. sometime grinding can feel somewhat repetitive but it doesnt have that feeling for this game. i really recommend this game.",1
"so far... it used to work but now it says it cannot connect, i tried reinstalling the game and yet it still didnt work. i suggest they get a patch for it soon. yet the game isnt bad for what ive played so far.",1
"space ninjas. freaking space ninjas. thats warframe in a nutshell. ninjas. the game is very big and expansive, has a great combat system and has lots of customization and such for players. the microtransactions are extremely annoying and playing f2p will result in you having to grind over and over. for a f2p title it is extremely well polished, and the game looks beautiful when its graphics are cranked to the max. this is almost next-gen levels of polish. the game does feel pretty open, and theres plenty to do, but like i said, playing f2p is a annoying challenge. but then again, with a f2p game this quality, how is it not worth dropping at least 40-60 dollars?",1
"this game has so many different ways to play, theres stealth, tank or you can be a sniper, really good and worth the the download.",1
"this game is an amazing example of how a slight remix of an idea can explode in popularity and exellent gameplay. like stealth play? go for it, theres an entire 3 characters for it an a whole array of weapons. like running and gunning? go forth and slaughter to your hearts content. warframe is truly a game that shows that giving the player a large number of pointy objects and fleshy, blood filled targets can be the most fun in your life.",1
"its fun, and not necessarily pay to win. you only pay to get boosts but other people can buy it with credits they earned.",1
"mmo for short. probably next generation graphics. no high computer specs needed. great gameplay, futuristic, and a little but educating becouse of the planets you travel to. point is: -make you character -fight trought the defenses -kick  -have fun make you family or clan. craft items such as rifles, bows and other... didnt play much but i am satisfied my rate as always 10/10 many updates, carefull with patches and ig look. install it as soon as possible :d",1
"i liked it, it wasnt too bad for me, though i prefer full controller support i would recomend it",1
"farming simulator 2013-20** and beyond. very well built game.",3
"one of the most amazing pc shooters ive played since halo",1
"your objective is to farm. there is no story only a sad atempt at a story. you can choose to pay money to get gear that is hard to farm. then use that gear to farm the crappy gear. the only plus to the game are the visuals. probably a handfull of talented devs surrounded by idiots.",5
"while it can get a little grindy at times, this is by far one of the best free to play games ive ever encountered. their business model is fair and affordable should you choose to spend money on the game. take note that spending money is not required to access all game content and the rmt currency (platinum) can be traded amongst players, so even free players have access to the items in the store. the gameplay itself is fast paced, and the freedom of movement is liberating and smooth. warframe specific powers are flashy but very useful, and any warframe class is an asset in fights. i would recommend this game to anyone, even if they do not like shooters. i wasnt too keen when i first started but now im hooked! been playing it for over a year.",9
"i liked the game sooo much in the beginning, but when you level up your warframes it gets too easy. then, for those conclave things(pvp) someone will always have those broken melle weapons, it just gets boring. for example, dragon nikana, everyone was dead with a slide hit.so i would recommend this game for the first... like... 200 hours maximum? but then it gets bad.oh, and dont you bother using money at this game except if youre going to put lots of it.i put like 100 over the 2 years i played,and it didnt help much. anything you get with money, you can also get it with some luck and patience. alright so you can play it, the review is about my personal opinion, if there have been changes that make it more difficult and the pvp has become more interesting just tell me so i reconsider my thoughts about that game. btw sorry for any mistakes i made about how does the game work, long time no play. and another thing, if you want to enjoy your hours of gameplay in warframe, be friendly, it has a good community that can make you laugh or cry because some players are completely newbs. good luck.",3
"pretty fun game when you cant find anything else to play... much better with friends.",1
"warfare is a f2p game with fantastic mechanics. my reasoning for not reccomending the game is because of the hours on end you will spend trying to obtain a single weapon or character. basically, in order to be even remotely good at the game i.e. over-powered weapons / specific characters, you would have to pay for in game currency, otherwise know as platinum, or just comepletely no life the game, every single time you wish to have an upgrade, new weapon, or a new warframe. on the flip-side, warframe offers a fast pased, run and gun, wall running experience un-like any other. a game similar to this game, but not as far into the future is, vindictus (for those who look for similar games, vindictus is a prequel to mobonogi. despite no awesome mechanics like wall running, it is quite enjoyable and if swords, bows, and other weapons are more your speed check it out). personally, i do not like to grind, i payed for all my gear and would reccommend warframe to people at least open to the idea of spending money, if not, hope you like the grind!",1
"+not pay-to-win +every character and weapon can be earned without paying actual money +probably will end up buying some cosmetics with money anyway, just like lol or tf2 -i feel it requires joining an active clan or a group of friends to play with for the fun to keep going past end game",7
"support this game its made by the same guys who made dark sector really good game this is just like but ten times better",1
"you have to play warframe becuase its the most epic tps game are there is",1
"anyone?send help i dont have my computer but sending this from a school computer, 65 days from computer withdrawl. parents say grades arent good enough, please send me power cords",1
"ive played this game for a long time and im very impressed it has evolved alot from what it was origanally and its gameplay mixes classic third person controlls with good flowing parkour, interesting and diverse weapons and good melee combat add all this with the evolving universe and lore that is growing from the game. my only critism is that the game hassles you for money such as the kubrows, the kubrows make you have to log on every day or it loses health and if you put it in stasis it takes 3 hours to wake it up, the crafting is quite decent and reasnable but the exessive periods you have to wait are quite offputting. all in all this is a great game, as soon as my friend introduced me to this game i was hooked and now i love it and cant stop playing it. the graphics in this game are also fantastic as well and so is the music, it provides an interesting variety of game types and missions the enemys are also very diverse. one of the things that i personally like about this game is that the focus is taken away from pvp, the reason i like this is because so many free to play games are all just pvp focused. anyway to wrap this all up i recommend this game and think it is a great piece of work 10 out of 10",2
"the grind is real, but its all worth it. the gameplay is addictive, updates and patches are frequent, and the devs are outstanding. oh, and you get to be a space ninja.",3
"ive heard lots of good things about this game and i was dying to try it! but unfortunatley, some update content cant be downloaded from the servers! so yeah... i cant play the actual game which is fun all in itself! but i would hope other people have better luck.",1
"it is an awesom game super fun to play.but it is needed to have platinum to fully enjoy the game.",1
"awsoome game! i recomend this game to people who likes grinding and like to be an ninja. ninjas play free.",1
"great game, people who enjoy a sci-fi experience should atleast give it a go.",2
"you can almost get all of the items and equips from the farming and in-game credits. but you can also purchase platinums to buy those items but only cosmetics that can puchased by plats. overall, its a good game, pretty addicting. you cant stop with only one or two warframes/weapons, you will always wanted to make another one.",4
"try it i think you will like it doesnt matter which toon you choose at first you can create more later",1
"its such a shame...though this game has some of the most fun ive had playing f2p, the buisness model leaves much to be desired. unless your willing to grind out mission after mission, or pay for content, your going to find yourself leveling and aquiring better items much more slowly than i would have liked. the gameplay is reminiscent of me3s multiplayer, with more expansive levels and a smoother playstyle. if it wasnt for the pay2win system thid would be one of my favorite games on steam.",1
"pretty cool co-op game, very simular to mass effect",1
"before, indefinite yes, wouldve said yes a million times, it was a little empty yes, and gameplay was buggy, but it wasnt so complicated....now the maps not fluid or very understandable, some levels are too hard to solo if you are a solo gamer, and it can be just plain confusing... buuuut, it can still be a very good game for teams, i only say no because they ruined it for solo players",1
"i really enjoy the combat, everytime i play i learn something new or some new combo move. sure you can be the guy who sits in the back and shoots things, but you are missing a core part of the game and that involves being the matrix without bullettime. my only problem with the game is that it doesnt really explain how to play it; you just wake up, some creepy guy rubs your leg and then the game is just like now kill everyone and deflect this guys laser beams while defedning your ship and dozens of men with automatic weapons fire at you.",1
"one of the best games ive played but needs to have offline mode",1
"**be warned, warframe can be highly addictive** pros: - f2p - ninjas in space - you dont need platinum for getting the good stuff. only if you want to have all warframes/big arsenal of weapons then you might need to spend some real money. if so, wait that you get big discount as a login reward. cons: - can get repetitive - can steal quite many hours from your day, without you noticing it i cant comment how it is for beginners, for i started long time ago.. and if you are a veteran player, who got bored, give it a go! there has been a lot of changes :)",3
"lemme give ya a pros and cons list: pros: good gameplay good music nice surrounding awesome co-op mode cons: sometimes this game becomes a little pay2win most levels are a bit the same i rate it a 9.2/10 great game",1
"used teleport on an enemy. stucked in the wall. tried moving to get out of the wall. glitched and fell out of the map. died. press revive. respawned at out of the map. died again. -raged and press forfeit- my ashs true story in a nutshell. 10/10",7
"after all the changes and updates, i cant really get into it. i will go back every now and then but i cant see myself sticking with it for much longer. pros: -decent 3rd person shooter for a free to play -can be fun with friends -runs well and is well optimised -constantly being updated (also a negative) cons: -its free to wait, pay to win -the movement system can bug out badly -the guns feel more like your scratching the enemy than shooting them -late game melee isnt viable -only 2 or 3 wareframes are able to survive late game due being able to cheap the game -the ai is akin to a spud, and will run at you in lines and mostly out of cover -the updates have sucked what was fun out of the game -(constant re-balancing and changing of core mechanics, as well as adding unintuative ui changes) -useless weapons and wareframes can lead to beginner traps overall it just seems like the game is being updated over and over to force you to pay money for things, and the obsurdly ridiculous waiting times are a joke. to make and get a fully upgraded weapon that can last a while (until a rebalance) literally takes over 2 weeks. thats to get all the blueprints, grind for resources, grind for money and literally wait for it to build. or you can spend real money and get it on the spot there and then without finding the blueprints or grinding.",1
"a third person cooperative shooter with loot runs, procedurally generated levels, a ton of grinding but more content being added all the time.",1
"i think this is going to be a good game like destiny.",1
"rolled and flew through 2 floors to extraction, then got in a lobby with 5 other tenno. 10/10 ign would bang",4
"this game is so damn amazing i in love it !!! i deffinetly would reccomend it !!!!",1
"space magic, space magic, space armor and space acrobatics.",4
"great fun, interesting mechanics of swordfighting and agility. the best part about htis game is the agility+weapons mixed together, it is a versatile yet deadly combo. something i am dissapointed about is the little credits you earn for completing missions. 3/5",1
"great game, lots of fun.....can be a little repetative, cant wait for expanded content!",5
"like all free to play games, there is a catch. you cant get any new warframes without spending money on this game (at least from what i have seen playing it). you also have a limited arsenal, again, unless you pay. that alone is what i do not like about this game and it was enough for me to stop playing nearly instantly after i started.",1
"this, is our fork in the road loves last episode theres nowhere to go, oh no you made your choice, now its up to me to bow out gracefully though you hold the key, but baby whenever you call me, ill be there whenever you want me, ill be there whenever you need me, ill be there ill be around i, knew just what to say now i found out today that all the words had slipped away, but i know theres always a chance a tiny spark remains, yeah and sparks turn into flames and love can burn once again, but i know you know whenever you call me, ill be there whenever you want me, ill be there whenever you need me, ill be there ill be around...yeah whenever you call me, ill be there whenever you want me, ill be there even if i have to call, ill be there ill be around just call me at home, ill be there ill never leave you alone, ill be there just call out your name you know i know you know ill be around",5
"this game is a fun and addictive.plus with all the levels and charecters it gives many different ways tp play. what i am saying the game is amazing!:)",1
"good fun game, especially if you like the idea of customization and being a space ninja",3
"a fast-paced third person shooter. game best played with friends and using team speak to communicate. playing with random people can by okay, but usually you play with guys that are just farming resources, so its rush to the end. i burned me drive for this game when it was still in beta. the game just comes down to geting resources to build new wepons and warframes, if collecting stuff is your cup of tea, go for it, if your not up to grinding for hours then it is a skip.",2
"this is a great game and you should play it. sometimes it gliches but they always do that!",1
"it really good game it hard but good experience also the cosmetic and the weapons and the enemy are epic as well so yea really nice game also the adventure is long so i recommend this game",1
"thats one of the best f2p games i have ever played. you gotta be patient if you wanna completely design your character. i would rate 8/10",1
"very fun. hard start but once you get your skills youre good to go.",2
"great game im not that good at it still fun being a ninja",3
"(this is just constructive critisim also sorry if i misspell anything) this game is in the top 3 of my pc games (#2). if there were only 3 things that i could change it would be: gerneer models (just cover there face), make it so gus do not need platnum to buy( some guns(weak ones)), and finally include it for the xbox one and ps4. this is because not everyone has a good computer(like me) and like my computer it lags a lot exspecaly online and i would buy the game the second it comes out on xbox or ps. agian i love this game and i love you guys for making it, i am just saying you can make a lot more money if it was on the computer, xbox one, and ps4. i will even buy an xbox one or ps4 if it was relesed on them and i know my friends will too. -guardian angel",1
"this game is good for the first 200 hours or so then it gets boring but every update brings something new so you play it again so i rate this game a 8.5/10 good game not enough varity to keep me playing though also lots of bugs",3
"this is one of the best f2p games ever created in my opinion. its gorgeous, its super fun, and youre never pressured into paying because you are given many opportunities to craft new items and warframes for free. (when i say free, i mean after extensive grinding.) the large arsenal of weapons and mods lets you equip yourself to your play style and every warframe feels completely unique. also, space ninjas. 10/10",1
"the controls ache my fingers worse than playing a guitar.",1
"very fun...to a point about four levels in the terrains repeat and it just becomes grindy",1
"this game is just as awesome as it looks. tons of fast-paced action mixed with a variety of different play styles and customization. i havent spent a penny on this game and i recommend you do the same if you want the best experience. grinding and farming for resources and exp are what brings this game such a strong replay value. the real money system basically just grants you things instantly which i believe takes away from the experience. if you enjoy action games in general i would highly recommend this game.",1
"this game is really god. lots of potential. its fun and it looks really good, only problem is, this is a freemium sorry to disappoint",1
"0-10 hours: the starter weapon sucks, the starter character sucks and this game sucks! why did i let my friends get me to try this? 15 hours: oh this drakgoon thing is kinda cool i guess. rhino seems interesting too. 30 hours: wow im starting to get decent mods for my stuff, its getting really good. still feels really grindy. wtf is a potato or a forma??? 100 hours: wow this latron prime shreks! this game is pretty awesome! 120 hours: *starts talking strats with friends* 140 hours: *starts obsessively farming towers and alerts, hoping to get vauban chassis 200 hours: *has more potatoed and multi-formad secondaries than primaries* help me... i cant stop yeah this game is pretty good. try it if you want to destroy your life.",4
"i like the concept of this game, and i even liked the missions i could do. however, the game lags horribly and even stops altogether when played. my computer has all the necessary requirements to play warframe, it just doesnt quite work. it used to lag just when playing with other people, but now it lags all around. when i figure out whats causing the lag reaction and the other issues, then ill change and give a more positive review. currently, ill give 5/10 on 12/13/2014.",1
"this 3rd shooter game is awesome! from the graphics and animation to the storyline and the quest xd",2
"really fun game, takes some time to grow on you at the start but after that its smooth sailing until you start crafting then it goes really slow",2
"mo friggin space ninjas so this game is eeeeh, pretty good. got that 3rd person perspective super sparkle hardore parcore so much stuff to grind it can choke a monkey. the basis is simple, you fall out a tube, how do you do. grab a gun and blap blap, swing of the blade and thats the game. the major goal is....well there isnt really a goal. more like personal guidelines to make. maybe you prefer a certain weapon, or swords over bullets? many frames decide a general comfort and play style, ranging from super thick tanks who can take a beating, to heal classes and support, brawlers to snipers what have you. i got a little time under my belt on this title, and seen some stuff. all in all mastery is the games core. get mastery, rank up. do more stuffs. takes place in this spacial atmosphere, exploring planets, waring against factions and dogs? hell yeah dogs. this game as so much content (monkey choke) also if you gotta few bucks, get you some plat. support the devs who bust rump to release interesting, and fulfilling content. i give this a solid c/12 rating. so gud. oh yeah, and it has pvp. so do it. play it. get it. now. im waiting. its free",7
"the new contents they keep adding make you want to continue playing :d",8
"its a nice coop game that really has good maps, story and missions. yes, it is pay to win but if youre only playing coop then you dont have to worry about that.",1
"its a fantastic free to play game. well done and designed by an interested and thoughtful design team. my only real complaint would be that platinum doesnt have as much bang for the buck as one would like.",5
"got an egg from beating up wild dogs with a sword that fired like a shotgun. 11/10 best game",2
"this game is a very tense and fun game to play. you can play with your friends or choose to play alone. although i get lag, it is stila great game to play!",1
"i have seen this game grow into what used to be one ship that was randomly generated, to multiple areas with alot more random generation, lots of new weapons, warframes, and cosmetics, (most) that dont require spending money. this game is seriously what f2p should be. i would highly recommend for anyone looking for a fun, quick, and action packed game. pros, cons: -pros- *amazing graphics *very optimized *lots of warframe, weapon, sentinel, kubrow, and more, customization *dont have to spend a penny on this game *very very very friendly devs *very friendly community that will help you if your stuck on something. -cons- *not really a con for me but, grinding with be pretty common in this game. *rng is.... ehhh.... so thats my personal review for this game. yes i know its not that great. i heavily recommend this game. what are you waiting for? go and be a space ninja!!!",4
"great game pick it up and play with the cool community.",1
"4 words: space ninjas with guns. on a more serious note: a bit pay to win, while possible to grind items and credits you usually have to do a lot of it to really get the cool stuff... a lot of things are also nearly impossible to get without the use of real money... but if you want a game where you run, jump, gun and slash your way through different types of enemies in all kinds of gory ways, then go for it!",1
"only game i play and the amoun tof money i put into it could buy me 50 aaa games best game ever!!!!!!",4
"is good to entertain, very long gameplay (really no ending) and after each update it gets better is a on-going ride, a free ride and that is all what matter.",1
"very good game, a little disorientating when you start playing, but when you get a hang on it you wont stop playing. wide range of weapons/modifications",1
"im realy enjoying playing with my friends. not your typical mmo and i like it that way!",2
"one of the best co-operative third person shooters ive played. amazing graphics and animation, and the controls are easy to learn.",1
"i love this game. especially with the new archwings, this game is fact-paced and fun to play. pumping a couple dollars into the game helps you move along faster, but this game is definitley not pay-2-win, and you can play the full game comepletey free. this game does get repetitive, so i would reccomend playing maybe a couple times a week.",2
"warframe is extremely fun to play with friends and its challenging at times giving people a goal to shoot for. i think its a very well designed weapon and warframe crafting system aswell, though farming some parts for specific weapons and primes can get a bit (insanely) repetetive. great systems of trading parts for other parts with other players etc, though a fair warning to anyone new !! the grind is real !! overall good game but can get repetetive at times. :3",4
"absolutely love this game. still, anything can be good by adding space ninjas, am i right?",4
"great game! fun to play if you have good team-mates, but it is fun to play solo too.",1
"it looks like ninja with nano suit and futuristic weapon, very cool",3
"awesome game! who didnt tried game yet ,should really try it ,from update to update its just getting better and better ,be sure to try it.",5
"a grate game... if u are searching for a 3rd pesone shooter with unlimited movment variations, seacrets, grate combat system and a grate comunity cooperation then this is just the game for u. hury up and start playing!!!",7

"recommended but it might look like you keep doing the same level over and over again but you can trust me that it changes a little bit",1
"i love this game. but would like it to be available for steam linux. so pls consider releasing it foe linux too.",1
"this is the best game ive played in a long time. the archwing update is a bit stupid , but still a good game",6
"it has realy good grapics and alot of guns and weapons in store and it has good skills and players not only that it has lots of eneimes and lot",1
"warframe is an mmo shooter with a little lack in story, but beautiful visual and very awesome warframe (the high tech ninja you pick or build or buy ether way) moving on, the game progresses to better height everytimes it update, the developer are very awesome to there community( meaning they actually listen o_o), and they can be very active on hotfix (alway sending update to take down bugs), the game is still journey, there a lot of ideas, lot of challenges, grinding for builds, in opinion this game will become apart of youre life, it free so why not, this game will make you do theories because of the lack of fillers...soo good luck!",7
"warframe is by far the best free-to-play shooter ive seen, theres no pay to win as there is no real player versus player (besides the deuling mode in the clan bases, edit: and conclave, but nobody plays that anyway heuehuhehehhhe.) and while grinding for credits and parts to build stuff can get a little tedious, all the levels are procedurally generated so they always keep you on edge as what to expect. grab 3 friends to play this game with you, and give it a try on whatever platform you feel.(*cough*pcmasterrace*cough*)",1
"a good non-pay-to-win game that you can get all common in-game item without spending a single dollar. join the space ninja(farmer) to grind your very own equipment blueprint/parts!",3
"be a robot ninja in space. team up with three other robot ninjas to slice, dice, and shoot your way through thousands of enemies in varying mission types. level dozens of weapons and customize them with mod cards with over 9000 possible combinations. this game is absolutely worth playing. give it a try; well see you on the battlefield, tenno.",1
"warframe has nice graphics, a neat concept of booster cards, and a couple of really awesome weapons with a nice feel. unfortunately, the game is ruined completely by the utterly broken scaling that reduces it to tedious min-maxing, with the gameplay itself not offering much more than ability to slaughter hordes of boring enemies, and endless grind.",1
"like ninjas with guns? well this is ninjas with guns in space! the game is based entirely on how overpowered you can get, whether you augment your warframe, modify and max out your weapons, or go ballistic with your melee of choice. gameplay is varying on how you wish to play and there are dozens of warframes for them. however, its good to keep in mind that you may find yourself doing a lot of grinding and looting for the rarer materials to build said warframes. maps can get repetitive, but helps you remember where loot can be found. you either have to go through a lot of grinding to get materials and credits to forge new gear, with can get boring when playing alone. biggest issue, though, is the drastic difficulty curve. one moment, youre dominating every grineer, corpus, and infested you come across. next thing you know, youre flattened by the next planets enemies. id recommend this game, but definitely if you have someone to play with. relying on matchmaking usually ends up with total strangers much stronger than you, noobs who dont know what to do so you constantly have to revive them, or soloing witht the chance of losing all your revives. basically, i recommend you make some friends or meet your ends.",4
"the game is changing constantly in a positive direction as the devs listen to users feedback on the forums and even on stream, all the warframes offer thier own special aspects and skills. on a side-note i ing love loki with every fiber of my being and, when starting the game dont be discouraged by the platnum anything can be obtained with normal gameplay it just takes time, the platnum is a shortcut while the game with worth the founder packs offered on the website, i love this game and feel like its a retail release game, with new features recently as clan dojos and dueling, and researching as a clan reward for weapons that require some degree of teamwork.",4
"ive only been playing this masterpice for half an hour or so, but i already love it. its fast-paced, responsive, and graphicly stunning. it leaves an excellent first impression, but only time will tell if it holds up or not.",1
"completly frustrating for beginners and new players. tutorial throws you in the middle of the action, game modes are not explained, matchmaking throws you in with maxlevle people who raise the difficulty to enourmous levels. game is broken in many ways, missions disconnect even if all playeres are still online, ingeame money vanishes after missions sometimes. getting better rank or gear is a hostile and slow grind. community is completly hostile and unresponsive, except some very, very few individuals.",1
"sorry, but can not recommend. the gameplay is fun and the weapons and levels are interesting, but none of that matters because i have yet to see a game as glitchy as this. ive had everything from objectives not showing up, to doors remaining locked (effectively locking you into a room forever) to timed missions where youre left waiting for that extraction that will never come because the timer has stopped at 1:07 left. if theyve just released some sort of content, youd best believe thats gonna be glitched to hell. even for a f2p title, the amount of bugs is just not acceptable, especially after its been out this long.",5
"its an ok game. its not bad. there are may worse games out there, and to be honest, this one is actualy kind of fun. you dont need very much skill to be good at it, and it really is a pay to win game, but even if you dont, that just means itll take about 10 times as long to do stuff. i wont harp on that though, as most games are like that anyway. the graphics are really good, the environments are well thought out, and no two maps are the same, because every map is randomly generated. the ai is pretty , but they make up for it with insane accuracy. the warframes are also fun to mess around with, and the wepons are cool. this isnt a game i recommend if you want a challenge, i recomend this game to people who want to beat the living hell out of thousands of underpowerd enimes while using superpowers like lightning, fire, wind, death itself, or a shrukin (suprised me to).",2
"this game is wonderful. loads of replayability, tons of customization, fun levels, enemies, and a wide variety of weapons and playstyles. if you have a soul you should at least try this game out.",4
"free to play destiny on pc is pretty much this game but diffrent",1
"a good time sink with a fair business model. the game has great gunplay and most abilities are very satisfying to use, and since the game revolves around pve, they have an excuse to be quite broken. crafting equipment, weapons and warframes takes a lot of time, but it feels really good when your effort finally pays off and you unlock that sweet new warframe you spent 3 days farming for. the gameplay can get quite repetitive, but the variety of missions and guns helps keep it from getting boring. having stuck around since the beta, i can tell you that the developers do a great job of updating the game regularly. being one of the very few games i have supported since before its release, i have not yet been disappointed. if youre looking for a good sci-fi shooter that you can sink time into every once in a while, or just play regularly, im willing to say that neither will you.",3

"dungeon based 3rd person shooter in ninja skin, even if the game will let you play against bot more often, the fun incomparable. if youre more on pvp guy, i dont recommend this game because the pvp is pretty much broken and is not the main focus of the game. gameplay 10/10 story 10/10 customization 10/10 graphics 10/10 market 10/10 so far this game is a farming simulation because de :d. almost everything you see in the market, you can farm so you dont need to spend much money.",10

"it may look pay2win, but its not. its actually fun to try. the game is very well optimized for my pc, the graphics are amazing. the gameplay is very well but what fails for me are the controls, i would try getting a controller. the missions can be frustrating when you are alone at times, but when you are with a couple of friends who help you and make a good team, well thats a good thing! i really recommend this game, its absolutely amazing. if you own a ps4, you can also try it! it is still amazing!",1
"1. if you are not a fan of farming of any sorts, this game is not for you. 2. if you dont like having ingame purchases, this game is not for you. now with that out of the way, lets get to what i like about it. i played this game about a year ago. it was wierd and very hard to understandl. i have recently started trying it again and have formed an addiction. i love how the game is run and how it feels. i love to farm resources and having many characters (warframe) to choose from, each with thier own playstyle. i love the farming aspect of the game as welll. not to much a fan of the purchasing stuff for more space, but if you like the game enough, its worth it. i rate this a solid 8/10.",6
"this game is fun, but can get boring after a while if youre not playing it the right way. playing it with a couple of buddies would be my recommendation. also, the creators change the layout too much. one day i get online and its the same. then the next day, its like a whole new game. but overall, its a good game for free-to-play.",1

"you are an exoskeleton wearing, gun toting, space ninja with memory problems and awesome powers. do i really need to tell you much more? the game play is fast and fun. devastation is the name of the game as you turn enemies into piles of dust with a lightning gun, piles of shreaded beef with some claws, punch through them with a laser cannon, or even nail them to the wall with a bow (and hilariously break physics sometimes when you do) the powers of the warframes give you many tactical ways of playing. do you use the power of electricity with volt and fry enemies with lightning or do you take a rhino and laugh as they franticly try to take you down as you walk through the horde unfazed by gunfire due to your iron skin ability? maybe you like to take a steathy or fast aproach and choose the ash where you can blink behind enemies to finish them off and slice up an entire room with the push of a button using blade storm. in the end, its up to you. battle well, and win often",4
"warframe is 10/10 it has a very slow start with a lot of grinding but once you get some stuff it is amazing",3
"when i first tried this game around v7-ish, the ui was a fuster-cluck of stuff. i had no idea what to do, who goes where, why the warframes even, etc. so, sadly, i gave up. as well, a tubor of a pc was no help either. come a few weeks ago, it is up there, in my opinion, with good f2ps like team fortress 2. it follows a pattern where you have to work for stuff, and buying things is not necessary unless you want to shorten build times. i like that, it is a sense of progression that even few p2p games give. i really like that. as well, each warframe is varied, and unique in each power. some are pure tanks, others are butterflies-of-death, and 1 is basically a self-repairing/energy siphoning queen, and another is the best for defense missions. as well, each wep feels varied, and looks unique, and few need certain prerequisites to acquire them. higher mastery rank, gives you cooler weps, and clans/labs allow research into cooler weps. aside from the occasional bug, i really love this game.",2
"when i started playing this i was really confused that how to play and its tough a bit in the start but in time when u will play, slowly, slowly. you will get it and like it much i just played this game much like in 7 days 80 hrs mayb even i dont have much time to play but still 80 hrs are much. :d you should try it, whom didnt anyways take care,",1

"these updates theyve done are fantastic. great game",1
"wow what can i say about this game title. its changed loads since i played it when the beta launched but what game doesnt. now this game has new fetures added into it on the recent patch  loving it  btw ftw guys keep it up. i recommend everyone to atleast try this as it doesnt force you to do anything ( pvp related ) if you dont want to do so . this game is again co-op an most you an 3 other friends or pugs running around a map completeing the objectives an killing all the al badguys its very shiny an most will agree it has to be shiny as its a sci-fi mmo with in my opinion has a mass effect feel to it at some points which is nice",1
"it is a alright game if you are ok with the repetetive farming",1
"its a bit hard on solo but when coop its a bit easy when you stick together and farming makes it even harder to get items",1
"your common p2w with a twist, it has space ninja shooting role based characters! with them, you can do anything! as long as its the same thing for about 2 years... play if you have nothing else to do (also comes with so much blur youll throw up!) 4.5/10",5
"warframe...its a beautiful game. its got space, and ninja, and robots... love it. parkour is a factor, too, and i love that so much.",1
"very addictive and challenging game , not pay to win at all bacause almost all of the weapons and gear can be gained by collecting parts and crafting",2
"space ninjas nuff said. but seriusly its a fun game, although overtime it gets boring(after about 2 years of playing it on and off i find myelf waiting for a new update just to have a reason to go in the game), but for new players there is still alot to do like syndicate, archwing and farming xd",7
"great game if you dont mind it becoming a bit of a grind-fest sometimes, but an entertaining one at that.",2

"this game is really grindy, but the content you have to play is fun. what the  kind of game makes grinding enjoyable?",1
"this is a really fun and interesting 3rd person shooter. the game is quite beautiful, bringing the player to a host of different planets with varying scenery. the gameplay is tough, but fun. although the mechanics are lacking in some ways. the aim assist function helps keep the player locked to a target, but only to a point, this gets especially hard to manage when facing flying enemies, for the aim assist only loosely locks to the target, and when locked, the aim is tough to unlock. i found that in the simulator, that i was failing most of the time, due to the shielding enemies flying around so much that i cant hit them. on top of that, the shields they grant to their allies are too overpowered, with a bow, the player must hit the enemies head three times in a row to get the kill. this makes it not worth trying to kill the enemy over the support drone flying above them. i think that with some good tweaking and nerfing of some enemies, and the complete elimination of the defense missions (they pretty much suck every bit of fun out of this game, which is running, gunning, and slashing, there isnt much of that when there are hordes of enemies converging on you to kill a very fragile piece of equipment)",1
"its a good game dont get me wrong but.... its not for everyone.... you will jump in and enjoy it for like the first 6 missions but then you realize how much damn grinding there is and then how tedious and boring it actually gets... graphics=10 voice acting=8.7 gameplay=6.2 mechanics=7.6 overall worth value .play this if there is like literally nothing at all to play.",1

"ive played tons of f2p games over the years and while warframe isnt my normal mmo (i usually play rpg games) i have to say its definitely a game that constantly surprises and impresses me. ill admit i dont play it very often and ill get bored and quit for a bit, but each time i come back there is always something new and friggin awesome! digital extremes....you guys are top notch, keep it going :)",5
"a very fun and very stylish game w i would very much reccomend this game",1

"warframe is awesome it is definetly something that i would recomend",1

"the developers are jews but i cant stop playing. :^) 10/10 its pretty good.",1
"awesome game played 85+ hours no its not a lot compared to other people but for me thats a fair amount definitely recommend this game.",1
"my opinion of warframe is biased towards how i find enjoyment (i like grinding in games, no matter how trivial or boring). the gameplay is enjoyable, fun to parkour though there wasnt many places that used it until update 9. the weapons and warframes themselves are quite varied, although serious investment is needed to get the top tier equipment. as of now, the game is still in beta but despite the bugs its a highly decent free to play game. nearly everything in the game you can aquire without any payment, it just takes time. so how much youre willing to spend is how much time you save with the game. you do need a lot of time though, some drops are very low and get lower if youre a collecter of items like me. overall; if you have a lot of time, this is a great game to spend it, especially with friends. if you want to have some money free, you can wait for a log-in reward of a platinum discount (ingame premium currency) and buy some gear. otherwise, if you just want to have fun for a while with little investment, start as an excaliber and slash dash your way to victory one grineer squad at a time.",5

"i have been playing this game since the release of open beta and it is easily one of my favorite games of all time, it is constantly updated with new content it looks beautiful and it has something for people that love shooters and for those like me who just love some good melee mashing. i have met de steve and de rebecca in person and they are really wonderful people who are truly commoitted to making the game a great experience for everyone. warframe is truly an amazing game and i would recommend it to anyone. i think the amount of time i have spent on this game kinda speaks for itself though, even if you are apprehensive, its free so why not give it a go? whats not to love about high-tech space ninjas?",7
"its an amazing game that creates the ninja/fighter style look but will space travel, the only down side is you just repeat over and over the same things and almost the same maps. but all in all its got the fight styling that you want. oh and really sick gear and weapons",1

"why i would recommend this game? because its cool, fun and if you play wit the right players, you will have a good time. not only the missions itself are well planned, but the entire co-op sistem and weapons.",1
"dont play it. youll be addicted because you can have a scythe and slash many infected and deviously decapitate plasma-shooting space d-bags.",1
"i really enjoy this game with its variety of weapons and characters. also like the trade feature and alert missions. a very addicting game for me. bonus logins are great too.",6
"very unique class system, allows you to pick and choose which skills and abilities you bring to the battlefield. options are extremely diverse- 30+ classes, primary, secondary, and melee weapons. the beginning might seem like a slow grind (little choice in weapons and classes until a significant amout of time has been played), but it opens up around 5-7 hours in.",1
"man i love ninjas, space ninjas, thats just awsome. the game may not be the moast intense game you have ever played, its more about the community and the friends that you play this game with. this is a good time with friends, the crafting takes a long time and it may get updated with wierd changes from time to time, but if you boil it down its still the same game that i started playing with my friends, and i still enjoy those times.",5
"really enjoying the style of fast paced 3rd perso view shooter/slasher, accurate and very clean graphics. the graphics are of a very detailed and high quality even at lower settings. edit: 618 hours of gameplay later. very very dissapointed. the game is/has become unplayable for many users. constant crashes, frame rate issues, insane memory usage (alienware m17x, cpu 1~2%, ram 25% idle) play warframe..... cpu 40%, ram 67% then ram shoots up if you breathe too hard on your keyboard). the game is still such an unpolished gem. hotfixes are always being thrown in the mix, but what good is it if gaming stability affects the masses. sorry, but my vote is a no after 617+ hours of gameplay and real life money thrown into the hype. edit: oct 28th game is back and playable. it is a mastepiece that needs to be allowed a playable format. sorry for ing, but it is back and i am relieved.",10
"i really want to like this game but the stupid pay-for-gameplay-items system really sours it for me. which is a damn shame because the universe is magnificent, every single visual design is fantastic and the gameplay mechanics are really solid too. id recommend it if you can deal with zynga-fees.",1
"very repitive gaming experience but has a nice leveling up system and gameplay does noticable increase in difficulty. recommended to play but for maxium enjoyment, play with friends.",1
"i enjoyed this game very mutch but cant play it on linux now.",1
"one of the best free-to-play titles currently available in the action and shooter genre. and every update from the devs seems to make the game even more awesome. i think they will continue doing this until no player can handle the awesomeness anymore because it became too epic.",1
"this a free to play game you can pay to win but you can make it through the game without paying but it will take longer",7
"a suprisigly good idea that has been built up solidly with enjoyable gameplay. it still has a few glitches and bugs, and you can get lost on a few levels, but still a game that i highly recommend.",1
"so when i first started playing this, i really wasnt that into it. then a couple of months passed, and i started to slowly get more and more into it. your experience in this game really starts to become more enjoyable the more and more you play. because for someone who only played for like an hour a week at the start, given my old meh review, i now put plenty of hours into this. at this point, it has become my most played game on steam and im not afraid to admit it.",4
"so, this game is nice. good graphics, good gameplay, decent balancing(?) i personally would recommend it to anyone who has extra time. this game requires you to replay or farm levels for certain resources. for instance, at some point, your weapons are too old to use them against newer, stronger enemies, so you set out to craft new ones. however, the amount of time, and work you must put into getting weapons that will carry you farther into the game is overwhelming. not only weapons, but warframes also require too much to craft. tkes me a day to get materials, or more, and 3 days to craft the actual warframe. now, you may choose to use stock weapons bought with credits, the games main currency, but the game insists you either buy platinum to get new weapons and warframes and whatnot, or craft them yourself, which takes a bit of time to do. though, judging from the majority of people on steam, i doubt time will be a problem. so, go ahead and play this game, if you want. its free anyway, what is there to lose?",1
"amazing game with great graphics, if you like hack n slash you will love this. has a shooter side aswell. kept me busy for hours and still going! 9/10 for f2p",1
"dont have time to write a review, too busy playing.",5
"super awesome game. i love it. use to play it regularly. ill play it once again once i finish my pc build (x99+295 or titan) so i can play this game at max setting. i built my own base and slowly building up new weapons. the cons for me is upgrading your warframe is where im stuck on and its the reason i stop playing lol. i think its level 7 where you have to run on walls and jump on platform as fast as you can and i cry cause i cant do it grrr. but all in all this game is fun and i cant wait to play this on ps4 as well.",1
"of course, its a great game, but it does not change one thing, that is the game is still in beta mode and you are just a tester. is a nice game, requires a little modification though, sometimes it stucks.",1
"loved slashing and dicing through the mobs and duel shooting my way to the goal. not only is the combat system epic but wallriding is also the greatest in-game.",1
"this game may get old after awhile, but i always find myself coming back after breaks. the content, customization, and general playstyle and theme are all awesome. they update it pretty regularly with cool new additions, almost never the same old recycled .",2
"free to play done right in my book... nothing has to be bought, everything can be earned though some take forever to make so its just a matter of how bad do you want it :) weapons gain levels and you can add special cards to them to add abilities like +20% damage or + reload speed %. game features wall walking and climbing. sliding melee or just straight melee your choice, not big on melee thats fine use machine guns, snipers, bow, pistols, knives, shotguns, and more!",2
"i recommend this game, because its fun tp play either in solo or online with your friends. the game focuses on combat , teamwork and has the foundry where you can build new things for your tenno. but, you have to get the blueprints first and then what you need for it, from a specific planet or enemy type. the game allows you to costumize a ton of things, like your colouring for your tenno, guns and even make these things better, by adding mods to them. of course the game just gets better by having a sword as your melee weapon with which you can do different combos, from the air or sliding under the enemys gunfire and slicing them into pieces. you start off with basic weapons, but you can change them as you get more credits, to buy faster, stronger and better shotguns, sniper rifles and such things as a dual ninja sword. in-game you can play up to 4 players, and if you with different amount of players, then you get different spaceships to run around on. as you level up, you get more mod capacity on your weapons and tenno. the capacity/rank can be increased by playing with it. when i say mods, i mean that you can get different upgrades that gives piercing shot on enemy armor, more shield capacity etc. and you can access them in your own arsenal, yeah your inventory is called arsenal, and then you can put them on and have fun slaughtering the enemy aliens. the game is beta, but its a hundred percent free-to-play.",3
"a fun game for anyone that is tired of normal shooting games",1
"all i like to say is this game is one of the most ba games ever this is so cool the stealth the ninjas even friends :d",1
"although i have only played the game for a small amount of time, i love it. although it is an online game, i really wish they would fix the glitch when you are trying to level your character, and the internet skips for any amount of time, it will disconnect you and make you wait 24 hours before trying again. other than that, i have absolutely no complaints and this is a very well polished game.",1
"lots to do this should keep even the busiest gamer...well busy for ages!",1
"if you like games were you can jump around like a ninja of shot them up while playing, with your friends then this is the game foe you i got recommended this game and i played it now i am recommending it to you to play and enjoy",1
"interested in parkouring to a spot to farm and run all the way back to starting point to wait for others? have fun collecting numerous components across the whole universe (to craft a weapon you dislike and equip it for years to upgrade)? space farm simulator... i mean warfarme, is your best first-person meadow keeper game option!",3
"this is one of the coolest games i played so far. i highly recomended it to you. although its updates are long n buggy it will be worth the wait once your in the game:)",5
"this game is good looking, fun with friends, but very repetitive... but you can customise your character to the core with dozens of different things to change, upgrade, or mod. new functionalities are fun, special mention to the archwing, totally changing the gameplay in a fun and arcady way. play it with friend, or you wont enjoy it fully.",1
"if you know names in this games that means you are nooo....t noob, btw my ign: nighthide if you need help in the game you can contact me...in warframe of course. i persuaded my friends who only liked fps to play this. if you know how to play this game i gurantee youll love it, if you dont i am sorry to say that you are gaaaaaaanot an interesting person(or a diiiiiicluless person)",8
"dont let the free to play fool you, this game is better than 90% of pay to play games. graphics are insanely fantastic and gameplay is smooth. you will get addicted.",1
"this game has changed the way i look at third person shooters. i love the constant additions and improvements as well as quests given by the generous amount of updates and i hope to see this game get even bigger in the future.",1
"this game is essentially ninja gaiden mixed with mass effect without the storyline from either. fun to get with your friends and chew through a bunch of grinding quests, but other than that its pretty limited. looks pretty too, which is nice.",1
"i think this game is a step into the future. this is a gateway game. if you are new to the steam community,i really think you should play this. a futuristic ninja game......its briliant! there should be more games just as great as this one. my first 10 minutes of this game was the greatest 10 minutes ive ever had. if you love fast paced ninja stealth games,you will love this.",1
"this game is fun. i like free and i like good graphics. 10/10. would play again.",1
"this is a good game if you want some ninja skills and abilities mixed with a splinter cell type game!",1
"so far i had a great time with warframe. i did two missions. i cant wait to put more hours in and see what mission i get next. this game is wild and seriously sci-fi. i had a great time. repetetive but super fun! i am having such a good time with the beautiful graphics. i hear you can craft anything later so money does not need to be spent. i picked a bo staff in the beginning and i wish i picked a machine gun but oh well it was fun anyway! it payed very well on my mac dual boot with windows 8.2. beautiful graphic and smooth grinding and lots of cool effect like i can run across walls. so far i can see myself playing for hours on end. cant wait to play again tomorrow!",1
"absolutely amazing game - suffers from somewhat lack end-game content that can reduce the game to a grindfest, but can easily get you 80+ hours of gameplay without feeling repetetive.",7
"one of the the best f2p games and my favourite so far",3
"free multiplayer, still in development so a lot of things get changed and you get to be part of the process. in the beginning opportunities where kinda limited but the game has gotten a lot of great features. missions are medium long so you can very flexibly decide how long you want to play. i recommend an alarm-app for the mission-alarms that give you extra items or credits. you may help yourself to more warframes or weapons with a little platinum, which is the currency you exchange for many, however, you dont need to! but i and my friends all invested some money into the game. i think thats still fair because i would have payed the same amount in store for a game i would play that much.",4
"too bad you cant link your ps4 account to pc. i had a lot of stuff on there",1
"game is amazing nothing i dislike about it. 5 stars.",4
"very fun, its a bit of a grind but killing hordes of enemys with cool guns and powers make up for it imo",7
"this game is very big and requires dozens of hours to complete,even tough the quests are repetitive ,the combat and movement style of these game will make you think on many solutions to best your enemies and graphical content are superb.",1
"it is a pretty awesome game. must say, it blew my mind. but the only bad part is that you need a very smooth computer to play it. lag is dangerous for a game like that.",1
"although ive never played warframe on pc i played hundreds of hours on the ps4 (i hope theres no real differnce) and i must say for a free game warframe is amazing you will spend countless hours even alone on this game something this game did very well was how many things you can do you can work on making a warframe, weapon, something for the clan, etc. all in all this is my first review so its  and short but at least i tried",1
"so, youre a space ninja armed with a gun/bow/grenade launcher/weird alien tech weapon and a sword/hammer/fists/mace and wielding crazy powers to destroy/stun/confuse/decimate your enemies? why have i never heard of this game before??? seriously, this game is phenomenal, the graphics are amazing, the weapons are fun, the powers are cool, the devs are constantly fixing and improving the experience, i cannot find a fault with this free game! i dont have a lot of time to play games, but warframe doesnt require that much dedication to enjoy it at all. the action is fast-paced, the plot is light, the requirements are minimal, the game is ever-evolving giving you new things to do, the tech options (in the form of mod cards) are immense. i highly recommend everyone to try it! what have you got to lose? its free!!!",2
"awesome fastpaced 3rd person shooter also ............ninja play free.",2
"i think this game is awesome. just play it and understand the mechanics. nuff said.",1
"this has gotta be one of the best games ive played yet. this game is like space alien ninja robots doing extreme parkour and deafeating an aliance of hostile individuals.",1
"so ive been playing this game for more than 400 hours( i know steam just say i played 150) since the start(about 2 years ago). its amazing how much it has improved. even if the game would be pay to play it will still worthy, because the developters do a great job in every update. we dont know what are they planing for the future, but so far they had made the right choices and they are delivering us an incredible great game. i would totally recommend this game, and i will add: try it and follow the news of it because in maybe in the next update the game became all you ever wished.",3
"listen to malo mart from zelda and play any mission in the game while playing, and you will understand why i recommend it.",4
"the game encourages you to use multiple different types of weapons and warframes. while the game does support solo-play, that is not where its true potienal lies. a solid 4-stack makes this game fun and less stressful at times. (and with some well-humored friends, its hiralious.) im not going to say there is a wide range of diversity but there is a way to make your warframes and your weapons unique to you. plenty of ways to progress in the game and beginner-friendly. i recommend this game entirely to anyone who want to play with friends in a new type of cooperative play.",2
"this game is good however i seem to run across this issue where i need to update but my version is already up to date which fores me to reinstall the entire game",1
"i just loved this game very much it is really fun, i like it, the graphics are spectacular too!",1
"what can i say? ive had lots of fun with it, the grind doesnt really get to me cause i can keep going with it and it doesnt matter, but in the end its actually funner with friends. there are a lot of things that need to be fixed though that are pretty annoying but other then that its a good game.",3
"at first,,, this game felt kinda repetitive and boring. after some time went by i gave it a second chance. this game picks up.. i must say..... just be ready to murder 1,000,000,000,000 fat space people really really realy fast. btw, truely is ftp",1
"boy am i glad hes frozen in there and that were out here. -vor looking at every warframe cryopod",4
"fun game but it has a lot of new addons since 2013 so if gave up on it then try it again",1

"pretty good was expecting a fps shooter with perks and killcam",1
"level up., collect material...build weapons...upgrade weapon...and many more to do. you get to experience a fast pace third person shooter game with extraordinary gameplay with friends or public. never regret playing and neither should you.",1
"i just started playing this game, and i am one impressed gamer. i cant believe its free. i cant believe all the reviews are positive reviews, and i cant believe how awesome it is. i cant believe ive never heard of this before. holy . try this game.",4
"pay-to-win/play couldnt be any worse than what it is, play it if you have money to burn.",1
"this game is reaonable for mucking about and having a good time for a good few hours but its only a really good game if your very much into this sort of game",1
"you will need the powerful platinum to buy those powerful prime stuff that you need to your prime account in the prime world with  trads or the traders that are so good you wonder why you even try. 7/11",3

"truely an awesome online game... recomend it for all gamers out there!",4
"first third person shooter game i enjoy the camera is always where you want it the weapon system is awesome and the balance for buying stuf and not buying them with money but credits is awewsome 9/10 i love it",1
"this game is great. i love it, but it is lagging a looot on my laptop, but i wont delete it hah. :d",1
"two hours in and im enjoying myself greatly. cant wait to get further in and start playing around with new warframes and, you know, like everything else.",1
"i cant play this game because i am not a qualified ninja. wish i could though.",1
"so much of my life has been absorbed by this game. weve started our own clan, fought the fight and ran the grind. this game starts off a little slow while you get your bearings, but once you have it boy does it start gaining momentum. gameplay is pretty mental if you jump into a match with the right squad, wave after wave of enemies and warframe powers going off left right and center! it is a little buggy now and then, but worth they play. all in game items can be obtained with effort, minus some personalization items which make no difference. and youre always on the edge of your seat with each update waiting on new things!! 10/10 would play and recommend!",8
"love this game! however, be warned, story has much to be desired and do not play too much as gets dull.",1
"ive been playing this game since about update 8. it is by far the funnest game i have ever played. there is always something new to search for and there is always new stuff being added. it has quite a few bugs but they just make the game more interesting. and the best part is that while there is the freedom of playing with whatever setup you want. it is a very balanced and enjoyable game.",3
"amazing game! the support is oustanding, with new updates and fixes each month, this is my new favorite game.",2
"great game fast paced incredable fights an all round great game",1
"rating: 8/10 overall a fun game, but for new players it can be difficult to get into. for the first couple hours of the game, you will be using the same boring weapons until you buy/craft a new weapon using blueprints. you can run on walls, fly kick, slide, and perform devastating melee combos. fun game to play coop with friends!",1
"needs dedicated servers. a lot of lag when you join a game making it almost unplayable. get repetitive after about 25 hours in. good game though.",1
"so much fun. i start play this game when it was beta then some  happen and i stop play it. but please play this game ninjas everywhere....alien ninjas.",1
"awesome game... im playing it since it came out and still loving it!!!",2
"<3 is all i have to say. ive seen this game come from barely playable to great space-ninja action rpg. high five de! now gove us a reason to keep playing! (*arch-wing etc etc)",2
"this game are talking about 1 tenno that try to escape the guards and the tenno need to kill them and escape (just when you start) he need to kill captain vor and more boss you can play multiplayer wit your friends even if they dont dowload from steam i think this game its realy good and interesting and you need to dowload him (:",1

"yes yes yes :d it is one of the greatest games i have ever playd",4
"fun game to play, does get a little dull and repettitive the more you play and the more you get.",5
"ill be short for now...but this game could use a video tutorial for mods, weapons and stuff...but i guess thats the point: having the players confused to make them pay for items they dont need.",1
"-gets you hooked fast -parkour moves -various builds -regular new content updates. -can get a bit repetitive -best played with friends i played during closed beta, back then when it only had like 2 or 3 map layouts with 9 planets to play on and 10 available weapons it was already pretty good but then it got repetitive but with the regular new content and constant improvements being made i cant help but keep coming back. the game just keeps on expanding and its all for free! story is weak though but who cares? youre a space ninja!",1
"i found this game to be really good and alot of fun! it is a bit confusing as to what is going on till you get used to it. i have only playied for a few hours, so i am not sure at the moment how the f2p acctully is. i reccommend this game its looks very good and the combat is fantatic.",1
"warframe is an optimized game to run on low or high end rigs. its draw back is the large mircro transaction system where you can not play the full game unless you pay large amounts of money. this is a pay to play, pay to win game.",1
"very fun game despite the grind. can get monotonous, but its still great for some relaxed, mindless face rolling.",1
"fun with friends. a little boring soloing but still fun. community is helpful and talkative. everything is farmable even the cash items (most of them) clan feature isnt so bad but very costy... levelling is halve bad and nothing is tooooo overpowered overall a good game to try out with friends :d",2
"im only a few missions in, but i can see myself sinking a lot of hours into this. good music, tight controls, endless customizations? yes please.",1
"i used to love warframe very much. but then, when ive unlocked sedna and phobos, enemies are tougher to kill, enemies can airborne while warframe cant (not archwing) and enemies weapons can damaged your shield very fast. mine was from 900+ shield to 200- within 10 seconds on rhino equipped with steel fiber ranked 8. i did cashed out from money to purchase some items. i realized that its all a waste! theyre uselss! only for f***ing decorations to make looks cool and awesome not the weapons! dont cash out some money for platinums! its a waste for money! i couldve buy other games like far cry 4 or sniper ghost warrior 2!",2
"fun game bit of a learning curve for the more comp[licated things, like how you can trade for the premium",2
"a very addictive game + best looking graphics for f2p",1
"this game is like mass effect, have good visualization, less story and sometimes i get bored with this game, but this game is challenging and i like it.",1
"whats that, you dont have this game? oh no it isnt a probelm... :( 10/10 gobsmacking now wheres the removal of friendship button...",1
"it was the first multiplayer game ive ever played and now nothing else compares. i love it!",5
"ive already sunk so many hours into this game, and they seem to have a steady stream of updates. the graphics looks very well done, and as for the games currency system (since it is a free to play) it is pretty simple to get a lot of platinum without actually spending money via the in-game trading system.",4
"great game. can be a bit of a grind but if you have friends playing with you the time will fly by :d",8
"it may be a little difficult to get used to, but after you play for a while, it absorbs your time and energy. ive spent entire days playing this game, my word, its addictive. its a good game due to several factors: good graphics, it has a great storyline that makes it interesting to play along with, you have several options for primary, secondary, and melee weapons, you can customize your ship/character/pet, and you have an entire universe to select your missions from. of course theres other factors, but those are the things i noticed firsthand. overall, its a little complex to get used to, but if you are willing to dedicate your time and get to know it better, youll find yourself playing it pretty frequently. hope that helps :)",3
"this game offers non stop inprovements and i love it but beware it needs a little comitment to fully enjoy",7
"i like this game i have a windows 8 and the only lag is when trying to aim if they can improve that then the game is perfect",1
"so far this game is basically a fast paced ninja simulator :3 it has a large amount of replay value so it is almost impossible to be the very best. like no one ever was",1
"grinded for 2 days to make a gun to grind for 3 days to make a suit to grind for 2 more days to make a sword and another gun. 10/10 best material collection simulator ever created.",2
"a good game that was made bad by endless grinding...",1
"after coming back in later updates, ill admit i have grown to enjoy the game a bit more. while certain problems still remain like the baffling unbalanced abilities of the warframes, mostly it feels like a product of constantly adding things and trying to give players a star to shoot for. while i feel it has major room for improvement, it is much more enjoyable in its current state.",2
"i tried for over 3+ hours to play this game, everytime i tried to launch it, it said direct x failed to update. which is amusing because the system im trying to run it on already has directx 11 on it, how do you need to update something that is already at the top of the list. and once the directx failed to update the launcher went full on  and wouldnt let me go any further.",1
"im mixed, leaning more towards positive. the game is fun, although it is sort of pay to win. pros -it looks nice -gameplay is fun and rewarding -fast paced cons -pay to win -waiting times -a bit too easy for my liking",1
"the conclusion of this game is your a biotic ninja that does lots of really cool stuff.",1
"really enjoyable game. takes a while to farm stuff and level up, but it is very fun.",1
"space ninja! warframe, a scifi action game, ecompasses everything there is to a scifi game. the developers are great and take the players opinions into account and the game itself is ever developing. you are a tenno (space ninja), and you do various missions, making the game fun for playing by yourself and with others.",2

"a good game where you can just build your own weapons/warframes instead of having to buy through real money and even get these rare weapons aka prime stuffs. real good that you cant truly get bored because there is always new things that you find and wanna build.",2
"been playing this game for a few weeks now and i like it i would reccomend to anyone for a free game :d plenty to do on it.",1
"get this game i mean why not? its free after all...",3
"i loved it... i have to say this is one of the best free games on steam to date... its graphics are amazing, gameplay is fun, customization and upgrades are hard to achieve, but thats what makes the game a whole lot more fun!",4

"i recommend you to try this game, its very fun. ^_^",1
"im a space ninja! just like what ive always dreamed of",1
"i absolutely hate freemium rpgs because they flash you with everything you could become from the very beginning and entice you to pay as a shortcut. in my playtime the game was cute. the controls were a little weird, but the storyline was cool. in general not a bad game",1
"i ran up a wall, glitched out of bounds and failed the mission 10/10",1
"with all the recent updates i cant stop playing d:",1
"sometimes you just have to go in without looking at the situation and realize gee this is one big mess but on the other hand you have to say to yourself i can fix this and thats what you",1
"absolutely awesome game, im gonna be playing this a lot! any1 wanna play together gimme a shout :)",1
"great game, it isnt pay2win but more like pay2grindless. even if you dont like grinding, id still recommend you try it, because its just that fun.",10
"fun f2p game... if you got nothing to do and your tired of all games in your library.",1
"might as well get a meat grinder for all the grinding and jacking off youre going to do",3
"stared playing got addicted spent 80 dollars an it 300 hours later got bored and morned the denied that i spent 80 dallars on this game",1
"10/10 best f2p game ive played yet. the devs are chill and hilarious!",5
"its literally the same map over and over again with the same damn",1
"used my 5$ for plat and its not showing im not gonna spend money on something if it doeasnt sjow",1
"id like to support this game, but really, its built to suck your wallet dry and its horribly expensive. the platinum conversion ratio is 75p for $5. almost any weapon is atleast 145p, which means it costs you $10 to buy one damn weapon. most of the good weapons are 230+p which is going to cost you $20 with some platinum left over. you might think, well, thats not really terribly horrible, right? except, the way the damage system is built, you will totally suck against one or the other factions without buying weapons that are effective against them. and dont give me the crap about being able to craft the weapons, because crafting resources are scattered and ive yet to unlock the systems in which to find any specific crafting materials needed. but you can buy them, for real money. and whatever warframe you pick at the beginning, thats the only one youll ever have until youve unlocked enough places to gather the crafting materials, or you drop the real world cash one, which by the way is 20+ just to play another class.",1
"i almost got fired with how much i love this game.",4
"great and fun game, only game i would actually use money on which is freemium. recent updates made it a little buggy though.",3
"space ninjas. nuff said. along with the hi-tech faction, low-tech faction and some other faction, you can also fight space zombies. i just stopped to play this game because of all the grinding. yet it is one of the most fair games out there!",1
"do you like being a super weapon? if so youll like this game, if not move on. every weapon and warframe in this game can be earned in game (excluding the collecters edition rewards). they all take time to get and build but none the less you can get them without cash. on the other hand if you dont want to spend the time to get them you can buy them. you can also trade items in game with other players for the in game cash currency (which is a market all into its self completely player controlled). the game play is fun and for the most part co-op. four warframe teams going up against entire armies, all with different powers. what little pvp there is, is focused on clans (guilds) and control of highly profitable co-op mission areas. the clan that controls one of those missions collects a reasoure tax that they set. in can be as little as nothing or as high as 100%. the longest a clan can hold a mission is 24hr after which any other clan may challange them for it. anyone can help attack or defend a clan controlled mission (unless theyre with the attacking/defending clan then they must attack/defend), which offen leads to clans keeping the tax rates fairly low to encourge outside help. when you first start playing do not spend the free cash currency you get right away. read the forums theyll give you an idea on where to spend the free money to get the most bang for your buck. good luck tenno, your in for a fun ride :)",7
"slice a buch of aliens to pieces. parkoured over the place. shot a buch of robots. and made it back home for supper",1
"i first found out about this game from my best friend about a year or so ago, we played it for about 10 hours then got kinda bored due to the fact that we had more fun together in person. after my friend had passed away i re downloaded the game and decided to re check it out, and remembering the fun that we had on it made it really easy to pick back up, once you start getting deep into the game though you become addicted because of how great the game really is. probably one of the best free games i have ever played.",1
"really fun game, yes, it is definitely a lot of grinding for items, but i truly enjoy playing the game, and time flies when i do, i honestly dont know how i got so many hours on the game.",2
"basically, you grind for cool weapons and warframes. repetitive but youll find yourself doing it anyway. graphics arent bad, not pay2win(yay), no hackers.. i believe, aand its fun to play with friends! imo, they should change the place in menu where your character is like stuck and has a small room. there should also be free test of weapons so that yennow, you didnt grind for something then youll find out that weapon is not for you. 8/10.",1
"they may want your money, but how else are the cyber ninjas with sweet power suits going to make a living?",1

"people are saying that this is grinding and it is but i dont want to hear anymore pay 2 win crap from people u can get platinum (real money currency) by trading if u get a prime part that u dont need or u have 2 of them there is a trade chat where u use platinum as a currency so basically u can get unlimited ammount of platinum by trading prime parts wich are 100% drops from key maps and u get the keys from different modes. if u play like 1 hour u will get like 7 keys (i did) and u will get from completing the key maps 5 prime parts u can sell the prime parts for 20p for each (depends on the value of the part). so there u go its not a pay 2 win its free 2 play ewery aspect of it.",3

"wasted potential: the game. you might think that youre coming into a nice game about space ninjas, but what yore really going to get is a run-and-gun shooter with -grinding to unlock other forms of grinding to get weapons and warframes that require grinding to have something strong enough to survive the endgame grinding -a painful lack of endgame -an unbalanced set of characters that have any fun or redeeming qualities nerfed the moment theyre noticed -dull level design that both is empty enough so that players just rush through to the objective, but with just enough thrown in there to break the pacing -a loot pool so diluted that any chance of getting something useful is about as good as your computer being lined with gold on the inside -an inconsistent aestetic that will leave you wondering what the games trying to accomplish -and a set of moderators that will not-so-subtly shut down any negative feedback on their forums. i want to like this game. i really do. the fact that ive put so much time into it shows how im willing to bet it on the next big update. but as it is, its like watching a good friend get sicker and sicker.",9
"cool game... stuck in 7 hours ..... i recommend this for those who want action. you! vs 100 enemies",5
"wow. this is the best game. i recommnend it to everyone! its amazing!!!!! its hard to sum such an amazing game up so quickly... you start off with a choice of 3 warframes, each specializing in different aspects (weapons, stealth and power) and move onto a choice of over 20 other frames ranging from tank-like classes to elemental, traps and flight just to name a few. there are many bosses, with their difficulty increasing as you get better, that become available after playing through many different maps all over the solar systems. the 4 factions that you fight never get old and are always a challenge for new players to the more experienced. you can do the missions however you like, whether it be like a 1 man army or playing co-op with your mates to create even more carnage. there are so many environments and the updates keep them coming, along with even more frames at your disposal. there are often events where the whole community works together or you can fight them in pvp matches. its a great free to play and you are not forced to purchase anything, however the weekly discounts make purchasing the ingame currency (platinum) an affordable option. this is by far my favourtite game ever and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a great game that you will surely enjoy and make some friends. now go out and kill some infestation tenno!",4
"addictive multiplayer experience, would recommend this to anyone.",1

"didnt play much of this game but it is really interesting.",4
"this is the most expensive free game ive ver played. that being said, i loved it. if you dont have the cash to buy the upgrades here and there as needed, be prepared for a grind fest. but honestly, who can complain when its a free game? the game was highly addicting to me for the first few months, but the repetitiveness and lack of a really clear story eventually made the game seem really lackluster to me. however, as far as ftp games go, this one is a gem. 7.5/10",1

"sooooooooooooo many of the kools were put into this game",1
"i like this game but frist you need too much money/time to play use time = long play use money = fast play (you will feel bore so fast) and if have new prime warframe you can use the money to buy but not are good number (p.s dont ! dont ! dont look this! plz just dont)",6
"absolute carnage this is a must for any rpg/firstperson/action gamer, this game keeps me awake hours on end. only downside is that you kinda get thrown into the deep side when it comes to what you need to focus on first and what you actually need to do, but theres nothing a quick google/wikia cant solve.. 9/10",1
"acceptable pre-destiny instanced missions and pvp with a fairly open class / ability structure and par-core(?), but with some annoying les. can be played without cost but the better items are via premium currency. if all you do is pve, that might work for you. clan structures give access to blueprint research, unless you are really patient this will mean contributing currency into the game. while the game as a whole is ok, there are 2 things that come close to killing it for me: archwing was a recent update (circa mid-2014) but in my opinion is clumsy and almost unplayable. ability to deploy resource collectors (8 hour cycle random crafting material generator) requires all missions on a planet to be completed (not just unlocked) so archwing mission are compulsory in this respect. play them once, never again. down side is that the developer ~really~ wants you to like (or at least play it a lot) archwing, to justify its creation, so some events revolve around it. menu system the minority report style / zoom-on-mouse-over menus causes the screen to shift / scew and auto zoom while moving the mouse around the menu system. very distracting, clumsy and akward, ultimately leaving sections of the screen obscured. the multi-layering of some menus (like the market) have to be fully navigated to get out of them, sometimes up to 4 screens deep, rather then being about to x-out back to your character.",2
"pretty nice game, especially for some quick shooting action. amazing that they release lots of new upgrades, and new contents, but i just cant keep up with it, so i stop playing it... lol though the server lag and sync can be frustrating at times.",1
"psychic ninja wizards in space, with genetically degenerating dogs and hal 9000 as your ship",5
"i find myself coming back to this time and again, i really like it, even when i play single. they countinually add uppdates, quests, warframes and weapons. the thing is, i usually argue like the negatives, but there is always a but at the end.. its free, try it. but; it is more fun if you have friends to playwith, but sometimes you can find yourself pared up with three awesome dudes (or gals) and mabe make a few new friends. be prepared to grind; if you dont want to pay, then it is a bit grindy, yes....but that has been fun for me, and i use it as the reason to play, to be able to get, and level up the new weapon/s. prepare for repetition; you do the same things, a lot, but the random quests, events and invasions stirr it up a bit now and then. i could continue....but if you read this long, then you will probably read the other rewiews to :p tenno unite!",8
"warframe is by far the best free-to-play shooter ive seen, theres no pay to win as there is no real player versus player (besides the deuling mode in the clan bases, edit: and conclave, but nobody plays that anyway heuehuhehehhhe.) and while grinding for credits and parts to build stuff can get a little tedious, all the levels are procedurally generated so they always keep you on edge as what to expect. grab 3 friends to play this game with you, and give it a try on whatever platform you feel.(*cough*pcmasterrace*cough*)",1
"a good non-pay-to-win game that you can get all common in-game item without spending a single dollar. join the space ninja(farmer) to grind your very own equipment blueprint/parts!",3
"be a robot ninja in space. team up with three other robot ninjas to slice, dice, and shoot your way through thousands of enemies in varying mission types. level dozens of weapons and customize them with mod cards with over 9000 possible combinations. this game is absolutely worth playing. give it a try; well see you on the battlefield, tenno.",1
"warframe has nice graphics, a neat concept of booster cards, and a couple of really awesome weapons with a nice feel. unfortunately, the game is ruined completely by the utterly broken scaling that reduces it to tedious min-maxing, with the gameplay itself not offering much more than ability to slaughter hordes of boring enemies, and endless grind.",1
"10/10 would tear the limbs off of corpus crewman again. honestly though as long as you dont mind a little grinding (okay, a lot of grinding) and have a life or two to waste its an amazing game. past 300 hours with no sign of slowing down.",5

"awsome to the max, sometimes a bit laggy, but dont mind that.",1
"good gameplay and visuals but weak story and quests, fun with friends.",1
"this game is a amazing fast moving paest game ninja space game this is and it rocks. i play it all the time and its just plain fun to make new friends, play with friends also always geting new stuff to deystroy or kill. plus amazing qusts so i really think if you like fast moving and action then this game has youer name all over it!!!",4
"the only game i have ever played whose netcode managed to go from bad to nonexistant in the eight-month break i took. 10/10 would be kicked from my own party again.",4
"dat game doe. thats all i have to say about this game. if you have a slow computer and are in a more console like world, then this game is a free-to-play on ps4 and i strongly recommend that.",1
"i was looking far and wide for a f2p coop shooter, until i stumbled upon this game. gameplay wise its really cool, especially if you have friends to play with you. there are some microtransactions in the game, but the buisness model is fair for the most part. i dont usually spend real money on a f2p titles but this time i made an exception and i say it was well worth it. long story short, if you are looking for a free coop based shooter, give this game a try :)",2
"this is just awesome! (and free) get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"really epic game with awesome graphics and good combat system! for a free game this is way too good to be true. i have been playing this for awhile and i have noticed that even thought this is free2play its not pay2win, almost anything in the game can be bought with the in-game money. everyone who are interested in space, ninjas and epic fights must give opportunity for this game!",3
"i tried running on a wall, i got launched into the cornor of the ceiling and got stuck there for 15 minuetes. 10/10",1
"this is not a game to be played alone. that being said its a lot of grinding and frame building. archwing is amazing and a whole other set of challenges on the game since it is so different from the rest of it. this is a game that will take time and passion to get into. it is well worth it. the trade systems in the game are pretty good but depend on other people who play the game. it can cost a lot of money to play unless you have the willpower to resist lol. though you dont need to spend money on it till later on. i recommend using the platnum that you get when you first start on slots for frames and weapons. it will save you a lot of time and trouble once you start lvling up and getting new gear. i recommend also choosing a syndacte that will do you the most good after you learn your play style and the most common frames you use. they also take a lot of time to build reputation with but the rewards they give you are astonishing and can often be traded for good platinum if you do that i recommend keeping one and saving up to get another to trade. msg me if you have further questions this is the most frequent game i play..and im deffinitly not ending anytime soon.",5
"a decent 3rd person shooter with numerous ways to adjust your char to your own playstyle, though it a bit bland at times the action is decent fun and really gives you the vibe of being a ninja with high powered fire arms.",2
"+ visuals + gameplay + really complex, but not difficult to understand. + its fun. + free to play. - client sometimes crashes unexpectedly. all in all, a great game.",1
"this game is pretty amazing because it visually is awesome gameplay really cool it reminds me of all different games mixed into one",1

"i cut a robot in half, decapitated that half and cut his arms off. 10/10",1
"warframe, omg dont even get me started! in my honest opinion this game is just un real. you have such a diversity in choice its incredible its and amazing fps/rpg!",1
"for a free-to-play game it is pretty awesome. badass ninja aliens kicking other alien ? definetly a must have considering it is free!",4
"i didnt like this game much back then when i frist got it, and well ever sease my freind started playing it (too much) i fianly came on to see why it was so worth playing so much and well now i love this game its geart i love the warframes and my nekros as you can tell by my image :3. and the prime stuff is soooo goood. also space ships soon!",3
"you play as a weeaboo space ninja with magic powered by nanobots. so i enterd the game, and was immediately struck by the fact that, even in the grim, dark future, they still use bows. anyways, this legend of zeldo navi  says, kill em all. and thats all the mission parameters are. murder ing everyone. so im scootin along, when out of the corner of my eye, i see four lancers (riflemen). so, taking position on my storage crate, i cast invisibility, and take aim. the lancers (all reasonably higher levelled) had unwittingly lined up their thick skulls right into my blinking crosshairs, and i let loose a fully charged, over-modded arrow, which sailed through the skulls of the lancers. however, these were no regular skulls... these were of the armored type. the arrow, still flying, had impaled itself in the corpses, who were flying with my arrow. suddenly, a door on the far end of the room closed, stopping the arrow. by now, the ragdolling lancers had their limbs removed via sheer force, so i notched another arrow, with at least eighty more baddies to impale. i walked forward, unaware of the surprise i was to see. so this enemy trooper opened the door, and the arrow that i had fired earlier continued moving at its original pace, killing the trooper and the sniper behind him. i finished the mission, went to my magical space ship, and played with a puppy-bat hybrid in the game. 10/10 would shoot arrows again.",2
"space ninjas. need i say more? true f2p unless youre impatient. good coop shooter.",1
"a bit grindy, but to be expected from free to play. never felt it needed to spend money to have fun, but have done so just to support the company for doing free to play right! brilliantly good fun co-op space ninjas with frequent updates. what more would a boy ask for?",1
"awesome game for something that is free. after a while of playing i did not mind purchasing platnium, something i never do liked free feel of the environment, maps and futuristic/ sci fi concept easy to join other players on missions daily missions weapons easy to play great for a casual fps disliked lack of weapon slots and weapons you can use as you have to upgrade mods and the weapons. maybe would of been one of the best games if the game was sold for $60 and you had access to everything",2
"warframe is a fantastic game if you like ninjas and space. you are able to sneak around albeit difficult and shoot and slash your way through corpus (robot-looking guys) and grineer (ugly looking mugs). you get a dojo if you join a clan (guild in other terms) and decorate and play with your friends and allies. you also get a most of the time funny companion on your ship. warning you may need a good pc, i can play with it on my laptop i just recieve a little bit of lag during the missions on snowy planets. otherwise its fantastic even for a free-to-play game.",1
"space robot ninjas fighting dirty racist illuminati trade federation mercenaries clones with zombies using swords and guns and bows and stuff. highly recommended",10
"ever wanted to be a ninja? ever wanted to fight stuff in space? ever wanted to do both at the same time? if so then warframe is the perfect game fore you. a massive variety of weapons, gamemodes, areas, enemys and charecters means that youll still be playing warframe years form when you starte. combine that with weekly updates and youve got the game that just keeps getting better. hope to see you in the starchart tenno.",1
"this game not really need money for play, all item in the shop can be obtain by collect resource and blue print cash in this game just for instant get item because some material very hard to find. gameplay not hard to understand all warframe had plus and minus this game have many world and in 1 world have nearly 20 different quest well but the minus this game so hard to find companion at some quest better if you want play this game ask your friend to play together because if you play with stranger at some quest it can take more than 20 minute and you got no one companion or jerk companion who left the game after the game start maybe you can play solo but some quest hard to play solo and need companion to help you but overall this game good",1
"mecha-hitler vs the space zog: transhuminism edition - the game. also, excalibur and vauban are literally generic guardsman a and b. other than that, good game. economy is  though.",1
"pros.warframe is a very very good game it`s better than most $59.99 games it`s not pay to win like a most free to play games you can get every warframe/character though in game resources and you can get most costimization items without paying a thing, i`ve played 300hours without spending a pennie and had fun doing so.and while graphics aren`t every thing warframe has very good graphics for a free to play game. new content is constantly being made adding new modes,mods,warframes,weapons,game elements such as sindicits,quest,companions,and etc.also warframes or characters aren`t more powerful than others just different. cons. while i do so dearly love warframe its not a perfect game there are bugs that accor every now then mostly after major updates, sometime forgring times can be a bit agervating,pvp can sometimes seem glued on, and there can be overly long grinds at points.but in the end i strongly recommend warframe to those who enjoy fastpace co-op pve third person shooters/sworders.",4
"honestly after playing this game for more than a few months, this is the best free to play game on steam. beats tf2 by a long shot. warframe is a game about space ninjas with no real questline to follow. you basically do what you want, when you want, where you want, with what you want. form a crew if you feel like it. want to have a giant hammer that crushes everything beneath your feet? go ahead! or do you want the more stealthy approach? take a bow and small sword. you play as a tenno: a superpowered race of humans with engineered suits that give them unique and amazing abilities. the community is extremely nice, and the developers have set a very good free to play model for their game. they are a company that cares. they put out events and update their game regularly, and nothing in this game is pay to win. everything can be obtained legit, minus extra modifications and skins. the grind can be long, but when you finally finish that gun or armor you want, it is the most rewarding feeling ever. 10/10 play this game.",2
"i love it but its lacking that single player excitement you need to have friends or the game is quite boring and hard.",1
"pretty good but it sucks for bad computers. bad computers + warframe = intense lag if you have a bad computer you probably shouldnt play this.",1
"really great game. it has large updates that are put out each month. it keeps getting better. very polished gameplay. one of the best free to play games ive played. i would highly recommend experiencing it with your friends as it was meant to be played cooperatively and its a far more fun than when played solo.",1
"one of the best free to play games. hop in for some quick missions or sink massive hours in this game it stays interesting with the continous updates!",4
"a good game definatly but the controls are a bit weird",1
"the recent updates to this game since when i played when nekros first game out, are turning out to be pretty dange neat!",2
"if you love farming simulator 2013, youre gonna love this.",7
"warframe equals mate. feed. kill. repeat. repeat. repeat. repeat. repeat. repeat. for fans of smash em buttons games. i recommend this game. fast paced actions over you.",9
"gameplay is very fun, especially when you get used to all the ninja moves! i like that the developers make it a point to keep updating and improving the game based on the player feedback in the forums.",4
"its a great game to kill time and also a great choice for achievement hunters like myself. lot of stuff to collect and do, level up, unlock and try out. surely the levels get repetitive really quick and that might bore you, but then again as mentioned before its great for killing time because you know what to expect (in most cases). can be played alone, with friends, or with a bunch of random players, which is a big plus!",1
"im lazy playing this game but its cool. exept fighting a level 4 guy when you are level 2. exept from the around 10 rounds we had i beat him only one.",1
"the best part about this game to me is that even though you can spend real money and get almost anything you want at the start, it really doesnt matter since skill still plays a huge part in what you can and cant do. also there is nothing that cant be gotten by farming, and there is even stuff that you can only get by farming that is not available in the market. the game can be a little repetitive, but what isnt entertaining about being a space ninja and running into a crowd of enemies and killing them all with throwing knives, or killing them with a blast of fire. play this game, you wont regret it.",2
"this game is awesome. the variety of characters and weapons is huge and each one its own perks and disadvantages. the only problem is that you have to wait if you are building a new weapon.",4
"im having some login issues where it keeps adding unessisay letters and my war frame freezes in the middle of game play but other then that the game is excellent",1
"do you want to be a space-ninja with your friends ? play it.",1
"this game is one of the best free to play, with stunning visuals and great co-op play. whilst the game itself is not pay to win as every item in the game is accessable for free, you would certainly benefit from investing in the game. weapons take up to 5 hours of collecting resources on top of another 12 hours to build, that is my only complaint.",1
"just look at how many hours i have .... yea its the best f2p game ive ever played",4
"this game has so much grinding your genitals will be smooth when youre done. but all in all this game is pretty tasty. like a twinkie covered in that one ice-cream that tastes so great you want an infinite supply of it. you know which one ;). but yeah this game is great.",1
"this is the game that i was searching for. its casual and doesnt require any aiming skills, its fun to play with your friends, and its free.",1
"pretty fun waste of time, its free to play so why not give it a go eh? same name in game so feel free to add me and be taxied.",8
"well if you like tps and ninjas this is very simmiliar (dont know if word is right not very good at english) its good on its own i think im gonna have fun playing it until gta 5 comes out its not same game cos gta 5 is an fps and tps so yea i recommend it.",1
"really good game, although it has a bit of a grindy end game.",4
"awesome game! im not a big fan of free to play games. but i have to commend the developer for creating a good balance where it is defenetly not a pay to win game! very addicting and simply fun with tried and true mechanics. the game is also suprisingly impressive when it comes to graphics, audio and once again gameplay (you will be suprised you never tried this game before!) i recommend to everyone to at least give it a try!",3
"ok... game sucks... thats all, glitches like falling through walls, the mods in chat are either drunk or they are bots, so saying anything with wts, wtt, or wtb in front in region chat will kick you. the game is unclear, it almost forces you to buy stuff, since everything takes alot of time to make, and it just sucks... dislike this as much as you want, i dont care... dont get this game...",3
"a great game that will consume all of your time. at first you realy have to work to get somewear but it is getting better and better. there are constant updates with new features so you have always something to do. fot tips you have to watch mogamu and otherwarframe youtubers. a great game.",3
"oh gosh, where do i start? wonderful. *wonderful graphics *play it, why do you need another positive review? play. now. and. get. consume.",1
"well destiny let us down it prob wont come out on pc but this will do :d 8 out of 8 m8 lots a fun",1
"think mass effect 3 multiplayer. neato stuff with monster hunter-tier grinding, but will get extremely repetitive quickly. recommend small bursts.",1
"i have had problems with games that are too repetitive in the past. this is one such game and while it was fun the first few hours it has become much too repetitive after a while. i dont like to grind for hours at end and thats the one reason i have stopped playing the game. otherwise this game deserves at least a 9/10.",1
"you know i really liked this game it is pretty amazing with its stunning graphics and the weopons are op 8.5 out of ten",1
"awesome game! thumbs up. store items do cost a little too much for me, but if you play well you can become very good without buying stuff from store.",5
"awesome game. everyone should play it, derserves more players.",3
"its like a devil may cry game with many various items and enemies in a online game.",1
"rather good game. seems to be meant for higher level missions to be done with other players; the downside is that unless you know a ton of people that play this game; you either play by yourself and hope not to die while waiting for someone (if anyone ever) to show up and help or sit before entering the mission waiting for someone (if anyone ever) to show up and start the mission with you. custumization is fun, but comes with a price weapons are exciting, and take time to earn; giving you a feeling of reward when you get what you have wanted or paid with cash for. ships ai is a bit nagging at times and your ally lotus seems to repeat herself to break silence way too much during missions. the warframes are amazing, the weapons are cool, the action can get pretty intense. like i said; rather good game 7 out of 10 not bad for a game that is free (cash gives you bonuses though)",2
"best game ive played other than thief. ive gotten addicted to the game but what evs",1
"warframe is love warframe is lyfe. one at a tyme it takes our lyves",1
"its an really fun game good if u are looking for an space game when u walk around and shoot things",1
"not a very good a game to play alone but i give it a 7/10",2
"awesome game and is very fun you have to download it its very addicting.",1
"what an amazing third-person shooter! warframe has got the guns and ninja weapons for badass action! you into bloody ongoing sluaghtering? well this is the game for you! ninjas play free",2
"i love this game so uch i have bean playing ot before steam so yeah great game",1
"quite fun especially with friends. love updates (events + new warframes/guns)... quite often, though i need to be more lucky in getting prime parts!",2
"great game, whether what you like is shotgunning things, sniping them from a distance, blowing them up, slicing them to bits, or committing genocide with awesome powers. become ridiculously op in the lower levels or run around in the higher levels where enemies one-hit you, either way youll probably find somewhere you can have fun.",5
"almo 700h of grind and farm alread, like clicka heroes but betta.",7
"i have played about 24 hrs.... and the only thing i like about the game is its lore and character depth... but after a certain point only this u are going to do is grind all the time... there is not any instresting stuff that want to make me play this game for a long time....",1
"this game is amazing exept it does not save to your steam i had ash with full out stealth build and then i got a new pc and all my stuff was not on it so i had to restart still an amazing game",1
"this game is reeally fun, but the downside is there is a lot of grinding to do, but i really enjoy playing this game. hope you do too! :)",4
"well, i play f2p games with a little disbelief. developers force you to buy in-game stuff to progress. you know a lot of games like this, right? but there exceptions and you probably know them too. and i didnt believed this game until i played it and had a lot of fun. i recommend you to play it. it has deep character customization, maps, gamemodes, weapons and even freakin` cyber ninjas in space. will that make you download this game? i hope so.",1
"there are some games that show that free to play still has something fun to offer. warframe is one of those titles co-op ninja beat em up or shoot em up. the downside is that the game kinda tries to push you to buy platinum (game money currency) by putting kinda of ridiculous real world hours to build something, besides that you can have all things in the game (besides cosmetic) without paying a cent.",2
"i would recommend this if you have the time and patience,but be warned this game is very buggy.",1
"i love working with other players in missions! great graphics and detail. i just dont enjoy all of the grinding and training involved. there isnt much of a point or plot to the game. but still fun!",1
"this game is awesome! ~pros~ -incredible graphics (when set to the highest settings) -fast paced action -events constantly further the story -archwingsssssssssss -great mix of shooting and sword-play -great leveling system -fun missions ~cons~ -can get a bit repetitive -is there any point to buy skins for your hull? its a loading screen -farming 8/10 it has flaws but is still a tonne of fun, dont hesitate to install this!",2
"should be called farming simulator instead due to all the farming you do. its a great game overall dont get me wrong, just alot of farming..",1
"spaceninjas dont even need to be endorsed by humans. beautiful graphics, great score, frequent updates, awesome devs, and soooo much more.",5
"free to play done right in my opinion. you can buy the in-game currency to help speed things up, but overall you dont need to ever really buy any if you are ok with working a little harder to get some specific things. plus the in-game currency has a chance of going on sales of 20%, 50%, and even 75% off depending on your luck at the log-in rewards.",2
"warframe is a different kind of co-op third person shooter game there is. its pretty fast and its really sweet! ive played it for a while (and then lost the files because of some stupid fail backup .. sigh! :<) and i must say it is one fine game! the graphics, the gameplay and the sword-slashing skills *_* .. just too epic but there are some cons that i found to be annoying such as the repetitive play. there is no option to delete a character (afaik) as i wanted to try all the classes before taking a proper class that ill love. but all in all, its a brilliant game! i love it and you should too :p",1
"i was a mage. being a mage in this game is sooooooo hard. hes a support, so i had to call my brother to help. he was fighting with his badass swords and i was shooting lightning. i enjoyed it as much as i enjoy my turkey sandwiches. 9/10",1
"great looking game. one problem imo tho. the difficulty spikes are insane. game is basically unplayable solo. and the pay 2 win feature is even more insane. sure one can farm the easy lvls for a year and sell your soul to the lootfairy and hope for something good to drop. but its not changing my feelings towards the insane difficulty this game has when playing alone the idea of the game is great overall, but unless something is done about the difficulty im not gonna support this game anymore. maybe i just suck at the game. i do recomend people to try it. at least once.",1
"good sound, graphic, and motion. this is an interesting shooting game that you can play free. however there are so many annoying bug and you might bore, if you play incessantly so long time.",2
"if you think space ninjas with guns is hype i recomend it. there is farming involed but the story is amazing.",7
"flesh menaces versus the galaxy in this oer-the-shouldie mass murder simulator. nerve-shredding combat at 90 miles an hour with weapons on the spectrum of handguns all the way to electronic versions of  youd find strapped to your favorite ninja turtle. plays like mirrors edge meets mass effect. lovely upgrade/crafting systems in a booster pack format.",2
"warframe in my opinion it is just too amazing to be free and i mean for gods sake youre a space ninja whats not to love about that and another thing it have a great and helpful community involved in it plus its a really great game to play with friends.",7
"poorframe, the game that will make you poor due to all the spendingsssssszssssssss",1
"ok, so like 20 billion years into the furture and the universe is populated by different groups of  who hate everyone, but they went and pissed off ur mumma, and they didnt realise that ur mumma was the leader of an ancient race of kick  super space ninjas. she tell you to go out there and kill them all.. and like a good lil boy you do... and some times you take ur brother and sisters cos sharing is caring.... oh and while your out there slashing you way to happy town, you loot every dam thing in ur path so you can go home and build your own awesome space dojo to bounce around with you friends, build a training course, dueling arena and some sort of room for upgrading ur stuff and abilites cos ur clearly not op enough. when ur done you become king of the universe but ur mumma still make you eat all ur greens.",1

"do i really even have to say it? look at my hours played. fun combat, if ultimately a bit repetitive, the game is made worth it by the constant stream of new content, player influenced economy and politics, and the need for sweet sweet loot. i cant stop. wont stop.",10
"warframe what to say? nice customization options ... wait need platinum ok lets get a new gun (grind,grind,grind)... sweet now wait 24 hours hmmm i like it but ..... lets get a new warframe (grind,grind,grind,grind) sweet now wait 3 days 3 weeks later ok i am bored waits for next big up-date, ooooooh i can have a space dog (grind, grind, 50 round later kubrow egg sweet) wait for it to mature bring it out in battle, it gets killed ;( make dog stronger get bored try getting a prime warframe............... out of void keys!!!!!!!!! start trading junk on the market helmet, systems, blueprint, wait the chassis is worth 300 plat -_- find some sucker trade him rare mods for 80 plat a peice (because i am too poor or not too stupid to buy plat) finaly i get rhino prime. leave game for 3 months waiting for next big update hi archwing and repeat",4

"when i started playing this game it was in alpha. i played when it was first made. every since then its been going downhill. i still recommend it because it use to be a lot of fun and i am a founder.",1

"where to start, this game is amazing. who dosent love futuristic ninjas with a large asortment of weaponry and warframes. you (and your sqaud if you chose) are a thought to be a long extinct race called the tenno. you (and your squad) are sent on challenging missions such as raid, capture, assassination and more. with unique maps and randomly generated scenarios, this game is hard to beat comparied to the other free to play games. it plays well and it is well polished. its flaws are the currency for ingame money called platinum, $5.00 = 75 platinum in which a warframe cost 375 platinum (depending on the warframe). another flaw is the building system, you go all over the solar system collecting various resurces and materials to build weapons, warframes, ect. but the warframes require a s**t ton of material and some of them you cannot get in one go. you may have the bluprints for the warframe ect. but you nedd to work for it. once you have all of the materials you can build the warfraem, weapon, ect. but it will take 12hrs for weapons, warframe parts 24hrs, warframes them selves will take 3days. but, this games goods over shadow the bads with f-u-n. so if you like space ninjas, badass weapons, cool looking warframes with unique powers this is for you. (9.3/10)",3
"ive been really addicited to this game! at first glance i thought it was lame and stupid. i never really enjoyed the whole futureistic stuff and space. but seriously! this blew me away on how the pve is perfect! the whole game is f2p and there revenue is based on players buying in game currency to get outfits and such. they are very cool but seriously the game is designed to not have one player be over powered. one must grind to get there and thats why this game is very enjoyable! no one can be good without grinding there way to there. even with buying stuff with real money..",2
"this game has come a looooong way since they first started. at first it was like were robot ninjas in space and now its literally robot ninjas in space with super powers, guns, and dogs. starting nearly powerless you grow into a powerful warrior if youre willing to give it a go. i do recommend that you play with friends though, this is pretty harsh to solo players",3
"warframe is a game in which you follow a group of three really strong, cool and fast ninjas around as they do sweet flips and kill army men. all sorts of neat things fall out of the army men as they die! your goal is collect as many items as possible before the ninjas get tired of being totally sweet and decide to leave. when they leave, any items you havent picked up yet are lost! the ninjas are really fast and do some pretty sweet tricks, so it can be really hard to keep up with them! the challenge is part of the fun, though. anyone who enjoys casual games, racing games or ninjas would do well to check this incredible f2p offering out.",1
"for an f2p game you get a lot for nothing, but when you start paying its still the same f2p game thats good for an f2p game. very repetitive, vague systems for leveling.",1
"what destiny should have been. i was disapointed when i played destiny with all the hype i should have known better, not long after a friend showd me this game, and i was not disapointed.",7
"warframe takes a free to play format that really works - rewarding players for their commitment to the game, while allowing for many customization options that dont make the one with more $$$ too powerful. definitely worth a play in my book.",1
"grab this if you want to be: a freaking ninja a stealth fellow who likes banging everyone a social butterfly a 3rd fps pro an up all night gamer an fun game to play 100/100.5",1
"addicted until i found out i spent 415 hours on it. i remember not sleeping or blinking and id play hours and hours helpful community, good fun, attractive developers grineer are the best.",5
"repetative but nice ranged and melee combat. fast combat and tons of loot to use and craft along the way",1
"for all those friend of mine. i suggest everyone to try this one. needless to mention this is free to play game tho. its pretty much addective third person game. i would love to play this whole day and night without rest and food :)) . some kind of high technology mixed with katana and bow and other stuffs. its really new thing for me from the very start. even now i dont know what exactly should i do :))",1
"very good game. although i would really like to have this game avaiable on os x becuase use dual boot is somewhat slighly troublesome.",1
"good cant rember stealthing though then a gen a only got to the second level but it as ninja super supreme game 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10",1
"i used to be a space ninja. untill i took an arrow to the knee",1
"great gameplay i can play this for hours on end. i never run out of things to do and the poeple on the game are very nice. the graphics are amazing and they take into account if your computer is not good. boogner rates 10/10",2
"my game keeps on crashing and i cant do anything about it",3
"they need claptrap put in the next patch . more claptrap!",1
"i played it once but it is to laggy like 1frame per second but going to download it again and see what happens",1
"fun for a while, gets repetitive. if you dont mind this kind of repetition then its a great game. i burned out and can only play it now to placate my fascist friends.",5
"you basically are a race of galactic ninjas (that play free) that pwn no0bs all day 10/10",1
"this is the best game ever made i play this on ps4 and pc when away from home get this an add me on steam",1
"very fun f2p game. theyve done transactions pretty well in that the best/most rare gear in game cant be bought but has to be earned, and anything that can be bought can also be crafted/found without an inordinate amount of time. plus its like diablo with space ninjas so how rad is that?",1
"this game. this game. i have played quite a few third-person shooters, but my main complaint was that most of them were simply fps-style gameplay, just over the shoulder of your character. the standard, run-shoot-take cover deal. not this game though. with a variety of weapons, characters that have their own skills and powers, and a slick melee/free running mechanic, this game is one of the most fun third person shooters i have played yet. the fact that it is also free helps. no, this game is not pay-to-win, if you were worried about that. there is a market system, but most, if not all weapons and armors can be forged with in-game currency and resources dropped from enemies. perks like colors and the occasional ninja scarf do requrire cash, but they are only there if you want them. overall, i give this game two thumbs up. if you were worried by that metacritic score, dont be. this is a good, lasting game that is frequently updated by a developer that acutally listens to player feedback. i can only see this game getting better in the future.",2
"awesome f2p-game! definetly worth the time to check it out!",5
"a very fun and rather addicting game. i enjoy grinding levels and materials to make better weapons and gear, so this is my kind of time-eater. great looking game with easy controls and a fast pace. things get pretty buggy when a patch is released, espeically because they tend to do big patches, but theyre really quick to address and fix things.",3
"space ninjas fighting space marines and the flood from halo. also guns and swords and special abilities and tight suits.",1
"still the one of the best fp2 games out there or even the best!!! u should really check it out its incredibly fun!!!",1
"really, i think its one of the best free games on steam . i recomend this to anyone looking for a challenge. thats my opinion.",2
"free to play and pretty damn good. once you start it does start tempting you to spend money on new armour, weapons and items but so far i have not needed to do this to enjoy the game. massively multiplayer and fun to work together (or alone) to complete the levels, download it!",1
"this game is awesome ... i dont know i mean it just *clicks* for me! :d",1
"yess totaly a good game, as its free and all great graphics and cool wepons and frames. but extreamly repetitve and if you plan to play single player (which you can) it can get extreamly imposible. kinda buggy but its all good",1
"great game! fast paced, a lot of presonlization, and has a ton of potention in its open beta phase. sometimes a bit repetative, but it is a beta so its growing. highly recommend.",1
"one of the best free games i ever played try it right now",1
"quick, dirty, fun game of intense hacking, slashing, and shooting.",4
"i did not have the highest hopes after playing destiny, but when i head jeff from giant bomb give it a pretty good review on the quick look. i thought i would give it a try. i have been having a blast with it. most of the mechanics are clean except for wall running.",1
"i really enjoy this game, its not like any other game im use to, but it has some much to offer.",3
"an awesome game , but lots of the players in game cannot speak english , and that is a minus for the game :/ it is sometimes hard to make contact with them and you dont do the mission right , but the game is great and its even greater when you play in a party with some friends :) recommended , a great game !",1
"ruined my life for one month. grindy as hell, but its just so worth it. want to pin stuff to walls with your bolto? go ahead and grind for one to a few hours. but then, tis so fun just firing f*cking crossbow bolts with a rifle. want to get the nova warframe? sure, grind for the blueprints, with a 33% chance drop of a specific one after killing a boss , then grind for all the f*cking plastids , but sucking stuff into a black hole is so satisfying. go ahead, be like me and ruin your life, but be warned, some updates will be major (i.e. i quit cos of a new ui). edit 1: just got back into it- amazing sauce. contacted support for something and the response was posted in less than 24 hours :) gj devs tl;dr : grindy, but fun with good support!",1
"its hard but its very cool: nice graphics,sounds, maps play this game = ruin your real life :d",1
"warframe is a game that starts with you being majestic cyberninja, who backflips his way throught hordes of enemies and continues with you being most lonely, miserable, murderous mercenary in galaxy. we play as tenno, interstellar terrorists, who commit ruthless genocide among cloned humanity descendants because some weird woman hates them and doesnt want them live because we told they are oppresive and oppresive is bad for space slaughter. if you beated first six levels, that you know how the rest hundred or so looks like. whole sections of levels are shamelesly copypasted. get ready to climb same vent passage dozens of times. then climb it some more. to add punch to injury, game doesnt give you free stuff that easy. prepare to waste your week for new useless gun and several month for new warframe part. wallruning is useless, teamplay is useless, stealth is useless, you just run and shoot. whole mechanics wasted because of poor balance. also, higher level players can log in and gun down everything in sight, because level limitations doesnt exist. poor weapon balance was carried out from dark sector, which is a prequel and prototype for that game. i played warframe for several months, and it never changed. if you dont like changes, however, warframe is a game for you and your nonexistent social life. alternatively, you can wash dishes, it got the same gameplay and visual style, althought graphics is much better.",1
"stylish characters, sci-fi setting, pretty nice action, awesome keyboard+mouse controlling, free to play!!!",1
"this is an excellent third person co-op shooter. youll enjoy the freedom of movement and the weapon variety continues to grow. their current focus is pve, and thats just fine with me. each time you play a level it is constructed by randomly stitching together a series of rooms from the particular tile set, similar to diablo. it helps reduce the grinding feeling if you repeat levels for item drops. ive played since closed beta and its the devs openness to the community is what really drives my positive outlook on the game. you can earn everything in this game by playing, except for some aesthetics and convince, and thats the right way to do f2p. want > need. its rare for me to actually put money into this kind of game but ive upgraded to the hunter founders pack just because they are doing things right.",10
"fun game if not a little confusing. could use more tutorials but beyond that its great for a free to play.",1
"excellent third person shooting with unique visuals inspired by what a lot of us hoped dark sector would be. this is a great game and an even greater example of how to properly use the free-to-play model. i am holding each of my friends computers hostage and forcing the installation of this game on all of them. theres nothing in this game that you cant get for free with a little hard work aside from some cosmetic items. while it may not appear all weapons or characters are playable for free than can all be earned with a bit of work. the gameplay supports numeroous playstyles as long as they include mass murder of any enemy on the screen. overall a great game, and no reason not to play it.",2
"one of the best co-op games made... graphics gorgeous, gameplay smooth... the only thing i think it lacks is the true power, of ultimate space-ninja-hybrid-alien-thingies-powers. sadly i dont feel like a galaxy god :d i recomend this game anywhere, anytime, solo, random player co-op or the best... with your friends. ;)",1
"love this game, play it all the time with my friends and it can also be a great single player game.",1
"this game is honestly amazing but! ive benn playing since closed beta so i know how things work. that being said this game has a excessively steep learning curve that might detour new players but if you stick around long enough i swear you wont regret it. also the devs are an amazing bunch and are a huge part of their community if you have any questions check the forums or wiki.",4
"plenty of fun, especially with mates. guns? melee? stealth? customization? if you like all these, im pretty sure youll enjoy this.",8
"ill keep this short, this is a must have f2p game, it looks great and plays even better, + you cant go wrong with.........fu*king ninjas!!!!",1
"a very fun,fast paced,thirdperson shooter with amazing graphics that should blow a persons mind.",1
"awesome game, its suuuuuper fun. my only bad point here is that its kinda pay-to-win. this is a free game, so they have to get money somehow, but the major currency really isnt obtainable without real money.",3
"you can cut people in half ever since the beta. you know its good 9/10 a bit too much grinding",1
"yes please... dont wonder if this game is any good... just play it.. a lot... 3rd person shooter action with wall climbing, super jumping, melee weapon action... its so good.. youll wonder why you dont even have to pay for it!!!!! awesome new quests to get you started and introduce you to the game make it even sweeter for new players, your upgradable space ship is an awesome between mission base and gives a nice home to the various non mission activities such as crafting, modifications and research. tldr: just do it!!!!!! nuff said",2
"space ninjas, need i say more? ive been playing this for nearly two years and still love love love it. your start will be pretty slow and without potatoes and good ranked up mods in your gear, youll be kinda weak. however, when you become powerful and have a squad to play with, this game really shines. if youre looking for a free to play game to sink alot of time into, this is it.",5
"game is by far, one of the most amazing games i have played.. in years....fluid from gun combat, to melee, then the big bada boom! abilities and custom variety for your very own warfarme. grand...simply grand!",3
"i first played this game when i was in high school, i was just looking for a new free game then and i found something thatll get me hooked really good... as a returning old player ive never seen such awesome improvements in such a short span of time. good to play with solo... better with a team of friends.",1
"warframe, definitely one of my all-time favourite games. the graphics are awesome, comparable to those of next-gen console games. with almost 200 hours on record and at least spent $100 on in-game currency. of course, one of my biggest problems with this game is that the farming takes soooo long! if you want to get some of the higher end stuff, then youre going to need a lot of time on hand. and i mean a lot!",2
"waframe is a fun and a bad game its cuz of the movement its fun cuz of how much stuff u can do",1
"just got game go to options turn on fullscreen game has blackscreen cant see a thing stops trying to make it work 100/10 gg gaben plez",1
"warframe is worth your time to play, that i can guarantee. grinding game but still worth the shot, you can gets, builds and achives",9
"you see in the game from weapons, warframes (characters), sentinels, pets and other cool stuffs. the only character and weapons you cant get is the excalibur prime, lato prime & skana prime - cuz its a game founders items. other sci-fi / fantasy themed game can never be better than this game. unique art style that will blow your mind the moment you see it, very good and detailed background storyline that is also stick along with the in-game living universe. new contents and updates every month thats always get you hype and surprise you all the time. the game focused on co-op pve hack & slash things rather than pvp but its still have some good competitive pvp mode like clan vs clan or alliance vs alliance... let just stop right here, youve to play and feel the game yourself, words mean nothing in this game. and one last thing, warframe devs always care about the community just like valve did, theyd ask you how you feel, how you doing, what is going on, what do you want in the next update, do you have any problem while playing... and so so on, they really care about you, they do, same goes for the community itself, good people everywhere will help you noobs if you get stuck somewhere or dont know this or that. just play the game and you will be in love with it.",1
"one of the best indie games youll find. love it in nearly every way.",2
"this is a beautiful looking game and the gameplay is ok but it falls with almost everything having to be bought with money.",1
"pros: + maneuvers and parkour. + straightforward combat. + large variety of weapons, suits and game modes. cons - story isnt prevalent. - very repetetive. - recycled levels.",1
"its fun for a while, but the connections are so horrible they made me quit.",3
"overall, i highly recommend warframe. i like the whole space ninja aesthetic of this game. the developers did a good job of making something original. there are some valid criticisms to the complexity of the game, but at least there is a great wiki and good developer support. the developers are constantly adding new content, which can actually be a little bit overwhelming at times, but theres always new stuff to do. the developers are involved with the community, and are generally fast with the bug fixes. did i mention the bugs? theres new bugs with every update, but most of it is minor stuff that gets fixed quickly. platinum: you can spend large amounts of real world money on the premium currency and end up with very little to show for it. however, if you are smart about how you spend platinum, you can avoid some of the early-game grinding and get some fun cosmetic items as well. warframe is certainly not a pay-to-win game, but at some point youre really going to need some plat. if you dont want to spend real money, you can get all of the plat youll ever need through in-game trades. i have most of the cosmetic stuff, 90% of the weapons, and all of the warframes, but i only purchased $25 of plat when i first started playing.",6
"the game is so damn good, trust me, but there are just a lots of milestones to buy cash point, you want to craft a weapon? here, please gather the required materials, pay the credit after you pay the credit, and wait for 12 hours, just when i thought grind is the only wall, now comes the crafting time... i mean cmon, ive gathered my mats, paid the required price, and now wait for 12 effin hours for mah knuckles? so here it is, the game itself is enjoyable and action packed, but hell the dev loves money so much, not only the cash shop is stingy as expensive french cuisines portion, but most of the warframes are expensive too (granted to balance it out with crafting), but theres a waiting time for 12 hours after you give the mats to the crafter and if you want to have the crafted stuff now, you have to pay with real money currency... so theres these 2 walls in early game 1. grindy for some people, and even some have more patient, theres rng system you know... 2. dem crafting wait time, this pissed me off the most though if you have no problem with them, then just play the game, its definitely worth your time.",2
"after a couple game crashes just trying to turn the game on, and then being forced to play the tutorial/first level a couple times cause the game logged me out mid-level, im done. uninstalled and very much not recommended",1
"this game is amazing.i suggest you downloading this game at the official website as steam warframe will crash more often than the official one.",1
"so, why dont you go ahead and play something more constructive? like minecraft?",7
"great settting and gives a updated twist on games like d3 and torchlight ii. oh and who doesnt love ninjas",8
"future space ninja coop magic third-person. awesome as  (also, it not pay2win ^^)",1
"over 400 hours played and an amazing collection of weapons which include: a double headed halberd, dual infected cleavers, a katana, a laser cannon, a sawn off sniper pistol, throwing stars, a assualt rifle with a 100 clip, a long range rifle and much, much more. in order to fully enjoy this game you may have to spend a bit although everything is obtainable troughout time and farming. a warframe for everything, and an arsenal that compliments every warframe in different ways, i cant see why not? 10/10",5
"for a free to play game , well .. this game is 2 good lol :d",1
"i personally loved minecraft, and warframe reminded me alot of it. i definitely recommend!",1
"deluxe zuppa atraczion space ninjas 10/10. but i wanna some ost music simmilar to unreal tournament ost",4
"fun game to play online. get in a clan, run some alerts and blow sh!t up. the actual frames are fun to build. makes you work a bit to get all the parts, but thats really what keeps you coming back. decent graphics and the controls are on par with most aaa tps games.",1
"few words about this game. awesome, multiplayer, and free.",1
"like farmville in space!! it even has potatoes !!!",3
"get this game got no money but want a epic game look no further :d",1
"its an awesome game to play with your friends/family alot of blood though so only 13 and up",1
"very unique mmo. like playing a bad  coop verion of mass effect where each player controls an acrobatic terminator with guns and blades. theres not much i can say that hasnt been said about this game already but its atleast worth a try. i really like the game and like the idea of instance based mmos and this one is one of the coolest in style and gameplay. its also very fast paced and fun with friends or by yourself. you could even speedrun instances which is something most open world mmos dont have available.",1
"awesome game looks nice for a free-2-play but it is 90% pay to win type of game. the game it self is still amazing.",1
"for a free to play game, warframe certainly gets quite a few things right: the graphics are gorgeous, the game mechanics are simple, & the frames (characters) are unique, and stand out with personalities even though they dont have dialouge. as a bonus, the developers are very involved in the community; adding new weapons and items, as well as implementing new game modes and events with detailed backgrounds on a regular basis. the weapons and frames are so diverse and numerous, & its really fun to experiment and find a combination that you call your own. the only problem i have with the games structure is that you get very few weapon and frame slots to start with, and you can only get more through buying platinum (cash). there are so many weapons and frames i feel that they need to add a few more slots, because new players might not have the information they need to sink some money into the game if they cant experiment with more than 2 frames or 4 weapons. and, unfortunately, the starting weapons suck to the maximum, but that should be expected since you need to work your way up. i would definitely reccommend this game to anyone who wants an action / brawler game, because the melee / ninja-acrobatic side is stronger than the shooter side.",9
"im enjoying this game quite a bit but ive been stuck on the eurasia mission on earth for 2-3 days now. i would like to continue playing but im afraid that this one mission might just stop me. very much do i enjoy challenges but for being so early on, i feel that this mission is too much. ive even played with several different groups and it all ends the same. failed. this mission is too over-powering. i feel that the creators of this game should fix this and make it a tad easier like how it used to be before. other than that i would totally recommend this game to other video gamers!",1
"never play the game because it always updating. after download the client i play the game and asking for update, its arround 596mb (from game launcher). and than im waiting to finish update. after that. its updating (again, from steam) arround 5.8gb, i update it. and ask update again 596mb. this is",1
"i cant even explain how much i love this game. it just doesnt get boring with all the different gear you can use and tasks you can do. if you like hack n slash / 3rd person shooters, this game is for you",8
"dangerous game, once you start to understand the mods part of the game it can get very addictive ;d you have bin warned haha",7
"its really cool and 100% good if you want to play but if your network are low bar i recomend you not to play because you will have burn your your computer down after you play.trust me i have that problem.",1
"you know destiny? this is the game it wanted to be... warframe is a hack and slash shooter with free flowing movement and shooting with some annoying f2p tricks and moba tip bits. pros: the guns are various, good or bad - it depends on your mods and how you play the free flowing movement system is good and can slide in and hack people up 3 factions that offer good varation but the grinner are annoying with there armor the mods are a mixed bag as rng decides your loot some of the weapons and suits require you to be in a clan to get them it takes time to get good guns the suits or frames is good but be careful when you upgrade mods and there suit the crafting system is abit weird and has some pay to go tricks overall fun --- updates very often cons: dont finish the galaxy quickly, it gets boring the bosses are often gimmicky with weakspots the grinner can cause a bleeding proc that wrecks some frames and exposlives the infested arent scary but the elders can wreck you clans are needed for some of the cool guns the market often has cool guns that you either buy with real money or take a week to grind from them and build them most often the missions repeat. the ship and ui was better when it was menu based but that is me i recommend this game, it pretty and unique just remember it takes awhile to get used too.",3
"game is very fun and a free which is amazing! i dont understand why you would buy destiny when there is warframe!",1
"ive barely played 3 hours and just finished the first couple of missions where youve gotta go after vor or whatever. i killed him, and now can completely see this game is grind heavy. if i wanted to grind through a game, id go for a game with at least some open world features and maybe a tad bit of story like oh i dunno, wow. this game is just murder porn with half a story and a grind thats completely unaddictive. this game could be more, but really its the same crap with no variation.",1
"this game is very ambitious, but whats great about this game is that it delivers. this game always comes up with a huge update, it offers a new content at least twice a year. it is impressive",7
"warframe, a game in which you are farming more than you do on farming simulator. 10/10",2
"omg why i dont know this awesome game from a long time my friend recomeded this for me and i sayed it will be just like others but now this game is the #1 in my game list ps : i am a youtuber with 120 subs i need someone with skype to make a video on this awsome game ps #2 : sorry for my bad english i am french lol",1
"great co-op game, i love playing it with my friends, it kinda gets boring playing by yourself, a great third person shooter. i recommend it.",1
"the new updates are really f*cking glitchy, but i still recommend it....",2
"it said ninjas play free but then i bought a dlc pack 0/10 - ign",1
"interesting third-person shooter, great design and definitley worth a look.",1
"this game is very good. i can not believe it was free. the customisation options are amazing, as well as the blending of the multiplayer and storymode. i use the volt tenno but i am looking forward to using the others.",2
"basically, an mmo cyborg-ninja mech suit steath-ish maybe third person shooter with awesome graphics, nice voice acting, and (when it has it) good humor. top it off with being free to play.",1
"they fixed their  but they still have a ways to go... introduce the nature warframe already...",6
"you may find you spend too much on this free game. its free to play but made as well as a big budget game. my main selling point is you can get anything through normal play! try it out what can it hurt?",3
"do you like grinding in a game that is fun to play but still alot of grinding? then get the game and try it out. do you hate grinding? then dont get this game. thats all you need to know to see if you will like it.",10
"this game... whew, where do i begin? i shall start with the technical elements. the graphics (on my 1920 x 1080 hd screen) are smooth and flawless. i have yet to see a graphical error, and i see these in almost every game. this game is one of the few truly free-to-play games on the market. all it takes is patience, friends, a plan, and an understanding of the concept of bugeting resources. it has one of the kindest playerbases i have ever had the pleasure of encountering, people who will let you jump right in to their tower iv defense and only give you a little crap for being a level 6 loki prime. this game is an unforgettable experience, with a storyline that i can only call epic, genius original ideas for most aspects of the game, and parkour system that flows so smoothly that i still cannot believe functions as well as it does. its a game for people who dont want to spend a dime, as well as one who loves to pump money ito videogames. the grinding can be frustrating and tedious, and some missions seem unnessecarily difficult, but with a group of friends and a little bit of time, these things cease to exist. in this game, you strive to build your own weapons and warframes, and though it takes longer, i have to say, its damn satisfying. 10/10. get in here, tenno. we need you.",1
"this game is pretty great. i enjoy the gameplay. it is a little difficult most of the time to solo missions although they start to get easier after progressing through some of the levels. i like the weapon/pet aspect. overall a very fun endless game. that is unless you spend a lot of money on platinum which then its probably pretty easy.",3
"great graphics, tons of weapons, suits, and companions, hundreds of missions; all for free. the vast majority of the in-game content can be accessed just by playing, but you can spend real money to speed things up or buy aesthetic upgrades. 10/10, will ruin your life.",3
"the game is great more better its free to play.. there are a lot great stuff, like mele combat shooting stile.. but there is something negative about it---the farming, you need a lot of timr to get what you need",3
"warframe is a great game. i played early on and liked it a lot. due to life issues i quit playing all games for a while. i recently came back to it after a couple years and wow. according to my game profile i have around 160 hours played, steam does not show the correct number, because i played before it was on steam. if you have a group of friends that enjoy co op games you should give it a shot. fast paced action, gorgeous graphics, nice music and sound fx. developers update the game and address any balance issues.",2
"a very beautiful game in terms of graphics and gameplay. warframe does have a tendency to become a little repeative though the more time you spent playing with different people the more different the gameplay feels. as its a game that is still being developed the story is still small great but has the potenail to become one epic tale of survival. i believe its a game eveyone should t least try though it may not be for everyone",8
"alright, theres a lot to tell with this review. warframe is a good game. it has good lore and okay mechanics. the graphics are appealing and the design is good lookin. there are also downsides here however. the maps are very repetetive and can get boring. the games difficulty is too much for beginning players who havent mastered the game. the biggest problem though, are the paywall limitations. you start off extremely limited. only a few inventory slots and a few warframe slots until you pay. now of course, you can barter with otherf players for platinum piece by piece but that takes days just to get 5$ of platinum, unless you grind for hours. once you get good at warframe, its insanely fun though. 9/10, would pwn in space for hours at a time.",6
"the absolute proof that co-op can be pay to win. with good graphics, repetitive gameplay and forgettable maps, you will find yourself doing the same brainless thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again just to get that one thing you need to craft something, then start all over again. all this is pointlles and i do not understand why this game even exist.",1
"i kicked another mans soul out of his chest and into another one 9/10 would preform necrmancy again",1
"really fun game and really cool! but unfortunatly when you finish the main story you go into multiplayer online coop matches. this means you are faced with odds to high for your level or weapon efficiancy but to get better weapons or level up you have to either spend money or keep playing which is very difficult as all the odds are against you. still a great game but i wish the better weapons and powers where easier to access, instead of having to spend real money.",1
"verry nice game with a lot of content, there are some problems with all that content, the nu game syle with the archwings is rubbish, is nice looking and all that crap but thats all good looking, is to dizzy with all that spinning, and there is much more but in conclusion the new content may macke the game much more good looking and more but that doesnt mean thah is macking the game more playable for us its actualy macking us harder to find what we want, wat i do realy like is the combat sistem and the nice grafic thah the game has. i will recomand this game to any of you for the next reasons, good grafic , nice combat sistem, multyplayer coop, alows u to trade some items, and much more content that makes this game a good game, i still need to say that u might find some bugs and specialy when they macke a new pach",2
"the worst part about warframe: buying anything with paid credits is extremely expensive unless you roll a discount as a login reward. the second worst part: some bugs, but it is still in beta. third worst part: subpar interface. aside from that, pretty much no complaints. best visuals and gameplay out of any f2p thing i can think of, including some pretty badass sliding, wall running, somersaulting and other acrobatics, during which you can still freely shoot and melee. melee is elegantly handled with a single key instead of having to manually equip a weapon. putting weapons together the long way is just the right amount of work to actually be kind of satisfying instead of the anticipated unbearable grind. the universe and art direction are excellent; the tenno are badasses, and its practically impossible to not be awesome. even playing online with random guys isnt too awful; the average player barely even talks during a game, although you do run into some guys who are apparently hosting the game from a ti-83 in kenya. all in all, i mean, its a game about future space ninjas with guns and swords and superpowers, so im kind of predictably addicted. and the devteam seems like a pretty alright group of guys who enjoy adding new content.",1
"excellent ftp game! not only is it free to play (with the possibility to buy credits to get weapons ect. faster) but its a lot of fun playing! one of the best parts is that you can choice to play either alone or with others (its meant to be played as a multiplayer game), and that the multiplayer part is made so that you actually have to work as a team in many ways in order to complete many missions - its not the typically every man for himself-game so thumbs up for that. at this date the game is still in beta so there will be bugs. but besides that - great setup, great idea, and great action. can only recommend the game - without doubt!",4
"whooo hooo! lots of fun. the maps start to feal a bit recycled after a while, and it feals kike there could be more diversity in weapons but over all quite fun and purty to look at.",1
"its a four-player co-op shooter in the vein of mass effect 3 multiplayer, with fast-paced action and plenty of customizable options. unforunately there is no story context. warframe seems content to establish its universe at a basic level. animations in general are fluid and interesting. digital extremes has created something thats often genuinely fun to play, and given the cost of entry, warframes well worth a try if youre in the mood for something different.",1
"space ninjas with a futuristic twist. it is a very fun game, worth while and would have payed for if it costed money.",2
"its not a bad game considering its free. the best thing about it is that you can play in 15-30 minute chunks if you wanted. its not impossible to obtain every item in the game for free, but its no cake-walk either. but if you just want to be a wall-running, katana slinging, dual-pistol wielding space ninja, then this is the game for you!",2
"one of the good ftp titles. very interesting art design and quickly becoming my favorite sci-fi universe. also: parkour space ninjas!",6
"ninjas in space!. whats not to love, 11/10 what are you doing still reading this review. go! shoo!",1
"futuristic robotic body ninja in space,there is always new to this game since the devs always put something new almost like every week, the one thing i like of this game is. its not a competetive game ,even so, you will still probably wanting to farm and buy the best items and mods to experience all the things warframe has to offer, id recommend this to people who likes shooting games in 3rd person, likes ninja, parkour, non-human characters, and dogs. thats right, dogs! the downside of this game is some of the items and item parts are hard to farm because it has a low drop chance, anyways its part of the difficulty, i would be giving it a 8/10. btw if you guys need a clan just message me on steam or at my steam profile we got like 900+ people, full unlock tech in dojo and a good community. have fun!",7
"amazing, not well known, but very addictive. completely free if you play enough. you can loot every items you can buy.",2
"most f2p games, especially 3rd person, are generally just cheap shells for a money pit. while this game does require lots of time or money, it is fair-ish about getting resources. pros: great graphics (low grade drivers beware!!!) good community tolerable market system cons: movement and tricks are not intuitive new warframes are hard to earn brand new items cant be bought w/ credits, must be bought w/ money money scaling is a pain in the butt. 9/10 would recommend again",1
"two reasons why to play: 1. its free, why the hell not? 2. youre a god damn alien robot ninja thing that can do backflips. i would say warframe is an excellent game which requires you to spend some time to actually get good at. though the key mapping is very odd, after a while you get used to it. i did encounter quite a few bugs though, one of the worst, being in first person (i dont know how it happened, dont ask). though playing in first person may seem cool and all, it made me feel nautious as hell and i couldnt even see what i was doing.",2
"ive been playing warframe for about two months, and from the first time i played it, i knew it would be a game id play for a long while. its game play overall reminisces of monster hunter, so if youre familiar with that game, youll more than likely enjoy this one. of course, their similarities end there. this is a game of skill. it is set in some alternate universe, and, in short, you go around, killing things foreseen as evil and you dont really know why, just that you must at any cost. in your travels, you collect materials and, in turn, use them to create weapons, as well as other warframes. tread lightly and slowly, because there is not an end-game to this one yet. all you have is the pvp, and that doesnt quite do it for a good number of the players. the only thing you can do right now is become a perfectionst and compete for clan rights, but it is still (technically) in early-access, so we can always look forward for new content. all in all, id have to say give it a try. its free, you can dump time into it, and the community is great overall.",4
"totally enjoyed the game, didnt play on steam anymore tho, steam sux with updating the game.",3
"my computer exploded while trying to run this game 11/10 would ninja again.",1
"overall game concepts pretty awesome !! btw how do people run so fast in the game ?!",2
"fast paced, high flying robot ninja action! this game is extremely fun!",2
"very good game ! ive played also on the ps4 and it rocks !! i recommend it 100%",1
"this is a game about running around with guns and swords slaughtering everything that moves, and farming to get more cool guns, swords, and suits. its fun, if you like that kind of thing. its free, and you can trade other players to get the real-money currency (platinum), so you can get everything (even the cosmetics) without spending a dime.",3
"such a good game its free to play so keep in mind that it has flaws, it has very good grafics for it being a free to play,nice lore,characters, lots of weapons and a bunch of ther  :p but if you dont like to grind then this game is not for you the game is hard at first because you have a hard time finding people to do the first missions so keep that in mind but once you get the game and how it is you will find everything very easy",1
"excelent for a free game. could easily be singleplayer just as much as it is multiplayer.",1
"definitely one of the best free shooters out there. want destiny? try warframe first.",4
"level 3, still no idea what i am doing. no clue how to get new items. its an okay game, just confusing for me. 10/10 would get confused again",4
"please give me my life back, it wasnt much but, it still was my life.",2
"this game is really fun to play with friends and a great way to pass the time.",1
"due to support and not the game itself i have to give it a thumbs down for now. the support is almost the worst i have ever had besides the first darkfall. lastly be prepared to spend lots of real money if you want stuff in game the time it takes to gather materials and then wait on crafting times is unreasonable and they know it. so what happens is you spend real money because after you have grinded for 100s of hours for much of the gear and waited days and weeks to craft it you get sick of the grind give in and pay real money to speed it up. also the pricing of in game content is the highest i have ever seen in any game. so in essence long grinds or pay money (lots of money) and bad support.",6
"warframe is a f2p game that, for once, is done well. you are tenno, one ancient sci-fi race or another, that gives you an excuse to bring an overlarge knife to a gunfight- and win. there is pvp, though most of your time will be spent pve, slaughtering hordes of enimies, shoot em up style. through this, you will gain xp to level up your guns, melee weapons and armour suit, as well as mods to further enhance them. paying money is not neccecary to win or progress, though you can use it if you so desire. graphically, the game looks pretty. its not going to blow you away, and id appreciate some more aa, but its great for what it is. and it also allows it to run on lower-tier pcs, which is always good. warframe is a great way to unwind after a stressful day, as you clear out an enture room by yourself.",1
"in my opinion best free to play game on steam. have played the game since beta and am still seeing new content and events on a regular basis. this game has done incredibly well to avoid any pay to win aspects.",3
"i love it! really, this is the best free to play game ever, and warthunder ofcourse, and keep in mind , i played a lot of free to play games, but.. i really cant belive this game is free... wow... just..... wow.... great job guys, great job. :3",1
"its free! it has beautiful graphics! you can play online.... etc. recommend! one of the best free games on steam!",1
"very good game, addictive. if u have friends start together and learn your way into the game. its awsome. you should give it a shot. tenno out of ten (10/10).",9
"warframe is a free 3rd person instance based mmo, to truly get into this game it requires more time than i have put into it so dont solely base your opinion on this game off my review. warframe in my opinion takes a long time and a lot of grinding to start having fun with.. you begin with basic equipment and weapons that arent horrible so you not left that far behind, but you will soon be grinding constantly for your next weapon or suit. the game itself has a very loose story and backstory that you dont have to pay any attention to if you dont want to. your character is tenno and you play as a warframe or in my eyes just a fancy coloured mech. each warframe has certain perks and 4 special abilities and you take on typical mmo roles of damage, tank and healer. the artwork is actually pretty good for a free to play game, its very colourful and can even look pretty but because you are always moving around very quickly or getting mobbed by enemies you dont really get time to have a good look. to be honest its a very good game but its just not for me. i would suggest that if you were to start playing, get some friends who have already played to either teach you or carry you through the lower stages of the game. i rate it 8/10",1
"perfect game in many aspects. begin on unical fps play style, ending on patches which inlcude always new stuff, fixes and of course upgrade the game to the current stage. my wish for next years? create perfect story lane, make from this game something more then default shooter.",5
"great game!!. a lot of diferent classes and skills, weapons all over... and multiple game modes. very enterteining. i started playing this game since the early alpha and i can tell that it is continously evolving but always in a good way. just play it",2
"its is a third person shooter with lots of cool weapons and procedurally generated levels. only negative is that it can get repetitive and i would recommend short sessions.",2
"lots of fun! beautiful graphics! not a lot of end game content besides void keys!",1
"an awesome 3rd person with some  awesome gameplay and graphics! you gotta play this at least more than tf2.",1
"can be a bit confussing to learn rhe flow of the game, but its super fun when you get together with your friends.",1
"you get to play as a warframe, a person/robot in a suit.. gameplay is great, fast paste, generaly quick. creating items takes some time but in return makes you more powerfull. you should atleast try it. best 3rd person free-to-play so far.",2
"the game is extremely fun with friends and possibly alone if youre good enough for it. the only problem with it is it has a very minor grinding problem.",4
"its a good game, there is a lot of grind to get what you want, if you want to you can choose your weapons carefully in the tutorial (kind of like a cheat) without the cheating. game is nicely glazed with transparent effects and lots of glow, options are confusing to me in this game because of the ps4 compatibility! if you want you can farm the same area or you can do them sequentially! gud fon!",3
"imagine repeatedly ejaculating in your pants, but there is no mess. that is warframe, a pleasure filled experience......with no inconvenience to follow.",1
"for a free game this has awesome graphics, and the diversity on this game is unbelievable, and i love the free running sooooooo helpful. overall this game is amazing!!!.",1
"im kinda in between on wether i like it or not, but its a great concept for a game and i really enjoy playing it, just grinding out levels for hours and hours causes me to be really upset when i play it because i dont wanna have to sit here for hours and kill bosses for loot and levels, also the crafting system is really nice for the card system they have for improving your warframe, but you can get way too overpowered too quickly with a few hours at venus and a few minutes in the crafting menu",1
"very fun if you like games that involve shooting and ninjas, but maybe not for people who like pirates. then again, there is swords, so mabey you can pretend :)",1
"although you do the same thing in the game over and over the game still seems fun. its yout typical thirdperson shooter with great co-op. i recommend it",1
"so far this is an amazing game, its an underdog game for me, i like playing it but not by myself.",1
"very awesome game and the best grinding game i have played",3
"an exciting 3rd person ninja shooter based on sci-fi. explore respective warframes powers and master them!",5
"for the reason i dont know how to write the review",2
"i like the game because its different from others but there is sooo many problems to solve. the content on game is so low.. always same missions, same thing, same enemies.. :/",3
"whats not to like about space ninjaing all over the place? sure its free to play and has ingame currency you can buy, but its less grindy than many other free to play games. space! ninjas! in space! you can run on the walls and use your melee arsenal to cut and smash enemies.",4
"great f2p game. whats nice is that with a lot of hard work and dedication, you know you can get almost everything without having to use your hard-earned (hopefully) money.",2
"game has lots of bugs, which ruin gameplay. client crash when youre at the end of tough mission is normal, and all you earned during the fight is gone. save your nerves and dont play this game.",1
"fantastic! looking for that old school 2p console gamer feel without having to be near the person or having to pay any money? then this will be your new cocaine.",4
"this game is probably one of the best free to play games out there",1
"highly recommended : what more can we say about this game, that hasnt already been said ? its an amazing f2p, everything is obtainable through farming/grinding, even the real currency youd buy with real money. takes a bit of time and farming to actually get some decent stuff but its worth the trouble! graphics wise, its better than some $20-$30 games out there, and it keeps on getting better! sure, youll have glitches and bugs, thats because the game is still in beta, and many people seem to forget about it. glitches and bugs get fixed over time, the devs works hard for that. =)",8
"beautiful and fast paced with the added effect of slaughtering hundreds of enemies without really having to think about it. its fun. the different frames give the game an added variety along with the weapons.",1
"at the start it seems boring and the game did not explain u what it is very briefly for eg how to farm but as u understand it its a very very good game to play amust have the fact that they keep adding things so frequently is just awesome and the game is so attractive and addictive",6
"its a great game with many possiblites to get even better! 10/10!",1
"while some of the gameplay might come off as repetitive, there is no denying that destroying enemies in ever new and inventive ways is part of the fun. warframe is a generally middle-paced action based game that takes place in the future with two major factions you will encounter most of the time, the corpus and the grineer. there are others as well that can be encountered on certain planet missions to invasion events to crafting keys to access areas not normally open without the right materials. but, it is not just the game that makes it fun. it is also the development team that is behind it and they have been very supportive of the community and very fast to make fixes whenever there are problems. i remember when there was an issue with being unable to connect to the server some time ago and i honestly expected to be off for several days and maybe even weeks. they fixed the issue in hours. not only are they fast, they also do their best to keep in close contact with the player base. the only major downside i would say are some of the fellow players who can be rather entitled at times when it comes to demanding for this or demanding for that. but, that naturally comes with a large community. the higher the population base, the higher the statistical chance of encountering the less than pleasant members of society. still, i highly recommend the game and who knows? i might even encounter you. cheers and happy holidays to all who read this during the time of this post.",7
"great game. all kinds of variety in weapon selection and choosing a warframe to suit your playstyle, and every update adds more. occasionally has bugs, but runs much smoother than when i originally started playing. after a while the missions do get a little repetitive although new game mods are being introduced. platinum isnt a necessity in the game, although it makes things much much easier. overall, im satisfied with the 300+ hours of my life ive put into it.",4
"bit of a learning curve (not much) fun to shred noobs and spin around but apart from that, just grinding and getting the best loot possible to shred az as fast as possible. good game.",3
"immersive 3rd person shooter game for those with a ton of online/offline friends who are in to the genre. recommended!",1
"for a free to play game, its something you have to try and still probably get hooked on. its a level clearing game where you run around as a tenno, space ninja if you must, in order to liberate planets from either the infested, grineer or corpus robots. by clearing levels and objectives you level up your warframe which is your character. along with weapons and abilities. you start out with one class persay and as you clear levels you are able to obtain other classes though the forging station. along with unlocking other warframes (classes) you can unlock weapons. with weapons you can equipt modifications to them depending on the level of your weapon to make them stronger and to take on harder levels. towards the end it becomes a grind fest which can be a big downer if you are grinding alone. though the rewards for taking the time to grind out a stronger warframe, weapons and mods are something that you will be excited about and will keep on playing.",1
"this game is awesome!!! somewhat tactical as for the mods that you want to apply, nice details, large maps, cool flappy birds too! warframes have its own excellent ability and quite easy to control, so i would recommend this game. however, the 50 platinums the de give us, not much things to do with it! plus many people would not wanna buy platinums, and hacking would feel wrong... what can we do after the 50 plats have been used up? nothing, pretty much. so, maybe this could be one small downside but others than that... good game",7
"great great great game. updates bring new maps and warframes. maps bring new challenges. new game types too during an event. so much to do.. and if there are any bad updates, fixes come almost instantly. great work de!",8
"this game rocks, but the best way to know if you are going to like a game is to watch some gameplay. if you played this game when it first came out, you need to play this game agian, check out the new and improved warframe.",1
"a free to play destiny with some major difference. thats all folks",1

"- this the tps online game with the most number of diffirent weapon on the world, a hugh and plentyful weapon horde is waiting for your and your friend so get in and enticement your friend. - good co-op game play cuz you need your friend choose best equipment, weapon, class ( warframe ) to finish the mission faster or for best performent. - the game play is plentyful, very much things that when i though i found them all, new things that i have never know apear, and the game is alway update, new contents are release each months or week. - one more think, you dont need to buy platinum ( in game cash,gold, special money ) to be strong, all you have to do is play and looking for item drop, and that you can trade to other people for equipments, weapons, warframe. enjoy this co-op online game",4
"epic game, superb graphics but after hours playing it gets boring onwards... the story for me is kinda dull and i cant understand wtf is happening in the story and most of the times are wasted on farming guns or leveling up.. but afterall its free only so... win-win...",1
"best free to play game ive seen. sort of like a gears of war style co-op battle arena. sadly, it has some serious connection issues for a lot of players, including some friends of mine, making it iffy whether you will be able to play with specific people. but since its free, theres no reason not to try.",5
"this game is so ing awsome i would pay to play it. who wants any more from a f2p game? the devs of this game are ing brilliant, they listen to the community and have made a ing tip top game. 10/10 may it only get better!",4
"warframe is all about the suit (or frame) you choose to wear, the weapons you choose to equip and hanging out with your friends or clanmates in one of the best mmo shooters to be available in years. the number of options you have with free-to-play are staggering compared to any other game i have played. the developers are always on top of hotfixes and when they arent busy fixing things, they are truly working to expand and make the game even better. it is an awesome community and i highly recommend adding this game to your permanent library.",5
"i love the game, its a good game to tap your hands on when you are bores and your hand is on the mouse going up and down. sometimes its pretty annoying but the game is good, i like the graphics, the physx, the art everything. you really neeed to give it a try, but i will add it does not make sense but, its worth giving a try. ill give it the rate of 3/5. im just saying my own no hard feelings bra and steam members please let us broadcast our games",1
"great game. bit grindy and repetitive if you want to get new stuff and like in every mmo theres fun endgame content. however, llike in every mmo, id take a break after finishing all the endgame content a few times since id want to play something new.",7
"i have played this game since day one of open beta. the only issue is that it can be boring if you dont like the system it has for leveling your gear. i highly recomend it for anyone who enjoys a fast paced action game, just give it a shot!",1

"shot a nail and a robots helmet came off, it didnt die. 1000/5 is how many morphics you want to have in this game to craft all the weapons from the blueprints you get.",1
"probably one of the best free to play titles ive ever played, everything that is not a cosmetic item is available through gameplay and the best items are only available through farming. the gameplay is fast, parkour, ninja action; with a variaty of different game modes and characters available to change your style of play. if you like sci-fi, co-op shooters, with space ninjas give warframe a try. it does have a bit of a learning curve, but general chat is pretty friendly and there are enough videos on youtube to fill you in on what you dont know.",5
"its a good game had to rebind some keys and most of my time in the game was spent yelling join my clan at random strangers",1
"parkour, ninjas, and cool powers what more could a narrator ask for? 10/10 would observe the rhino in its natural habitat.",7
"this game turned me into a farmer with a nice corn grinder as that is all",2
"amazing game, brings 3rd person shooters to a new level! lots of customization and replayability, no real storyline and better to play with friends. a viable warframe (class) for every playstyle with the ability to customize your stats with mods. would rate a solid 8.5/10",5
"pros: - unique, fresh new look into the f2p genre - amazingly easy to learn controls yet complicated at the same time - a true progression system that makes you feel like you accomplished something (mastery rank, individual rank) - variety between weapons and warframes - great supportive community - some of the best gameplay i have experienced in a f2p game to date - no bad warframes - looks beautiful, graphic and environmentally speaking cons: - becomes a grindfest early and mid game - missions are mostly all the same type of objectives and enemies - waiting times on crafting is immense - two kinds of players: super fast and super slow. ruins the game between waiting and catching up - getting new things in the begining can be super hard the game shines its brightest at mid game. or close to there anyways. its a great game. 7/10. give it a try at least.",4

"i spent all my premium currency best game ever 10/10 would bang",1
"in all seriousness - this game is what destiny could have been if it actually made use of the money it charged people and had some balls. you have the entire solar system to explore. maps are randomly generated. enemies are interesting. missions are varied. dynamic events occur. and you have two tons of ranged weapons, melee weapons, mods, gear and so, so, so much more. if theres one criticism, is that the game can be harsh on newbies. not because its hard - its simply somewhat unwelcoming. a lot of things arent explained, and the game a bit too often hints that things can be purchased through the premium currency. dont be folled! almost everything can be bought with regular credits earned by playing or crafted through materials (also earned through playing). if you like the game, you should support it (i did), but at the start those platinum prices can be a bit disconcerting.",3

"great game if you like to grind and work for items. great free to play system as well.",1
"this game is awsome in everyway. the combat is awsome with many ways to kill the enimes from big heavy guns to a simple small stealth weapon. the best part about this game? the mobilty-freedom. this game enables you to move like no other game. you can run up walls or across them then you can jump off and do it agian plus you learn other tricks to increase you mobility. like the game suggest your a ninja, but that doesnt mean no jet packs..... archwing is a recent update(update 15) it provides you with a jetpack that allows to move freely in space with a primary anda melee weapon to kill your enimies so get the game. the lotus is waiting for more tenno.",4
"its fun. ive played over 525 hours. its a f2p i spent money on. what better recommendation can i give? play it.",8
"this game is beyond awesome. it is completely free, not pay to win, and has many options for battle and customozation. in this game you play the tenno, and the enemy soldiers are hunting you down. you complete several missions. great maps, pvp is great, and awesome animation. play this game!",1
"fast pace game blending hack and slash with shooting and a tinge of parkour. step into the shoes of a tenno, a space ninja with an assortment of powers. define what that means. be as stealthy, as powerful, or as cooperative as you must be to fight against the remains of our solar system long after war and greed ravaged it.",3
"so far the best free to play fps i can find on steam amazing graphics actual strategy in stuff never boring cause the levels are never the same exactly. not one of those easy to beat games nor is it a impossibly hard game its just... i dont know how to say this in words",2
"the gameplay itself is very smooth, with combat and objective-completion meshing seamlessly. for those who like mission-style gameplay, the map and world progression are well-paced. stealth gameplay is not as overpowered as in other similar games, with tanking and dps being equally viable.",2
"even though this game is extemely boring, takes forever to accomplish things, derives you from your money. its still a pretty fun game once you are at a high sequence in the game.",1
"this game is the most fun game i have played in a wile. i recomend this to any one who enjoys a saints row feel and a space shooter mix.",2
"where do i begin with this game? its mechanics are fantastic, its fast paced third person shooter goodness, it looks good and plays good at the same time. sometimes there are little bugs but im pretty sure its still in beta so i forgive them. its still a whole lot of fun!!",4

"its so awsome for a free game. the graphic are so sweet and the animation too.",1
"warframe is a sci-fi ninja action game. it gives you the thrill of a assassins creed and futuristic starwars skill game. in my opinion it is awesome. there are added features of character customisation and special abilities that you can use to over power you oponent. it also has an exiting speed up multiplayer feature where you and some friends can complete levels together.",1
"love this game never gets boring awsome graphics and epic gameplay love it and best of all its free. if you like fps games then this is a definite try this game should be one of the greats in mmorpg games its amazing from its intriging gameplay and mod customizations the possibilities are endless in the way you can crush you foes with your primary, seconday and melee weapons is defintly one of the best games ive played so far. this far surpasses other games such as skyrim, final fantasy and many others hope this was helpful to all who wish to play have fun",3
"i have no words to describe how frickin awesome this game is!!!!!!!!! a must play game for a fan of the sci fi genre!!!!!",1
"can someone please help me i got a ultimate game card and when i enter the number in the promo box it said its invailed also when i cant see any other way to enter it because the only box i see is the steam box with the options for 3.99 ect, please someone help...",1
"crazy fun shooter with rpg background. lots of upgrades, guild system etc...",1
"in this game, youre a badass space ninja doing badass space ninja things who has guns. 10/10 its k i guess -ign",1
"extremely well done for a hack an slash. would be nice if they add a pvp feature or expand on map layouts, but given its beta status, im quite happy with where its at right now. even spent money on it :o thumbs up for sure!",2
"a game about space ninjas killing decaying clones and corportae , whats not to like? also, did i mention that the different warframes (characters) can  up  in alot of different ways? well, now you know.",4
"my review of this game is it is just awsome and i would recoment it to every one",1
"for a f2p this game is legen-wait for it-dairy. warframe has fantastic graphics with an excellent third person over the shoulder combat view remaniscant of mass effect, granted there is no cover system not that it is need with the fast paced action death machines the player inhabbits. sum this game in one word......... awesoooooooooooome.",5
"you can steath be a brusier or just be a flat out sorcerer",4
"amazing! why is this free to play?!?! oh well, thank you warframe developers for being soooo amazing makeing such a game! its exactly what i wanted in a game! dungen crawling to an extent and then missions with customable powers and characters in a perfect 3d effects land of bad  guns and gorez!",1
"warframe is a great game with alot of different yet intersting classes to play as. the level based nature of the game makes you feel proud once youve beaten a hard boss or created a new warframe. it does a great job of balancing the ability to make things in the game versus buying them. the game is also graphically impressive, yet not intense on your system, making it perfrect for almost anyone. 10/10",7
"ninjas + space/sci-fi + epic weapons + magic powers + zombies + robots + cyborgs + explosions + a ton of gamemodes = ing amazing, gg, de (digital extremes), whoo!",8
"a cross between monster hunter, tenchu, left 4 dead and halo. brilliant!",1
"this game is by far one of the best games ive ever played. it can be hard to start playing, but once you get past that, its the most action packed and intense game. with different variants of powers, weapons and movement, this game could easily consume hundreds hours of your life.",10
"fun game if you like doing backflips, wall climbing, and lots of par-core. on top of a space shooter. so basicly your a freaking space ninja!!!",2
"if you enjoy tps or fps or basically any shooter with amazing graphics, skills, mods, etc play this. i played this since closed beta and its amazing. they continue to add more improvements and the game itself is beautiful. you can unlock basically everything through experience and effort. you dont have to cash out to get powerful weapons or mods. play this damn game! oh and the staff are awesome as well!",1
"love this game really one of the best free to play games out there",3
"this game is pretty good for a beta pros: -awesome feel. -cool guns and an exellent gun mod system. -clans are a nice touch. -nice graphics. -fun with friends -constant epic updates cons: -grinding in very common -gets boring after along while 8/10",1
"one of the best free-to-play coop games ive played in awhile.",1
"-- farming simulator 2020 -- its free and it will ruin your life. 10/10 would ruin my life again.",9
"warframe is a free game to play with your friends and makes you feel like a ninja (if you want ninja weapons...). playing alone is enjoyable, playing with friends is more enjoyable as with most games and it is a game that you select your class, level up, and upgrade your weapons. cant forget the premium weapons and  which make you feel like you are weak, behind in the game, or you just want to buy them because they look nice. nice graphics, not too crazy to run this game, and pretty basic controls. i give this game 7.5/10",1
"warframe is a very fun game of shooting and melee all the way, show us some tenno pride! plus, its free!",10
"got in a game a minute later* mission accomplished",1
"please sit down and relax, this will be a very long read: this is a very good game.",4
"tried to play a mission, crashed. tried to send a bug report after the game crashed, the program to send the report crashed aswell. 10/10 would crash bandicoon again",1
"one of the best free-to-play games on steam, very good graphics, nice gameplay, awesome story (but not read by most players). tl;dr: space ninja simulator",2
"10/10 would grind again seriously. the game is good. really good. but there is too much grinding, too much. i cannot take it anymore. actually, i can... so lets head back to grinding, shall we? oh and space ninjas are freaking awesome.",2
"well to me currently warframe is a really fun and addicting game they always have a frequent updates and new stuff just keeps being added and there is always something for you to do no matter what your doing",1
"i was loving this game when i was able to play it. until i was unreasonably banned for something i dont know as i did nothing wrong. other than that i will say it is an addicting game and is not a pay2win, but a pay2play as it does not require you to buy anything. but i have to give a bad ratingdue to being banned for no reason. if you have space and can run it get it and try it out.",1
"man this game is just mindblowing, what happern if you add ninja and space, youll get warframe, play it and belive it, its yours, tenno",1
"be ready to grind! im ready to grind. are you? its good grinding though. like the kind you would expect from a passionate woman.",1
"for a free game this is a lot of fun. pretty straightforward, easy controls, and can pass a lot of time!",1
"jack todd zig, and everyone else should play this game with me.",3
"space + ninjas + awesome weapons + awesome frames = awesome game... worth the free download!",7
"ive only been into this game for a day now, but, iam hooked. it is very fun.",1
"a great 3rd person ninja simulator. a diverse range of weapons and abilities. only problem is it acts much like an ipad or iphone game in the aspect of pay platinum to rush build this!, however, the addition of trading lessens that to an extent.",2
"its good. i tested it over a year before release. top notch free pve. try it! -zenmaster.",1
"this game is very ambitious, but whats great about this game is that it delivers. this game always comes up with a huge update, it offers a new content at least twice a year. it is impressive",7
"warframe, a game in which you are farming more than you do on farming simulator. 10/10",2
"omg why i dont know this awesome game from a long time my friend recomeded this for me and i sayed it will be just like others but now this game is the #1 in my game list ps : i am a youtuber with 120 subs i need someone with skype to make a video on this awsome game ps #2 : sorry for my bad english i am french lol",1
"great co-op game, i love playing it with my friends, it kinda gets boring playing by yourself, a great third person shooter. i recommend it.",1
"the new updates are really f*cking glitchy, but i still recommend it....",2
"ok game. graphics r good, gameplay and controls are good....way way too many updates..so far every time i open the game it finds new in game updates i have to download to play. other than that pretty good....be warned!!!!!! this game deletes itself from your pc when u backup it!!!! so be careful!",1
"good game, kind of boring in the first tries but when you play it long, youll discover its good as a bacon and a donut",3
"its an extremely fun game it just needs to work on the loading for the levels thats all but i recommend the game",1
"good game for evenings. it is kinda boring for me because we have to farm a lot, which is in my opinion boring. i recommend it for the gamers, who loves completing levels again and again, to get some materials ;p",1
"one of the best game i ever played. at first it doesnt look fun but afther you take some time to learn about the warframes, weapons , crafting and so you will realize that it is an awesome game and the best part it is free!",4
"warframe is a very good and addictive game, you will spend a lot of time on it. the game also get updated very frequently with more and more things for you to do with your friends or simply other players around the world, it is a very good game in my opinion because it is not a pay to win game. give it a try if you like coop games :d",1
"super ultra flying sci-fi future ninjas in space say woot",1
"get your grinding boots on because its gonna be rough. in all seriousness though, as far as f2p games go this is by far one of the best ive ever played. the grinding for items does get annoying but if you have friends to help you out the game is amazing. its free so give it a go, you have nothing to lose.",3
"people i have a live i play only two hours whats the big deal and im happy with the starter weapons i have collecteed so much money",4
"this game is amazing in some respects. it has a depth that you rarely see in a hack and slash / shooter and the gunplay is unique in its own right. the monetization is also very fair. that said the game after long enough starts to fade into repetition, bosses are recycled, levels seem hard to diffrientiate from one another and so forth. my main issue though with this game is that the possibility to extend playtime is there. in fact the levels are already built but the game cordens them off until you unlock a certain type of 1 use key.",1
"amazing free-to-play that requires no money to unlock everything (at the time of this recommendation)",3
"im just gonna be simple with this: no pay to win at all, there is a lot of maps that are also randomly generated and you can have a clan with your friends too in which you can create a dojo to duel in, research weapons and do much more. there is a trading system in which you can get platinum (basically spacebucks so you dont have to buy it rather just trade rare items for it). its mostly a pve game but pvp is fun too although with bad hosts it can suck a bit. in the end you are a space ninja that can wallrun, use crazy abilties and be badass.",1
"awesome game, its suuuuuper fun. my only bad point here is that its kinda pay-to-win. this is a free game, so they have to get money somehow, but the major currency really isnt obtainable without real money.",3
"you can cut people in half ever since the beta. you know its good 9/10 a bit too much grinding",1
"yes please... dont wonder if this game is any good... just play it.. a lot... 3rd person shooter action with wall climbing, super jumping, melee weapon action... its so good.. youll wonder why you dont even have to pay for it!!!!! awesome new quests to get you started and introduce you to the game make it even sweeter for new players, your upgradable space ship is an awesome between mission base and gives a nice home to the various non mission activities such as crafting, modifications and research. tldr: just do it!!!!!! nuff said",2
"space ninjas, need i say more? ive been playing this for nearly two years and still love love love it. your start will be pretty slow and without potatoes and good ranked up mods in your gear, youll be kinda weak. however, when you become powerful and have a squad to play with, this game really shines. if youre looking for a free to play game to sink alot of time into, this is it.",5
"game is by far, one of the most amazing games i have played.. in years....fluid from gun combat, to melee, then the big bada boom! abilities and custom variety for your very own warfarme. grand...simply grand!",3
"i first played this game when i was in high school, i was just looking for a new free game then and i found something thatll get me hooked really good... as a returning old player ive never seen such awesome improvements in such a short span of time. good to play with solo... better with a team of friends.",1
"warframe, definitely one of my all-time favourite games. the graphics are awesome, comparable to those of next-gen console games. with almost 200 hours on record and at least spent $100 on in-game currency. of course, one of my biggest problems with this game is that the farming takes soooo long! if you want to get some of the higher end stuff, then youre going to need a lot of time on hand. and i mean a lot!",2
"waframe is a fun and a bad game its cuz of the movement its fun cuz of how much stuff u can do",1
"just got game go to options turn on fullscreen game has blackscreen cant see a thing stops trying to make it work 100/10 gg gaben plez",1
"warframe is worth your time to play, that i can guarantee. grinding game but still worth the shot, you can gets, builds and achives",9
"you see in the game from weapons, warframes (characters), sentinels, pets and other cool stuffs. the only character and weapons you cant get is the excalibur prime, lato prime & skana prime - cuz its a game founders items. other sci-fi / fantasy themed game can never be better than this game. unique art style that will blow your mind the moment you see it, very good and detailed background storyline that is also stick along with the in-game living universe. new contents and updates every month thats always get you hype and surprise you all the time. the game focused on co-op pve hack & slash things rather than pvp but its still have some good competitive pvp mode like clan vs clan or alliance vs alliance... let just stop right here, youve to play and feel the game yourself, words mean nothing in this game. and one last thing, warframe devs always care about the community just like valve did, theyd ask you how you feel, how you doing, what is going on, what do you want in the next update, do you have any problem while playing... and so so on, they really care about you, they do, same goes for the community itself, good people everywhere will help you noobs if you get stuck somewhere or dont know this or that. just play the game and you will be in love with it.",1
"one of the best indie games youll find. love it in nearly every way.",2
"this is a beautiful looking game and the gameplay is ok but it falls with almost everything having to be bought with money.",1
"pros: + maneuvers and parkour. + straightforward combat. + large variety of weapons, suits and game modes. cons - story isnt prevalent. - very repetetive. - recycled levels.",1
"its fun for a while, but the connections are so horrible they made me quit.",3
"highly recomanded u can play without playing anything 90% of the weapons and items are craftable that means no p2w bs it looks amazing trust me u can have tons of fun playing this game",4
"this game is great, you can pin people to walls with a bow, and chop arms off with a staff.",1
"havent played much, but being a space ninja killing stuff is a whole lot of fun!",1
"you need to spend about 15 to get the full experience but it is a good game! it needs to let people increase their inventory space through gameplay!",1
"after playing vigorously for over 100 hours, i still find this game addicting there are many challenges and multiple experiences to be had, sharing it with online people or your friends and family. there are plenty of game play options to tinker with. i enjoy being a tenno space ninja! and i will continue to be one! lol",3
"this game is amazing if you a decent asus or alienware or w/e the graphics are pretty sweet. 10/10.",1
"if you play this game, pre-emptively realize that theres a cash shop. then, pack that thought in the back of your mind and play the game for the fun grind. 8/10, would play.",3
"when sign up i log in in the launcher but it says my login failed but when i watch people play it id give it a 7/10",1
"the greatest ninja simulator ever! and something about great mmo. but ninjas!",1
"grinding simulator 2015 11/10 like skyrim with space guns",1
"space ninjas. need i say more? true f2p unless youre impatient. good coop shooter.",1
"a bit grindy, but to be expected from free to play. never felt it needed to spend money to have fun, but have done so just to support the company for doing free to play right! brilliantly good fun co-op space ninjas with frequent updates. what more would a boy ask for?",1
"awesome game for something that is free. after a while of playing i did not mind purchasing platnium, something i never do liked free feel of the environment, maps and futuristic/ sci fi concept easy to join other players on missions daily missions weapons easy to play great for a casual fps disliked lack of weapon slots and weapons you can use as you have to upgrade mods and the weapons. maybe would of been one of the best games if the game was sold for $60 and you had access to everything",2
"warframe is a fantastic game if you like ninjas and space. you are able to sneak around albeit difficult and shoot and slash your way through corpus (robot-looking guys) and grineer (ugly looking mugs). you get a dojo if you join a clan (guild in other terms) and decorate and play with your friends and allies. you also get a most of the time funny companion on your ship. warning you may need a good pc, i can play with it on my laptop i just recieve a little bit of lag during the missions on snowy planets. otherwise its fantastic even for a free-to-play game.",1
"space robot ninjas fighting dirty racist illuminati trade federation mercenaries clones with zombies using swords and guns and bows and stuff. highly recommended",10
"ever wanted to be a ninja? ever wanted to fight stuff in space? ever wanted to do both at the same time? if so then warframe is the perfect game fore you. a massive variety of weapons, gamemodes, areas, enemys and charecters means that youll still be playing warframe years form when you starte. combine that with weekly updates and youve got the game that just keeps getting better. hope to see you in the starchart tenno.",1
"i have a right to review this with the amount of hours ive had on this game.... it was a fantastic experience, but its easy to get a mod maxed and just 1 shot everything.so no end game... i would download and play but dont spent loads of platnium like i did, spent your money on another game. $150 for max prime pack...  off d.e",6
"parkour simulator 2014 -fun gameplay -occasional difficulty spikes -have to pay for colors",4
"a lot of fun, theres a learning curve but if you have the patience to push through the early content, it gets really really good.",4
"very recommended! one of the best f2p and online hack and slash games ive ever played. its free, try it out! you dont have anything to lose.",1
"i think other than the fact that after the mesa update that i got glitched and cant connect to others.warframe is a very great third person shooter thats free. get it now youll be glad ya did.",7
"i totally recommend this game it can be very addicting and if you want i can help run through some of the basic missions but i am not that good myself but im something alright",1
"best free to play game ive seen. sort of like a gears of war style co-op battle arena. sadly, it has some serious connection issues for a lot of players, including some friends of mine, making it iffy whether you will be able to play with specific people. but since its free, theres no reason not to try.",5
"very time consuming, gets repetative after awhile. fairly fun though looks very beautiful, its nice that you can get things without paying real money for them it just takes more time and resources.",1
"this game is absolutely fun, if you want to feel like a badass ninja bouncing off wall and rolling toward your enemies and kill them with a single slice with a katana! this game is for you, many choices of weapon and type of ninja. very cool",1
"this game gives you high mobility,and a huge arsenal of wepons.also there are tons of mods that make it so no one is the same.",2
"not many games i get addicted to, but with the constant updates it just keeps getting better and better!",8
"ninjas in space!. whats not to love, 11/10 what are you doing still reading this review. go! shoo!",1
"baest f2p game ever!!!!!!!! try it out and add me (deadlya) :dddd",8
"if you enjoyed the me3 multiplayer you will fall in love with this.",6
"it is an awsome game have already recommend this game to several of my friends and they too have loved it and i believe told some of their other friends. i would give it a 98/100(the game play and graphics are just amazing).",1
"space ninjas coptering and shooting everything they see tenno with penta/ogris getting mirage and using hall of mirrors. discussions on region chat that have nothing to do with the game even though its a f2p game,you dont have to waste 8 months to get a single weapon tons of weapons and warframes to try out you can learn russian if you have the luck of getting into a russian squad . . . . . . . 10/10 would at least try the game",4
"you are a ninja, and you are in the space. aint nobody got time fo dat~",1
"this game is awfull and the grinding is too much... played for 1 month didnt unlock anything new + the levels are repetetive same ing thing everytime.",1
"i love this game becuase it has everything i enjoy from a game. it has a way to do a very stealthy run through, or just take a blade and gun and run through everybody like they are nothing. plus the fact that it was free is why i cant stop playing this game. i only have complaint. i have a mac laptop now and one of the first things i planned to do was download steam and get warframe. here is where my complaint comes in. i had spent my time playing this great game so when i got this better computer, i planned on keep playing... but i cant because it isnt available for apple computers. i dont know if this is because the game is so high quality that it cant run on this system, but i am hoping that is not the case. if there was any possible way that the game devs could make this gem of a game run and play well on a mac. i would download it and play it immedietly.",1
"the game is amazing i have it for my ps4 but its to heavy for my laptop so i guess ill stick to console warframe",1
"very bad very very bad no update server failed update!!",1
"this game is beautiful, no doubt, and is really fun for a couple of hours. the problem is that this is a typical grind-to-win type of game. its extremely repetitive and addicting. there are way more interesting and simply... better games to invest time on than this. trust me. ask me.",1
"amazing graphics for a free to play and gameplay is good. one flaw it is bound to throw you when you tri to climb walls",1
"this game in my opinion is one of the best free to play games out there. it is always changing and becoming better as it does. i would compare warframe to destiny, they are very alike games, lots of customisation, lots of fun game modes, things to find, things to unlock and money to earn. if you like destiny then youll love this.",2
"this is a very fun game because you can play this game as a lone wolf who will level up faster or you can play with friends which will make it easier. they are perks to bolth sides and i prefer to do the lone wolf tactic. the fighting in this game is amazing but sometimes i wish it was not as hard to find the crafting materials so you can get better weapons and suits. overal though great game that i love to play in my free time.",1
"this is a true free to play game. it might be harsh to newcomers but once you get past that you will be stuck to this game like glue. so i warn you now dont play this game if you have a life!! i mean look am my hours.....",8
"like ninjas with guns? well this is ninjas with guns in space! the game is based entirely on how overpowered you can get, whether you augment your warframe, modify and max out your weapons, or go ballistic with your melee of choice. gameplay is varying on how you wish to play and there are dozens of warframes for them. however, its good to keep in mind that you may find yourself doing a lot of grinding and looting for the rarer materials to build said warframes. maps can get repetitive, but helps you remember where loot can be found. you either have to go through a lot of grinding to get materials and credits to forge new gear, with can get boring when playing alone. biggest issue, though, is the drastic difficulty curve. one moment, youre dominating every grineer, corpus, and infested you come across. next thing you know, youre flattened by the next planets enemies. id recommend this game, but definitely if you have someone to play with. relying on matchmaking usually ends up with total strangers much stronger than you, noobs who dont know what to do so you constantly have to revive them, or soloing witht the chance of losing all your revives. basically, i recommend you make some friends or meet your ends.",4
"great graphics, addictive gameplay, but... the annoying glitches are everywhere which make me fall through the map!! needs a bit more bug fixes rather than constant updates on new weapons and warframes. but overall a great game!",1
"this game is exspensive to play but a heck of alot of fun and there are alot of serious guilds",2
"personally i would have to say that the game is decent enough, but i advise people to game with friends when they can as some (not all) of the community is more me minded then we minded when it comes to missions, and often you will be left behind or just ignored in mission by these people. however when you do find people that are good players that work together and as a team even with strangers then you will ahve quite a great time as the game really shines when players work together and you can get some rather cinimatic moments when that happenes, so its quite the mixed bag. all in all i would reccomend but with a flag of caution.",1
"this is the best game so far,good graphic, good game play,and f2p!now im addicted....someone help me",2
"this game is one of best free 2 play games out on the market. are you considering to download it? do it, you will not regret! its best to play with friends in a squad but if youre fast learner you can win entire maps by yourself ;)",1
"really fun. worth downloading and giving a try if still on the fence.",3
"this is a really fun and interesting 3rd person shooter. the game is quite beautiful, bringing the player to a host of different planets with varying scenery. the gameplay is tough, but fun. although the mechanics are lacking in some ways. the aim assist function helps keep the player locked to a target, but only to a point, this gets especially hard to manage when facing flying enemies, for the aim assist only loosely locks to the target, and when locked, the aim is tough to unlock. i found that in the simulator, that i was failing most of the time, due to the shielding enemies flying around so much that i cant hit them. on top of that, the shields they grant to their allies are too overpowered, with a bow, the player must hit the enemies head three times in a row to get the kill. this makes it not worth trying to kill the enemy over the support drone flying above them. i think that with some good tweaking and nerfing of some enemies, and the complete elimination of the defense missions (they pretty much suck every bit of fun out of this game, which is running, gunning, and slashing, there isnt much of that when there are hordes of enemies converging on you to kill a very fragile piece of equipment)",1
"its a good game dont get me wrong but.... its not for everyone.... you will jump in and enjoy it for like the first 6 missions but then you realize how much damn grinding there is and then how tedious and boring it actually gets... graphics=10 voice acting=8.7 gameplay=6.2 mechanics=7.6 overall worth value .play this if there is like literally nothing at all to play.",1
"a fairly repetitive game, but it leaves you wanting more.",1
"its a free2play cooperative 3rd person space ninja simulator with a fair business model and flashy graphics. can get a wee bit repetitive.",4
"when i try to open this game it keeps on crashing why?",1
"great game good for people who like games such as assassins creed and mass effect could use work on in game money stuff rather then real monney stuff in game but over fun game should give it a shot",1
"vas:have i every told you the deffition of warframe? its doing the same mission over and over and over again.",1
"this game to damn god, third person shooter with parkour gameplay, the character or warframes so badass, u can choose ur gameplay, for example :, u can choose stealth gameplay , or hardcore with u r friend. this game is so interesting. 8.7/10",1
"what the hell last minutes u come to update after i get the alert mission reward vigor ,u just send a message that update come my progress cannot save .how come like this",8
"man is this game addicting! whats even better is that everything bought with real money can also be farmed and crafted without it, you can also trade for platinum (real money currency).",2

"i do really like this game. everytime i am playing warframe it reminds me of mass effect. you can explore the galaxy, customize and craft new weapons, change their look as well, get some new powers, team up with friends and kick some asses togheter. theres also a pvp but i havent tried it yet. the graphics are awesome, much better than in any other f2p game.",1
"not personally my sort of game, but its a really cool game if you love a bit of action and sci-fi :3",1
"free game that surpasses all paid. best game ive ever played to date. recommend to everyone.",7

"valkyr can control when she goes on her period, 11/10",2
"great game..but the grinding rule in this game sometimes makes the game become boring. this game is user friendly and newbie friendly..free to play is great and hope many others can join this space ninja thing!!",4
"a lot better than i thought it would be. it has some pretty simple set ups that are pretty addicting. there are even events that rely more on what set of enemies youre facing. even has a blueprint system with world reliant drops for the ingrediants. so far i havent seen anything requiring the cash only platinum credits that doesnt look like it can be earned from the market other than more superficial bits like costumes, colors and avatars",1

"run arround, shoot dudes, spend hours making for yourself fabulouuuuus, annoy your friends, set off trip-lasers, get stuck in walls, fall off the map like a double ended portal drop, and so much moooore. this game offers a huge variety of stuff to choose from and develop how you play and what you want to play. pretty much all the gear is equally viable to get the job done /well i mean braton-mk1 is total trash compared to say soma or karak but ya get my point/ as well as provide an ample chance to see if you like that weapon style or not. you can play through this game totally free, its really just buy plats to save time, like how reactors and catalysts are only aviable every other friday or you could buy a couple for some plats(p2p stuff). theres plenty of missions, alerts, events and the devs are really dedicated to keeping warframe so to speak a living thing constantly evolving and changing. in the few years ive on off played it, its changed enough times for me be baffled between hiatuses. hell today the big up.15 (time of writing) came out and left me quite suprised at all the changes. so id really reccomend this if you like 3rd person shooters with a fast pace, giant variety, and a pretty interesting community.",8
"never played it... everyones giving it a thumbs so... why shouldnt i?",1
"completely amazing. not only does it have quite a unique feel and game-play aspect, but this game has one of those no need for story to be awesome feelings. probably the best 3rd person mmo out there.",1
"warframe provides an easy to learn, third person shooter with some minor roleplaying abilities. the game excels at providing quick missions to pass the time, or longer missions with a squad to level and grab new gear. the game centers around tenno, an elite group of warriors. these warriors are masters with several types of weapons, such as assault rifles, shotguns, lasers, or poison blob launchers. however, it can also be effectively played with the melee weapons in the game; they range from large axes and hammers, to dual wielded daggers and specialty items. overall, the game is quite an enjoyable experience. the main drawback is the time it takes to build items. a new warframe, which is similar to classes in other games, will generally take ~3.5 days to build, unless platinum is spent on it (the purchaseable in-game currency). with patience, and plenty of weapons, there are many bad guys to exterminate while waiting.",3

"i had seen warframe for a while, but judging purely based on appearance, i never gave it a chance. being bored a few days ago, i decided to give it a shot. space ninjas. what could be the harm?. now im hooked. the controls take a little to get used to (im still trying to find a better key to swap my weapons), but graphics are great, the story isnt even that bad. you can run through each mission solo, with a buddy, or grab a random and hope they dont steal all the loot boxes.",1

"great ftp 3rd person shooter mmo. 7/10 cons: you need a good graphics card to get any kind of fps. your inventory is incredibly limited without paying, and theres no way around it. very arbitrary. cash shop is pay to shortcut progression and playtime rather than pure cosmetic. ingame documentation on the usage of cards and crafting materials is somewhat limited. pros: graphics are great unique shooter moblity progression crafting guilds cash shop items are craftable/farmable for the most part. updates are frequent. better to try than to not try. save your free money store cash for warframe slots. feel free to add me on your ingame friends list ughzug",6
"ive been playing since u7. all i can say is: for an f2p game, its pretty solid. constant updates, devs listening to the community [with devstream that giveaway in-game currency] and overall a generally fun game. the only problem right now is that its pretty much in an eternal beta state, where its not fully complete yet, but its already feeling pretty full. as a long-time veteran, id just say we need more lore. otherwise, its all good. except the fact that its pretty damn grindy. that can be a turn off for people. well, all weapons, mods, and frames can be grabbed for free through crafting and grinding of credits and resources. otherwise, its pretty much a pay to get cool cosmetics, and the latest stuff faster. platinum, the in-game currency that you can buy with real money, can also be grabbed by selling rare mods, prime warframe blueprints, and other special stuff. basically, it means that even if youre a free player, you can literally get everything if you have the time. as for the power creep, there is some, but not really a lot as its more on the skill and time spent by the player that determines how powerful one is. tl;dr: iz preety gud game. try it out doods.",2
"this game gets off to a truly awesome start, but then it takes pay to win to a whole new level. sure, its free to play... if you never want to actually get anywhere. i suppose the designers felt that the combination of frustration with the temtping shiny things theyre always shoving in my face would get me to spend money. instead, it got me to uninstall the game. shame, really. this game did things i havent seen anywhere else, and had the potential to be something truly special, if only the developers had either gone full subscription or at least made it possible to really play without hemmorhaging money left and right.",1

"do you recommend this game? hell yes. after 300-400 hours of total play time, ill still recommend it to anyone, especially if theyre asking any good action games? its about 4 dudes in guyver-esque suit with space magic, gun blazing, explosions, stuff cut into pieces, killing space nazis, space corporate workers, and space zerg-like...thing... oh, and youre guided by lotus, the woman inside your head that telling you to do stuff (not to be mistaken with schizophrenia) edit: after recent update i have to add things. and this game has 2 mini games (3 if you count hacking as a mini game). first, digimon tamagotchi, where you raise your kubrow, pet it, play with it, and take it to your battlefield where he will kick everyones  as good as you. second, recent update (u15) is zone of the enders, where your frame will be equipped with fancy pair of space wings (archwing, they call it), you fly with it, and shoot some more baddies in space, like literally, in the space. the wings even has guns and sword, so yeah, zone of the enders. 3 games in a game. thats, ladies and gentlemen, how to please your fanbase.",5

"immersive and constantly developing game. experiencing this may make you remember mass effect at its full glory with some little but really fun and additions. in this game everyone will find something they thrive for, want to be an aegis of your team that breaks through waves of enemies? go for it! want to be a sneaky trickster or a lighting? that is also available to you. through my more than year long experience in this game i found myself never tired of this game as there is always something more to explore.",9
"its really fun but after youve dsicovered every feature, the gameplay gets repetative and all you do is grind for new weapons that are fun, and once you use that new weapon for so long it gets boring. since they are constantly updating the game since it is in beta, it has alot of potential to be some sort of rpg and if they created a story based off of the warframe universe, i think it would make the game a whole lot more.",3
"this game, as every other game in steam, was created in true korea, so i recommend it. death to all who oppose us",1
"honestly, one of the best ftp/rpg/online game i have played... space ninja! {x,o",6

"this is basically pay to win, with all the limitations to inventory, weapons and warframes for you to use. despite that, the mechanics dont necessarily mean that it punished f2p people. all items can be gained in time,all warframes are easy to acquire if you got time and the mechanics and free updates are sweet. slightly repetative, but new updates ensure that we wont necessarily be bored with it for a long time. not for everyone, but i recommend this for people who like something new and fresh.",8
"its a great game but it kinda gets really repetative",1
"on this monumentous hour which steam should have given me an award for ill have a smoke and reflect on four hundred twenty hours of third person shooting with a curvy alien ninjas shooting the different types of enemies and running away running like a ***** cmon shields hurry up and fill up!! even just single player im playing it onmy one day off. fun for free ninety nine!",5
"warfram seems fun, it is packed with action and gameplay mechanics are cool. if i post anything that is not true, then my only expainationion is that i only played the game for 3.1 hours. the graphics are great and the ability to take a stelth approach or a action approach is quite supported by me. being able to fuse mods is becoming useful and the color options for your weapons adds some costumization to the game, although, so far i have not been able to change the color of my charactor and end up meeting color palette swapped players. another compaint is that at the begining, everything is very easy, perhaps making it a little more challanging would increase my intrest in the game. and the ability my charactor has allows him to strike forward with a swing of a holographic sword, whitch to me seems overpowered because of instead doing some complex parkour, i ended up skipping across everything. overall warframe is a good game so far and is gonna have some improvements. so if anything in this review is off, then remember that this game is in beta and ive only played it for 3 hours. so please message me if you want to give me spoilers. see yah",1
"have you ever wanted to be a space ninja guarding the solar system from evil and preventing the enemy from getting the upper hand? well you ,sir, have just found the right game. warframe offers the opportunity to slice, splat, shred, flatten, set fire to, electrify, melt, poison or blow up your enemy. you can grow, yes grow, your own dog that can make a pretty easy meal of anyone or anything and you can build your own clan fortress on the very edge of the system that can house up to 1000 of your fellow players or tenno as they are called. i not only like warframe because you can do all of the above but because unlike most games there are no items that you cant craft or find, so it does not force you to buy any in-game currency to get anything decent. so its good for players (like myself) that want a good game and dont want to have pay anything to get to the top of the food chain. i would extremely recomend this game! 9.5/10",6
"guys, seriously what are you doing sitting there and not playing this game!! its about guns & ninjas i mean, cmon who doesnt like that.",4
"this game is epic. you can craft thing (almost everything) and chop people in half again and again and again. you can even make new characters.",4
"why do i have 500 hours in this terrible game??? oh, because its cathartic and fun. welp. warframe is easily one of the very few f2p games that you can genuinely do in its entirety without paying a cent. starting off can be hard, though - the means of earning real-money currency in-game is not super easy.",7
"well its nice game to play with friends or yourself. but everytime the game update, a lot of bugs comes out.",3
"absolutely love this game! best free-to-play co-op mmo ive ever played. truly free. never pay-to-win. if you like ninjas, space, and being a ninja in space, this game is at least worth a shot.",6
"did blizzards overwatch interest you at all? this is a 3rd person sci-fi shooter. if i had to describe it using similar games, i would say its payday 2 mixed in the the feel of borderlands, along with a lot of parkour. fun game with friends, community is pretty decent, but at least one friend to play with is reccomended.",1
"addicting and refreshing, i love when games like this instead of generic cod type of style, you should totally get this if you are in to space ninjas that are fighting for their kin, even though theres probably millions of them lol",1
"good game, lot of fun. recruiting ninjas! sign up, suit up and help me take back the solar system in warframe! click this link to sign up for this awesome free-to-play game and well both receive cool rewards!",6
"i like everything about the game warframe, theres nothing specific its a good game i love all of it!",1

"really cool game love it lots. full of action and excitement, it draws you in for more and more",1
"once youve played one map, youve played them all. repetitive with little to no variation. brings nothing new to the table. i guess its good if youre 14 and havent yet played a hundred other games just like it.",1

"im over system requirments. but out of others reviews, experiances, and a good friend of mine - he loves it. so just from per-pressure out of all good iv seen threw youtube, hosting sites, clan sites, this, and the original web site. ill have to recommend it. it looks good and the game play looks very unqiue. = lass my computer crashes to a blue screen then reboots when i tried this game... happen to me with metro: last light as well. no idea why.",1
"tried to be a ninja. dream was crused by old man 10/10",1

"i cant tell you all how much i love warframe. its got to be one of my favorite mmos and a major timesink. this is all coming from a guy who didnt even think twice about it the first time he tried it -- i actually disliked it at first. and most of you trying it out for the first time probably will too. but youll get the urge, just like i did, to come back and play it 300 hours more. theres something so compelling about the structure of warframe. its such a simple concept -- fly in, shoot some baddies, complete the objective, fly out. rinse and repeat. yet somehow, it piques my interest. dont be turned away by that classic free to play business model. warframe isnt competetive first off, so theres no pay-to-win. you could spend hundreds of dollars buying everything in the game, but as every fan of warframe will tell you, it kills the fun. money usually goes to more aesthetic and none-essential parts of the game, or can be spent on virtually anything you might need. even then -- in game trading allows for you to obtain the currency in game that allows you to purchase these things. warframe is always changing, so its something new almost every month. theres plenty of fun to be had flying about, jumping from wall to wall and goring your foes, eviscerating any living being into 3 or 4 pieces. 8/10. worth giving a try.",4
"havent played it enough to write an in-detail review, but get this game. its awesome.",1
"i needed something to keep me busy while waiting for destiny to come out on pc. . . found it!",1
"beautiful. best graphics and never lags. reccomended for anyone how likes sci-fi.",1
"this is an amazing game 4/5 the only reason i dont like it is that u need to dedicate to it and in the beginning ur weapons suck [if u choose the wrong one] the game has a story but its not a very good one. though the gamplay makes up for that you can do pretty epic parkour and if u want more of an hack and slash instead of a third person shooter just dequip ur primary and secondary. the game may look like a complete charm at first but evantuly u realize its just farming enemies until u get better stuff leading to boredom after a long period of time. [also if u get it i dont really reccomend a kubrow if ur not extremely dedicated cuz he will die if u dont care for him. pros: epic gameplay and u can play with ur friends as much as u want. cons: bad story, wait times for items and constant farming. its a fun game with addictive attributes and i do reccomend it if u like rapidly killing enemies with a bladegun] pros: epic gameplay and u can play with ur friends as much as u want. cons: bad story, wait times for items and constant farming. its a fun game with addictive attributes and i do reccomend it if u like rapidly killing enemies with a bladegun]warframe powers",1

"this game is wonderful, go forward in the ninjas way !",1
"its fast its furious its warframe. this game is perfect for anyone who wants a si-fi ninja game! including stealth, pure war and an element of parkor.",1
"i have spent a good amount of hours in the game, and i have to admit, there are a few flaws. but what makes this game a sell for me is the frequency of the updates. they are updating constantly, creating new weapons, warframes, and levels before i even have a chance to finish the last few. and that is what gets me in this game, is that there is always something to do, and the level of depth is a bonus.",2
"this game is amazing if you love shooters it has a desteny feel to it its such a good game !!!!!",1
"its a free fully customizable third person shooter, although there are microtransactions its still optional. the game keeps regularly updating and its still officially a beta. i also like the lore, they even have a optional lore hunting game if you are interested.",2

"i love this games features but the only thing i dislike is that you cant start the account over again.",1
"to keep a long story short, the game is artistically beautiful, vastly entertaining and can provide you with hours and hours of fun while still tantalizing you to come back and keep playing. over all, i definitely give this game a 9/10 in its current state.",1
"spend my life savings on some guns and a new character... 10/10",1
"best f2p game ive played. i love the community. updates make the game better and better. weapons and customization are a little complicated but good. i love the fact that people know how long youve played the game by how you play and how strong you are, not many games do this.",1
"this is a great game, gamepla is fun, doesnt take much qork to find a matvh, its even etter to play with friends... nit, the one issue is that warframes (badicall other charecters) are extremely hard to get without using real money as you need to find individual blueprints for each piece and each cost money and resources to build, so i would recommend taking volt at the beginning as he is much more powerful than the other two. the reason i dont have is due to the fact that before volt was available it was loki, the dumbest warframe ever, as it has no offensive abilities which makes it incredibly difficult to get other warframes as you need tons of backup to survive.",1
"i like the game a lot. i have a new pc now. so now i have to redownload it. so ill rate it 8/10 -100%notign",1
"i really enjoy this game, because.... - character customization - pay2win aspect is pretty nonexistant - multiplayer is fun - stealth is optional, but awesome and makes you feel like a badass - awesome weapons - gore - fun story - hilarious robot in ship (sarcastic just like wheatley/glados from portal) and overall, its a good ninja/stealth game... did i mention its free? yeah, its fun! :d",1

"great gameplay, interface and game activity, updates add more variety to the game and have made the game overall more interesting. i would definitly recommend this game to everybody, they can have a great experience for free. watching this game develop over time has made has allowed myself to the rapid changes that take place to majorly improve the game. id rate this game close to 10/10.",8

"game has been pretty good and entertaining from the start, the past year the development has really picked up speed in my opinion and the game is starting to shine. new user interfaces that blend the separate parts of gearing up and crafting, personal ships to move from mission to mission now include customization options, nearly 200 weapons, over 20 different frames, space combat and the list goes on. liked it before, loved it recently. this game keeps pulling me back.",7
"this game... god damn. its amazingly fun to solo or with friends, if you like the hack n slash or dungeon genre then youll love this, it follows the same idea, you do missions and clear out stuff, pushing your way through hordes of enemies after enemies, youll have 3 others wholl either stealth or cover you, after that- youd continue onto the next mission. too much fun, 11/10",1

"its freemium done right. everything but cosmetics are obtainable through playing the game. as a freemium game there are wait times for when you are building things. at some times the game can be slightly grindy, however usually its still quite fun. there are lots of clans in the game that you can join and chat with the people in them. beware of the trade market, the benefit of the clans can help prevent you from getting tricked into selling something way cheaper than what is could be worth. in the end have fun",6

"great game! i think everyone should at least try this game!",1
"out of a 5 star rating, i personaly would give it a 4.5. the game is an overall fun and addictive experience and has slight bugs with input delay and acctually following what you are inputing. other than those slight glitches, the game is perfect. but all games have some sort of glitch or bug, just this one doesnt impact the gameplay. highly recomend to players looking for a either stealthy or action packed game. you get to choose.",1
"may get boring if you grind too much as it is too repetitive and it is not suited for players who are looking for more action  like paid games. i personally enjoyed this game a lot so i would recommend it to lads to love slicing dudes up and flying into space.",2
"you really cant beat this game based on quality and price!",1
"this is awesome. this is one of the best games i have played in a long time, and it is free. freee this is free how amazing. no mater what you say, this will always be a fav. just add a bit easier for people who dont always buy plat., but that is just a suggestion, you dont even need to do that. it is amazing i love it.",1
"a rapidly growing pve-based mmorpg game with epic space ninja acrobats, a ton of weapons and a variety of different classes/roles. youll find it different from a typical mmorpg (ex. wow, gw2, etc). if you prefer a more action based mmorpg with more direct controls (wasd to move, mouse to shoot/aim, basically like an fps), then this is the game for you. might be rather grindy, but honestly what kind of mmorpg does not have any form of grind? it is also not pay to win as you can achieve most (still have to buy for cosmetics and whatnot) through farming. the developers are pretty connected with the community too, which makes the community pretty invovled in the development of the game. the community itself is majorly helpful and nice, its not hard to find help from the subreddit /r/warframe or the in-game chat channel it self. highly recommend this game for people who like fast paced mmorpgs.",9
"i deeply enjoy the gameplay, being able to play with groups of players. but there is one problem bugging me this whole time ive been playing. im often the one inviting people to my games, rather than others inviting me in, which leads me to being the one always inviting them in. so the thing is, i often play with my bro alongside me.. and wed play together.. just not too frequently in the same matches now, due to one problem. me being unable to join his game, or even of those from other people, unless im going for the mission myself and am involved in the squad when i join it. you cant pick squads, and some areas are unable to be accessed cause my bro is hooked and hes of a max rank compared to me now, so he has more unlocked. and this results in this border where we stick to the lower levels if we wanted to play together. i dont know if this has occurred to anyone else but it seems to work fine for most. i just hope they fix it for me. i dont want my experience ruined cause of this.",2
"its a fun game, and i recommend it to anyone who wants to feel like a badass, fighting different kinds of enemies and unlocking new weapons and warframes. warframes are sort of like exo-skeletons that youre in. each of them have different kinds of abilities and they suit different kinds of playstyles. the developers are listening to the community and constantly adding new updates. while some warframes are considered more stronger and better than others, its still a fun game - no matter what. and hey - the worse the warframe, the harder the challenge, and the harder the challenge, the more time it requires to master it and when you master it - you know you suceeded! :)",1
"this is extremely playable (though sometimes frustrating). unless you pay in game for lots of platnum, it is actually pretty challenging. the updates have developed it quite a bit, though it is still pay-to-win. also, if you try to find them, there are plenty of glitches and bugs (the stealth in this is really stupidly easy in some ways, and impossible in others). this is a very quickly developing game, though, and they will fix those glitches eventually, i know it! the lore can go very deep, too, if you look (and make up theories). well anyway, i very much recommend this to anyone with a powerful computer (because it takes a lot to run this game).",2
"amazing game played it on every gaming device its on xbox one and i think it might be out on ps4 but the pc version cant be beat",1
"space ninjas with guns. free to play, wide range of weapons to elimate aliens. little to no story so if your going for immersion this isnt the game for you. if you like aarpgs and shooters then youll love warframe.",2
"this game is great alot of the weapons you have to buy with platinum but you still get some fun weapons to use i think some of the guns you can buy you can get from just playing anyway. <3",1
"my recomendation as a massive condition please read the review. the gameplay is fun and there are some interesting synergies between warframe power. however the sheer grind to get any new gear in this game makes it a chore to play once you get tired of the game play for whatever warframe and weapons you have. however if you do not mind excessive amounts of grinding then you will probably then you will love this game. the developers are regularlly updating it with new and interesting content. there are quests that updadte every few hours and every few weeks a large scale scriptied quest will be released. these quests also usually accompany the release of a new warframe. if you are a fan of mmorpgs and third person shooters then you will love this game since it takes the good, and a few of the bad, elements from both and combines them into one game. also for anyone that really wants to play destiny but does not want to pick up one of the new consoles you should give this game a shot.",1
"awesome graphics. nice feel. fast action. i like this game alot :)",7
"graphics are nice, gameplay is nice but i can see its going to be a bit grindy. good if youre new to fps :)",1
"its an awsome game but could you make it available for mac?",1
"as of right now i have this game for 2 weeks and i have 30 hours on it and ive dumped way too much money into ingame currency. get this game. now.",1
"i liked it, but i dont really get it. the idea sticks, but the level design just didnt click for me. they way progression works, mixed with the fact that there are little to no people at lower (?) levels makes this game confusing. maybe im just autistic. edit: after playing for 34.8 hours (and counting) after the damage 2.0 update, i get it now! i used to play warframe before, and everything was very confusing for me. this is a rather interesting game where you have to kick  as one of 200 ninja types against robots and fleshlings.",1
"ever since the mesa update, my warframe would not allow me to join any games with other people. everytime i join a game, it tells me that the  connection to the multiplayer host has been lost. all i am able to do is play games by myself. i recommend this game to eveybody but this is the only problem.",4
"awesome game!! who havent played it yet, must try!!",2
"incredily fun, great game to play with friends. the only downside is its a massive gind efore you feel good at the game, not to menion the overal comunity has gone down hill since recent patches. if you can get past the bad trading system, comunity and grinding its woth sinking 100+ hours into.",2
"i fully support this game from where it has and will be going. if the game genre is around your alley, you wont be disappointed. it has come a long way.",6
"great game, well polished, updated frequently , start tip save your free 50 starting plat to your first prime frame ( rhino p) or wep ( boltor p) those will help you imensley.",7
"a solid third-person shooter. the crafting system is fair and always makes you hungry for that next gun or warframe. it does require a beefy computer to keep it at a decent framerate (especially during those survival missions!) but its not an overly huge problem. the micro-transactions arent in your face and their prices are fairly reasonable considering you frequently recieve discounts as much as 50% off in your daily log in bonus. all in all a solid f2p co-op shooter to be the most badass warrior in the galaxy with your friends. 8/10",1
"this game is amazing! everything is good about it, execpt that there is a lot of grinding involved.",2
"hydroid is a pirate space ninja 11/10 (this is negative because i dont agree with their f2p model)",2
"very entertaining, and graphics are absolutely outstanding. range of movement is very high with only a couple exceptions. the only thing i didnt like was how you are playing the same missions over and over again. very repetitive. characters are boss- wonderful. as an artist i like this game mostly for outstanding, unique ideas and art. but if you like a game that is constantly new and exciting...dont play this, you will be dissapointed. but, if you dont mind the constant repeating missions, go for it...and remember, ninjas play free.",1
"honestly one of my favorite games. going around the universe with you friends. the best part is you can get everything for free if you really wanted too. can have a clan dojo where all the clan members meet together and chill.",1
"soooo muchhhhh lagggggggggggggggg! unless you have a great computer dont get this game. it looks awesome from the little that ive been able to play but if you cant run it whats the point?",1
"the game itself is pretty fun but really only if you have the computer thats good enough to really get it going, the only real flaw is all the waiting which sometimes gets annoying but all in all its one of the very few handfulls of free to play games that actually have content worth playing especially with friends also always has new content which is fun so far!",1
"extremely fun with friends and provides the gameplay and content that you might expect from destiny but better!",1
"hands down, best third-person-shooter ever. pros: graphics great parkour system great weapon system great npc ai system not a pay-to-win game, although paying can make things go faster cons: no cosmetics other than helmets and a few weapon skins can be obtained without spending real money not enough time to play no cash for how much grinding you do",3
"really fun game to play with friends, and some sick acrobatics to boot.",5
"will it ever be for mac???? i dont own one but my friend realy likes the game and wants to play it",5
"extremely high value game. the melee, the shooting, even the parkour are all solid. and you can enjoy them all for free. and if you really get into warframe, the cheapest payment options (around $10) will do you fine. they allow you to buy a massive number of slots  used to store equipment that you assemble over days or months of frenetic, cooperative fighting. drawbacks at the time of this review (nov 2014): new features are often unavoidably buggy, but then again, at least warframe is always updating (sometimes adding whole new mechanics!). unfortunately, warframes navigation menu still makes it impossible to quickmatch and keep the action pace up. menu and upgrade mechanics can also be underexplained  with no click-for-help option, serious players may have to visit wiki sites. review summary, great action supported by an improving development team. try warframe.",2
"the graphics on this game *.*...fantastic! love the ability to advance in levels through crafting weaponry, armory, and shield a lot to take in in the beginning but can be learned very easily game has the same concept as eso but has that sci-fi appeal likes the fact that you can play this game co-op, multi, and pvp highly recommend. 5 starts chia...addicting!",1
"this game is really fun. its a must to try with friends. 9001/100",1
"warframe is one of the most addictive games out on the market today. its mainly a co-op pve game but does have pvp in form of conclaves, small team matches. you can choose from a variety of warframes, which are powered exoskeletons with designs based on evangelion. all your weapons, sentinels, and frames are heavily customizable with many colors and addons to choose from. the game has hundreds of weapons to choose from and all are unique. it also features beautiful maps and challenging bosses. its a game that looks good even on the lower settings and has nice lighting. login rewards are also generous and sometimes you might get 40% off to even 75% off your next purchase. its not a pay-to-win game as anything you can get can be acquired in game, including platinum through trading.",4
"this is the best free game i have ever played!! :d its fun i play with friends and its just a great game",2
"1-fun game some minor glitches here and there 2-you dont really need to spend cash to get good frames/guns other fun items. (ive been told you can get everything from grinding and dont need to spend real money) 3-pvp is pretty fast paced 4-really addicting to play 5-the graphics alone are ing sexy as a muther er. 6-some of the tennos are pretty interesting to look. the people behind the tennos are genius and have taken a lot of time and effort to make some pretty unique warframes with some even stranger powers. its still alpha so its got problems like all games do and the community is really helpful.",1
"i have warframe on my xbox one as well. i really enjoy it and love the computer version as well1",1
"cool idea, but can be a bit too repetitive for my tastes.",1
"it is a good game if you like to grind for stuff :)",1
"is a very good game but i find my self getting very bored with it in between updates, the devs need to make some big game changers for the old players, but its still and amazing game and i often find my self thinking of it as a sci-fi vindictus.",8
"its good but there are usally 3 words: pay to win youll get cool warframes but whats this? u must buy more slots with money!",1
"considering how much i have played this game, i figured i should give it a possitive review. it is one of the best free games i have ever played. one of the best games i have played in general. i have spent money on this game (about $50), but i never truly needed to, i just wanted to support this great game. the community is generaly pritty good, the devs accually listen to you, generaly. there are a lot of contests and ways to get free plat, or get plat at reduced prices. everything that effects your experience can be farmed, but that gets to the one and only negative. this game is very farm intensive, which is offten not to bad (for me), but it can get pritty bad (i spent three full weeks of farming to try and get rhino prime, i got it though...). but its graphics are great, increadible customibility, and a lot of missions. you will always have something to do, theres always updates, always something new to get, to try out, to farm for. i love it.",7
"warframe is a third person shoter you play a co op campaign the campaign is super long i am not even close to finishing it the missions are super fun to play with a freind i would give this game 9/10",1
"warframe is in a league of its own not only because of how good it is now but how good it will be. everytime you look away from this game they have crazy patches and events and as such i will always recommend this game.",3
"i love this game even though i havent played it very much but one thing they should do is ad in controller support, this game, for me at least, would be so much better if you had controller support.",1
"game is awesome. i loved it. but wife got pregnant and its a bit time consuming. gotta play stuff i can pause. so no more online games awhile im affraid.",1
"do you like ninjas? do you like space? this game inexplicably has both. takes a bit of getting used to the controls and youll have to fiddle about with your keybindings to make it manageable but its super awesome if you get into it.",1
"pretty nice game to be honest. im not a huge fan of these kind of games, but this impressed me (since its free). i would give it a 9/10. why? because alot of the missions are bugged, and doors dont open when you go towards them. they are just stuck, wich results you to restarting the mission. but other than that, its a great game. gj",1
"only about 30 hours in and already i can see the future: im gonna lose my job.",1
"this game is awesome i wish that the company who makes this will make warframe first person and i love the graphics and every thing for this game",1
"this is a very good game, though it wont recongise my consle controler, its still a very good and well desined game.",2
"cant even play it so why download it, it was a waste of time.",1
"if have to rate this out of 10, ill rate it 10000/10. creative, ultra graphics, and its probably the best co-op game ive ever played.",1
"amazing game and free to play.... doesnt get any better",1
"great game, but i dont like this game update because its so huge.",1
"im adicted it takes a min to get in to and it a very grindy game but its aditing",3
"really odd game for me even thats really nice co-op, the system and the items abit hard i will give it a pass because you have alot of missons/chars!",1

"one of the ebst free to play out there. once you get a grasp of what damage and weapon works best against what enemy (and theres currently 200ish guns with more and more coming) youll enjoy it. grinding can and will be a big part of your game unless you dump money into it. and you should dump a little bit in just for more inventory slots. i really enjoy it (almost 2k hours speak for themsleves) its free to play jsut go and test it!^^",5
"awessome perfect game speed control and kicks  graphics - its deserve to pay for it and i ll pay for it :) <3",3
"played closed beta. played recently. this game changed incredibly. it has potential. still a repetetive grinding game. somewhat pay2win, but i am amazed how developers are putting work in this game. keep it up!",1
"good game. crap community. very hard to find players for all but end game run.",2
"this game is so f***ing pretty really much awesome balance (except legendary jhon prodman :d) is awesome, weapon designs are awesome, frames are f***ing ridiculously awesome, concept and lore is awesome, i just got some and prime gears are f**************(and 287  *  more) are beatiful, gameplay cannot be better in a tps game, bosses are really good and colourful (literally), clan system is petter then just every rpg game(we have a ghost clan with my irl friends),new coming (not yet at the moment) hub systems gonna be awesome, and i can write 15 more pages but its just a comment (and i think you got the idea) and the main message is: play this f***ing game right now.",1
"10/10 i can use a bow to kill highly advanced enemies.",1
"weapons+good graphics+lack of glitches+free. to. play.=good game.",3
"its good. why u might ask? because its about swords and guns. and who doesnt like swords and guns. take it from the dmc series.",1
"i really like this game. every time i come back to this game, theyve added something new. i have yet to buy any ingame items or frames so i know im missing out on a bunch of cool stuff. that being said, ive had a lot of fun playing for free.",3
"a great game. fast-paced with a lot of features. its a lot better with friends, though; playing solo is just boring, monotonous grinding. to be fair, the whole game is a giant grind for materials, but they keep it interesting. its totally free, but you can pay (and to be fair, when you pay its more expensive than working for your gear!) to have everything go faster. the devs keep the game up-to-date and theres a whole damn lot of content to get engulfed in. in short, this game is the love child of destiny and metal gear rising, directed by jj abrams. just... seriously. i love this game even after a few days of playing. get it. do it.",2
"i have a dog. its name is dildoprince. we travel the galazy with our dragondildo clan. and i, the dildoking, lead a new age where all dildotenno can be free. long live the  claaaaaaaaan!!!!! i have spent too much time playing this.....",1
"a good f2p requieres a bit of grinding to get some good items.",1
"ive pumped hundreds of hours into the stand-alone client, hence less hours played via steam. the gameplay is so much fun that it doesnt feel like grinding even though you basically are just grinding for loot and xp after a while. ive never really liked shooters. warframe is the exception, especially for the mobility and rpg elements. its very unique in that regard. also, putting some money into the game to get your warframe and wep slots is totally worth it if youre enjoying the game. the devs are worth supporting, theyre very responsive to the community,",1
"ill keep it short: do you enjoy games playing as super-powered badass ninjas in space? this game is the epitome of that. throw in a wonderful community and responsive dev team and youve got a mix for a soon to be mmo giant. seriously, at least give warframe a try!",4
"i grinded over a 1000 hours for potatoes so you wouldnt have to.",1
"warframe . a free to play game that is not a pay to win . all the warframes are craftable and the weapons too. but the colours and the decorations are only buyable and the grafics are really good for a free to play game ... and there are some things that are same from the game dark sector ... so much nostalgia ! , and did i said its a co-op game with space ninjas ? super cool right ?",5
"you are a ninja... in space... what more could you possibly want.",2
"honestly. hands down, this is the game you want to spend your precious time, and maybe even money on. best gameplay and great fast paced fun. get in now before you miss the best opportunity in your life!",1

"this game can be a very good experience. the community is great, the trade system is pretty active and healthy, the levels are interesting. every weapon and ability can be unique and fun. in general. this is one of the best games i have played in a while. i have had to delete it from my computer a few times in order to get work done...",5
"describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others. yeah i recommend it to people that like action and awesome games what i like about it is all the action all the stuff u can do in this and if u arent good at shooting games no worries there is alot of easy missions as well as hard missions u can train on or just have fun :) give it a try",4
"i have only played this game for about a week but i keep commign back, it can get a bit repetative but rng what do you expect still cant wait to try out everything so far its great ! love it sept for the ocasional fal;ong through the floor when you have no revives y^y no loot for jew haha",1
"warframe is a good game. almost perfect trade system, good battle system, perfect graphics. like; 1. wide range of weapons. 2. wide range of classes. 3. this game isnt full value rpg, but its elements are a lot in this game. every class, every weapon you can improve to higher lvl. 4. multiplayer is up to 4 guys, but you can play solo. 5. as well as pve, warframe has pvp. dislike; 1.pvp. pvp system is need to be improved. you can fight only vs 1 guy in your clan (need duel room) and up to 2vs2 in some places in some planets. balanced by conclave. its an indicator of your collness. it improves when you getting new, better items. in all, warframe is very good game. i recommend it for people who like action and rpg games.",3
"pro: great concept good graphics a very good way to spend your time contra: the hosting thing this might kill your social life. so be careful...",5

"very well designed game. definatly does not feel like a free to play game because of how good it is. this was the first game ive ever spent money on even though its free, and thats saying a lot. its free just download it!",2
"to be honest, the only reason this game is geting such amount of recommended rates is because its a free to play game. if people had to pay to play this game they would get really pissed off after a week or two if the dont like grinding games that much, because warframe is the king of grinding games. this game has alot of content, very cool content yes, but youll find yourself farming one item for countless hours and then waiting days for it to be available (after you get the materials for each item you have to wait for it to be finished, unless you pay). and this applies to everything, weapons, warframes, mods, mods mods. and of course, the bugs, i really dont want to write about this since i stoped playing a few patchs ago so maybe most of the bugs i encountered back when i was playing might got fixed already but holy f*ck did i find some *t bugs in this game. anyways, i got bored pretty fast but i cant say it was not worth the while, i had fun playing valkyr after i finished her completly, the animations and graphics are amazing and even though there are some warframes that are stronger than others all of them are viable and fun to play. download this game if you like ninjas, futuristic enviroment and if you dont mind grinding in a repetitive way for hours. after all, its free to play.",2
"this is extremely fun, but you need way to much money to play this. on the other half, i love this game.",2
"i like this game for the art direction. the developer do listen to the community which has it plus and minuss. the tricky part is that you will grind for resorces and items. coming from other games you have to unlearn cover base shooting. staying by a item that needs to be guarded will get you blown up. you must go out like john woo and shoot mobs in the face. the game is beta and while it stable they hold up the beta tag as a shield for some of the bugs.",8
"it is fun for a few hours and seems to be promising. but after that it is just lackluster. the pvp aspect is where this game could shine, however it drops the ball there. maybe i had this experiance because i did not pay to play.",1
"game isnt incredible, but who the  cares. you are mothering space cyborg ninjas with magic powers kicking every aliens  in existence. 7/10",1
"ive only spent 18 hours on this game. i think i need to play about 182 more hours before i can even begin writing a review... overall a yes right now.",2
"i tried to parkour and failed the jump but i got launched across the room behind a bunch of enemies which i then went to slaughter with my purple glowing swords.... ninjas play free!.....",1
"i think this is a really good game, infact one of my top 5 list. my only advice if you want to get this game is dont leave it for too long because you will be left out quite alot",3
"destiny is disappointing? fear not! try this game then. youll find all the minus point in destiny done right here. lore? plenty. content? majestic! stuff to do? never end. community? vast and improving. price? free! a real free to play! try it! you wont regret it!",1
"this game is a very good. it may have bugs but is a 10/10 game worth playing.",4
"great multiplayer game and free to play, with such amazing graphics and easy gameplay, what more do you want?",1

"ninjas. ninjas in space. ...what you want more? 10/10",1
"ok, ftp this is a damn good game. pros: fast action, combat is a blast flashy graphics is a good term for them especially liked the melee its a better first/third hybrid than firefall (where you also use warframes) cons: shallow--read, not an rpg, youre a combat drone flashy graphics are kind of stupid, characters are cool, enemies look clunky if you slip up early, you cant change things much without paying--wouldnt call it pay to win, but pay to change t what you really want. i really wish they had made it umm...something relevant like...cyberpunk maybe or...a zombie slayer or....something that makes some kind of sense rather than this weird tenno alien thing. but for fun, playable, combat video game...its pretty tight.",1
"my experience this far: start cool prologue grind grind grind new weapon wait 24 hours grind grind grind new frame wait 72 hours grind grind grind and repeat. 10/10 would grind again",1

"this game has 3 stages: 1.be the noob 2.the thought: oh look at that guy i want to look like him!! 3. 1500 hrs ok lets wait for the new prime acces...",7
"awesome game...hard to get into sort of like dota 2 in that way... the biggest con is that its repetitive.",1
"i played this game for a while, i enjoyed this game a lot. i invited couple friends and it made it even better. from getting all the chartchers, to openning achivemeants and getting lots of kubrows (pets) earned about 500 platinium legit by selling prime stuff i got from missions. its a really fun game, but it i really got bored later, but... getting bored after 563 hours, is normal. also take the fact its free.",5
"i love going to the void, because when you finish with your party, theres a huge mess left for the lonely corrupt janitor to clean up everytime. :) (warframe player on the xbox one, so i have much more playtime than the stated 9 hours.)",1
"hands down one of the best games i have ever played. took a little while to wrap my head around itm but after that, i cant stop playing it!!!",3
"i played this from alpha and let me tell you it has came a long way. the only reason you would play this is because one of your buddies sucks at anything but pve. so get warframe, easy for the most part. it will be a pain in the  to make anything, real time. its lame in alot of ways and fun alot for like 60 hours, then you grinding, the game is not as much of a grind as it was before, now its a fancy grind, but nevertheless, its ok. better then most free to play games. oh and the pay part is to look cool, you cant grind for color or other like cosmo items, just dont work like that ! happy homoing",2
"when i played it, it was great, after a few updates i didnt like the direction that game was going in, so i stopped playing, now, months later, im trying it again",3
"this game is truely what free to play is. evrything in the game can be made by collecting resources and using in-game currency. the only things exclusive to platinum are the cosmetic items. you can also earn the platinums by trading the rare drops which you can get in-game, with other players. the gameplay is mindblowing. everything has its own indiviuality and there is so much customization you can do. the graphics are also pretty good. the community is very helpful and friendly. the only cons i can think of are: you have to grind a lot to get all the different things in the game. (gotta catch em all) there are a few minor bugs. although there seems to be a lot of daily updates and patches made to fix the bugs. i would absolutely recommend you to try this game out. i mean who doesnt want to play as a cyber ninja who can fire guns? did i mention you also have super powers and dogs ?",4
"i found this game amazingly fun on my xbox and it is a game that even in the grindy bits is fun, its very customizeable and the co op is better so i can enjoy it with my friends",1
"tenno out of tenno. some good stuff here yeah its addicting dont get if you have good grades",2
"+ graphics gameplay action idea music/sound f2p, where you could earn in-game currency plat by grinding for items and sell them - grindfest i reached end-game and have nothing to do... daily limits on syndicate exps grindfest kubrows require real-life time maintenance or it will die permanently grindfest",6
"dont know how to explain this, its like destiny but cheaper and better",1
"this is an awesome game! though for me, there are few hindrances but that is easily counteracted by the awesome fun that unfolds while you play. it is at times complicated but its hilarious to run this with friends who can watch your back to the best of their abilities. things are modifyable so there is diversity within the game to make the runs never be the same even with the same allies.",2
"by far my favorate free to play games ive played, played alot on my ps4 and put some money into it and now getting started on pc good game if you dont mind some serious grinding to get what you want.",1
"loving this game alot, the concept of ninja is awesome! pet peeves of grindings.. but still good!",4
"this game has some very fun features, but high learning curve if you do not have experienced friends to help you. get some friends to help you if you want to play this game, make like more enjoyable.",3
"i totally ask people to try this game out if you havent try it yet it a cool game you get to but weapon get warframes but you need to collect iteams to build the weapons..",1
"absolutely spectacular, there is nothing more rewarding then obtain a new warframe, and levelling it. if you dont like it, go die in a hole. or dont.",3
"when you first play this game, youll just be amazed at how beautiful it can be, then it all turns to a grindfest that hooks you in and never lets you go. 1,000 hours in and im still grinding away something. but honestly the game burn out can get out of hand, find something soothing to play inbetween grind sessions. also, play with friends, soloing all the time will bring your spirits down. the community is generally really nice and willing to help.",10
"its a game about magic space ninjas, the game starts out slow and is hard to get into. however the gameplay itself is just fantastic and when you start getting frames and weapons and stuff building all the time its good fun, the pvp needs work at the time of me writing this review, but its fun even though its broken. ign would give it a 0/10 for too much originality and good mechanics... i give it about a 9/11. its the bomb.",4
"played for 66 minutes. didnt learn to attack and died on the first level. 10/10",1
"love how you can customise your guy, colours to a point, for everything your guy uses, has a unreal tornimant vibe but a better questline i quite enjoy it",1
"this reminds me of mass effect 3s multiplayer, except warframe plays faster and with more game modes. the graphics are impressive, and the powers and weapons are satisfying to use. no game released in 2014 convinced me to stop playing this one for more than a week or so, and i think that says something about the quality of this game. if you are new to the game, i strongly recommend spending the free starting platinum on a warframe slot and some weapon slots; every other non-cosmetic item can be obtained via gameplay.",9
"tenno out of ten. would be space wizard ninja with a gun again",1
"this is great game, great format, great progression, but the constant crashes and host migrations leading to losing all your progress and loot is not only annoying, but far too consistant. more stability would make this game experience a worthy choice in the free game arena.",2
"i have been playing warframe since the beginning. the game has changed a  ton and they are always adding new and exciting things. since i started playing,we have gotten hundreds of weapons,a bunch of frames,new game modes,new...everything,basically. warframe has become a permanet addition to my main played games just make sure you are not afraid of grind and you have a lot of time on your hands. takes hours to build a weapon :p",6
"amazing mult-player work together game and highly recommneded love it 10/10.",1
"highly addictive! developers constantly updating game. great economy not pay to win. i have spent about 10$ on this game and have played for over 500 hours.",5
"friends got me to play the game a few months ago. ive spent quite a few hours on it. its alright; very grindy but with a bunch of friends on a skype call its a fairly enjoyable experience.",1
"10th t3 survival attempt for nova prime chassis. went to 60 minutes, as opposed to the usual 40. got a sicarus prime bp at the end. 10/10 would commit suicide again",3
"warframe is a great game. the multiplayer feature of this game is nice. i had a good time playing with a friend. however, i did not really enjoy it. im not sure if i will play it again. i have played for an hour and a half so far. its a good game, but not a personal favourite of mine. i would reccomend warframe to some of my friends.",1
"10/10 amazing game maybe got a lot bug, but still amazing",5
"this game is very repetitive. it has a destiny feel to it, but with more focus on melee combat. it lags a lot when teaming up with a group, but that might just be my system. the game is trying to push the idea of p2w when every menu having items to buy right at the beginning, and anything you can buy with in game cash is overly expensive and not worth the time and effor, especially since each mission has such a little pay off. components for the blueprints are just impossible to find. each mission is the same, even story missions. go from point a to point b and kill wave after wave of enemies. the regular missions are just wave defense games. all in all the game is just a big waste of time with no pay off, its boring even though it had such a good premise. space ninjas. how could you have gone so terribly wrong?",1
"magic, swords, guns and free running... oh and did i mention free to play? warframe is an intense third person shooter where you hack, slash and utterly destroy any opposition standing in your way. the squad based pve (player vs enemy) combat system is a refreshing take on the multiplayer third person shooter platform that pits you up against many formidable foes including the alien grineers, infected scourge and robotic fleets in objective based missions spanning from extermination to extraction. the only downside to the game however, as with most f2ps (free to play) is the missions can become a bit repetitive and 90% of the weapons and other upgrades must be purchase. so if youre looking for a game to blow off some steam with some epic sword waving, gun toting, action packed combat, then warframe is the game for you! oh the carnage! 7/10",1
"this game is really fun. best third person shooter game in my opinion. 10/10",1
"i play this on the ps4 and just wanted to leave a review on here. in short, yes it is a grind if you want to keep playing for free and still get good items, but it is highly addictive. where destiny was limited, short, sometimes too difficult and not that much fun for me, warframe makes up for it. warframe is basically a more feature rich version of destiny. however be warned, if you dont want to play for free, it is very expensive. some of the packages cost double that of a normal game, and buying in game credits is obscene. but, that hasnt mattered for me. ive won enough items and levels through grinding on free play to keep me interested. highly recommend.",1
"nice game , graphics and action , extreme pakrour like me haha xd",2
"this game, without a doubt, has the flaw of being a f2p game but without all the constraints that most games under the same genre have today. nearly every thing can be attainted without the need to prchase the in-game currency, aside from select cosmetic and certain event mods. the only gripe is how many warframes and weapons one person can hold in their arsinal at once, which is gained by using platinum. it can be pretty easy to earn the in-game currency once you get going, as people will always be seeking out rare mods and prime parts. you can even gain some platinum from the daily log in! the developers also seem to frown upon buying credits with platinum, as 90 platinum is only 30,000 credits, which will not last long what-so-ever, and they know this.",3
"for those who want to waste time in downloading then redownload it again, this is for you. yeah, it uninstalled itself after 6.1gig dl then patching like i dont know how many gig then viola, vanished liek thin air. would recommend 69/10",3
"looks can be diseving this game looks bad but functions great. this game is good for all (unless you play minecraft. in that case stop playing it and play warframe)",1
"havent played it in 2 years but i think it was meh",1
"even though im new to this game, its already addicting!",1
"all i can say is best game ever i wish all free games were as good quality as this one. really appreciate all the time and effort you put into the game. keep it up guys",3
"this is a fantastic f2p game and im enjoying it a lot",1
"game is a grind. a grind better than destiny. with materials we actually need to farm. with more nicer looking weapons. with so much personalization. sadly, my windows kicked the bucket and warframe doesnt work on the osx unless i bootcamp it ( which i wont) so i spend every day on this page waiting, hopefully, for a mac client",6
"it is a very good game ,but is very laggy on my pc. help",1
"good game but very hard when u try to solo missions, especially when u have to get the collar for the kubrow i have one and its been sitting there for the past couple days because i cant complete the mission but if u have friends this game can be very fun",1
"took a break for a long time to come back to it. let me say that this game never gets old with the updated love they give it.",2
"omg get dis game it is awesome. is it really not interesting to be able to play as ninjas while they kick alien butt and protect the universe with high tech weapontry? really people come on!",1
"great amazing game some dont like it because its not freeroming but i ask you this how do you travel from planet to planet in a beutiful invironment with out cuting out most of the graphics the game would look shity if it was a freeromer plus i dont like being owned by pay to wins. overall amazing game",1
"its a good game.i have the graphics set to low,and its fantastic!i think:if i set the graphics on high or very high,how will it look?i recommend this game,have a good gameplay,a good storyline,you can play the missions with other players,and its free!!!!!!! now i have the game set on ultra settings and its awesome :)",1
"free to play, why yes it is. although a lot of this game is through learning by experience of play through you really dont need any money to spend to enjoy this game. the trading channel in which players can buy and sell items is easily the best way to enhance not only the community but yourself as well. love being a ninja in space? new updates are monthly with a dedicated staff. theres really nothing i dislike about the game. endless opportunities using hundreds of different weapons, customization beyond belief, its a real joy to play.",2
"mass effect and ninja gaidenss genius birth child.",2
"not big on story. takes a while to get into the game, but once you do, its a lot of fun. good game to play with friends, or even make friends.",1
"it turned me from atheist to religious. hail rngsus.",9
"pros: -generally satisfying third person action gameplay involving smooth shooting mechanics with a decent enough set of parkour controls. -varied ammount of content both common and rare that can be earned in various ways. -cash shop does not bar free members from any content, only accelerates its aquisition for paying members. -large roster of playable classes with a wide array of unique abilities, in addition to a massive arsenal of weapons anywhere between the shooter staples like assault rifles and snipers to the strange and obscure like bouncy saw blade launchers and tentacle beam lasers. -mostly bug free and with a good user interface to boot. cons: -ember wont be my waifu. -frosts sweet coat doesnt flap in the winter breeze.",3
"first impressions, looks good & the gameplay is sweet. im looking forward to playing this game a lot more. if youre interested in space, third person combat & loads of fun with friends. i reccomend this game. 100/10",1
"i dont think theres any other game that makes you feel so ridiculously overpowered",1
"i love it! i literally love it! im downloading it from steam now (i played the non steam version earlier)",1
"its a game, where you shoot things, make numbers fall out, and then repeat ad infinium until you kill things faster and faster. i suppose at some point you kill things fast enough that the heat death of the universe speeds up and consumes you. tenouttaten",1
"pretty cracking game. gets grindy and repetitive at times, but for what it is its awesome, especially if you have friends to play with.",2
"looking to be a space ninja? yeaa!? then you came to the right place! -------------------------------------- warframe! -------------------------------------- great game. great community. the game has been out for about 2 years (from when i wrote this review). it is still evolving, with equally good and bad choices, but they take in the communitys opinion into consideration and most of the time they head to the right direction. every week, the developers host live streams to update the players on what is changing and being added. like ever good mmo, players look at the endgame value. in warframes current state, there is little to no endgame play value, from a view of a veteran player. they are working on a 8 - man raid and a new pvp mode, capture the flag. warframe is mainly pve based when the game started out, and ive always view the game that way. give it a try!",10
"shes like a female buddy, but theres alot more grinding involved. *400 hours off ps4*",1
"a great game that will consume all of your time. at first you realy have to work to get somewear but it is getting better and better. there are constant updates with new features so you have always something to do. fot tips you have to watch mogamu and otherwarframe youtubers. a great game.",3
"oh gosh, where do i start? wonderful. *wonderful graphics *play it, why do you need another positive review? play. now. and. get. consume.",1
"well destiny let us down it prob wont come out on pc but this will do :d 8 out of 8 m8 lots a fun",1
"think mass effect 3 multiplayer. neato stuff with monster hunter-tier grinding, but will get extremely repetitive quickly. recommend small bursts.",1
"i have had problems with games that are too repetitive in the past. this is one such game and while it was fun the first few hours it has become much too repetitive after a while. i dont like to grind for hours at end and thats the one reason i have stopped playing the game. otherwise this game deserves at least a 9/10.",1
"with a great player driven economy, and the ability to earn all non-cosmetic items in the game, digital extremes has hit a great point with players all over with warframe. while many would say that the premium currency (platinum) is highly overcosted, they regularly give out coupons for their daily login prizes, ranging from 20% all the way to 75% off the regular price, and said platinum can also be earned in game by completing certain missions and earning parts and mods that the player can sell to others for the currency. the gameplay can get tedious, seeming as how most of the missions are cookie-cutter. but if you can get past the grinding, and the repetition, warframe might just become one of your favorite free-to-play gems in your library",1
"warframe, for being in beta currently, is singlehandedly the most phenomenal f2p game i have had the pleasure to play. although, it is a f2p game thus having microtransactions. luckily, digital extremes (the game developers), took into consideration, hey, everyone hates pay 2 win games, right? ok, so well leave in microtransactions for the lazy people who play the game to complete it and not for fun, but well make a way to earn platinum without buying it!. if you have parts for a prime weapon or warframe (your suits) or even a decently rare mod, you can head over to trading chat and sell it for xx amount of platinum. not only are the creators not money hungry scumbags, warframe is highly addicting, as you can see from my playtime. you will eventually get yourself into a situation such as ugh, my stuff is so terrible, but i need to grind out some resources to get this new weapon or ugh my stuff is so good it just wrecks anything in my path. i want a challenge and youll attempt to quit the game. you will never quit warframe. even if some serious  goes down, de will somehow rope you back in. warframe, recommended 8.5/10 near endless hours of entertainment, and a hell of a f2p. for your sake, get this game.",10
"too long; didnt write ~ who doesnt want to be a space ninja, with your friends killing in a co-op, anti-cover shooter? and with 80 hours in, it truely has been free to play.",2
"freakishly awesome game! id love to play it with everyone!",1
"how do i install this game?? theres only play options or the bonus pack downloadable contents.",1
"been playing this game for a few weeks now and i like it i would reccomend to anyone for a free game :d plenty to do on it.",1
"get this game i mean why not? its free after all...",3
"i loved it... i have to say this is one of the best free games on steam to date... its graphics are amazing, gameplay is fun, customization and upgrades are hard to achieve, but thats what makes the game a whole lot more fun!",4
"pros: good graphics good gameplay good story good quests is fun cons: too ing addicting sleep (stopping you from playing warframe) overall rating: 420/420 2gud4me",7
"its fun and the game itself changes from time to time",2
"i used to enjoy this game [until i lost a chance to get the last vauban helmet bp] this game is fun as heck. you need to grind/farm a little[too much] alot of hours to craft and make stuff.after you get some stuff youll get the hang off it. start farming void and trade to earn credits, to basicly buy what you want.this game gets updated alot and hope youll not miss a chance for a vauban piece.. uhh well.",1
"do you like levelling up? sci-fi? guns? swords? co-op? aliens? explosions? then get warframe it delivers all of these things and it is free as well!",1
"an awesome game that has fast gameplay.complately free and very unique desings.",3
"i liked pretty much everything about this game! it has a wide diversity of different set ups and different ways to make your warframe a special kind of awesome and unique warframe!",2
"i would only get this game if you have friends who are interested in it too, its hard to solo and its not very social",4
"space ninja simulator since 2013, ive been here since update 7, which was when it first hit steam in open beta. i have watched the whole game evolve before my eyes, from new weapons, frames, clans, enemies, to certain guns which used to be purchasable without payed currency or a blueprint such as the burston, a few guns being killed off like the snipetron and boar which can only be obtained by crafting it as a prime or buying a rhino pack, all the way to where we are now. all these events dont really change one thing though, the fact that its still a grind. i still havent completed a single prime anything. ive spent my fair share of money on inventory slots and orokin reactors/catalysts. still a better f2p than league",2
"the controls take a little getting used to and if you dont have a great computer it can lag at times. but, its great fun. would recommend",2
"ive put ninty hours into this game so far, and i know ill put many more. something about the pacing of the game just appeals to me, that and space ninjas. nuf said.",3
"so i installed the game then after a few weeks i uninstalled it then i installed it again, because i had nothing to play",1
"this game contains more grinding than your boy/girlfriend (depending on your preferences) will ever do for you. if youre still interested in grinding your  off for some shiny stuff, go for it. now excuse me, i have to go grind my  off for nova prime and some neurodes",6
"lights are the best in this game and animation are also the power",2
"too much pay to win else, too much grinding. melee feels very weak. movement is free yes, but has very little purpose. kinda weak. could work for you if you have friends. not much to say, sadly bland despite the outstanding art.",1
"game that is constantly updated and as it continues through it is always changing. started playing over a year ago and the hud back then was pretty bare, now it is very much different than it used to be. new gameplay additions such as the archwing and having your own space ship are things that werent around when i first started playing. if you decided not to play for awhile dont be surprized when you come back and things have changed quite a bit.",1
"very promising game, very satisfying, space missions i always wanted to play, very good game",1
"i found myself playing hours and hours of this game. at the 100 hour mark i stopped because of boredom. then came back for this amount of time before i got bored of it again. i swear if i find myself wasting life on this great game again ill shoot myself",6
"overall a solid game, with fast paced elements and enough content for a long fun-filled experience. however, if i grinded as much irl as i did in-game, then i would probably have the bad-aids. gg 10/10 warframe saved the day.",3
"an awsome game with spaceninjathings called tenno. it made a nice campfire out of my old computer but with my new one it works quite well and looks gorgeus. its also free-to-play so what are you waiting for?",1
"ninjas at space. why are you still here not playing the game! pros: lots of things to do cool weaponry with interesting upgrade mechanics, everyone undestands the international language of money, good graphics cons: farm heavy early game, requires a bit of intellect to get use to upgrade system, late game requires teamwork dont think you can go god mode all the time. should you play warframe: meh...",2
"a lot to do here. 80 hours to learn the game, 200 more to get acces to everything and 200 more to be able to farm everything. rng will still  around with you. youll never get the drop you want. you need to buy some more warframe and equipment slots if you want to play this game for a longer period of time. still its worth its money, one of the best pc mp farming games. 8.9 / 10.",5
"i started playing warframe a while ago and one thing that i have found is that each update just makes the game more and more fun. even when i feel like taking a break from this game, i always am drawn back in whenever they release an update because the developer team know what theyre doing and have lot of unique ideas that make this game really fun.",5
"once i started i was hooked, this game has everything a f2p needs and a mile more. i mean 3rd person was already a learning curve for myself but you get used to it, and you can take advantages from the camera angles when aiming. this game has everything smoothly cut and personally the only thing i didnt really like was how the slide (l shift + ctrl) was so close together it made it hard at some points but not really hard to just rebind the key. i am still new while writing this review but expect me to be much better later on. i expect to play this game and even make a purchase from warframe. this game is definately worth money, much better than a 10-20 dollar 3rd person campaign/shooter. the rating is m cause of violence but i think people of ages 12 or older should be fine understanding the concept and play the game themselves. well after writing this review it makes me want to play warframe even more. thanks for reading, off to game.",1
"nice game! my first free too play game i really like, top!",1
"exellent game, its not like the other si-fi and futeristic games. this one is diffrent. the dev team have really made the game look beautiful not only that but the combat is fluent, there is many other ways of killing your foes and not to mention the 20 diffrent and uniqe warframes (classes) they all have diffrent abilities and all hae a diffrent play style.",1
"aside from a community that is less than helpful, the game is pretty alright. i spent half an hour asking for help for a quest, but everyone decided to ignore me to talk about egyptian lazahs.",1
"pretty cool, if you like buying in-game things with real money",1
"its like mass effect and halo on steroids. except it doesnt have an actual story line...oh, and it is free.",7
"dear warframe as a valid customer i have been over charged with an item a syndana that i only bought once but charged me twice so i lost 50 platinum in the process please check the purchase system for any annomalies if i can get back those 50 platinum points that ive been overly charged. sincerely yours valid customer.",3
"best free to play third person shooter/slasher game ive ever played the only game that got me stuck onto for a long while... my gameplay hours aint much in steam because i dont launch it there but ive played tons of hours in this game because its so good only prolem is the grind is f***ing real!",1
"ok, so i came home from school one day and as soon as i join the call (after doing my homework obviously) yo, you gotta get this game uhm, what game is it? its called warframe, you gotta try this so after half an hour, this new game was downloaded and i went around playing it. i fell in love with it. literally. the amazing gameplay, parkour, grinding, differant weapons and classes made me fall for this game as i did with games like diablo. pretty soon i had my first warframe other than the mag that i started off with. my friends all calling me a tryhard for getting my valkyr. i passed my level 3 mastery rank before my friends even reached level 2, and suddenly i found myself one-shotting everything in the low level missions that my friends thought were difficult. pretty soon they stopped playing warframe, saying that it was crap and boring. but i kept on going, i got into trading and got myself a frost prime and burston prime. this is a pretty good game i thought to myself, meanwhile all my friends still saying it was bad. i still havent stopped playing, and i am on my way (3/4 of the way) to getting mastery rank 7, and i am still feeling pumped every time i start a mission. overall my verdict is... dont play if you a) have a girlfriend b) plan on having a life c) like vor if your none of the above, then i would definitely recommend this game to anybody, especially those who loved diablo or destiny",4
"whenever i feel like slashing enemies in half and doing raids start playing void missions in this game, pretty good satisfying if you ask me.",2
"whats more fun then space ninjas ? and swords ? and cutting up people like celery ? nothing",1
"shpaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace! - portal 2, space sphere",6
"something like mass effect with badassery all the way. fun and free.",3

"its very nice,but better adjust the screen resolution,nice graphics,you can choose ur own weapon",1
"one of the best game i ever play and can not stop...just dont know why but once u try it u will love the game!!! it may be a bit hard at first time but get a clan play with friend and dont be shy to ask for help ;)",6
"wtf! this game was teen before?im not reccomending it cause of that",1
"if only other game companies had as amazing speed at bug fixes and patching as this team does. oh did you know this game has ninjas? by god does it have ninjas. mesa is waifu for life. 10/10",1
"probably one of the best f2p games currently out on the market. nearly all items in the game can be obtained completely for free all you need to do is just play it. there is a reason this game is at the very top of steams top 100 games played list. warframe is very well optimized and will run on nearly any computer and with its intuitive tutorial system it wont take long for any new players to get familiar with the game.",4
"vindictus was probaly the first f2p game i ever got hooked on to and i thought there will probably never be another game quite as good as this. eventually this game slowly but surely lured me away from vindictus back in may of 2013. since then warframe has really grown and continues to grow into a uniqe game that no other f2p game has ever done before. event items/weapons are get them while its hot sort of deal. but unlike most games, you at least have a fighting chance to earn these event items through special missions avalible to all high/low level players. for premium content, excluding prime access, you can sell items/mods/blueprinrts for plat and buy new cosmetics/weapons/frames/resource/etc. every weapon and frame can be crafted via mission drops or blueprints/parts bought from other players. the best thing about the game is that it never needs to go under scheduled maintenance but instead a quick hotfix. gameplay is great and has a digital sorta in game manual for begginers. minus the minor bugs/glitches its an overall beautiful game that deserves praise.",1
"nice graphics , nice storyline(nothing special but still works well overall),rl fun to play,has improved much from beta,very nicely done combat system,newbies wont get lost,(for some people it may be hard to master....also depending the class you choose). rl nice game i look forward to it :) ...and watch better?its completely free :d 8/10",1
"fun game to play with friends. the only downsides ive experienced is the economy and crafting time. the economy is not very newbie friendly and can be kinda confusing at first, and about the crafting system i dont really enjoy having to wait +3 days to have certain items crafted, they try to make you pay to speed up the process.",1
"fun as crap. great combat system, great movement system. dont believe the metascore. this is one of the only f2p games that i have gone back to playing after stopping. i recommend this wholeheartedly for everyone.",1
"its an awesome 1st person shooter game,perfect for sci-fi fans like me",1
"this game is interesting, with a very good gameplay. the history is good aswell, i love the part that i can have bow and sword at same char. kinda dificult in the begining, but that what gives the motivation to keep playing. keep the good work.",1
"the account syncing needs some work digital extremes with steam but other then that top 10 favorite of all games. because of the endless hours of different weapons and frames just all that gear is a nerds wet dream.",4

"the game is great for a free to play game, with high graphics and high-quality gameplay. but the main flaw in this game is that it requires alot of farming or cashing in order to be able to complete high-tier missions such as the tier 4 void survival. but the gameplay makes it worth playing.",4
"i used to love warframe very much. but then, when ive unlocked sedna and phobos, enemies are tougher to kill, enemies can airborne while warframe cant (not archwing) and enemies weapons can damaged your shield very fast. mine was from 900+ shield to 200- within 10 seconds on rhino equipped with steel fiber ranked 8. i did cashed out from money to purchase some items. i realized that its all a waste! theyre uselss! only for f***ing decorations to make looks cool and awesome not the weapons! dont cash out some money for platinums! its a waste for money! i couldve buy other games like far cry 4 or sniper ghost warrior 2!",2

"it was the first multiplayer game ive ever played and now nothing else compares. i love it!",5
"ive already sunk so many hours into this game, and they seem to have a steady stream of updates. the graphics looks very well done, and as for the games currency system (since it is a free to play) it is pretty simple to get a lot of platinum without actually spending money via the in-game trading system.",4

"looks nice, tight controls (albeit a bit cluttered), some levels are just unfair, lots of grinding i like it but god damn it, its basically pay to not grind your fingers out because if you want anything other than starting gear youll grind your  out grinding is incredibly fun with friends though",1
"this game gets updated continually, and its got lots of content now, but it suffers from the same problem many mmorpgs do: little to no real endgame. ive got a lot of hours and corresponding equipment, and as such i rarely put any effort into a given mission. i feel like it needs a prestige mode or something, where you have to rebuild a warframe from scratch. despite all this, my statement stands: great for a beta is such a backhanded complement. note: it has router issues.",6
"solid gameplay, good customization, excellent graphics and free to play make this a good game to try at least once.",2
"great game, the gameplay and graphics are awesome.",1
"this game can easily make you play for hour on end, leveling you warframe, weapons or just getting resources. the abilty to play along with your friends is a great thing aswell. seriously, who would want to play as some futuristic ninja and not have their friends along.",1
"this game is as awesome as it gets, but only if you enjoy coop, hack and slash with a little stealth, in a futuristic environment. there is no equal.",1
"worth the download and really nice graphics, great gameplay 10/10",1
"completely awesome and completely free...unless you want to buy the packs... but it is still progressable without paying 17.5/10 , would pay nothing again",1
"in terms of free to play, this game does an excellent job at it. the amount of time and effort they have put into making this game does pay it well. there is always stuff to do it, it is never a dull, the cooperative system is amazingly executed. the choice and variety of warframes, weapons and sentinels make it you can never get bored of it. the lore and the design of the enemy are amazing.",4
"free to play games where you actually dont have to pay are always awesome. this one is up there. much better if you play it with friends rather than all alone. make sure to read up on some newbie guides once youre ready, as this will give you a much more enjoyable experience if youre not planning to buy any in-game currency.",2
"fun, good graphics, addicting. one of my favorite free to play.",2
"this is a good game for starters but when you play it for a while you start to have to pay for better stuff.",1
"warframe, where the grinding has a frangrance of crack cocaine to it.",1
"warning: this game has some sort of mind control that makes it really fun to grind levels for hours every day. join the infested.",2
"a while ago, i used to play this a lot. i had the same stock weapons for a long time, because its so hard to get a new weapon. when i finally got a new weapon (it was expensive), it sucked. i dont want to grind. but when i did grind, i got a cool gun. then my computer broke. rip",1
"game is very freaking good,i recommend it with all my heart,for a free to play game i would give 11/10,for a game itself i would give 9,7/10.just download and try,u wont regret it,unless u get too adicted :3",1

"this game is very reprtitive i have only just gotten bored be warned",1
"a crusade of farming platinum and resources to fund a crusade for more platinum and resources - cant remember author although the game is in a beta, it develops quick enough to keep the interest of the consumer. the latest archwing update brought an entirely new experience to the game and the dev community listens to their players. you can spend hours on a game like this. 9/10 *the only winning move is not to play*",3
"great game i highly recomend it to those looking for shooter games.",1
"a really good game but the match making systems is sometimes a bit buggy and wont let you join public games",7
"this game is fun but i wish that it was just a little bit easier to get platinum without paying because i play games that are free and i dont pay for in-game stuff anyways this game it goes from fun to boring to fun and keeps repeating so this is pretty fun also you can customize the colors on your warframe and your ship i want platinum for the accesories cuz you cant buy them with in-game credits so some look cool and i want them and you need platinum for sets of colors.a valentine color set costed 1 credit not platinum which i liked and this is a cool game.there are stealth weapons and guns in here.you can choose between a powerful bow or a gun.throwing knives or a pistol at beginning i like this game and recommend this to people who like sci-fi rpgs.",1
"after last big update there are some issues. menus look cheaper and are more difficult to navigate. mission view lost many nice features. cannot see how many nodes are complete when hovering mouse over planet. cannot see mission progression. cannot swap worlds have to back up to main screen. cannot view all planets at once. honestly older way was better. wish the levels had some more differences. sometimes it is easy to get lost when everything looks the same should be a way to transfer credits into ore. can put a limit within a week timeframe to keep transfers down and purchases up. or random items available in market for credits. need better interface for friends and mission starts. current is confusing. i like that you can view other missions now while timer is going just wish that navigation would be better. good step forward just gotta get some tweaks fixed.",8
"the finest most exiting and best suported beta i have ever experianced if you havent played it play it, get it installed and play it, the community is good, the developers are on it. its a new style of play but once you get your head around the nuances of the combos you will love running around as a space ninja",1
"it honestly may as well be a sandbox where you slaughter a bunch of npcs, then you unlock new tools to slaughter an even larger amount of npcs. then you change the gamemode so you can slaughter more npcs in a different style.",5
"pros: full customization. engaging co-op. loot. oh-yeah moments. cons: it demands that you replay missions to farm for items. does not surface many of the avenues a player can take to make grinding easier. must read the wiki to not waste your time. try if you like: borderlands, monster hunter, transformers foc",2
"people say this game requires a lot of grinding, but the game is still enjoyable. upgrade your warframe as you progress in the game, play with friends and other players. :)",1
"this game has to be by far one of my favorites! you play as a space ninja that awakens from stasis, only to find yourself plunged into a solar system being attacked by the grineer, an army of clones ruled by two queens whom we have yet to see, you also have the corpus to deal with, a faction that would sell their own mother just to get a buck, theyd also like to strip you for parts and sell you to the highest bidder. your end goal is to put and end to these two dark factions once and for all, but since its an rpg you wont actually ever put a stop to them. the graphics are a dream to look at, at least if you have a good enough graphics card. there is a crafting system in this game, but they manage to make it fit and not seem like a useless addon to fit in with the latest trend, though youll find yourself grinding for hours for that one rare resource that just doesnt want to spawn for you. you really dont have to spend any money on this game seeing as the crafting sytem allows you to build almost all of the items, though you do have to pay for slots for more weapons, warframes, sentinels, and kubrows. the game does suffer from some bugs, ranging from silly graphical errors, to not allowing you to progress in a mission. all in all id say this is a game that is at least worth a try.",2
"if you liked destiny you will love this its destiny... but better alot better the game is butiful and the enviroment is emerseve gamplay is great if you like being a ninja if you a rambo kind of guy that wont work well for you it has a bite of bugs not game brakers but small wtf moments. its a bit of a disapointment for me that theres not alot of things to buy cause you need a member ship witch is 50 dollors witch is the lest you can go give it a try i recomened it but if you cant stand bugs then not so much of a good game for you.hey at least its free",1

"very good game ! ive played also on the ps4 and it rocks !! i recommend it 100%",1
"this is a game about running around with guns and swords slaughtering everything that moves, and farming to get more cool guns, swords, and suits. its fun, if you like that kind of thing. its free, and you can trade other players to get the real-money currency (platinum), so you can get everything (even the cosmetics) without spending a dime.",3
"such a good game its free to play so keep in mind that it has flaws, it has very good grafics for it being a free to play,nice lore,characters, lots of weapons and a bunch of ther  :p but if you dont like to grind then this game is not for you the game is hard at first because you have a hard time finding people to do the first missions so keep that in mind but once you get the game and how it is you will find everything very easy",1
"excelent for a free game. could easily be singleplayer just as much as it is multiplayer.",1
"was so excited about this game that i overplayed it, and it didnt take too long until i got bored. would still recommend it, if you wanna ruin your life. 10/10",1
"this is the first free to play game that i have ever spent money on. normally these kind of games would have to pry my money out of my cold, dead hands, but this game. wow. excellent graphics, lots of different game modes (aka mission types), cool music, lots of awesome guns, swords, blades...the list goes on. this is a 3rd person co--op space ninja shooter/slasher. theres parkour elements (with parkour 2.0 coming up), sneaking (thanks to spy missions 2.0), 3-d space flight (think zone of the enders), intense boss fights, awesome endless missions in survival and defense, and the list goes on. and you know the best part? its totally free. and there is no paywall. in-game currency can be earned by going to void missions, then gaining and selling prime weapons in trade chat. ive head of players gaining something like 5,000 platinum from this method, which is more than enough to buy you 2 of almost everything. however, on the negative side, while there is no paywall, there is a grindwall. void missions require keys, which are dropped from regular missions and as rewards from low tier void missions. once you get the key you want, and complete the mission, there is a list of 4-8 possible rewards you might get, so trying for the blueprint for that new frame that just came out can be a bit....trying at times. however, it is absolutely worth it. every frame (aka character), every weapon, and every game mode and map can be accessed without paying a cent. how many other f2p games can say that?",7
"best game ive ever played, like it more than titanfall. just, hell yea is all i have to say",1
"this game is very fun the controls are tight and responsive (sometimes it glitches out and you die but oh well) but! its free to play but pay to win you cant get cool stuff unless you pay or play for 1500+ hours seriously look at some of the other reviewers hours played its insane. i also dont feel there is enough stuff on the market. all in all i would give this game a 8/10 i will play it (bows and throwing knives are cool in this game) but not very often.",1

"its pretty, well-designed, enjoyable and has lots of lovely weapons with which you can run around doing murders for kicks. however, it is an mmo and will likely eat your soul. that said, at least it doesnt try too hard to extort money out of you with microtransactions. if you work hard, literally anything (except the founders pack, which is basically just a reskin of the old newb kit and some other, non-gameplay-affecting stuff) the game has to offer is available to you. 9.5/10 would consign life to endless grinding again",2

"great graphics and gameplay, simply amazing at what people can do, this gives you that exact thought. this game is not p2p at all, some of my friends were payyed platinum (which is the special currency) for joining a clan, just to be like a spotlight to get more players to join. this is a great game, i hope that the company keeps up the great work on this game, and by the way, the only way to make it more awsome, is to be able to set up a base or home which your friends can visit, not like the dojo though, make it so that you can set up small bases, and have the styles like grineer, corpus, orokin, or just basic tenno. i promise the creators, many of the players that disliked this game for the repeated missions and over-powered enemies, would come back to this game in a heartbeat to try this out for themselves!",1

"of all the f2p games that flood the steam market, warframe is the one that keeps coming back again and again. the beautiful graphics, amazing gameplay, and unique arsenal of weapons gives the player a truly special feel to their story. each warframe is suited to certain playstyles, and all (except one) are legitimatly obtainable. the fact that this game is in no way pay to win makes it that much better than its competitors. it can be tough, but i have been playing since the early days of this game and have seen just how amazing it has become. absolutly recomend to any looking for a great game with no monitary investment required!",3
"a true ninja has only good things to say about this game.",2

"it feels pretty unfair to play this game for free and this is the only free to play game out of the hundreds ive tried that i can honestly say this about. its like borderlands 2 with way clearer graphics, smoothness, better combat, accuracy, feel, speed, and polish. i have a very old pc built almost 9 years ago. e8650 intel cpu and geforce gtx 260 and it runs in high quality faster than every other fps i own. its like crysis graphics at quake live speeds. your character is capable of wall running, climbing, covering vast distances with leaps and summersault techniques, stealth ambush kills, sniping, shotty action, smgs, swords, whips, chains, the whole bit. enemies are fun to kill. they arent extremely difficult to kill but have unpredictable behavior which makes them fun to kill. the only reason you would not like this game is if you do not like killing things at high speeds or not a sci-fi fan. theyve even added wings you can farm and attatch to your character for free roaming or trench diving 3d combat in space missions.",1
"this game is pay to win but you acn have some fun without paying",3

(yass!) great graphics (i mean amazing!) great controls (wish you can change it thought :/ ) good theme (the story line is actual interesting) combat is fantastic (the system is pretty fair) its playable for the people who doesnt want to spend money. (not like other free games :) wish i can say the same for other free games ;-;) cons you play this game by yourselff most of the time becasue almost nobody will play with you and its really difficult to beat the level by yourself because its meant for co-op. (its makes me rage! because its overly difficult sometimes and i feel lonely ;-;) let there be a easier way to get platinum plz! (i spend my on a skin when i thought it was a weapon!)",1
"mass effect-ish aesthetic + monster hunter crafting + ninja style parkour & movement + customizable weapons anad abilities = warframe. lots of farming and grinding, specialized frames with different abilities including healing, aoe, projectiles, stuns, confusion etc. plenty of different kind of guns, from rifles to shotguns, smgs and pewpew laser rifles, weird fleshy gas and needle guns, a huge variety of melee weapons; theres a lot of different ways to vary your combat. its free-to-play, and i wouldnt say that its pay-to-win, unless your idea of winning is just getting everything as fast as possible. you can pay nothing and attain much and more. you can never spend platinum on catalysts and reactors (because you can get several per month just through alerts and livestream game-wide giveaways) and still put up a fight, you can still participate in the void, you can actually contriute during events, during high level defense, survival, dark sectors etc. youve just got to be good. lastly, do not be fooled by its actiony display; this is as close to an mmorpg as a third person shooter can get, and expect to spend time learning and reading from the wiki and the forums. find a clan, get to know people, learn where to go to attain what you want, then spend hours shooting, killing and earning credits, items and crafting components. if all that sounds like fun, you have absolutely no reason not to be playing warframe.",10
"great game, get ready to grind and grind and grind though.",1
"about what you would expect from a free to play game, long boring tedium, unless you feel like forking over some real money. its mostly a lot of mazes where you fight a bunch of identical enemies before moving onto the next area. rinse and repeat.",1
"this game was fun, but this is game gets too grindy as you reach higher levels. for the first 100 hours, i was having the time of my life. then the game became way too repetitive and i decided to stop playing it. its a fun game, and should be tried but the players shouldnt expect the game to be a mirrors edge in space, but rather a splinter cell like game on drugs.",3
"reaaaly fun game if you have friends to play it with (can be confusing at first)",1
"fun game with big updates, lots of different weapons with some different functions, interesting play style, lots of thing to modify, time consuming, relys mostly on internet and some of it on friends to help you out, managed to solo quite a bit, pets , appearance, helpful... ness etc. basicly its pretty good",6
"awesome. one word to simply put it. but if you want more details..a great review would be. imagine having a fun life, going out with friends, seeing the sun, learning in school. remove all that. if you get addicted with this game youll start  where you eat. i  you not.",1

"cool game. really nice graphics and alright game play.",1
"as i play this game i find myself more and more wraped up in this collection of items and this felling of completing the entire world that de has layed out upon us. though at times things can get grindy there are always those moments when you paly and hours will pass and it feels like minuets. this is the type of game one would most likely welcome to the market. and some might say that oh its a pay to win, well thats not the case one can easily complete the game without paying it just takes longer and even though it takes longer that in itself is the glory of it. it gives one hours of replayability and makes the standard for most f2p games the ability to do everything yet if one wants to contribute to the company can pay not to be better but to get items faster. this is why i regaurde warframe as a great game for there customer support and the hours of replayability one can have with it.",3

"i loved the game. with sci-fi influences and the rpg style, this game is just great to play. i feel that this game could use serious work, however. the evolution engine stopped working for my computer. i never ha any problems with the engine before, but recently nothing worked. i even sent my computer to a programmer in order to fix it. it worked for a little while but then it was back to nothing. i had to delete the game so it wasnt taking up space. i was very sad about this. i really think with lots of improvement, the developers of this game could add things and maybe make it 1st person. they could really get more players if they fixed some bugs.",1

"can i use steam wallet to purchase warframe platinum? help please",3
"this game is quite fun, with decent gameplay mechanics, and an ok story. however, if you would like to play with your friends, on the multiplayer game, then be prepared for at least an hour of attempting to get into a squad with your friend, and get into a match, just to disconnect at the last second. also, be prepared to spend several hours gathering vast amounts of resources that have a infinitesimal drop chance, or pay enormous amounts of real money for things you want.",1

"very good game, ive only played four hours so far, and not even past the missions to repair my ship (which is basically tutorial, but still very fun). only thing ive noticed no one really comments on, is the fact that this game is better played with an xbox controller hooked up to the pc, otherwise, its still fun, but a right pain in the  sometimes, and you can just manouver so much better with an xbox controller, this game is the reason im buying a wireless reiciever, and i dont mind, jsut wish i could have one teleported to me :p upgrading is fun, crafting is fun, sci fi theme looks great, powers are great, bows that stick people to walls, swords that cut people up, and guns that blast people to , enjoy :)",1

"one of the best free-to-play co-op games out there! it has amazing graphics, the content is plenty and new stuff coming out all the time, and its not as a pay-to-win game as some critics tend to say it is. you are allowed to buy some stuff with money, but eventually you get them anyway. its a farming game, but thats a part of what this category is. if youre looking for something like cod or tf2 youre in the wrong place. if not, welcome to the community! overall score: 9/10",1

"pick up run-and-gun squad based shooter..great fluid animations, stunning graphics and plenty of sci-fi futuristic action with a splash of blood. im digging it :)",1
"very impressive f2p game. the controls take a little getting used to but are tight overall. this is a beatiful game with large almost overwhelming areas to explore. you do come back down to earth eventually because the large areas are reused enough to take away a bit of the novelty. new areas and ways to play the game open to extend your enjoyment. this is necessary because the repetitve grinding does have the potential to get boring. the new areas, guns, ect probably do not come fast enough though. make sure you go into this cyber ninja sci-fi epoch with a co-op partner that wont bail on you and you have to cry yourself to sleep in you stasis pod. 6.5/10",1

"[eng] even if this game is not an open-world one, its very flexible, its not so boring and youll enjoy it step by step :) its true that there are some weapons/equip for platinum (real money), but you dont really need to spend anything. i just love this game :3 [ita]anche se questo gioco non  un open-world,  veramente flessibile, non  cos noioso ed  da gustarselo pian piano :) anche se ci sono armi/equip a pagamento, non  necessario spendere soldi veri. personalmente a me piace davvero tanto questo gioco :3",2
"ninjas play free. but ninjas pay to look cool. or suffer hours of building. 90/10 best game since apb reloaded gun system.",1
"a bit grindy , but i like that. lots of fun to be had and lots of hours to spend. definitely something you can play when you are bored.",8
"great graphics, intense combat, and easy to learn controls the graphics are really nice, which is one of the main reasons i love this. i dont have a killer pc, but i could get my settings up pretty high without dropping too many frames. other games need this",1
"lets first go with what i enjoy of warframe. 1. i love the story. 2. i love the powers. 3. i really like the weapon choices. 4.i like the multiplayer! 5. i like the warframe choices! now lets go ever what i dislike about the game. 1. you have to pay real currency to get anything great. 2. for the ftp, almost nothing is available. 3. i dislike how much the dlcs cost. really, pay $100 just to have the tenno pack?!?!?! in all, i think i enjoy the game as a ftp person. i am warning you guys though, dont get surprised when you see the stuff you will be missing on.",1
"how to rek the ai skrubs: get the grakata equip it with faster firing, faster reloding, bigger magazines, higher damage and ammo conversion get akimbo vipers equip it with mods that are pistol version for the mods i said for the grakata now go out there and spray. this game is hard but fun.",1
"this game was very very smooth gameplay and worked perfectly online multiplayer.",1
"played this game entirely too much about 9 months ago, came back and its still just as fun! yay for new content",5
"really awesome game, and the best part is its free!!! after playing for about 4 hours by yourself it might seem to get a little boring, but thats only if you play by yourself (which i never do). the multiplayer is boss! if you have internet then this game you must have.",1
"this game is amazing! when it says space ninjas it isnt kidding. you can do all these facing manuevers and have access to all these different weapons and abilities. the melee is well fleshed out too. my only problem is that its grindy, hard to play alone, and actually sorta forces you to choose a specific warframe. you actually have a choice of three, but one of them you cant get for free otherwise (volt).",1
"this game is worth every second, minute, hour, day or whatever. it has every element that i like in this but, (this might not apply to some) sometimes the connection times out. sometimes it happens more than needed but it might just be me. there is a money system and there is always those people who use real life money to influence there own gameplay, so there is the im just going to buy it instead of working for it kind of people. then some of the higher ranking people like to come into lower ranking missions and it messes up with the lower ranking person actually ranking up. but try not to let that bother you because it is most likely going to happen if you play public. dont worry you can play public, friends only, invite only and solo. just to let you know, there are some missions it might get too dificult for solo so try making some friends in there. this is also not a completly finished game so they are doing updates and adding very nice features. overall this is a very nice game and i do recommend this, so give it a shot! (in this review, if i offended anyone i do appologize in advance)",4
"the thing that pisses me off is that you have one guy and that if you  up you cant get it fixed. i screwed up the mod process and now i need like a 10th google email and . this is what happens when there is no flexability.",1
"great game , keeps you busy. you will always find something do.",1
"this ing game man seriously i mean its good but the ing ranking up  is so annoying what the !!!!! i keep on failing for no particular ing reason theres no timer on my ing screen i didnt miss a shot i didnt use any other ing weapons what is making me fail?? good game tho c:  you anyways!",1
"if you want to go kill some random aliens/ robots / infested werid things , spamming your bullets and upgrading then repeating over and over to collect stuff, then you wil like this as a time waster game. but for me, the whole repeate the same misssion 10 times to collect 1 thing bores me. so i moved on. overall 6/10",2
"this is one of my favourite games to play when i have time to play",1
"1.graphics and animations stunning graphics with beautiful realistic fighting animation, especially during melee combat. the computer requirement is also a little bit high due to the graphics quality. 2.sound nothing special. 3.pay to win ? no, but it requires you to play a lot in order to get the good things. of course, if you pay, youll get things much faster. the only downside in the pay to win system is the colors. youll only get dreadful colors if you dont pay. 4.gameplay extremely and overwhelmingly boring. i almost fell asleep each time im leveling my things, and thats basically what youre gonna do all the time. i got a tiny lil bit of fun when i play co-op with 3 of my friends,though. other than that, the gameplay is horrifyingly dreadful. ok,it has got cool animations,yes,itll make you feel like an invincible space ninja. but come on, spending 30 minutes each mission just to hit aliens from the roof ? seriously ? its dead boring. i had fun for my first 100 hours though. after that ? this game has become some kind of lullaby rather than a game.",2
"its a great game but right now i can,t log on and it is a little bugged the most of the time im playing cuz you find glitches every where!",4
"katana-wielding cyberninjas in funny helmets in space. also lazers. 10/10 potatoes.",3
"the game is interesting,but a very good computer is needed to run it.",1
"its a good game but it gets repetetive for a while but i would rate it 7 out of 10 for gameplay and cinematic effect. i would recommend this game to everyone because the plot is good and the whole game is pretty mch customizeable to a certain degree.",1
"super fun game with or without friends, you can charge in guns blazing or sneak around stealthily assasinating people from behind and you dont need a beefy computer(just turn off motion blur) 10/10",1
"have you ever wanted to be a ninja. no you say. still get this game",1
"this is a great tps game, packed with dlc and tons of costomization options.",1
"i made a steam account a while ago, but am just now getting into the pc gaming scene. overall, this game is pretty good: it looks nice, and plays well. id definitely recommend it to others. one small problem i had was the back/exit button in the menus. it would sometimes not function or be missing entirely. if this were fixed, id have less need to quit and re-open the game. also, i noticed while the extraction animation is playing, theres a slight lean in the tennos upper body.",1
"warframe is a grinding game but if you have ocd you will love it lol. i like the fact that you have to work hard to get stuff ingame, and that you can get everything that people pay for that adds any advantages in game for free by grinding. graphics are really nice and up to date. game is full of bugs. dx11 is bugged on my rig (apu). dx9 works great imo.game crashes alot and will just freeze rendomly. a good bit of the time you get dropped from games and lobbys for no reason. it can be a challenge somtimes to get in a game ive noticed after playing 180 + hours. the community is awesome and friendy. devs are always updating and active with the community so thats a good thing. overall this game is a blast when it works right and i highly recommend it. i plan on playing this game for a long time.",3
"its a good game dont get me wrong, but the amount of farming just kinda shuts it down for me. that, and on top of the waiting time to even make the item you worked so hard for just irritates me. if you can get past that then you can enjoy the whole jumping off walls thing you can do.",1
"byfar one of the best free to play titles out there. looks great, feels great, runs great, tons of fun. its best to play with friends but usually you can matchmake where there are other players. the game takes skill. id give it a 4/5 only because some of the recent updates i did not care for, but its still a damn good game. much better than say a call of duty game.",1
"....... dont even know what to say anymore.......... .......life ruin......never fell in love.......... .......so much gore......so awsome.......so.....ninjas...... .......12......outta 10..........",1
"a bit money driven, but definitely fun to get your friends to get together and kick serious butt!",1
"the game is one of the bests but it could be better like if they didnt add archwing and if they focused more over some bugs that keep destroyng the gameplay",5
"really fun game play it live it, breath it. realize its ruining your life dont care.",1
"this game taught me business acumen platinum/10 would trade again - ign",8
"this game has some very fun features, but high learning curve if you do not have experienced friends to help you. get some friends to help you if you want to play this game, make like more enjoyable.",3
"i totally ask people to try this game out if you havent try it yet it a cool game you get to but weapon get warframes but you need to collect iteams to build the weapons..",1
"absolutely spectacular, there is nothing more rewarding then obtain a new warframe, and levelling it. if you dont like it, go die in a hole. or dont.",3
"when you first play this game, youll just be amazed at how beautiful it can be, then it all turns to a grindfest that hooks you in and never lets you go. 1,000 hours in and im still grinding away something. but honestly the game burn out can get out of hand, find something soothing to play inbetween grind sessions. also, play with friends, soloing all the time will bring your spirits down. the community is generally really nice and willing to help.",10
"im mixed, leaning more towards positive. the game is fun, although it is sort of pay to win. pros -it looks nice -gameplay is fun and rewarding -fast paced cons -pay to win -waiting times -a bit too easy for my liking",1
"the conclusion of this game is your a biotic ninja that does lots of really cool stuff.",1
"really enjoyable game. takes a while to farm stuff and level up, but it is very fun.",1
"the gamepad support of this game is one of the worst ive ever seen. half the menus are unaccessible with a controller.",1
"takes a bit of grinding, but you can get absoloutely everything for free or trade for it. fantastic graphics, intense action and a great community where the devs frequently interact and talk with the players.",3
"great game, filled with action and fun. fun game to play with friends and make new friends in the process. build your own clan and make it stronger and lager!",1
"mass effect gunplay meets fun and fast slash and dash action, completely free to play, all items can be attained w/o spending a penny, can be played in solo sessions or with up to four person co-op (so if your internet proves to be a problem, you can limit said problem by playing solo). the only real downside being that (as it is still in open beta) there are some glitches. overall, i would say its a fun game that is worth the price of free.",3
"good game. its no as grind heavy as people make it out to seem. sure theres alot of grinding, but its not nearly as bad as a real korean grind heavy mmo. the game is hella fun, but gets boring very quickly due to lack of things to do. its very repetitive, but otherwise good.",4
"ahh, warfarm. its a great 3d-person farming simulator. kidding aside, it has alot of depth to how you can build your frame your guns and pretty much everything. overall if your willing to spend the time (or money) you can get almost everything in the game. each frame has many differant playsyles that they fit into. i am a wallet warrior, and as such i have built every standard frame and i am currently building every single gun. its a fantastic time sink and you can spend months of time if you want to. positive: fun gunplay with super powers! neat locations with interesting monsters/villians. huge amount of weapons, mods and frames. negitive: horrible bugs that are different for nearly every person that plays. building new anythings is time blocked for 12 and up hours at a time, so you cant keep playing endlessly. lack of top teir frames that can survive on metagame levels. overall: do it, enjoy it, and then complain about bugs later! :d",6
"if you like farming for stuff this is the game for you!",1
"awesome game, havnt figured out if its play to win yet",1
"for a free to play game, its about as good as it gets. you got your space ninjas, you got your cool weapons and guns, you got you flips and jumps and mods and all that good stuff. still in the beta so its changing and adapting, but thats a good thing because there is always new stuff coming. platinum is expensive but so is building a game, most definitely worth a try.",6
"pretty great game to play with friend cause without its going to be really hard to start playig longterm also if you have money this game becomes too easy",3
"find someone who explains you game. it was terrible before but friend told me how and whtat to do/collect and it became fun.",3
"yes , a very fun game with aneed of a sense of tps games enjoyed",1
"fps meets rpg and they make a baby called warframe. quite fun for a free game. better then destiny in most aspects.",8
"if you like space ninjas this game is for you ! love playing this with friends",2
"its part fps, part gun collector. when they say its free to play, its not entirely. the restrictions that arise come in the form of weapon and warframe slots, which require some money to expand. the positive side to this, that i think is really great, is that you can get daily rewards that reduce the price of pay currency by 25-50-75%. all together, its a very very fun shooter, with parkour, wall running, melee and tons of guns. the best thing though is de, the company that makes the game. they are top-notch when it comes to updates, and customer care. 9/10 would reccomend to all my friends.",2
"great game but it has a lot of grinding i like i recommend more people should try it but this game is not for everyone. 7.8/10 too much water",5
"you either really love it or really hate it, its kinda like marmalade, even though i dont love marmalade i do love this game, you really do need to put in alot of time into this game before it starts to get fun, but with friends, it really is a fun game 9.7/10",2
"very fun game its not like most game where its pay to win this one paying willhelp but paying doesnt really effect anything cool  game doe",2
"its a great game with great graphics and gameplay thats awesome to play with any friends or people across the globe. you will be immersed into a beatiful world with tons of hours to spend on it. updates give new content to players to keep them on their toes but the grinding might get tiring for some to unlock new experiences. overall i strongly reccomend this game. 100000000000000/10 stars",1
"the game revolves aroung grinding but you never notice or mind the grinding. it always gives you something to do and it has new alerts every 20-30 minutes.",3
"scy fy ninjas in space !!!!!! just try it out its free",3
"this is a really fun game, but it was better in the old version with charge melee and stuf like that some tweeks are nice, but its not all good my opinion 9.5/10 (dont watch my playtime) xd",8
"the game is very fun for a while, but then it gets very repetetive. it also becomes addictive, which is not fun, for various reasons. having to wait real life hours to complete weapons is frustrating and paying to complete them faster or buy the weapon outright will bleed your wallet dry. the devs will try to get your money with prime packs and such. trust me, dont buy these. i havent played a lot since the beta, so things may change, but remember that this game was made to make money. i recommend it for its fun, but the rest almost made me not.",6
"thrilling and challenging third-person originality, loaded with upgrades and customizations enough to keep you engaged past ordinary run n guns. this is a game that genuinely incorporates the best kind of replay value - the fun kind. the only thing more enjoyable than sliding into a group of bad guys flailing a glowing energy staff is doing it with other people. i rate this game 8/10 spaghetti dinners, not just because of microtransactions, but because theyre also ridiculously priced.",1
"ninjas play free and by ninjas, they mean cool, awesome, robot ninjas in a sci-fi universe do i really have to say more?",1
"grinding....like eclipse is on it pretty fun game none the less. its a great time vampire if youre jaded of your other games.",1

"damn a you walk around with a in sword and dress like a real real real sharp  ign/10 - too dank for the game industry",1
"warframe is, in my opinion, unique among third person shooters. the gameplay and graphics are phenomenal and can run on most systems. pros: -graphics are stunning on full but still valiant on low. -a vast selection of weapons, skins, mods and missions. -this game is fantastic for when you are looking for action-packed, parkour-filled gameplay, but is also great to pass the time. -you can choose between singleplayer and multiplayer. -interesting blueprint mechanic where you can craft guns and skins. -every skin or weapon is beautiful no matter what it looks like. -takes on a social aspect e.g clans, parties etc. cons: -requires an internet connection to play. -you will have a better experience if you are willing to contribute funds irl. -microtransactions do not give you the bang for your buck. for example, 3.99 gbp gets you 70 platinum which is the worthiness of a pistol designed for beginners. -the hardest f2p game to progress in that i have encountered. a nice f2p game if you are tired of lousy mobas or cheap, bloodsucking anime money-s.",2
"downloaded it couldnt get it to run went to eat something came back, 11 hours of gameplay gg 11/11",1
"omg this game is soooo coool! would reccommend it for sure",1
"welcome to grinding simulator! this game is awsome, i really recomend it, this is the best free game you will ever find, it even beats games that cost 40$!!! get this game",2
"fun as hell. this game lets you fly and gun, be a mercenary, have superpowers, pull crazy stunts, and will test your reflexes and will,; to put it simply, i love it. would put money into again, 10/10.",3
"warframe is the most fun game that i have played in a very long time. what makes this game so much fun is.....your a mother f****** space ninja but honestly it is just so much fun. it is like someone took assassin creed and mass effect and made them into one very awesome game that just keeps getting bette.",2
"ive played this before, its really fun! i like it, the massive multiplayer, the huge selection of weapons. they need to fix some of the lag. overall i give it a thumbs up",1
"awesome game,awesome concept,but have a little tec difficulties like the mic potion that doest work and in-game camera that stuck after hacking but overall great game and plese make the platinum in idr for easier player acces",2
"this game is awesome. need more spuds 10/10 cant stop playing!",5
"summary: a (free!) third-person sci-fi coop action game. as with many free games are these days, there is a lot of grind involved. but theres also plenty of content that keeps the game enjoyable. worth a try, especially if you have friends who are interested. pros: +youre a freakin space ninja with magical powers. +gameplay is very satisfying. the combat system works great and the visuals are nice. +large variety of weapons and characters, very fun to try out all the new ones. +not pay-to-win. you can collect blueprints for items from missions or buy them with credits you collect from missions; you can trade for the premium currency (platinum) with other players to get any other things you need +active with updates that add more content to explore cons: -story is (so far) very limited. there are bits and pieces of lore from the intro, bosses and item descriptions but that leaves a lot of unanswered questions. -not *as* fun without friends. pugs just arent the same. -repetitive levels. -poor voice acting -certain things very grindy to obtain.",3
"this game is great. the fighting is intense and the set-up of gameplay is well thought out. however, if you choose to play this game, make sure not to rely on paid items and/or more experienced players to get you through missions. i made that mistake and i am now having problems progressing further since the previous planets give less xp than before and newer planets for my account are too difficult to complete. although those mistake could cause major problems for a player, and the though that money was wasted if you bought items and find things too difficult, i completely recommend this game.",1
"a good game for people who likes to grind for resoures in order to get endgame weapons",9
"i do not recommend this game!! this game is not my type of ninja at all! i know it is a future but still a ninja apouse to be stealthy, quite, and never seen. ok the future stuff is fine but forget the lights!! how hard is that?! sorry for yelling but this game...if you are into rambo ninja games then get this or if you are like me that wants to be stealthy, never seen, and yes make your own ninja that levels up with the weapons (aka you dont which sucks hard which that you dont even lack info!!!! what the hell!!! sorry again and i dont approve this game) then you are out of luck, this game is not a ninja even i want to blend in the shadows but basic colors are appouse to be free and the other colors ok i get to be lock but all basic colors are locked, yeah half of the time i go stealthy but my emeny sees me with the lights, here is a thing...do not add lights to your weapons!! i dont care how much it is the future but even a future ninja always be stealthy like the past!! those are my thoughts and fustrations. the atomasher ok but it just lacks the ninja way, be steathly is not the ninja way at all in this game which is not being faithful, i am into a ninja game that i can hide, be stealthy, and yes assassinate but when i need to not in the open where every one can see me. like i said if you want this game and like killing things in the open fine but i dont recommend the game thank you. p.s. i am sorry for yelling through this just need to get out some fustrations",1
"this game is awesome, if you are looking for a fast paced third person combat game that allows you to take the role of a alien space ninja then look no further. another awesome benefit of this game is that everything that has an impact on gameplay while you can purchase for money, you can also obtain in game through hard work, time, and effort. this game keeps pulling me in, and they are always releasing more and more features.",1
"i can only describe this game as one thing, space ninja farm simulator 3082 because the main thing you do in this game is to farm/grind certain missions on certain planets to obtain materials to craft better weapons to allow for more efficient farming. and to obtain new and better warframes you must go borderlands style and kill certain bosses to obtain one of three parts all of which have a random chance at spawning. normally i would not have a probelm with this if it werent for the fact that once you can craft your desired weapon or warframe you have to wait 12-72 hours in real life for them to complete crafting, or you could just spend money and have it instantly. in fact almost all of the weapons and warframes can be bought with actuall money which also kills the main purpose of this game which is to get better weapons and level up.",1
"sorry. but my mind kind of exploded so i cant really tell you much other than you should get it. 10/10 really awesome and has very elaborate details xd",2
"like mass effect but thought... man why cant shepard run on the wall like a ninja cause shepard is a badass like that or i wish there was amazing melee weapons added in. minus the story and all the sex and you have warframe! ive played this for awhile ( on and off again) i highly recommend this to anyone that loves games ( not to mention its a good f2p game) its a great combination of ninjas and gunplay. features a great many warframes to play ( classes) you start with 1 of 3 in the begining ( volt, excalibur, and mag) you can buy the others via platnium ( real cash ) or credits and build the parts yourself. i hope to see you future fellow tenno out in the galaxy!",2
"i killed the stalker so ing hard he actually died.",2
"one of the best free games ive played so far. it gives you the choice of 1 of 3 warframes and from there it sends you right into the tutorial, and part of the story, picking up the basics and weapons. after the initial tutorial, it continues to help you understand the other parts like modifications and upgrades, all based around the story. now the combat is purely amazing, from stealthily murdering everything bow and arrow or go in rushing with a rifle to mow everything down, whatever way you want to play, the game lets you. overall 10/10 for what the game is supposed to be.",1
"ive played this agme for 40 hours on xbox one and started playing this game on pc so i know what kind of game this si even though i have low playtime on pc. anyways, warframe has to be one of the best 3rd person shooters ever made. fresh gameplay, cool graphical style and really good graphics that run even on a low-end gaming pcs. theres just one thing i dont like about. this game has to be one of the best f2p games since you can get pretty much anything for free. but weapon slots and warframe slots are pretty limited. you get 50 free platinum which i should be used on a couple of arframe/weapon slots. you can get more platinum with real money and the price of the platinum isnt really that cheap. people wanting to buy cosmetics will have to use pretty high amounts of money. overall, one of the best game ive played! and that takes a lot. i dont really like current gen games but warframe has to be the best game that has been released in the past 5 years.",2
"ninjas play free! so... so im a ninja? *takes shuriken* die!!! the game is pretty good. its different from other games. not something you would find for free.",1
"a pretty interesting interface, but currently, i dont really see much that you dont see in the average tps. currently i dont reccomend.",1
"indeed this game is a bit hard for understanding and ofc its pay to win a little bit but its realy intersting game for those who play fps in space ^^ so i recommend this game and yes its nice game !!",1

"hands down most aaa completely free-to-play on steam. next to tf2 and dota2.",1
"this game has heavily influenced my switch from the generic mmo rpg to the action-rpg format that i once hated, but now enjoy more than anything, other than premaridal affairs ;). the textures and postprocessing in warframe prove to keep the player immersed in the games universe for hours on end, as well as the sound track. originally when i was made aware of the cross-platform title i cringed, but as they proved this was both possible and able to be done properly. i give kudos to those who labored for years to make this possible. thank you to the production team and the programmers who made this game, the masterpiece that it is. i will be logging in as soon as my steam client is up to date.",1
"a collectors game. i love bows, so when i finished my bow collection, i quit... i login to view my bows everyday.",2
"i really like this game because of all of the stuff that you can do, you can play with your friends, unock a metric crap ton of items, have a companion, and many more things. plus the gameplay is amazing along with the graphics and animations. if you have not tried this then i recommend playing this amazing looking, fun playing, very addictive, mmo shooter.",1

"i love the game i cant say anything bad about it other than they need to fix the loading bug when it stops its so annoyeing",1
"this game is a ninja alien third person shooter... 11/10 would ninja again",1
"an awesome space ninja simulator in which farming and grinding is actually fun. trust me it is. the graphics are just so awesome with little flashy and glowing lights and stuff. too bad the devs are updating the prime equipments looks for the sake of people with  pcs (a prime is an enhanced version or a weapon or character thats usually white or black with a gold trimming that normally was reflective and shiny, now it looks like cheap plastic.)",5
"the game can be very addicting and very fun to play, always a fun time shooting things in the face or slicing them to bits. but after the grinding and getting parts and having to wait days to get a new warframe gets a bit repetitive and not much fun.",4
"biggest update ive ever seen! its huge and there is not one time where i cant find a game online! the game became huge!",1
"well after playing this game for some time i thought it would be time to wright a review. it my not be my most played game but it very good free to play. okay they is abit of a pay to win but it not that bad because the prime items u cant buy but you can have hour of fun with youre mate. i would give this game an 8/10",1
"this game, this game... ive grinded so hard to make my puerto rican  experience as good as it can get. if you have the time to farm for certain items and you like being a loothoarder then this game is for you. i always find new and interesting stuff in this game. and for added bonus it has a load of gliches",1
"this game is super fun and addictive the fisrt 100 hours. there is so much content its crazy for a f2p game. thats the reason i give it the thumbs up, it gave me an awesome experienc for so long. later though, i want to do more missions that are pretty deep in the maps. i cant do them alone and i the problem is that no one is doing them. its so frustrating not being able to do any missions that you need to do late in the game. its because there are so many missons to do on so many planets that finding a player doing the exact same mision at the exact sametime is nearly immpossible. its extremely awnnoying but it wont happen at first because all the new players are doing the missions you need to do.",3
"they should fix their download & update servers ! its downloading 50kb/s and my internet is 3mb/s ! and its always frozes when verifying download cache come.",1
"this game revolves around being a space ninja, how much more awesome can it get. though the accesories cost an arm and a leg, it doesnt effect gameplay whatsoever. highly reccomended.",1

"if your reading the reviews and see reviews about you having no life after playing this game, they were right. i was like when i first saw this game like hmph a game cant ruin a life. oh boy was i wrong. started playing got addicted to it. you want to quit but seeing all these fancy equipments makes you go play more. so far i have 9.7 hours on this and i started 2 days ago.",1
"the best game you will ever play. fun on so many levels but challenging in all the others. you will have fun as you struggle through the rankings and as you unlock more frames you will notice a different side to the game as you see that its about choosing the right frame for the job. where as it may involve a limbo, one of the newer warframes, in a pvp where you just send one enemy at a time and pvp that way. or you could play the other side of it where you might want to play a nekros on defense to get a alot of loot really fast with the ability desecrate in the story mode. either way you have so many variations to choose from so much customization and abilities to pick from. i completely recommend this game and i cant wait to battle on beside you.",3

"a gritty zombie survival set in a near distant future. in the early game you must raise your zerglings while last hitting minions to ensure you get maximum exp. the story has branching dialogue trees with strong moral choices, do you want to let aiden go mental, or bide your time and unleash the power of your thuum. can you stop hugo from destroying arkham city? will you let benny get away with shooting you? can you defeat the elite four? all these question can be answered by solving the games many puzzles, and rising up against the looming threat of the tyranids. on the specs side of the game, it made me purchase a fourth gtx titan to achieve the ultra quality. it burnt out my 64gbs of ram. before buying this game, remember to watercool your entire house, it heats up your gpu about ten times more than far cry 3 on ultra.",1

"while this game has a lot of potential, its been in beta for a very long time(2 yrs ish). there are stil a lot of bugs that can really screw with your efforts to play(and retain what you have earned). the chat code is written in flash apparently and so you cannot copy/paste with any ease(and a bug can result in you copy/paste funtions from windows no longer working until you reboot), you can also be kicked by the code from chat. there are no female/male versions of the warframes, they are all gender assigned and stuck that way. the only way to get some prime warframes are to pay, and if you didnt pay when the wf was offered it could be gone forever, there are some prime wfs you cannot get through normal play. the trade system does prevent credit farming, but its only available for a limited set of items to trade. resources, non-prime wf pieces and wfs themselves are not tradable. i had stopped playing this game for about 11 months and came back to a lot of great changes that have really added depth to the game(including trading) and while i wouldnt say the game is pay to win i would say its pay to win-quicker-than-not-paying. when this game is finally in a release form i will probably revisit my review.",7
"this is the best free game i have ever played. imagine if metroid was an online game where each and everyone could travel together or alone and just, well, do what ever the hell you want! in fact, this is my favorite game of all time! yes, there are things only real money can buy, but there are free was around that! you can get almost everything for fake money if you figure out how! just like me! i never bought a warframe, i just farmed for parts and built it myself! 11/10 dankest  ever. -ign",3
"played this game a lot when i didnt have any friends to vc and play with, grinded pretty hard but never got past the casual area of gameplay, still hardly got past that point. with friends this game gets a lot easier to farm and do higher level stuff because you have some sort of coordination, until i decide to play vauban built for bounce.",6
"one of the best squad-based mmo 3rd person shooters out there! like any mmo, it takes quite some time to get to the good part. its not very story driven like a solo game because its mostly enjoyed when you play with other people. dont get me wrong though, there is some story to it if you invest some time to read up on the codex. but seriously, youd definitely enjoy the combat in this game. fast-paced ninja slice, dice and gun action! im a collector, and this game gives you that itch to collect a ton of weapons! dont be daunted by the f2p/p2w model. its definitely not pay to win. there are players out there who dont even need to spend a cent to buy what they want, they just farm stuff in-game and sell them to other players via the trading systems in their dojos. free plat, boiiii! the community of wf is great! the devs are even better. they listen to the community because they would love to see this game grow into its true potential. that alone makes me want to support them even more. if youre not a fan of the genre, atleast give it a try -- a few hours or so, then decide. im gonna bet its gonna be worth your while. hey, when it comes down to it, it may or may not be for you. but what youre getting is a free awesome space ninja game with tonnes of people who are farming for them sweet sweet loot. if that doesnt sound badass, then i dont know what is! 10/10 *the bugs are there, every game has it. dont worry, they fix a lot of them regularly. just hang in there.",8
"after just 90 minutes of playtime im impressed with this free to play shooter and offers just as much enjoyment as games such as dead space 3 and mass effect 3 ..... being a free to play game i was initially expecting a average game with a sad storyline and mediocre graphics but instead i was greeted with a amazing shooter with some impressive gameplay ..... i wont go too deep but warframe is a no-brainer and even the updates dont take too long ... so what are you waiting for ..... download and install today !",1
"its so funnnnnnnnnn on a serious note it is a very fun space/ninja 3rd person fps/hack and slash game everything is setup to run as groups of up to 4 tenno (players) co-oping against enemy ai to complete missions ranging from assassinations to wave based defense missions. if you like running around with friends killing mobs of enemies and unlocking new weapons/warframes/pets then this game is for you. even if you are interested in a stealth ninja experience many additions have made this possible although it is much harder to stay undetected than running in killing everything",4
"the game will be good, possibly, at some point. changes are very slow, and the developers are bad with priorities. it has some strong points, but ultimately key issues are ignored for long periods of time. recomendation: come back later.",8
"mass effect-ish aesthetic + monster hunter crafting + ninja style parkour & movement + customizable weapons anad abilities = warframe. lots of farming and grinding, specialized frames with different abilities including healing, aoe, projectiles, stuns, confusion etc. plenty of different kind of guns, from rifles to shotguns, smgs and pewpew laser rifles, weird fleshy gas and needle guns, a huge variety of melee weapons; theres a lot of different ways to vary your combat. its free-to-play, and i wouldnt say that its pay-to-win, unless your idea of winning is just getting everything as fast as possible. you can pay nothing and attain much and more. you can never spend platinum on catalysts and reactors (because you can get several per month just through alerts and livestream game-wide giveaways) and still put up a fight, you can still participate in the void, you can actually contriute during events, during high level defense, survival, dark sectors etc. youve just got to be good. lastly, do not be fooled by its actiony display; this is as close to an mmorpg as a third person shooter can get, and expect to spend time learning and reading from the wiki and the forums. find a clan, get to know people, learn where to go to attain what you want, then spend hours shooting, killing and earning credits, items and crafting components. if all that sounds like fun, you have absolutely no reason not to be playing warframe.",10
"great game, get ready to grind and grind and grind though.",1
"about what you would expect from a free to play game, long boring tedium, unless you feel like forking over some real money. its mostly a lot of mazes where you fight a bunch of identical enemies before moving onto the next area. rinse and repeat.",1
"this game was fun, but this is game gets too grindy as you reach higher levels. for the first 100 hours, i was having the time of my life. then the game became way too repetitive and i decided to stop playing it. its a fun game, and should be tried but the players shouldnt expect the game to be a mirrors edge in space, but rather a splinter cell like game on drugs.",3
"whoever made this game was like, lets make a game, in a futurestict setting, with guns and swords, and everybody can build asian style gardens... in space.",3
"well made system and game play , although alot of bugs need to be fix",3
"worth the money i put into it had tons of fun with friends id say its worth it. its not for everyone though there is some grinding for items but thats all the better once you make the weapons and stuff you did it for. lots of lvling if youre into that and different ways to buff out your character or weapons. as well as pets.",5
"edit: this went from fun, to just a drag now. its the same old thing over and over, and now the events they run are boring as well. there is no real point to doing anything when you realize 90% of it is there to make it take forever. fun shootem up but the intro grind really sucks. once you get past that, the new market makes it much easier to get going. need a clan for some of the better weapons, but the blueprints in the market are good as well, if not a bit expensive starting out.",4

"missions are easy with a group, its boring as hell by yourself, fun with friends, an extreamly helpful and overall great community, sadly you either need to grind like hell to get your favorite warframes or weapons, or invest some cash to get them, still recomend tho. :)",4
"still love the game, the events are amazing but the first part of the game can be sluggish when youre fresh out of the cryopod and you test out one of the high end missions you feel like a weakling but after a while you get used the the way the game works you grab new weapons and try new things you become stronger, better, smarter, faster. a team really helps so id suggest starting with a friend or finding a group to play with. once youve done that the game will go by and youll set goals for yourself like i want x warframe or y weapon and you can do it you can get almost all the content in this game for free. some items you can only get through hard work, and i think thats amazing. so really the question is why are you reading reviews instead of downloading this game and climbing to the top?",8

"i enjoyed this game. it was fun and refreshing break from some of the other games i was playing at the time i found it (mobas mostly). unfortunatly what i remember from the beta and what im now seeing in game are two very different things. when i first played this game you had three warframe slots and three warframes you could choose from. the blink assassin dude, the tank, and the standard warrior warframe. now when i log in to play, and its been a while since i have, all i see is paying to unlock damn near everything in the game except for maybe weapons. weve gone from having three warframe slots to 2. the only warframe you can unlock with exp (that i saw) was the tank; although you can buy warframe blueprints with in game currency (which doesnt do you much good if you dont have the slots for it). so we have warframe slots locked behind a paywall, all the other warframes locked behind a paywall. also almost all customisation items are also locked behind a paywall. i can not recommend this game until the warframes and warframe slots are taken from behind the pay wall.",1
"good graphics, boring looking gameplay, bad storyline.",1

"wasted potential: the game. you might think that youre coming into a nice game about space ninjas, but what yore really going to get is a run-and-gun shooter with -grinding to unlock other forms of grinding to get weapons and warframes that require grinding to have something strong enough to survive the endgame grinding -a painful lack of endgame -an unbalanced set of characters that have any fun or redeeming qualities nerfed the moment theyre noticed -dull level design that both is empty enough so that players just rush through to the objective, but with just enough thrown in there to break the pacing -a loot pool so diluted that any chance of getting something useful is about as good as your computer being lined with gold on the inside -an inconsistent aestetic that will leave you wondering what the games trying to accomplish -and a set of moderators that will not-so-subtly shut down any negative feedback on their forums. i want to like this game. i really do. the fact that ive put so much time into it shows how im willing to bet it on the next big update. but as it is, its like watching a good friend get sicker and sicker.",9

"for me its a good game, a slightly different style of playing/fighting than i am used to. only been playing it a week and have 90 hours and yet i have barely scratched the surface of the game. prolly about 1-2 % of the game content from what i can see. volt is the best starter i think. choose the staff, not the sword.",8

"lets see uh im a casual gamer looking for some games worthy to play on and eventually my friends urged me to try warframe. ive got good reviews from them so i tried and i think its kind of worthy to play with.and holycheeseballs i fell in love with its good graphics, a third person point of view which is good (and oh guns i freakin love guns omg) , the warframes are very sleek and promising (not to mention the warframe ladies has nice builds and butts omg), each warframe is unique and they have their own signature of moves and powers. choosing a warframe from a pool of them is exciting, make sure that you feel connected just by the first look of that warframe. amazingly , you are actually making your own story like destinys on your own hands with this game. and oh, i literally got hooked up(i mean who doesnt??! *hyperventilates) and theres no turning back when youre on the run so good luck. tenno-speed.",2
"this game is awesome gunplay feels great and melee combat is executed perfectly ,even though it may be overpowered when charged and the enviroments will be reused over and over again but still its worth playing and it can be played alone forcing the player to choose his/her battles wisely also space ninjas what more could i say about that",1
"awsome game, fun coop experience, movement and fighting mechanics a smooth and fluid, you can get every single item with-out paying a penny but the farming sometimes gets repetitive, very interesting story arc. 9.5/10",2
"a f2p game done right. you can basically get almost everything presented in the game and playing it is addicting as hell. although it can be grindy in more ways than one (which is annoying most of the time) i still would recommend this to anyone willing enough to sacrifice their soul to warframe",3
"after about 2 years of not playing this game i picked it up in desperation for something to play so i chose this game. now i though this game was boring for a number of reasons then but now its gotten great i played mor than 10 hour in one day with a friend and had a blast we found pinning ragdolls to walls espacilly entertaing.... a lot of fun gamplay + stealth system to some extend made it even more fun since i love stealth. things are actually buyable before it was ohh no you need 5.000.000 million credits for this items and no half the shet wasent even buyable with out the payable platinum. thats still and issue though as half the stuff costs plat but there are weapons wich are buable like blueprints if taken the time can give you eny weapon desired in the game unless its a print witch need a plat only weapon but for most part 90% all items availible for free runners like my self. i recomend you try it one more time if you where like me and peace out brah.",1

"what has made me super happy: - the game. its a lot of fun. - graphics are awesome, gameplay is smooth, and ninja robots. - good variety of levels and missions. - the game is really, really cool. what has upsetted me so far: - to register for my account i had to log in to the website via vpn probably because im in china and couldnt load the webpage otherwise. - some of the levels are pretty hard without help (solo). - more connection problems: friends often appear as offline, i also cant connect to others nor can others join my games. because most of the challenges are oriented towards multiplayer play, this renders half of the game inaccessible to me. im almost ready to give up and un-recommend this game again. summary: - really good game. if theyd spend more time working on fixing connectivity issues (dota 2, dont starve together all work just fine!) i would give this game a resounding thumbs up, but as of right now, im having trouble learning the game and not knowing if im doing things wrong game-wise or outside-game-wise is bothersome.",3
"only one thing can even describe this game. volt prime: go faster edition. 10/10 would go faster again.",1
"controller support woot woot! though tutorial was mouse and keyboard based, so had to figiure it out how to play the hard way. beautiful game and the fact its for free! running on a r9 280 on 1080 all high with no problem. had to revert to 720 just so i can read the text playing on my tv. seems you cant really customize your character unless you pay.",1

"oh my god.. i joined this game during closed beta update 11, and now were nearing update 16. de have put in so much effort to make this game full of thiings to do and challenges to perfrom( although admittidly all the missions are basically the same). theyve added player ships relay station and even alliances you can join. even though the game has in game purchses, you never feel pressured to buy it and once everywhile youll get a discount. all the items in the game can be crafted, however some thigs do take quite a grind but apart from that i really enjoyed and i think its an awesome game any one into sci-fi should play.",6
"an amazing game, anyone can play it, and takes you to a whole new place!",2

"warframe is a great game. the multiplayer feature of this game is nice. i had a good time playing with a friend. however, i did not really enjoy it. im not sure if i will play it again. i have played for an hour and a half so far. its a good game, but not a personal favourite of mine. i would reccomend warframe to some of my friends.",1
"this game is very repetitive. it has a destiny feel to it, but with more focus on melee combat. it lags a lot when teaming up with a group, but that might just be my system. the game is trying to push the idea of p2w when every menu having items to buy right at the beginning, and anything you can buy with in game cash is overly expensive and not worth the time and effor, especially since each mission has such a little pay off. components for the blueprints are just impossible to find. each mission is the same, even story missions. go from point a to point b and kill wave after wave of enemies. the regular missions are just wave defense games. all in all the game is just a big waste of time with no pay off, its boring even though it had such a good premise. space ninjas. how could you have gone so terribly wrong?",1
"magic, swords, guns and free running... oh and did i mention free to play? warframe is an intense third person shooter where you hack, slash and utterly destroy any opposition standing in your way. the squad based pve (player vs enemy) combat system is a refreshing take on the multiplayer third person shooter platform that pits you up against many formidable foes including the alien grineers, infected scourge and robotic fleets in objective based missions spanning from extermination to extraction. the only downside to the game however, as with most f2ps (free to play) is the missions can become a bit repetitive and 90% of the weapons and other upgrades must be purchase. so if youre looking for a game to blow off some steam with some epic sword waving, gun toting, action packed combat, then warframe is the game for you! oh the carnage! 7/10",1
"this game is really fun. best third person shooter game in my opinion. 10/10",1
"i play this on the ps4 and just wanted to leave a review on here. in short, yes it is a grind if you want to keep playing for free and still get good items, but it is highly addictive. where destiny was limited, short, sometimes too difficult and not that much fun for me, warframe makes up for it. warframe is basically a more feature rich version of destiny. however be warned, if you dont want to play for free, it is very expensive. some of the packages cost double that of a normal game, and buying in game credits is obscene. but, that hasnt mattered for me. ive won enough items and levels through grinding on free play to keep me interested. highly recommend.",1

"very fun game, which quicky transforms its fun into grind.",1
"its good but then again its not, all the levels seem the same and there just the pointless run threw and kill type  with no objective what so ever besides killing. i like it but then again i dont. you dont really earn anything for doing missions or gain anything out of the except a new level that is based the same way the other one was. if you wanna get stuff you have to pay real money witch is some bs and the levels just drag on because youre just running and shooting at the same looking guys. it goes like oh cool new level *plays new level* what the  this looks the same as the other level so yeah i like this game then i dont i cant really rate this bad because it is fun but then again its not.",1

"its a fun game if you enjoy lots of grinding. it can be very tough at first but later if you already have some decent weapons/warframe it can get little easier. you can play this game without spending money however it would take a longg time to get some items. at the end play it if you like repeating stuff but otherwise dont even bother.",7
"game is very freaking good,i recommend it with all my heart,for a free to play game i would give 11/10,for a game itself i would give 9,7/10.just download and try,u wont regret it,unless u get too adicted :3",1

"this game is very fun and i love playing it. however, the graphics is a little bad for my taste, as i like higher megapixels per secong",1
"warframe is awesomely fun but difficult at the same time. the only problem with it being difficult is when u die to come back costs revives and im not sure what happens when you get down to 0 of those..",1
"really fun game, try to find someone to play with, if you cant no worries its still a fun time killer. but, do your best not to be tempted by their market, its a bit pricey.",2
"this game really awesome ! but , its kinda boring when teamed up with high rating conclave :v .... i mean the enemies really easy to kill ~",2
"if you like a combination of grinding for items, shooting things in the face and magic missile, this is your game. the game can get pretty scary to delve into at first, but if you play the missions as they become available with public on, youre likely to get the hang of it fairly easily. end-game is constantly being updated and old content reworked. while it is free to play which includes a cash shop, you have the option of farming for almost everything in game. extra slots require payed currency, but de allows trading of this currency with other players for farmed items.",10
"really fun game that i would recomend to anyone. you can play it for free or pay for some things. either way its a really fun game. worth every second ^^",1
"a must have for everyone absolutely astounding. ftp is not an issue unless you get into the pvp aspect, which i never did. and even then you can trade for the in game currency (platinum) so you dont have to spend real monay! its customization and rediculously high replay are the reasons ive logged over 750 hours.",7

"with a great player driven economy, and the ability to earn all non-cosmetic items in the game, digital extremes has hit a great point with players all over with warframe. while many would say that the premium currency (platinum) is highly overcosted, they regularly give out coupons for their daily login prizes, ranging from 20% all the way to 75% off the regular price, and said platinum can also be earned in game by completing certain missions and earning parts and mods that the player can sell to others for the currency. the gameplay can get tedious, seeming as how most of the missions are cookie-cutter. but if you can get past the grinding, and the repetition, warframe might just become one of your favorite free-to-play gems in your library",1
"warframe, for being in beta currently, is singlehandedly the most phenomenal f2p game i have had the pleasure to play. although, it is a f2p game thus having microtransactions. luckily, digital extremes (the game developers), took into consideration, hey, everyone hates pay 2 win games, right? ok, so well leave in microtransactions for the lazy people who play the game to complete it and not for fun, but well make a way to earn platinum without buying it!. if you have parts for a prime weapon or warframe (your suits) or even a decently rare mod, you can head over to trading chat and sell it for xx amount of platinum. not only are the creators not money hungry scumbags, warframe is highly addicting, as you can see from my playtime. you will eventually get yourself into a situation such as ugh, my stuff is so terrible, but i need to grind out some resources to get this new weapon or ugh my stuff is so good it just wrecks anything in my path. i want a challenge and youll attempt to quit the game. you will never quit warframe. even if some serious  goes down, de will somehow rope you back in. warframe, recommended 8.5/10 near endless hours of entertainment, and a hell of a f2p. for your sake, get this game.",10
"amazing f2p game you should try it. its free youve nothing to lose",1
"when i launch warframe: warframe just got updated! me: yeeah!!!! launcher: added wings so that u can fly like a boss! me mhm... also the wings looks like iron man things i dont know! me: -.- wich means... they just ruined a good game.....",3
"good game any thing you want in a third person shooter.",1
"the game is good. really good. it has.....like......graphics and stuff....and swords. you should totally get it. its in space....it has space zombies. ten tens out of ten.",1
"if it aint good, ive wasted a really unfortunate ammount of my life! simply satisfying to control. as soon as you get bored, theres something else to try. by the time youre running out of variety, youre weeks of gameplay in. much less grindy than at launch.",3
"got stuck in a wall in the second mission, great game.",1
"started with the excalibur (if you dont know by now, the jack of all trades, master of none frame) played for a bit over 35 hours before getting the rhino construction up and running (the most recommended frame for newbies), some might get it sooner, but i just happen to be slower than most people with these things the gameplay seems pretty solid, and even though the recruiting and trading channels are messy, i eventually got into a nice and cooperative clan also, youre a ninja in space with tons of different weaponry and you can sell/buy stuff to/from other people for/with platinum (the pay-to-get currency), but beware the trade taxes",1
"warframe is a bit slow in the beginning but later in the game you will love the intense action and epic moments warframe offers!",4
"i asked them to fix account creation activation link, i got permanent ban from forums.",1
"so to pretty much sum up this game, you are a space ninja robot that goes around beating up evil ugly people who cant have children. oh and you can shoot lightning out your fricken hands. pretty neat. also the grind is real.",1
"this is a hard one. on the one hand, the game is quite fun and i always enjoy ninja games, but on the other hand, the dialogue is just broken (lotuss dialogue takes half a minute to actually play, and vors dialogue just straight up wont play, showing his ugly face getting in the way of my gameplay for half an hour without even playing any dialogue), the music cuts out every once in a while, the game freezes up alot for me, the controls are quite difficult to handle and get used to, i can never tell where an enemy is, and the game has a very bad habit of not telling what the crap is actualy happening. also, i crafted the thing you need to remove the virus vor put on you, but it wouldnt tell me what to do, and it just showed vors ugly face moving around for so long that i just gave up and exited the game. tl;dr: the game is fun, if you can see past some of the glaring flaws.",1
"honestly one of my favorite games ever! everytihing about this game is fun. ive been playing since upadate about 8.5 and the game has come a long way since then. my only issue is that my computer cant run it anymore after upadate 15. :,( i cri ery tim.",1
"i played it last year. it was a pretty good game but it needed tons of work. it was also the least optimized game i had played. but now after 1 year they have changed so much the game is so good now. i am gonna play it so much more now. 9.5/10 slowly increasing would build more guns and decapitate more enemys again",1
"all i can say is this......great freaking game, period.",1
"there is a stalker that watches you in-game. 11/10 would be stalked again.",10
"its a third-person shooter, you have multiply ways of how you want to kill your enemies, with your characters abilities, primary/secondary/melee weapons, in which expans in almost each major update, you can also have a pet or a sentinel with their own unique uses for different things. there are many characters to pick but first you have to unlock them by either buying them or get the components from boss fights and then after getting 3 different components you build your character which takes time and the currency in the game. you can play with people or solo if you prefer it.",4
"i enjoy the game in an overall sense, but i think it would be better as an fps instead.",1
"a veary good and well made game but i have one thing to say. please bring stealth back. by this i mean the game seems veary un stealth like and the game is kind of inplementing the ninja so not tank like. there are only 2 classes that use acctualy stealth abllities and most weapons are realy tank like. its annoying when im trying to kill enimies undetected and my teamates are just running in gun-a-blazen. so please add more stealth like warframe and weapons.",2
"very very fun game if you can stick around and grind for gear. it is somewhat destiny like but better because it has tons of classes and weapons u can go pay to win or grind for gear and i love games like this so if u want to jump on the awesome train get this game and send me a friend request at bravosquad123",2
"an online co-op mass effect 3 had an affair with diablo 3. what you get from the offspring is warframe. if you like being a ninja in space then i can not not recommend this game any more .",2
"pls fix this bug i always keep on getting dc i dont know why but my internet connection is fine and whenever i finish my quest all of the icons on my ship stops popping up and cant click any of the icons on the ship :(",1
"just like allience of blah blah blah who gives a poo! its stuped!",1
"seriously. this game may be in beta, but when it comes out to its final stages, youll bet you wont want to put this game down. it also tends to discourage others to pay to win for its high prices for platinum. overall, a great game.",2
"yo heard you like ninjas,so im recommending this game about ninjas in space where other ninjas be like ninjas more than other ninjas that all have powers like shooting electricity or wrapping themelves in serran wrap to be invincible!get this game,fool!",6
"i really do like the game but there are lots of bugs, most are minor but recently i had a crash where it corrupted 54 files so i am sitting here waiting for them to finish downloading :/",1
"freaking best game ever smooth combat great characters and abilities has to be in the top 2 for best mmo/hack and slash ever!",3
"this game is awesome. i remember it got a luke warm reception when it first came out, but the developers have since made it a great game! there is a pretty steep learning curve at the beginning, knowing what missions you can solo, figuring out crafting and equipping, but once you get going - what a game!",4
"rinsing the same missions over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again has never been so much fun. 10/10 would buy if it cost anything.",1
"how warframe ruined my life: the documentry 1. i downloaded the game cause it looked cool and had great gameplay 2. the first mission was awesome lets play a few more rounds 3. now im hooked on the game d:",1

"if playstation has destiny, pc has warframe! and it is better!!",1
"this game has come a long ways since its start. i think its great game and love how much it changes and becomes better. keep up the work. one of my top favorite games.",1
"this game is incredibly fun. i personally found it a little complicated at first, though it came easily with time. if you like action games and all that fancy jazz, play it! its free, and its a game that is always fun to come back to after not playing it for a while. it has a lot to do and a lot to kill, so play it!",2
"graphics - 8/10 audio - 7/10 gameplay - 9/10 imho - good game. try it!     .",1
"love this game its soooo frikin awesome an the graphic are mouth watering.",7
"definatly worth playing, and its free! amazing graphics.",1
"a free action mmorpg. what more do you want? 10/10",6
"i started playing warframe a while ago and one thing that i have found is that each update just makes the game more and more fun. even when i feel like taking a break from this game, i always am drawn back in whenever they release an update because the developer team know what theyre doing and have lot of unique ideas that make this game really fun.",5
"once i started i was hooked, this game has everything a f2p needs and a mile more. i mean 3rd person was already a learning curve for myself but you get used to it, and you can take advantages from the camera angles when aiming. this game has everything smoothly cut and personally the only thing i didnt really like was how the slide (l shift + ctrl) was so close together it made it hard at some points but not really hard to just rebind the key. i am still new while writing this review but expect me to be much better later on. i expect to play this game and even make a purchase from warframe. this game is definately worth money, much better than a 10-20 dollar 3rd person campaign/shooter. the rating is m cause of violence but i think people of ages 12 or older should be fine understanding the concept and play the game themselves. well after writing this review it makes me want to play warframe even more. thanks for reading, off to game.",1
"nice game! my first free too play game i really like, top!",1
"exellent game, its not like the other si-fi and futeristic games. this one is diffrent. the dev team have really made the game look beautiful not only that but the combat is fluent, there is many other ways of killing your foes and not to mention the 20 diffrent and uniqe warframes (classes) they all have diffrent abilities and all hae a diffrent play style.",1
"aside from a community that is less than helpful, the game is pretty alright. i spent half an hour asking for help for a quest, but everyone decided to ignore me to talk about egyptian lazahs.",1
"pretty cool, if you like buying in-game things with real money",1
"if you liked destiny you will love this its destiny... but better alot better the game is butiful and the enviroment is emerseve gamplay is great if you like being a ninja if you a rambo kind of guy that wont work well for you it has a bite of bugs not game brakers but small wtf moments. its a bit of a disapointment for me that theres not alot of things to buy cause you need a member ship witch is 50 dollors witch is the lest you can go give it a try i recomened it but if you cant stand bugs then not so much of a good game for you.hey at least its free",1
"i have lost two girlfriends to this game and now you can too!! recruiting ninjas! sign up, suit up and help me take back the solar system in warframe! click this link to sign up for this awesome free-to-play game and well both receive cool rewards!",10
"awesome physics and graphics for a f2p game, gameplay reminds me of destiny but warframe has more planets and its a free game. the community is great same with the squad matchmaking, recommend this game to anyone 8/10.",1
"grinding in this game is like grinding your  against a frozen lamp post, it provides no pleasure what-so-ever but youll still get stuck to it no matter what you do.",2
"amazing, simply amazing. for a free to play it has surprisingly good graphics with small download. the only negative part would be the grind for good warframes, weapons, etc.",2
"fun in co-op, good game in general but it kinda repetitive... it could be better if players can make their own maps!!",1
"the game is epic, with great graphics, rocking gameplay, and a lot of content. although, the high number of bugs in the game (and not only) make the experience average.",2
"deadly mass murdering ninjas with superpowers in space. whats not to love?",2
"i really love this game. good story, good gameplay, good players. ill give 10/10",1
"greate game, if your willing to spend about 15$ on in-game cash, but otherwise addicting and action packed, loads of weapons and plenty of co-op things to do.",1
"this game is art. it really is amazing. its like a free, better than destiny, awsome game.",1
"great graphics, animations, sound effects, game play (combine shooting and close combat), everything is great except one thing: the whole game is an endless loop. there are lots of missions and you have to complete them to explore the whole map but after that. youll just do some same missions, again and again, kill the same enemies, again and again. you kill the enemies to get the gears you want, to strengthen them, then use those gears to kill the same enemies you already killed thousands time. its so pointless. i still recommend this game because its will be fun for a long time. but know that at some point you will not enjoy it anymore and find the game pointless, like me and my friends. sorry for my bad english, its not my language.",10
"was so excited about this game that i overplayed it, and it didnt take too long until i got bored. would still recommend it, if you wanna ruin your life. 10/10",1
"this is the first free to play game that i have ever spent money on. normally these kind of games would have to pry my money out of my cold, dead hands, but this game. wow. excellent graphics, lots of different game modes (aka mission types), cool music, lots of awesome guns, swords, blades...the list goes on. this is a 3rd person co--op space ninja shooter/slasher. theres parkour elements (with parkour 2.0 coming up), sneaking (thanks to spy missions 2.0), 3-d space flight (think zone of the enders), intense boss fights, awesome endless missions in survival and defense, and the list goes on. and you know the best part? its totally free. and there is no paywall. in-game currency can be earned by going to void missions, then gaining and selling prime weapons in trade chat. ive head of players gaining something like 5,000 platinum from this method, which is more than enough to buy you 2 of almost everything. however, on the negative side, while there is no paywall, there is a grindwall. void missions require keys, which are dropped from regular missions and as rewards from low tier void missions. once you get the key you want, and complete the mission, there is a list of 4-8 possible rewards you might get, so trying for the blueprint for that new frame that just came out can be a bit....trying at times. however, it is absolutely worth it. every frame (aka character), every weapon, and every game mode and map can be accessed without paying a cent. how many other f2p games can say that?",7
"best game ive ever played, like it more than titanfall. just, hell yea is all i have to say",1
"this game is very fun the controls are tight and responsive (sometimes it glitches out and you die but oh well) but! its free to play but pay to win you cant get cool stuff unless you pay or play for 1500+ hours seriously look at some of the other reviewers hours played its insane. i also dont feel there is enough stuff on the market. all in all i would give this game a 8/10 i will play it (bows and throwing knives are cool in this game) but not very often.",1

"it will be a short review: good game but it lags... nothing more",1
"warframe is an amazing game as a free to play and can be a lot of fun with friends, even a place to make new friends as the community is better than some other online game communities. however, this game requires a lot of time to get good equipment and be over-powered, so have fun grinding for hours on end for the item you want.",10

"its like sex but without the pain and crying....wait...its like sex. edit: game is still the .",6
"love this game. so many options! male and female warframes, weapons, accessories, and companions, and so much more. i love how you can customize just about everything color-wise, if you can buy the color pallettes. my only hang up is that platinum (the currency you can pay actual cash for.) is pretty expensive. but you can wait and see if you get a discount on it in your daily bonus, or you can trade prime parts for it, so it isnt too big a deal, just takes longer that way. its pretty amazing to play with other people and friends as well, jokes galore and you can mess with your friends. theres also some funny glitches that happen... like falling out of the map, getting stuck in walls and things and so on. the glitches dont happen often though and it only happens usually when the player is doing something they probably shouldnt do... like run at a wall full speed or jump up the elevator shaft while its moving and go through the ceiling. good game. 10/10",2
"awesomeness in its true form. the best f2p game ive ever played. i would not lie and say that it isnt a complex game, but it is its complexity and variety of possible ways to play that makes this game as beautiful as it is. not to mention these guys are the best devs ive ran into my entire life. keep up the good work, de",8
"come on and slam, if you wanna jam. space jam ninjas!!!",8
"honestly, with it being still in beta, i am massively impressed by the brilliant graphics, great gameplay, sick weapons and skins, the being able to not be pay-to-win and most of all; by the best community that i have ever seen in any mmo ever! i already played this game so much and i hope that i will maintain playing this amazing game!",3
"i would write a long and good review for this game, but i have more farming to do.",1
"even though the sanctuary update makes my game crash on startup, the game is still awesome. i just wish i could play. :( there are also others who are encountering this and, i think i speak for all those people and me, it would be much appreciated if the creators could fix this. we all want to play, but we cant because of this problem. except for this i severly recommend this game to everyone.",1
"free2play that is shaping up to be an amazing game, good aspects of the game are. 1. allowing all players to get everything in the store by running alerts wich keeps the player watching out for those run giving more content for players to do..... blizzard.... 2. the cash shop might have some people saying that its pay to win, but in fact this is not true because you are not competeing against anyone, even if the player buys a gun or armor from the shop he has to level it up. so a person bought a weapon that you are still farming for? good because he can take that weapon and help you kill the things you are killing to get the items to farm it while he is trying to level up the weapon. 3. costumization is really great, there are tons of cards that drop that allow you to costumize how the weapon performs. then you have to format the weapons and armor to suit your build, then you have paint and color, pets, ect.",8
"to be honest warframe is a good game with potential but de are making too many mistakes. yea its a game where you can slice and guy then u burn him then u watch him fall to the ground but there is only so far that ccan get you. once you get into the game the game get repetitive. although i personally dont mind but at times farming items can get annoying. in conclusion this willl be a great game some day but for now it needs more input from the community.",5
"warframe, for people who want a mediocre gaming experience for 250 times the price. featuring not only pay to win, but pay to pay! this revolutionary step in gaming demands players pay real cash to unlock new slots so they can pay more cash to fill those slots with. one aspect of the game that should be highlighted is that one can pay a low, low price of $19.99 to get 370 platinum. the great thing about this is its nearly enough to buy the warframes that cost 375 platinum to buy, meaning you only need to purchase 5 more dollars worth of platinum or spent 50 dollars to get 1k worth of platinum. do yourself a favor, youll be better off spending that money on any other money sink. even if you spent the money you could spend on this game for the profound lack of interesting content on a vice that would shave a few years off your life, at least you wouldnt be wasting your life away playing this game.",1

"tl:dr: a great third person shooter co-op game with a few grind walls but worth getting past them this game is one of my favorite and for good reason. this is one of the best third person, co-op shooter out there and should at least be given a try since it is free pros: very high amounts of customization lots of game content regularly updated most content can be obtained through playing some cosmetics are available for in-game credits way to make (real)money in this game great graphics cons: moderate grind walls (sometimes) frustrating rng high pc requirements for high graphics can be alot of downloads for someone with low internet speed",3

"ive been playing this game for a few months now, and i love it. it really is a fun and unique experience. it is so hard to find good free-to-play games that can be played and enjoyed without spending real money, and this is one of those gems. i havent spend a dime on this game yet i continue to enjoy it. there are some missions which do seem insanely difficult unless you have special gear, or if you play with others. i recommend that you play this game with a group, it makes it easier and a whole lot more fun. there are a lot of missions that you can take on by yourself if you cant find anyone to play with, i replay some of them for resources and experience. overall this game provides a fun and impressive experience considering it is free. the graphics are also pretty darn amazing. im running this on a low-end laptop and it still runs fine with decent graphics. i definately recommend this game.",1
"fantastic game for co-op vs ai, or even pvp :d highly recommend a try!",1
"no problems at all, nice selection of weapons, good fps, fun to play",1
"beware !!!! warframe is extremely addictive. iv spent alot of time playing this, as it have great replay ability. this is a free to play game, the more you play it and progress, the better it gets. however to get the most from it you really have to purchase platinum but you wont regreat it. the devs are constantly adding new content, including warframes, quests and weapons - to name a few. prepare to fight tenno. p.s. well over 400 hrs time spent playing warframe on my ps4",1

"ive often asked myself: how could a free to play game possibly be worth it? i mean it must be free for a reason? planetside 2 for example, kinda sucked and i couldnt get into it at all. but on friends recommendation i downloaded warframe - and i know im only 30 minutes into playing the game and i might get bored of it after a while - but this is just awesome and definantly worth the $0 and 6gig on my computer. starts off with some standard but epic melee combat before introducing you to the third person shooter experience and i straight away grabbed the bow and arrow and just couldnt believe how much enjoyment i was having already. but by far the best part of the game and what sets it apart from other fpss tpss etc, is the movement mechanics. my ogd. does this bring back some oldschool memories speedrunning mario/ banjo kazooie/ crash bandicoot, trying to get extra speed by fluent combinations of different movements. beautiful! these movement mechanics are what makes a 2d scroller like speedrunners fun and is perfectly incorporated into this new style of game, cant wait to see what is in store for the rest of the game but it was worth it already",1
"warframe has great bosses that provide a challange. as far as the pvp goes weapon mods do impact the fight as well as the mods on your character.",5

"its the best free-to-play shooter available-even better than cs, cod or bf4. its a ninja gaiden theme type of game except the setting is in space and planets with beautifully detailed and dynamic environments. the models and weapons are well designed and stylish. you can spring, slide, wall-run, and do some amazing maneuvers just like a ninja would. perhaps its best feature is the four-player cooperative gameplay so you can play with friends. each warframe has different skills/abilities. choose what fits your playstyle.the game is essentially about collecting loot and components, such as weapons, warframes, mods (which make you stronger). it has crafting and trade system.",1

"alrighty how to start this, first off let me say this, i really disliked (hated)*cough cough* when it was back in beta a year ago. but dont get the wrong idea i didnt press the i recommend this game button for nothing. i started playing just recently around 2/20/15 because my friend has been playing it. i realized two problems that i might have had before that made me dislike it that ive have fixed for myself. 1, i have people to play it with now, playing this game alone is boring so trying to make friends online the game or having friends you know download and play with you is the way to go. 2, the game has changed alot since then with more rng to levels and different game modes and types and even random events called alerts. even for a grindy 3rd person shooter this game is defintely worth your time. - echo out.",3
"expect to pay, unless you want to drive yourself nuts grinding the same early crap over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. its not pay to win, but its pay to not want to poke youre eyes out with a dull spoon. that being said, its not worth paying for. pretty monotonous.",1
"ive dumped entirely too much time, effort, and thought into this game. but can you ever have too many space ninjas with magic!!?? a fun pve co-op slaughterfest with awesome acrobatics, satisfying gunplay, and extroardinarily meaningful progression and goals that you set for yourself. be warned of a steep learning curve and brutal rng-based drop mechanics, but if you want a f2p game that feels like you bought it for $60 and will keep you obsessed for hundreds upon hundreds of hours, you cant go wrong. very pretty, too! great for playing with friends.",3
"i havent found a game i knew id love right away in a long time. my brother has played this game endlessly and i am just now giving it a try. i have really good feelings about this!",1
"i very much enjoy this game, and i have devoted lots of time to it. i may not be the best player in the world, but here are my two cents on it. pros: fun to play, cool designs, interesting mechanics, teamplay based, the people are fun and goofy, and its quite easy to pick up. constantly expanding. cons: not really for casuals. a sort of lack of clarity after you beat the tutorial. crafting is somewhat confusing before you figure it out. there are still bugs here and there. however, if you are going to pick up this game, i recommend you look up information on the wiki frequently. because its good for you.",1
"great f2p, all weapons and classes are craftable without spending a dime. some cosmetics are available for free but some are exclusively real money currency. unlike other games, these cosmetics dont cost an arm and a leg to aquire. if you feel like trying it out use my referral link, itll give you a 7 day exp booster and ill get some  mods i already have as a reward...",5
"cool game... stuck in 7 hours ..... i recommend this for those who want action. you! vs 100 enemies",5
"well after playing this game for some time i thought it would be time to wright a review. it my not be my most played game but it very good free to play. okay they is abit of a pay to win but it not that bad because the prime items u cant buy but you can have hour of fun with youre mate. i would give this game an 8/10",1
"great game! some of the warframes (characters) look a little wierd, but most of them are sooooo boss! i definitely recommend this game to anyone who is new to first perso shooters on the pc. great gameplay, and awesome story.",1
"first off, im a girl and i love this game! not only do u get to have full customization of everything, you also get great graphics, fun third person shooter and i can make my warframe ing pink. im sold. <3",1
"played for a few hours still have no idea whats happening except other players fly around spinning around and kill everything before i even get pass the first door...so yeah...good graphics doe.",1
"always getting black screen at startup :c someone please help also i will keep hating this game until i find a solution... edit:now the game fixed its awesome!!",1
"how to be cool: 1. download warframe 2. play warframe 3. attempt to make friends while not playing warframe 4. forgot step 3",1
"thought it was going to be an mmo team deathmatch multiplayer type game. but i was wrong. the missions are fun and beats those other free games on steam.",1
"who dosent love a good grindfest/space ninja/ 3rd person shooter/ overcomplicated game? luv dis game.",2
"a really awesome fun game i recomend it to everyone!!!!!",1
"a mustplay for strtegist and graphics interested players",1
"looks nice, tight controls (albeit a bit cluttered), some levels are just unfair, lots of grinding i like it but god damn it, its basically pay to not grind your fingers out because if you want anything other than starting gear youll grind your  out grinding is incredibly fun with friends though",1
"this game gets updated continually, and its got lots of content now, but it suffers from the same problem many mmorpgs do: little to no real endgame. ive got a lot of hours and corresponding equipment, and as such i rarely put any effort into a given mission. i feel like it needs a prestige mode or something, where you have to rebuild a warframe from scratch. despite all this, my statement stands: great for a beta is such a backhanded complement. note: it has router issues.",6
"solid gameplay, good customization, excellent graphics and free to play make this a good game to try at least once.",2
"great game, the gameplay and graphics are awesome.",1
"great game, eventually ill get back to this wonderful game! again, great game 10/10!",1
"if i had internet that allowed me to download 10gb every 2 weeks, i would play this more. is good. but not worth those precious gigs. edit- i will go back to this wonderful game, once it is complete.",1
"do not let my hours playing this game fool you , ive played it for more than a thousand hour directly w/o steam and played it since release. the ultimate grinding experience , your only progression in this game is to obtain weapons/frames/rarecores. is it a bad grindfest ? no. enemies can be majorly challenging , maps have rotation starting spawns , you will almost never start at the same spot in the same map , but maps have a lot of sections and the devs even make the maps bigger and bigger with every patch. would you recommend ? -do you like running around being a badass space ninja ? -do you like to swing swords while being a badass space ninja? -do you like using super space ninja chi to kill your enemies? -are you willing to spend hours and hours grinding the same map for rngesus to bless you with a drop for a weapon youre making ? if the answer is yes to any of the questions , then its the game for you. the dev team is downright amazing , they actually listen to players , they host events , they do rebalances when needed and such , the game gets atleast 1 frame(armor/class) and 2 weapons per month so its lively and going strong and hold it goes strong while it lasts.",4
"highly enjoyable. its something different, highly recommend",1
"you are a ninja, and you are in the space. aint nobody got time fo dat~",1
"this game is awfull and the grinding is too much... played for 1 month didnt unlock anything new + the levels are repetetive same ing thing everytime.",1
"i love this game becuase it has everything i enjoy from a game. it has a way to do a very stealthy run through, or just take a blade and gun and run through everybody like they are nothing. plus the fact that it was free is why i cant stop playing this game. i only have complaint. i have a mac laptop now and one of the first things i planned to do was download steam and get warframe. here is where my complaint comes in. i had spent my time playing this great game so when i got this better computer, i planned on keep playing... but i cant because it isnt available for apple computers. i dont know if this is because the game is so high quality that it cant run on this system, but i am hoping that is not the case. if there was any possible way that the game devs could make this gem of a game run and play well on a mac. i would download it and play it immedietly.",1
"i admit that when i first started playing this game i was impressed with all the bells and whistles that the game had to offer for a free to play game. i played it so much at first that i got burnt out on it and the game just felt like a grinding fest. which in essence it is, but what really helps when playing this game is to make friends. your friends (if they have been playing for an extended period of time) will beable to give you the information you need to meet your goals of a new weapon/warframe and make the process extremely simple. if you like playing lone wolf that is fine as well you can set your misson access to invite-only and if you need information check the wiki. simply play how you want.",3
"this game is probably one of my favorite games ive ever played. the story line behind it all is very creative and i havent heard anything like it. i heavily recommend this game not just because of the gameplay, but because of the developers that repeatedly update this game so its at its highest point of operation, and the players that play the game. most of the community are very cool helpful peopel that will help you get an understanding of the game. so all in all i would rate it 4/20 would blaze again.",9
"some missions are really difficult, and most of this game requires your actual money to get platinum and purchase things from the market, and those are the only negative things i really can say about this game. the gameplay is fun, the voice actors are great and i really like how you unlock new missions and how you can customize the appearance of things in your loadout. 7.5/10 ign.",1
"buggy as all getout, constantly lose precious mission loot. support? dont bother, they just sit on their hands and dont care.",3
"get this game best tps i have played so far ninja gun blade and tenno!",7
"i recommend this game for intense gamers cause it is fast paced fun!!!",1
"this is game is just beautiful, lots of potential, and already so much to love.",1
"quite interesting of a game design, addicting, yet.... full of fun for quite awhile if you have friends to play it with.",1
"for a free-to-play, warframe is a , action-packed shoot-em-up that doesnt disappoint! with dynamic diving, wall-running, sliding and genreally traversing surfaces, warframe lives out the experince of a space-faring, gun toting  as you fight disgusting s with no sense of personal hygeine, some cheap rip off from mass effect and some human/alien/cyborg/bill murray offspring. warframe allows medicore co-op gameplay with millenia of survival, extermination, high class drug sessions, sabotage and other mission classes. definately a solid -58/10: must die! see you in the system, you ing prick.  you.",1
"looks good had some fun ninjaring around killing enemies and looking at the fantastic graphics well made game bit grindy but hey its free so i cant really critizize it and you have fun do you know whats also free and incredibley fun? other free games but this one is nice to just look cool and kill stuff but sadly since it has its fantastic graphics its fps is a bit shabby on bad computers but overall a solid game 9/10 well worth the 0 money you pay for it",1
"very very difficult to advance in the game. it requires too much time consumption just to get items, and experience. the game is more buy-to-play because of that. there arent enough levels suitable for your low level avatar, and playing over the same level is boring. also when partying, you usually get really high level memebers who just clear the area level for you, taking away your experience and items. the game is beautiful despite the hard gameplay.",1
"when i first played the game i did not enjoy it at all but once i started playing on the ps4 and had a friend show me what was up i realized how great of a game this is. give it a try, it may be for you or may not be.",1
"free to play structure that actually works? check. space ninjas. check. shotting stuff. check. ok, i loved every second.",2
"very fun to play, although ps4 to pc migration would be nice, i spent a lot of time on ps4, well over 100 hours and had rare items, nevertheless there is more to the pc version as it is more up to date and runs smoother with more players and better matchmaking.",1
"honestly this game has more bugs (the most annoying bugs) you can ever imagine like some of them will impair your gaming experiance and other will crash your game or even ruin a mission for you [making you glitch into a wall preventing you from doing anything] and upon somehow managing to die you can spend a revive which you get 4 every 24 hrs but the revive will only respawn you back in the wall again. another bug is the one where it will completely stop you from typing to others or interacting with the pause menu but instead they focus on more features instead of fixing the bugs which is ruining the game for everyone fyi: this game is only %30 f2p everything must be bought with expensive in-game currency known as platinum and if you invest it in some top-notch guns the developers will nerf the gun if more people than they predicted enjoy it by nerf i mean reduce damage/ammo etc",4
"warframe is a great game, i loved this game. i definetly recommend this game!",1
"grind all night grind all day grind in the limbo that is between time",2
"warframe is one of the best games i have played all year long. the graphics are stunning, the crafting system is deep, and missions are varied enough to be entertaining for a while. the only issue is that while you can earn moste everything by playing it takes a long time. you are almost restricted to the point of frustration in which you can just pay real money to buy what you want.",1
"it is extremely awesome!!! the graphics are phenominal and the gameplay is different but also really fantastic. i highly recommend this game. 10/10",1
"this game is awesome! and free. motherf**king space ninjas!",1
"warframe is an amazing game and it runs very well. this game does get repetitive at times but overall i personally find it a fun game to play once and awhile by myself or with friends. the game adds more updates to keep players wanting to play. i would recommend this to players who want to play a fun and entertaining game with friends or if you want to just have some fun fighting different creatures/species.",1
"pick up run-and-gun squad based shooter..great fluid animations, stunning graphics and plenty of sci-fi futuristic action with a splash of blood. im digging it :)",1
"this is a true free to play game. it might be harsh to newcomers but once you get past that you will be stuck to this game like glue. so i warn you now dont play this game if you have a life!! i mean look am my hours.....",8
"would highly recommend this game - great sci-fi tps , you are basiclly a wall run power slashing hack and slashing shot em up ninja , that can do some ing awesome",6
"slightly repetative after a while but its a good game 7.5/10",2
"its what destiny isnt 11/10 its like skyrim in the future",1
"one of the best horde mode games you can play. its like 4 player dynasty warriors with shooter elements and far more customization. the game keeps improving with each patch. definitely worth your time.",5
"out of all free to play games, this one is my favorite imo. its still in beta from what i can tell, but its rather good! let me start out with some of the things i whitnessed in this game. (and why i like it.) 1st: you dont have to play this multiplayer. you have an opption to play by yourself! i love it when f2p games do this. 2nd: even if you lose a mission, you still get a little bit of money. sort of like a you tried! keep trying! plus, if you win a misson, you get bonus credit. from what i have seen it ranges from 1000 to 1500. im not sure how far it gose. 3rd: the gameplay , in my oppinion, is so sattisfying. im not someone who likes rpgs, but this gameplay is super addictive! i love the sword play in this game, its epic. now, some of the cons. 1: there is a lot of grinding, but i can forgive that due to the gameplay being fun. 2: while they allow you to buy blueprints, some of the items are a little pricey, this is a f2p afterall. 3: expect bugs. the only bugs i have whitnessed were graphical ones. not too much, but they are there. and that is all i can think of. correct me if im wrong on some things, but i would recomend this game to any space ninja enthusiest.",1
"it was all like pew pew grab dis pew pew grab dat pew pew get muny pew pew keel heme dis game is for mlg pro noscopers m8 no lil scrubs #2dank4me",1
"half of the time when you put war in the name of a game, its either gonna be half- or badass.",1
"used to play this about a year or 2 back, was pretty cool but repepetive. im starting to play it again and its pretty sick, the game has changed like crazy and i personally love it. check it out.",1
"fast paced, high-action, well-built, expansive game that deserves extensive praise. it has been designed from the ground up for the player, even the payment feature cannot unlock the best teir of gear, only playing can. this game is play to win, where you can build up an arsenal that supports your play style, whatever it is, and beat the missions through multiple tactics. to top it all off, the community is extremely playful, joking, helpful, and well-intentioned.",3
"hey! do you like ninjas? do you like spess? do you like controling ninjas in space? play this game!!! its free!!!! youll love it! take up a gun and a blade and get a choppin greenhorn! you just got drafted!",1
"tenno scoom - a good game, and a good community :d",6
"loads of guns, melee weapons, and enough enemies to create that single moment when you run out of ammo and it becomes do or die. not to mention the unique frames that carve out their own niche really well and can be used in a variety of ways within a team mission. amazing physics that add a surprising amount of depth to the game (sometimes pinning someone to a wall is just the happiest moment of your day.) it can be a bit repetitive but that is easily cured with the right people.",4
"a very good game indeed. a fantastic free to play game! there is one thing that i do not like though: updates almost everyday. i do not have a fast internet (mine is 115kbs at max) like most other people do so it is aggravating for me to constantly download those updates. try it out for yourself and i bet that you will not be dissapointed.",1
"to sum it all up. a better version of farming simulator 2014.",7
"the combat, overall design and story makes lots of aaa titles seem like rookie works. this is definetly not a pay2win game and certainly makes into my list of favorite games of all time.",1
"space ninjas with guns. really all you need to know... 10/10",4
"this game isnt necessarily a pay to win, but more of a pay to have fun. this game had so much potential, but they had to add in-game money. at first the game is fun, running around like deadpool with smgs and katanas, but then it just gets repetative. the missions are all the same, and if you want to unlock new warframes or weapons, you have to pay real money. for a while it is fun but then it gets boring fast.",1
"i have played this game for ages! i am very impresed in it and here is my review: pros: extreme grafics and gameplay, a nice comunity with loads of missions,items,story and upgrades. what really gets me is theese warframes and their powers!, shooting a electric blot while flying mid air and front flip and head shoting with a duel pistol.........then land and bodies land afterwords! cons: the only reason i ever stop playing is the bugs. warframe has a lot of bugs and if you encounter one..good luck trying to fix it! while early ingame the early missions have no players and no help...so this turns a lot of players to turn heads and leave. my overall experiance: i have enjoyed this game a lot and hope everyone comes and has a good experiance,while the bugs may get you down....it worth just posting on the forms and waiting for that next gen grafics.",1
"the recent changes to melee makes this game great.",2
"one of the best games i ever played. its very unique and its 2.5years old i haave to mention that admins/devs really listen to the community.",4
"a great game alot of new content updates if you think you are done with getting everything you are wrong becouse a new update will be up by then pros: great graphics free to play. no pay to win! easy to learn. enough warframes to play. (kinda like classes in rpgs) you can get everything without spending a single penny. range and mellee combat you are a flipping space ninja! cons : a farmfest game so if you dislike these kinds of game dont play it only able to play with 3 others friends at once",2
"ive played a hand full of free to play games but his is my favorite so far. it can be very fast pace and fun with others or by yourself. but it can slow to a halt in later stages if you have no one on the squad or your build isnt strong enough. warframe is one of the most original free to plays ive ever played, i would highly recommend this game to anyone that loves space or ninjas.",2
"good game. high action. :-) i only typed this to get the badge.",3
"ive got some hours into this game and i awlays find the mood to return to it! when i randomly saw it hanging out in steam i decided: hey, why not? and so i started playing it! the story, well.... it needs work, but dont worry, updates come flying now and then so theres awlays new stuff, just one major setback however. the gameplay, the gameplay is amazing! i really like the combat style! but if youre going to play this game, prepare yourself for a major, major grind fest. the maps, a lot of them are the same, literally! just the objectives are different, and if you want to progress, you have no other choice but to grind! grind, grind, grind! but if we put that aside, the game is definately worth a try and its a pretty good one. oh and hey, its free! furthermore, the effects are awesome!",6
"this game ate my soul. 10/10 would wonder how to get a life again.",10
"this game is really fun, and even though it is a pay-to-win sort of game, almost all items can be obtained normally. it doesnt have that feel that type of game have, like you have no chance against paying suckers. you feel equally powerful to the other players. its a great time, and free, check it out!",1
"the ranking up part is so annoying, other than that i like the game.",1
"pls fix the download files.besides that i love the game. also after getting a loki as first warframe now i am sent back to the first mission so now im getting a free volt :d",1
"got boring after a while. good couple hours of fun though.",1
"a lot i could say here, but sufficed to say ive never been so impressed with a f2p -- try it.",1
"great game overall. if you havent played this game yet then you need to play it. this game set the all time high for great f2p games. my only problem is the motivation in the game. as you can see by my hours ive put some time into this game and have had a lot of fun with it. though, once you get to higher levels unlocking the higher weapons and frames that you want it gets kinda boring to play. since they have put in quests that makes the game a bunch more motivating to play, but they dont have many and unless you are playing with friends you will probably get bored of the game at higher ranks too. trust me though when i say that this game deserves a play if you havent tryed it yet because this game is awsome.",1
"love this game , the build times are abit long but i can deal with it , very grindy",2
"pretty fun but gets repetitive quite fast .. still will recommend cause im main stream and i have to recommend anything popular ya",2
"this game is about tennos fight against monsters to gain theyre honor back. by playing the game you will drop/find any sort of item. wich with those items you can craft primary weapons, secondary weapons and melee weapons. you can craft various tennos too, there are any sort of tenno, healer, dps, etc. in my opinion its a really good game, beside that i really like to farm :p. you can totally have anything in this game, its not a pay2win, you just need to get used to it, to learn planets, mobs, item drops, bosses. the game has really good graphics and really good effects, you wont need more for a free2play. the game is constantly updated. i really enjoy this game, hope we can meet in game ;d. my nick in-game: zsoby17 -soby",2
"i tried becoming a hardcore player. oh how i loved the mod set building and grinding. they just know how to make grinding fun!",4
"a little overwhelming at first but still a great game. wonderful graphics, awesome gameplay, and a ton of customization.",1
"really good game, especially when you can play it with mulitple friends :d. if youre looking for a visually stunning game, stop looking because you just stumbled upon something interesting. 9/10 love this game <3",1
"amazing game, doesnt force you to use micro transactions like a lot of f2p games",5
"fun free game, great time waster to play with friends.",2
"damn, this game is really not that great, its generic plus it doesnt require much skill, but hot damn im so addicted to it. pros : very fun and addicting cons : not enough hours in a day to play it, takes away your social life and prevents you from studying for exams. 11/10 would pay for it anytime.",4
"as long as you are okay with it being fairly grindy, warframe is an absolutely fantastic co-op shooter. the movement, the shooting, and the game world itself are all top-notch and extremely well done.",2
"summary: a (free!) third-person sci-fi coop action game. as with many free games are these days, there is a lot of grind involved. but theres also plenty of content that keeps the game enjoyable. worth a try, especially if you have friends who are interested. pros: +youre a freakin space ninja with magical powers. +gameplay is very satisfying. the combat system works great and the visuals are nice. +large variety of weapons and characters, very fun to try out all the new ones. +not pay-to-win. you can collect blueprints for items from missions or buy them with credits you collect from missions; you can trade for the premium currency (platinum) with other players to get any other things you need +active with updates that add more content to explore cons: -story is (so far) very limited. there are bits and pieces of lore from the intro, bosses and item descriptions but that leaves a lot of unanswered questions. -not *as* fun without friends. pugs just arent the same. -repetitive levels. -poor voice acting -certain things very grindy to obtain.",3
"this game is great. the fighting is intense and the set-up of gameplay is well thought out. however, if you choose to play this game, make sure not to rely on paid items and/or more experienced players to get you through missions. i made that mistake and i am now having problems progressing further since the previous planets give less xp than before and newer planets for my account are too difficult to complete. although those mistake could cause major problems for a player, and the though that money was wasted if you bought items and find things too difficult, i completely recommend this game.",1
"a good game for people who likes to grind for resoures in order to get endgame weapons",9
"i do not recommend this game!! this game is not my type of ninja at all! i know it is a future but still a ninja apouse to be stealthy, quite, and never seen. ok the future stuff is fine but forget the lights!! how hard is that?! sorry for yelling but this game...if you are into rambo ninja games then get this or if you are like me that wants to be stealthy, never seen, and yes make your own ninja that levels up with the weapons (aka you dont which sucks hard which that you dont even lack info!!!! what the hell!!! sorry again and i dont approve this game) then you are out of luck, this game is not a ninja even i want to blend in the shadows but basic colors are appouse to be free and the other colors ok i get to be lock but all basic colors are locked, yeah half of the time i go stealthy but my emeny sees me with the lights, here is a thing...do not add lights to your weapons!! i dont care how much it is the future but even a future ninja always be stealthy like the past!! those are my thoughts and fustrations. the atomasher ok but it just lacks the ninja way, be steathly is not the ninja way at all in this game which is not being faithful, i am into a ninja game that i can hide, be stealthy, and yes assassinate but when i need to not in the open where every one can see me. like i said if you want this game and like killing things in the open fine but i dont recommend the game thank you. p.s. i am sorry for yelling through this just need to get out some fustrations",1
"this game is awesome, if you are looking for a fast paced third person combat game that allows you to take the role of a alien space ninja then look no further. another awesome benefit of this game is that everything that has an impact on gameplay while you can purchase for money, you can also obtain in game through hard work, time, and effort. this game keeps pulling me in, and they are always releasing more and more features.",1
"i can only describe this game as one thing, space ninja farm simulator 3082 because the main thing you do in this game is to farm/grind certain missions on certain planets to obtain materials to craft better weapons to allow for more efficient farming. and to obtain new and better warframes you must go borderlands style and kill certain bosses to obtain one of three parts all of which have a random chance at spawning. normally i would not have a probelm with this if it werent for the fact that once you can craft your desired weapon or warframe you have to wait 12-72 hours in real life for them to complete crafting, or you could just spend money and have it instantly. in fact almost all of the weapons and warframes can be bought with actuall money which also kills the main purpose of this game which is to get better weapons and level up.",1
"even though most people already play the best free-to-play game on steam,(this game.) i thought i should write a review about how good this game is. the running up walls and jumping like a lunatic is one of the things that made this game a fun game to play, and the shooting is the second. mixing in some magic in this has made the game what it is. customization is also great, but there is not much to customize to me. it keeps you playing to try getting better and max out everything you have bought, keep since the beginning, or crafted together. always keeping you at your feet with trying to unlock certain items or blue-prints so you can make that weapon or warframe you always wanted.(or missions in your codex.) i recommend this game a 10/10 and one of the best games ive ever played. thanks for reading this review and hope you love the game.",1
"good game, pros : very funny fast pace good effects good auido good community cons: a few bugs needs a little of fix but their not that noticeable i reccomend you download this game its free and defintly worth your time",1
"this game is fun ..but there is a lot of stuff that they ... the game does not tell you .... the codex .. gives you info but ... only the basic ... lots of stuff i cant figure out even tho i have been playing for like a month now",4
"warframe is best with friends in a clan (or alliance, if youre so inclined). the grindiness hurts after the newness of it wears off, but with a good group of people, it can be a lot of fun. the lore is improving. every new gun that comes out is more overpowered than the last. the support is super kind and responsive, and the devs are pretty spectacular about being up front and listening to the player base. events range from awesome to boring, but the rewards are always overpowered, which means to compete in the pvp arenas, youd best have all the best mods from doing all the events and all the best weapons (preferably the prime versions) and the frame of the month, because the frames are not balanced (though the devs are trying). its not really pay to win - most of the things you buy are cosmetic, and a few hours will usually get you the components and credits you need to buy anything new. it does get really old after youve spent enough time grinding, and as always, rng can be a . 7/10",6
"seeing that ive spent nearly 600 hours on this game, might as well write a review for it. its fun, quite a bit of tedious grinding to get your equipments, but thats okay. its not even pay to win, seeing as you can get 90% of the content for free eventually. the only thing you can pay for is cosmetics and convenience, like potatoes, which are in fact optional and help you progress faster, thats it. there is not much of a lore, so to speak. you select a mission, go in with your fancy ship, complete the opjective and shoot up about 200 guys on your way to the extraction site. im bad at writing review. just play it okay ?",5
"i would recommend this game to people who like sifi or stealth games. its like halo and assasins creed had a child anyone would have fun with this game and everything is free",1
"amazing game, however my friend started around the same time as me but he does not like it. i guess it is a hate it or love it type of game. p.s dont expect this too be a quick game. if you want to be good it take really long. i have played 30+ hours and still have one of the starting tenno. (almost have rhino:) you will have to play alot if you want this game too be awesome and believe me it is worth it,",1

"a very fun a game 8/10 for me! this game is the best co-op f2p game i have ever played. the best part is when you and your friends play it for 10 hours straight! the only down side to this game is that it gets a little grindy/repetitive after a while of playing. also there is no need to buy any packs for this game, it is fun anyways.",1
"not sure why this game is free. id gladly pay money for it. the game looks fantastic. its not hardware demanding. its everything destiny shouldve been. it costs you $0.00 to play.",1
"embrace the dark side,waste your life on this game.",3
"this game really shows off how amazing free-to-play games can really be. i look in my library, and i can just see how sexy,action-packed,and sexy this game is. new users of warframe have so much to search out for with new content being added as each month passes by. the graphical qualities are superior eye candy and the gameplay is purely exciteful. 5000/10=sexy",1
"not much to say. worth every minute in it,and still is. guys before me did already some great and detailed reviews,so check them out. an easy 8.5/10",1

"really good. constantly changing after a while you will need to get prime weapons, which require lots of wiki searching though. overall lots of fun, but quite a few glitches too. 10/10 would waste life again",1
"warframe is really amusing. nice to be a co-op, action game. it presents quite good graphics. sometimes i cant believe it is a f2p. the only bad thing i can find is that sometimes it turns out to be monotonous. but the game is really good.",1
"warframe is a free 2 play gold mine of nonstop infinite fun, shadowed only by its seemingly repetitive grinding which will likely never be taken away. however, if you enjoy the simplicity of what warframe has to offer then the endless hours of griding, oftentimes to make the most basic of necessary resources, would only be a slight obstacle for the otherwise brilliant and captivating gameplay. warframe certainly has its many downsides, including but not limited to poor design choices by its developers, however i cannot personally vouch if they would deter your entertainmnt of the game. the game is potentially hit or miss for many players. this game gets my personal thumbs up. warframe is one of the best free 2 play games on steam (and anywhere else for that matter) and rivals many other aaa games from the already faltering action genre.",3
"twat they say, is true. there are amazing openings, missons, and weapons. but, theres always two sides to a coin, am i wrong? this game shows true tps action. it delivers amazing graphics, missons, gameplay, and wonderfull tech support. then there is the dark side, which saddens me. this game is not, (i repeat) not a f-2-p. and if it is, ive never seen it since im a level 24, and not a single penny into this game. then there are the lvl 5 people with tier 20 guns, in pvp, running (and attempting) to gun. f2p users, watch out, theyre always there, and always will be. but back on track, there are some other bad stuff that people dont like. one of my personal considerations of changing is, the exiting sence. i dont like how its always that block thats made for your guy. why not a sexy, amazing cargo door ending, where it opens and a gunship mows down enemies you didnt hit as you board the ship, and set sail to the next misson. that, would be ing awesome. well, to me.... icleast. i hope this review helped you decide if this is a game for you... if so, leave a comment on my profile. - bowhunter",1

"very addictive. i mean, space ninjas? what more could i ask for?",2
"yes i do recommend this game.. first of all why ? 1. because this game even though it has in game currency the game doesnt really based on pay to win which is most commonly found in free to play games. 2. the in game currency can be purchased or even earned by trading prime parts / rare mods, this is really helpful for peoples who doesnt have any wallet or something like that 3. the devs are really actively update the game with new contents and constantly gives us a number of events. this thing makes the game really fun pros : - everything related to ninjas, acrobatic sh*ts, mad psycho bosses, hot gurls :v, space weapons, body slashes, blood - nice graphics but low requirements :) - funny, great, and active players (and most are perverts :v) - great cosmetics items cons : - lots of lags :v - some warframes are too hot :v - the maps are too big (thats what she said) - and bugs (see this is the main problem even though the bugs doesnt really affect too much of the gameplay",6

"my honest opinion to start my review i would like to point out that this game is pretty fun but when played friends it is instantly 10x better, this game is also not your typical pay to win most of everything in this game is buildable but some of the items are only accessiable through buying. cons in the game would be glitches that i run into but they are usually fixed by the constant patches this game gives out, other than that i havent found any other cons that have disturbed or broke the game in anyway. oh yea and did i mention you can cut people in half and parkour :d now go out there and be the best space ninja you can be.",1
"its free. the devs give a . more content than 90% of paid for aaa mmos. its unbelievable how much they keep expanding this game. i am utterly addicted. it is a drug. i cant stop. help me.",3
"better than destiny in every way. cant beat free. the game is gorgeous and combat is fun and a blast with a buddy, but i just dont like the in game purchases, think they are way to expensive, we are not talking .99cents for angry birds here, some of these items are more than i care to spend, but you might like it so i say its an awesome game and worth it to try it.",1
"a lot of fun parkour elements, satisfying combat, and beautiful visuals make this game worth trying. my only complaint is that the story is a little.. well.. incohesive.. but at least there is one and its constatly being developed, just dont expect off the bat to understand wtf is going on.",2
"first of all this game is great and full of action, i give it 10/10. but something dumb happen, when i wanted to buy my platinums, my platinums didnt showed up and i get frustrated. i waisted my money to buy cool stuff but it didnt so to all who wants to buy platinum pls dont buy it. youll be sorry.",1

"for a free game it has good graphics and is pretty adddictive. i recomment you trying it.",3

"well balanced tps pve shooter, well made graphics and quests, but a big curruncy problem since platinum is only optainable for irl money, or just trade alot of stuff to get like 1 plat, which are used to buy slots of more warframes and weapons but still easly replaced by deleting useless items and warframes but still very cool overall 16/20",1

"warframe. what can i say? badass space ninjas with guns? of course. warframe is a free to play 3rd person co-op shooter with endless amounts of character customization, ever changing enemies, mission types, tilesets, and a metric -ton of weapons. really, what more could you ask for in a free to play game? pros- -lots of weapons to choose from -lots of character customization -randomly built levels, no level is every the same twice, which gives them a very fresh feeling -lots of different mission types, and several different factions to fight -both land and space combat -did i mention the warframes look badass? cons- -warframe is often called warfarm as there can be a fair bit of farming for parts/mods/weapons -well warframe has the base of a very good story it still lacks in that department(of course some people couldnt care less about a story so if thats you, your good to go!) all in all i give warframe a 10/10",7
"doesnt work on steam.... id recomend gettinit from the internet",1
"worth the money i put into it had tons of fun with friends id say its worth it. its not for everyone though there is some grinding for items but thats all the better once you make the weapons and stuff you did it for. lots of lvling if youre into that and different ways to buff out your character or weapons. as well as pets.",5
"edit: this went from fun, to just a drag now. its the same old thing over and over, and now the events they run are boring as well. there is no real point to doing anything when you realize 90% of it is there to make it take forever. fun shootem up but the intro grind really sucks. once you get past that, the new market makes it much easier to get going. need a clan for some of the better weapons, but the blueprints in the market are good as well, if not a bit expensive starting out.",4
"all me and my friend did was saw your too slow in the loading time 10/10",1
"great game. takes some time to become a true super warrior but there are guides to help you speed things up a bit on the interwebs. if you dont mind spending a little money in game it might make things more fun faster but thats up to you as anything in the game can be aquired through gameplay. slight learning curve but its not terrible by any means. if you like games where you gradually unlock new armors and weapons and make them stronger and stronger ultimatly taking down rooms full of enemies with flashy ninja super power explosions, this game should keep you well entertained. also a pretty decent community and an active development team, both very good things for a 4 player co-op beta game to have. 10/10 would ninja again.",7
"f2p model can get a bit grindy, but a solid title.",1
"if youre up to farming your items for 300h + this game is very fun i highly recommend it specialy because of the great and unique expirience and the best part its free 2 play",4
"warframe is an excellent game. i have spent numerous hours playing this game and im barely halfway through the non-endgame content. i have some minor gripes, but considering how long i have been playing, id say that they are mostly negligible. pros: + massive amount of content. + easy to learn + nearly endless skill ceiling + excellent gameplay mechanics + all payment is optional digital extremes have taken great care in creating a truly great experience. i personally have very few issues with this game. however, there are some things that im sure will bother others. ill list them here for you. cons*: - can get samey - requires a lot of time investment - paying for items has the potential to extremely be expensive - no dedicated servers (matchmaking with random people can result in severe latency issues) personally, i only have issues with the matchmaking. there are many opportunities to get large discounts on ingame currency, and the levels are randomly generated based on tilesets (rooms are the same, but the layouts are random). overall, if you have plenty of free time and are okay with levels feeling similar, i highly recommend this game. basically, to sum it up, take destiny, get rid of randomly-generated weapons, give it an interesting story, deep combat mechanics, and memorable character design. that is warframe.",3
"very fun and addictive game, with more hours played this game i love it more..",1
"while im writing this review i have about 150 hours in this game. this game is great. you dont have to spend money if you want cool weapons or gear. it can be all unlocked. the platinum which can be bought with realmoney can also be earned in the game (selling prime parts and moods etc.). in this game you play like a spaceninja you can either go in stealthy or you can go in guns a blazing its your choice. hope this short review helps pros: - great visuals - fun combat - great warframe designs - a lot of weapons - great community cons: - repetitive soundtrack - lackluster mission objectives - some bugs - grinding",2
"downloaded i the deleted it and then downloaded it again but it wont download this time.",1

"iz good. i wish they would make so your character automatically changes from looking right to left when covering behind an object... you cant see out the left side... iz confusin what im sayin but other than that good game",1
"tl;dr version: look at my hours in game... nuff said! ...and for me, the action is the juice! -- michael, heat an action packed 3ps co-op map runner offering a wide array of warframes (hominoid battle suits, each with their own power sets loosely targetting traditional group roles i.e.: tank, dps, support, etc), advanced and traditional weaponry of hot-swappable rifle, sidearm, and melee types, and hundreds of explorable and repeatable mission nodes. warframe ensures that all that great gear goes to good use by offering a variety of missions including both wave (survival, defense, etc.), and objective (steal information, kill all enemies, etc.), based types, all which can be played either solo or with up to four other players (whether with friends only, or random players in ones own region through the games lobby system). enough of the best parts of shooter games is offered that should satisfy most action genre fans, including the best parkour-inspired movement and combat system of any game available! imo while most gear is available from the games built in marketplace (using the games own currency system) -- for the impatient among us -- nearly all gear in the game is available simply by playing, and playing is simply free.... get it, play it, now.",9
"8/8 the grind is real. i have ~500 hours in-game and as of me writing this i am mastery rank 14, going on 15. this game is awesome, but de tends to make a lot of fixes and patches for stuff which affect everyone, when aimed at a specific group. the recent afk rules are a good example of this. after 2 minutes of standing still(moving mouse and moving a short count as staying still), you wont be able to pick up items, get energy or affinity. this was because of the egate-gate and draco afkers. i recommend this game, 7.5/10.",4
"the free version of destiny. still able to earn the game currency platinum and its tradeable. so, you can stay a true free to play player. the lore is something i dont normally get into with games, but its really interesting with this game. you can start up some really cool conversations with the community. if you are looking for a shooter game that you can enjoy, and not run out of things to do, and that has a good community bases, this is the game to try!",5
"awesome game for when you just feel like being a ninja.",1
"i love this game so much. to me it feels like a mix of destiny and metal gear",1
"other key elements - create an avatar, characters speak english, have your own ship hub- can go to town hub later on if you wish or leave at you leisure, faction selection later on, class selection - 3 choices from the start, daily log in rewards, make the graphics higher or lower to let lower cpu play game, make new job classes or new weapons with blue prints with ingame money, 360 wired controller compatible, replayable missions and pvp the gameplay its a 3d realistic looking scifi thrid person shooter/mmorpg. the more you party with people, the more chance you have to survive the levels. the game will send legions of enemies at you ment for 4 people. you can solo the game but have a tougher time advancing. you can pay real cash to get items instant or use ingame money to buy blue prints to make them with parts you find in levels. you also have slots on weapons/on self to equiped abilities-lvl up to gain more points to better things. the weapon you kill enemies with gains the most experince points. the bad the only bad thing i could think of is the no skip on story cutscenes when characters start to talk, there no skip button i found to stop the replay if you failed a campaign quest. cannot do anything til characters stop talking storyline. maybe a update will erase this problem. update as i play more of the game",1
"one of the most promising games ive ever heard of. sadly, counter-intuitive controls, a sub-par tutorial and graphical options only accesible in-game cause it to deter me. its like they expect me to know exactly how im suppsoed to be playing in my first 5-10 minutes of gameplay. definately a learning curve, and no time to adhere to it. such great potential, such awesome graphics, and some of the controls are really cool on the other hand. but, for example, when i eneter my first mission, directly after learning how to use the kunai and bow, they supply me with only a sword. no other weapon to switch to, and they expect me to destroy 5 flying targets, who have guns? i started playing 5 minutes ago, cut me a break! worst part is, i was extremely excited to try this game. (try it again that is, since i played it about a year ago, with nearly the same results). meh, i dont really care though. would have disappointed anyways when they started rolling out the p2w aspects which are surely in every free game on steam, aside from poe.",1
"this is a really fun shooter. at the moment it is completely free, sure if you want some color customizations you need platinum (the cashable currencey) but that platinum can be farmed by selling mods or blueprints. anyway, the game is nice and well paced. the controls need a bit getting used to but otherwise its a borderlands-halo mashup with some extra mobility and less humor. the different warframes give you various playstyles. from tank to ninja everything is in there. if you like good shooters with lots of different weapons and mods and you dont mind serious grinding, then youll enjoy this. if youre not a big fan of grinding you probably wont like this game unless you want to invest real money, since your base weapons arent all that great, like in any game youve played you have to put some effort in it to get the good stuff. if you have to break it up into pros and cons it would probably look a bit like this; pros: - good shooter - large variety of modifications for warframe and weapon - multiple playstyles possible - free to play design well made - nice graphics cons: - controls need getting used to neutral - grind heavy - fast paced to sum it up short its pretty much space ninja grinding asap.",7
"space ninjas!? where do i sign up? welcome to warfarm, *ahem* warframe! solid gameplay and a nice chunk of content. warframes are like pokemon, gotta catch them all! or rather farm for them. but anyway, this game sure is a lot of fun. especially with friends! definitely worth a try. and for those of you asking is this pay to win? the answer is no! its more like pay to get a mile ahead of everyone else. but you can get anything by just playing the game. and you will more than likely get everything if you like the game.",3
"i recommend this game. but i have a complain: the grindwall is huge. you climb a grindwall, just to find another one, bigger! if you can deal with it, this game amazing. the graphics are great (and you dont need the fastest computer to run it); you can decide to play solo or multiplayer (and its drop-in); variety of weapons and playstyle is astounding; im too lazy to write a full review so i will just recommend it for you if you are interested in tl;dr fast action shooting slashing/brawling game.",2

(it does cost a lot and i havent spent a single penny on it) - very nice graphics - the game has a lot of versatility that makes it very fun to play. no 2 players have the same loadout and mods installed - great crafting system - great clan system - great trade system cons - can be repititive after a while - free playing requires a  ton of grinding, trading and waiting around - takes a long time to get to the good stuff (though the good stuff is really very good fun to use) - often see bugs but they are not very hindering to gameplay i personally recommend this game to people who are looking for a free game that has a lot to offer for an extended period of time and not just for a couple of hours.",3

"easily lands itself into the top 5 games ive ever played. i do admit it is a grind, but once you finally start building your new weapon/warframe, the satisfaction is soooooooo gooooooood. community is filled with nice people, i havent met a harsh soul and they are all willing to help out. has bugs, but they are actively updating constantly and trying to fix everything so it is understandable. its a little harsh on newer people, but if you have a few friends to hang out with youll barely notice a thing. i rarely think about rating games, but this game deserves it. 10/10.",4
"if you ever played or still playing destiny,better version of it. gotta say what i needa say since it is easy to access to missions,harder to get new weapons(meaning need more time to grind,which in my opinion is the best) andddd its f2p crazeh!!",4
"its warfram, not warframe lol. i love this game anyways <3",2
"the only 10/10 f2p game that you can never find anywhere. warframe=50% my life :)",4

"pretty interesting premise, mixing the matrix with borderlands and gears of war, very complex customisation, very fun gameplay, buggy as all hell, game crashes sometimes which sucks, but oh well. give it a try you wont be dissapointed, partying up is alot more fun than solo, find a good clan! edit: the biggest case of failed potential ive ever seen, the devs made a great, but extremely buggy, base game, but all proceeding updates are either cash grab store weapons, bugged out community events, and new features nobody likes. play until you get a nice set of endgame weapons, frames and mods, and never log in again, because theres nothing fun worth doing.",3
"one of my favorite games, started playing this on the ps4, now im playing it on the pc. game is crazy interactive, you can plant seeds, water farms, feed cows, build barns, go to town and sell crop oh wait! sorry i was confusing this game for harvest moon considering all the farming you will be doing.",1
"amazing game. one of my favourites. one of the only ones able to suck me in to play a good weeks-worth of the game. well done.",1
"more grind than a tony hawk game. more content than destiny, and more story. 10/10 ps: the graphics and gameplay are amazing, especially those archwings. and the game is 1000x more fun with a group. phantasy star online 2 is the only game like it that is better :p",1

"i started playing this game for relaxation and rest from other frustrating games. the game is technically improved quite a lot, but as i reached greater experience in the game i realized that one problem still has not changed! the problem is, crashing in the middle of a game. its not a big problem if you are a beginner, but someone who works void survival 70 min + is very annoying and frustrating. regarding of such problems they did nothing, because if you crash after you will gain nothing. which means besides games enemy difficult you have to worry about whether the game will crash again. and generally it is not pleasant after 78 min of your game, you do not get anything. it is sad that this problem after so much time is not resolved! just because this, i do not recomend game because a lot of time your just grind and waiting items to be built!",10

"i would recommend this game if you want to spend hours upon end trying to get past the endless amount of glitches and exploits this game has to offer. i have been playing this game for about a year now, on and off, and glitches are fixed and return on countless occassions. the game itself is good, but there are times where you will spend an hour farming and get some really good stuff, then find you cant complete the mission and get that stuff due to a glitch where a door wont open, or a boss has fallen out of the map and become invincible etc.",5
"the game is an absolute grind, but the artstyle, soundtrack and movement mechanics are gorgeous, unique and very fun. chop chop chop chop.",1
"great game. minus the time walls, grind walls, and all other invisible walls. although f2p, you need to put money into it to progress. its either that or you have to commit multiple hours a day to acomplish something. microtransactions are horrendous. but overall, the gameplay feels good. just bad decision making and business design from devs.",6
"this game had improved a lot since its release, it looks interesting at the beginning but then it just gets boring, frustrating and repetitive to the point you only end up repeating the same things over and over to grind rare materials to get new stuff that barely has any impact on the gameplay itself. the game has no sense of progression whatsoever, getting new levels, weapons and warframes feels like it only changes the way things look. if you wanna avoid the grinding you have to either pay-to-win or party-up with decked-out players to just tag along and get their loot. not to mention the game is buggy as hell, especially the ui, that thing needs to be redone from the ground up. but meh, at least its f2p.",2

"been having alot of issues with this game lately. itll take forever to load, and after i get into my ship, and attempt to go for a mission or join a friend on theirs, it freezes on the loading screen and either crashes or just disconnects from everything, anyone have any ideas? ive tried redownloading multiple times, and to no avail",1

"i find this game creative by the way each map is created, and the animation they put on and within the characters. the most part i really right about warframe, is the abilities each class or different ninja is made. thats how i much i like warframe. most importantly i mostly find this game really eotically fun! and if you like my review a give a thumbs up and start playing warframe, for allt he ninjas out there! p.s:i advise to ahve a good pc while playing since this is 3d game",1

"i have seen the many changes throughout the close beta in which by far the developers of this game (de) did a tremendous job of keeping a game at a high quality pace within the free to play industry. i have supported the dvelopers since update 9 and have been really happy on their progress of developing this game. even though there were controversies between de and perfect world entertainment, it was only an investment run in which perfect world entertainment want to see them success in the f2p market industry. and so i highly recommend this game to new players who wants to play an action third person gun and blade mmo since they have updated and refined the tutorial section in which also has tonnes and tonnes of lore in which more are coming out in future major updates. also this game keeps its true free to play genre title since most of the cash items are just asthetics and not a pay to win situation (in which this game is mostly a cooperative game rather than a player vs player base).",9
"is it f2p or p2p? 100% f2p. honestly, ive never seen a game with a better or more fair f2p model than warframe. there is nothing in this game whatsoever that cannot be obtained with time that is obtainable by money. the gameplay is repetitive, but very, very fun. im 700 hours in, and i havent faced burnout once! is it complicated? nope. not even a bit. the plot is very bare bones right now, and modding your gear (putting in game modules on it to make it better) is easily grasped with a small amount of testing. is it worth playing? hell yes!",6

"jesus save me i play this game more than i want to",2
"one of the best co-op games i ever played and without a doubt the second best f2p game on steam. ive read some people complain about the pay 2 win and i can say, thats bs. you can get every item on the game, even the ones you can only get with platinum (only vanity items and extra slots for guns and warframes) without ever paying a cent, thanks to the trading mechanics. the only thing about this game that you may dislike, is that there is quite a lot of farming. you have to farm for credits, materials, experience, mods (cards that let you modify your warframes and weapons, and which you can then sell for platinum), warframe parts and prime parts (which you can also sell for platinum). personally, i have to say that i love it, and it can get you a lot of hours of gameplay. but again, if you hate farming or grinding, this is not the game that you should be playing. edit: i only have around 15 hours registered because i was playing the standalone version, without steam. im mastery rank 7.",1

"i only had one problem with this game, and it was a pretty major one, the game wouldnt let me continue, every time i finished a mission, it wouldnt give me a completed marker for that mission, so with only 1 mission available to play, i cant continue playing, the little bit of the game that i did play was amazing however, fun with friends, not as fun solo, but still quite enjoyable if you like playing solo. i do recommend this game, and i just wish i could continue playing it.",1

"alright, lets just start this off right this game is great. unique combat system, decent ideas, combat feels very natural. now, lets get to an actual analysis of the game. this game, despite looking like its pay2win, it kind of is.. but not really. platinum is required for nearly everything. new guns? platinum! cosmetics? platinum! the ability to take a  all over yourself for money so you can buy platinum? well. doesnt require platinum. but the fact that your weapons are moddable, giving you the ability to make what you want, thats where this game saves itself. it makes the legitimate weapons feel more like skins, and the mods feel like the weapon itself. that being said, another problem occurs. mods are too ing varied. most of the time youll get something utterly worthless, that you already have ten of. i guess you could just power up yer mods, but still, it hurts. as far as the story goes.. its there. theres nothing really special about the story. annnd finally, combat. the combat can feel a bit wonky at times, but eventually you get used to it. i genuinely enjoy his combat system, it makes the game great. overall, beautiful game with few faults other than platinum. 9.5/10",1
"warframe: micro transactions that save your life. lets all be honest here, microtransactions are the bain of all gamers, and this game takes the absolute piss when it comes to them. you want to get that class? pay 10 and another 3.70 in individual packs to get it when it comes to gameplay however, this game pulls back some good boy points for the addictive hack n slash aspect of running around with a huge battle-axe swinging faster than the wheels on a ferrari going top speed. this game will take hours of your life away!!! when crafting a new weapon or a class this game takes the royal f-. low level weapons/ unsorted weapons: 12h popular weapons: 24h classes 3 motherf- days timers like that are not healthy for a game to survive, also it forces the player to think: i should really spend some money so i dont have to wait 3 days for this new class. despite my constant playing of the game, (getting a blazing +420 hours) this game disappoints me with build times. 6/10.",5
"best game 11/10, made me play for so long that i got scared and took a break. not because i was bored but because i was so addicted.

"overall a great game i encourage you to play it, people might say its bad for its excive farming i can agree there is exesive farming yes but that is the fun of it you are working hard to get the prime wepons and at the end you will feel it has been worth it, i farmed the scindo prime and at the end it becomes my go to wepon for all enemy types. i seriusly recomend trying this game out and it is not going to hurt you as this game is free to play, also its f2p systems is not bad compared to other f2p games it does not force you to buy, you can just about get every item in the game through farming except for cosmetic items but now the introduction of the void traders you can get prime accesories such as the prime eos armor set or the pyra sugatra (btw you cant get this from buying with plat). also if you like the game and decides to help the devs speend you cash on prime access to get the latest prime release. happy farming (>)>",5

"warframe is by far one of my favorite games and for sure no game is comparable. there are so many warframes in this game, there is one for sure to fit your playstyle if your in to 3rd person shooter / stealth games / mmos you can make this a fast paces shooter or a slow paced stealth killing game there are a lot of different mission types there are many many many weapons in this game to benefit your playstyle, i cant even exagerate how many creative weapons are in this game there are many mods in this game (modules are basically parts to your weapons that make them more op with crit+status effects, et cet.) varius enemy types you need to keep in mind when facing hard missions. there will be various enemy types you despise that make this game more fun by killing them. clans + alliances, so you can get the benefit of having friends to play with, and the access to more weapons like any mmo has . then theres archwings - ultra amazing warframe jetpacks with op abilities like warframes have - archwing was a whole new game to me. the only cons to this game i can think of is its a bit repetitive - and playing with random players you will not be able to execute the missions the way you want it done",9
"awesome mutiplayer game! some lags, but its only the beginning, so its ok ;)",1
"absolutely fantastic game! everybody kept telling me to play it and i finally go around to it. i wish i had start playing earlier! it plays a lot like destiny, but im actually liking it a lot more than destiny. its free to play, and has options in game to pay for materials or frame/weapon slots. but its not play to win, which is what really matters! and you are able to trade the real world money to other players, so you can get everything in the game without paying a penny (with some rare exceptions). i recommend getting a bunch of friends to play this with you. its a lot better than trying to find pugs.",2
"been trying to play the game for about 7 hours now. forums say that lots of people are experimenting this problem, and that its been around 3/4 days since they cant log in.too bad that devs havent said a single thing about.",1
"i could lie to you and say that this game respects your time, and encourages you to go outside and live life. but that would be lying. and i dont lie. this game is so much fun. the 3rd-person shooter gameplay is extremely tight and engaging, and the free-to-play model is fair. you can craft a wide variety of weapons and warframes (classes) without spending a dollar. this is coming from the perspective of someone who has only put 40-some hours in this game (at the time of this review), and i could honestly say i dont feel pressured to spend yet. try it. its free, it looks damn beautiful, and its even more fun with friends. just, be aware that it is a very grindy game if you do go through the no-spending route. (it takes quite a while to gather the materials you need). i could only imagine it will only get grindier the more you play, but trust me, whatever time you do spend before you hit that wall, it will probably be great!",2
"have been playing this since launch and it has become quite the game. the customization is insane and while a bit grindy matches with friends are a lot of fun. if you like space ninjas, try this game. even if you dont like them, its free. although not nessecary i would suggest a small payment after you feel out the game (if you like it that is) - starting out can be hard and by the time you know what you want you probably have spent time earning other things so. you still have to level up anything you get but its nice to just have a reliable weapon or something to get you through the upgrade process of other things. that is not much to ask tho for a game you can try for free lol",1
"didnt keep me hooked for long enough. and i will have you know for a picky and judgmental gamer like me, that is quite a bad sign. the long updates, the scific setting rip-off, the mediocre community ratings. convince me otherwise, but plenty of other fishes out in the sea to waste my time/energy/attention with.",1
"lots of fun. its sorta like diablo as a third-person shooter with wallrunning and no garbage loot. and you can do everything for free; paying money just means you dont need to play as much to get what you want. i highly recommend it.",5
"checking for new updates simulator 2015. would update again.",1
"action game is a poor description of warframe. it is an action rpg, and the action portion is fairly inconsequential. warframe is grindy and repetitive. many of the missions are the same, right down to the level and dialogue, but with a different name. if youre getting overwhelmed on a mission, new tactics will rarely work. you likely need to grind more or get forced to play in a group. for someone that prefers to play alone or with one other person, this game is just going to be a drag. if you enjoyed borderlands you might appreciate warframe, but borderlands is the better rpg in another genres shell.",1
"i no longer recomend this game.... i quit playing as it got boring, but my review is now not recomended. i came back as a friend told me it was better.... dont get me wrong. it was definatly better, but im disappointed. it is still the exact same thing....every time. yeah the missions are more varied now... thank god, however, what are you doing in warframe? chopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchopchop okay thats cool, but ive been doing this for what feels like decades now.... what do i do? how about go to the market and get the  you cant seem to craft! free to plays are the death of gaming.... play at your own risk of getting sucked up in a sad free to play farm fest!",1
"grind fest matches up with diablo 3s end-game ancient legendary item farm... 11/10 would farm again.",3
"platinum is a bit rare to come by unless you actively purchase it (since the other methods have you grinding out mods and whatnot and trade them from players that did purchase them) and you need platinum to buy slots for warframes and items/weapons. otherwise, happy slashing ninja dashing guns blazing into the mess of enemies.",2
"accidentally? killed entire team on defence mission 10/10 would do again",3
"kinda feels like a heavily upgraded version of the mass effect 3 multiplayer to me, pretty solid game, one of my favriots",3
"firstly, this is not a pay to win game. the game provides sleek gameplay and forces to forget everything. its too good to be true.",5
"ive played warframe for about 1.5 years now, and ive got to say, i have enjoyed every minute of it. this game has seas of content, weapons, playable characters (frames), multiple game modes, you name it. i dont think anyone can be truly done with warframe due to unending content. a lot of people say this game is just a farming simulator, which in all fairness is true, but warframe does it in such a way that it gives you more to look forward to than just one goal. pros : - regular updates - tons of content - deep customization - great visuals - sense of community / great community - amazing clan sytem design - amazing dev team - fluid gameplay cons : - buggy - unbalanced pvp - repetitive - system requirements - pay to win overall, i give warframe a 8.5/10. i look forward to seeing what this game has in store for the future :)",4
"do i recommend this game? yes i do, the constant updates and hype gives the game its edge and enjoyment. the amount of things to collect and build makes it a unique game. theres a in game cash shop, but dont worry. its 100% not pay to win. everything you see in the game are all earn through farming and earning. besides skins and cosmetics, some youll have to pay. down side to this game is it requires hours of grinding to get what you need, it does get pretty boring at some points. but whenever a new update gets released with new content, thats where the enjoyment of the game is brought back.",7
"once you start playing warframe, all youll every think about is farming. literally, this will ruin your social, spirutal, and physical life. just one more void run.....just one more.... 10/10 warfarm best farming simulator rngesus approved!",3
"when i first got this game i couldnt log in, so i contacted the customer support expecting terrible feedback, they delivered great feedback within the hour and were very respectful and really helpful, the game is awesome and i love the feedback the devs give, great game!",1
"a fun shooter and beautifully designed shooter, especially considering how its free. devs work really hard to keep things game updated and make the playing experience better. a bit too much of a grind quest for me seeing as how i dont want to spend actual money so that i can get a different character; but if thats not a problem then you need this game in your life.",1
"looking to emulate the grind of korean mmos without the endgame fun? then warframe is the game for you. in this exciting space ninja co-op disaster you get to go through countless levels killing the same ing corpus walkers as you level up your super suit to blast bosses and get more magic spandex. what can you do with your megacharged mechs? nothing! (except farm some more mods)",2
"fantastic so long as you dont powergame too much.",2
"i am probably going to buy a control pad for this game.",1
"grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind. then wait 24h for 1 item to finish.",2
"have i ever tell you, the definition of warframe: 1) play missions 2) get the blueprints which can be sold 3) trade them for platinum 4) do it all over and over and over again",3
"the game is fun but i will not play a game where thay will nurf a in game thing to the point it cant be used and in this game where you can get stuff for real world money paying 15 usd to get a gun and having it turned it to  is not a happy day",4
"jump around out of your space-ninja mind and cut a proverbial eff tonne out of more enemies than your screen can fit in it and your graphics card can render. imagine if star wars and tenchu had a baby and fed it acid, thats the general feel of warframe. its deeper than loch ness and just as vast, always something new to look at and learn. kiss goodbye to your social life and say hello to an extra two kilos of  and a lucious neck beard, neglect the missus and turn your phone off, let warframe consume you. rating - 4/5 - (minus one point for its at times grindy feel and ftp/ptw structure)",1
"it looks very hard to play.i think we need some tutorials in game to learn us how to play it. thank you :) btw the game is awesome",1
"this game is a prime example for the horrible concept of freemium gaming. - the game itself is just barely fun (actually its rather frustrating) until you pay for it. - pvp is a joke - only a handful of missions are actually profitable the rest of the +- 300 available missions just plain sucks - there is no actual loot like items for your character. its all about building more useless weapons and warframes to play with for mastery rating. (repeating the same dumb 1-30 level cycle with everything you build over and over. most weapons & warframes require 3-5 full level cycles to equip the required mods.) - credit sinks everywhere. prepare to use boosters or get credit starved. - every major addition to the game (e.g. kubrows, archwing, reputation system) turns out to be really really bad by design and doesnt add much to the game beside more options for the player to waste money or grind their brains out to actually enjoy the new content. - i could list more negative stuff for days if i wanted...trust me on this. + graphics + movement / character control tl;dr & final thought: the only thing that this freemium cashgrab game can do to get even worse is to send you push notifications on your phone.",4
"excellent potential and in development.. some bugs but theyre bbeing ironed out of course :) it just gets better!",1
"a fast paced co-op shooter, with lots of grinding for gear and characters. very fun, especially with friends, and a community full of bros",1
"not all free games are so epic.by saying epic i mean ultra epic and never forget game! 8/10..",2
"this is a great game for anyone who loves ninjas, grinding, and salad. 10/10",1
"hands down this is one of the best free to play games that i have ever played, still impressed with every update.",6
"its a very fun game that you cant stop playing,its like a better version of destiny",2
"very fun game. made me very addicted in just a few hours, must download!!!",1
"my computer doesnt run this very well as its a huge game to even download alone, but i do play it on ps4 and i could recommend it to most patient players, however i could say its not for impatient people unless youre willing to blow through a bit of cash to get your head start a little quicker than others. cool game about a 7.5/10. (alot of glitches, then again its still beta).",1
"the game is awesome. the combat is very cool and inovative. one single thing i dont like is that the ui is very very very clunky. please guis redesign the ui please.",1
"better than destiny in every way. cant beat free. the game is gorgeous and combat is fun and a blast with a buddy, but i just dont like the in game purchases, think they are way to expensive, we are not talking .99cents for angry birds here, some of these items are more than i care to spend, but you might like it so i say its an awesome game and worth it to try it.",1
"fantastic game, whether you only play for free, or purchase things. it has a great community, and above all else, the dev team communicates with the gamers more often than most other studios.",4
"a highly action packed third person shooter, with a space ninja theme. you are a tenno an ancient breed of warriors who insight justice and restore balance across the solar system. slice, shoot, blow your way through all your enemies. with a unqiue modding systems that allows you to adapt your playstyle to your very own. the fight has just begun tenno.",10

"you like ninjas? how about space? if so, play this game!",6
"awesome, especially for f2p game. between primary weapons, the co-op play, the melee weapons. and the warframes this game has tons to do. though i will admit that it can get redundant at times theres so much to do that those moments of redundancy dont last to long.",4
"very fun, gets repetitive after a few hours of gameplay(i have played for well over 500 hours :p), lots of events to keep you into the game.",6
"after many decades of grinding, i have finally reached the final stage....oh wait. 10.5/10 - ign 24/7 grind recommended",1
"warframe is a third person shooter set in a sci fi universe. you play as a ninja alien that can take the form of any warframe, which is just a fancy way to distinguish the different classes. it starts out a bit cliche, but has a shocking level of depth once you crack the surface. its especially fun if you can get 4 friends together, in the same way payday is fun. sure, its a grind sometimes... but is it really a grind if the activities are a blast? i definitely recommend warframe.",1
"wonderful game for pc (if your pc is up to its requirements), really recommend it, except sometimes the game will log you out and you have to relog.",1
"10/10 like skyrim with guns and space and a few ninjas -ign",1
"+character designs is pretty cool +really good gameplay +co-op +lens flare is awesome +graphic is pretty good +same mission -->random map/ spawn place +its free ! -you might want to play this with friends -i just dont like some of its bgm -melee system is good but it can be better -fighting some bosses doesnt feel like boss fight at all overall, this is one of the best f2p game. if you like to wall run, do double backflip, and stab guys in the chest this is definitely your game.",3
"this game definitly belongs a one of best games i have played. what warframe might be lacking, devs surely develop game eagerly. years what i have followed this game, they still have a fire on their soul when making more content and taking game further with a each update. for new players, it might feel little bit at start overwhelming what do in a warframe. but once you find bunch of friends who play with and just play, thats when warframe shows how fun game it can be... i definitly recommend this game, even it has little connecting problems between some players. and it has years i have played maybe 3 times on me, i definitly say everyone should give it a try! and try watch one of they dev streams and you will understand what i mean that devs truly make this game with passion...",6
"absolutely obsessed with the game, its in my dreams and will not let me go.",2
"after a few updates down the way and friends swearing me up and down that the game is better, i have it another try, starting again from scratch so i could try again the tutorial and i have to admit that the game is loads better. the tutorial is way better and everything is explained (even though theres a few flaws still) the only downside i would say about warframe is that its very grindy but theres a lot of content, especially with a free to play game. i would definitely recommend getting into it now, giving it a try.",1

"good game i like it it was awesome in beta and still awesome now",1
"truly an astounding game. hope it doesnt die off. everything in the game is obtainable by buying with platinum or grinding, making it possible to earn all items by grinding instead of spending money to get in game items.",2
"its a real time action game. if you dont dodge or block fast enough you dont want to find out what will happen to you. there are times when you definitely dont want to go into a level alone because you will need help from others.",1
"lets just say, your going to be doing one certain mission a lot. in warframe, you have to buy blueprints to get new weapons and stuff. after you buy blueprints you have to get certain materials. after you get said materials, you can craft it, and its going to take about a day for the item to actually craft. wait simulator 2099 10/10 would allahu ackbar again",1
"great shooter in a great f2p model. real fun while playing solo and also with friends!",2

"hands down most aaa completely free-to-play on steam. next to tf2 and dota2.",1
"this game has heavily influenced my switch from the generic mmo rpg to the action-rpg format that i once hated, but now enjoy more than anything, other than premaridal affairs ;). the textures and postprocessing in warframe prove to keep the player immersed in the games universe for hours on end, as well as the sound track. originally when i was made aware of the cross-platform title i cringed, but as they proved this was both possible and able to be done properly. i give kudos to those who labored for years to make this possible. thank you to the production team and the programmers who made this game, the masterpiece that it is. i will be logging in as soon as my steam client is up to date.",1

"i really like this game because of all of the stuff that you can do, you can play with your friends, unock a metric crap ton of items, have a companion, and many more things. plus the gameplay is amazing along with the graphics and animations. if you have not tried this then i recommend playing this amazing looking, fun playing, very addictive, mmo shooter.",1

"i love the game i cant say anything bad about it other than they need to fix the loading bug when it stops its so annoyeing",1
"alien space ninjas? never expected to run into something that could pull it off, but i was wrong. running through a horde of alien humpback robot(?) soldiers with a sword, sneaking around with a bow, blasting your way around with a shotgun and machine guns. yeah, this game is fun. gameplay is great, graphics are good, payment is there (duh) but you can work around it. this is certainly not pay to play at lower levels, but you will begin to notice it. by the time you see this youll probably have read the reviews by the guys with 1,000+ hours, and for the most part, theyre correct, this game is great. of course, while playing alone is fun, running around assasinating hunchbacks and robots with a group of friends is much, much more fun. this game pulls to co-op play off nicely, and thats something most games have a problem with. but by all means, dont take my word for it, go ahead and download it. it is free after all.",1
"this is a very fun game also it has very good graphics and it is free to play",1
"this game is awesome! i just looked at the trailer and thought meh, its another shoot em up with a sci-fi look. ill get it i got it at first and started lagging. then the gameplay didnt lag a single bit. cutscenes a bit laggy. then i played the campaign with some strangers playing the game and its awesome! this game is f2p (free-2-play) so you know their will be some in-game currency that you buy with steam money, but thats comepletely optional! sometimes in the maps you have no where you are supposed to go. and, there is the solo play. ah, the solo play. its harder in solo then in online. (obviously) and when i say harder then online, i mean so hard. i cant even explain how hard it is. great story, great graphics, great gameplay, no lag in gameplay, lag in cutscenes, way too hard in solo play, in-game currency, etc. i give this game a 8/10",1

"only got to play it once and it was amazing. only problem is that it will never load the game.",1
"for me personally, it was fun for a little while, but got very repetitive very fast. i would recommend it as a game to play for a little while or to people who like grinding in an extremely repetitive environment and love the scifi kind of thing.",1
"great game i have a great time playing with my friend and others. would definitely recommend this game to everyone because of three reasons, its fun, its free, and its multiplayer.",6
"what an amazing game. warframe. ah... this game is very fun for people who enjoy the option of choosing a character that suits the rpg element of their playstyle. the graphics are outstanding, and the replay value... well varies. you see, when people get into this game, they play it for a long time, then stop. it depends if they do come back to play this game again or not, but if they do, they will surely enjoy it. here are my ratings: story: 5/10 graphics: 7/10. gameplay: 9/10. replayability: 4-6/10. funfactor: 7/10. = 66/100, or 66% recommendation.",6

"this reminds me of mass effect 3s multiplayer, except warframe plays faster and with more game modes. the graphics are impressive, and the powers and weapons are satisfying to use. no game released in 2014 convinced me to stop playing this one for more than a week or so, and i think that says something about the quality of this game. if you are new to the game, i strongly recommend spending the free starting platinum on a warframe slot and some weapon slots; every other non-cosmetic item can be obtained via gameplay.",9
"tenno out of ten. would be space wizard ninja with a gun again",1

"i have been playing warframe since the beginning. the game has changed a  ton and they are always adding new and exciting things. since i started playing,we have gotten hundreds of weapons,a bunch of frames,new game modes,new...everything,basically. warframe has become a permanet addition to my main played games just make sure you are not afraid of grind and you have a lot of time on your hands. takes hours to build a weapon :p",6

"love this game. so many options! male and female warframes, weapons, accessories, and companions, and so much more. i love how you can customize just about everything color-wise, if you can buy the color pallettes. my only hang up is that platinum (the currency you can pay actual cash for.) is pretty expensive. but you can wait and see if you get a discount on it in your daily bonus, or you can trade prime parts for it, so it isnt too big a deal, just takes longer that way. its pretty amazing to play with other people and friends as well, jokes galore and you can mess with your friends. theres also some funny glitches that happen... like falling out of the map, getting stuck in walls and things and so on. the glitches dont happen often though and it only happens usually when the player is doing something they probably shouldnt do... like run at a wall full speed or jump up the elevator shaft while its moving and go through the ceiling. good game. 10/10",2

"give this game a try. its free! its a great concept, with great combat, great graphics, greatly improved/improving controls, and best of all, a dev team that is constantly trying to one-up their past updates. first there was melee 2.0, now theres conclave (pvp) 2.0, and from what ive heard, next will be a major movement overhaul (see the tombs of the sentient trailer). thats right, they might finally be putting the ninja part into space robot ninja warrior. with almost 300 hours under my belt, i can say with the utmost confidence that this game is one of the most entertaining games that ive ever had the pleasure of spending less than $60 in for sweet new gear. did i mention its still in beta? at least try this game. get your second warframe, and then you have my permission to say nah man, this aint me.",3

"ive often asked myself: how could a free to play game possibly be worth it? i mean it must be free for a reason? planetside 2 for example, kinda sucked and i couldnt get into it at all. but on friends recommendation i downloaded warframe - and i know im only 30 minutes into playing the game and i might get bored of it after a while - but this is just awesome and definantly worth the $0 and 6gig on my computer. starts off with some standard but epic melee combat before introducing you to the third person shooter experience and i straight away grabbed the bow and arrow and just couldnt believe how much enjoyment i was having already. but by far the best part of the game and what sets it apart from other fpss tpss etc, is the movement mechanics. my ogd. does this bring back some oldschool memories speedrunning mario/ banjo kazooie/ crash bandicoot, trying to get extra speed by fluent combinations of different movements. beautiful! these movement mechanics are what makes a 2d scroller like speedrunners fun and is perfectly incorporated into this new style of game, cant wait to see what is in store for the rest of the game but it was worth it already",1
"warning: this game has some sort of mind control that makes it really fun to grind levels for hours every day. join the infested.",2
"a while ago, i used to play this a lot. i had the same stock weapons for a long time, because its so hard to get a new weapon. when i finally got a new weapon (it was expensive), it sucked. i dont want to grind. but when i did grind, i got a cool gun. then my computer broke. rip",1
"this game is a fun (but gorey) thirdperson shooter and when i played it for the first time i thought the graphics and the gameplay was pretty good.",1
"warframe is a very good game it have a story which is very interesting for those people who never try out this game you should try it out.warframe is also based on future and it have a third person view and awesome abilities u guys should try it out!",6
"warframe is a nicely done sci-fi hack-and slash third-person shooter with lots of customization options and replayability. each warframe has 4 abilities and can be equipped with lots of passive upgrades, called mods, which drop randomly from enemies. everything in this game can be bought with ingame money, as well as real money. the level-design remembers me somehow of lego, as there are finished rooms which are put together randomly every level to make every level unique. the ai is pretty good, too. enemies are trying to take cover most of the time and barely stand out in the open. it actually has no story yet, but that doesnt really matter, as it is still a lot of fun, specially with friends, to slice/shoot your way through hordes of enemies. it gets pretty boring after a while though.",1
"its pretty, well-designed, enjoyable and has lots of lovely weapons with which you can run around doing murders for kicks. however, it is an mmo and will likely eat your soul. that said, at least it doesnt try too hard to extort money out of you with microtransactions. if you work hard, literally anything (except the founders pack, which is basically just a reskin of the old newb kit and some other, non-gameplay-affecting stuff) the game has to offer is available to you. 9.5/10 would consign life to endless grinding again",2
"if this game only ran on a cheese grater, i would still play it.",9
"fun for some time, but then it gets reeeeeeaaaaaaalllllyyyyyyyyyy grindy. i am over 20 hours in and there has been no progression at all.",1
"absolute badassness. basic day in this game wake up attack space cyborgs get attacked by said space cyborgs attack space clone zombie things (no really what are the grineir?) kill their leader fly through space on a jet pack. get into your space ship and pop a space beer and whatch space hockey in space",1
"this is a great game if your playing with friends. you can get warframes by playing the game and not spending a dime.",2
"great game, absolutely love it, whenever i find myself playin other games i get this nagging feeling to always come back to warframe. i swear its an addiction lol.",3
"its a fun and awesome game if u really like third person i recommend this game",1
"warframe is honestly one of the best games i have ever played. its a tps/parkour game it is still a little buggy but that is totally forgivable once you experience the gameplay. not only is this game fun its an experience the way you interact with the environment makes you feel as if you were actually in the game wall jumping, and parkouring through the maps of the world, but anyways positives and negatives aside this game scores a 9/10 from me would reccomend to friends and family.",3
"one of few games that make you feel like a real space ninja",1
"i think that you guys should offer a more first person view. ^^",1
"this game is very repetitive. i mean if you are really into grinding over and over and over again, you should probably get that checked out, but you can also see if this game solves your problems.",1
"i admit that when i first started playing this game i was impressed with all the bells and whistles that the game had to offer for a free to play game. i played it so much at first that i got burnt out on it and the game just felt like a grinding fest. which in essence it is, but what really helps when playing this game is to make friends. your friends (if they have been playing for an extended period of time) will beable to give you the information you need to meet your goals of a new weapon/warframe and make the process extremely simple. if you like playing lone wolf that is fine as well you can set your misson access to invite-only and if you need information check the wiki. simply play how you want.",3
"this game is probably one of my favorite games ive ever played. the story line behind it all is very creative and i havent heard anything like it. i heavily recommend this game not just because of the gameplay, but because of the developers that repeatedly update this game so its at its highest point of operation, and the players that play the game. most of the community are very cool helpful peopel that will help you get an understanding of the game. so all in all i would rate it 4/20 would blaze again.",9
"some missions are really difficult, and most of this game requires your actual money to get platinum and purchase things from the market, and those are the only negative things i really can say about this game. the gameplay is fun, the voice actors are great and i really like how you unlock new missions and how you can customize the appearance of things in your loadout. 7.5/10 ign.",1

"how to win the war in this frame: you dont. your not fighting because you want to, you fight because all the newbs keep asking questions and randomly inviting you to there games because you have either a. high lvl gear, b.high mastery rank, c. prime gear and look cool with it. other wise its a space ninja game where your not even ninjas due to the fact ninjas play for free but you still have to pay for stuff... oh theres space russians and space jews along with space ebola, + on a side note you can as edgy as you want. screw those bright colors, get the smoke color pack, anything red, tr(ash), a dragon nikana and play some linkin park... not edgy enough? get the itzel archwing and paint it the same way? still not edgy enough? well nobody gives two s***s because your playing the game wrong!!! 10/10 would play as loki prime again",6

"f2p done right, is a bit grindy but as you can tell from the time played there is plenty to do",9
"game got everything you could desire. the combat system is almost perfect. huge arsenal filled with polearms, axes, maces, whips, ranged weapons, alive swords, lazors, something that spitsa acid, flamethrowers and this list goes on! more than 20 different characters with unique skillset. every single one is good for no matter which mission you are doing which means everything depends on your own preferences. you can play however you like. bunch of customization options, colors, atachments. amazing comunity, helpful, friendly and funny. frequent updates, great lore, funny devs. everything comes free to play. what are you waiting for, grab this game! p.s. did i mention you can play as humanoid dragon? which spits fire!",5
"ive only played it for a few hours and i can already tell that this game is awesome. all f2p games should have this kind of system for free users. definitely not p2w since this game is pretty much coop.. i guess..",1
"my sword glitched/stopped working and i ran out of ammo so i had to jumpkick a boss to death. a+",2
"i was short on money and was looking for a game that was f2p and thats when i saw warframe. i thought it looked pretty cool and similar to destiny. ive only had the game for a week and have already spen 30+ hours playing it. the game has lots of options for playstyle with different warframes. only drawback is that it takes a while to farm the mats required to build them, as well as the blueprints. though you can also pay to get them (im just cheap). though there is a grind to it, the levels can be really quick so it makes it really easy to hop in and do something and not be there a long time.",1
"nice new interface, hud has improved a lot, new warframes seem cool and the game is just not garbage anymore-ign approved",4
"i recommend this game because it is absolutly amazing and i can tell what ill be spend hours playing after i finish a school assignment :( but i have one issue..... the game freezes all the time and i dont know why, is there a setting i can change for it to stop freezing my specs cpu: amd a10-6800k (more stuff) 4.10 ghz gpu: asus geforce gtx 760 oc ram: 8 gb power supply: 700w i have a cpu cooler",1
"m just gonna write down the fact that why i am playing this game so some can relate and give it a shot ;).  love playing competitive games (mostly moba) but after a while toxicity of these games is building up and overwhelming. that is when warframe is come along. f you want to just chill and look good x) this game is just for you my friend.",7
"space ninjas. so much fun updates all the time, great events, if you thank this game is ptw you are wrong it is more like event to win lol great game 10/10",5
"everyone should play warframe. its free. its fast paced. its balls out. its ninjas being boss  ninjas, and the best part about it is, ninjas play free. p.s. people who think warframe is pay to win, its not. people who buy all there gear, and upgrades lack actual skill in the game. so if you want to be a boss earn your boss status.",7
"amazing visuals, and super entertaining. the classess are so different, its like each one is different playstyle. the only bad thing about it is the ridicolous amount of bloom. seriously. my eyes hurt from the bloom.",1

"ok, ftp this is a damn good game. pros: fast action, combat is a blast flashy graphics is a good term for them especially liked the melee its a better first/third hybrid than firefall (where you also use warframes) cons: shallow--read, not an rpg, youre a combat drone flashy graphics are kind of stupid, characters are cool, enemies look clunky if you slip up early, you cant change things much without paying--wouldnt call it pay to win, but pay to change t what you really want. i really wish they had made it umm...something relevant like...cyberpunk maybe or...a zombie slayer or....something that makes some kind of sense rather than this weird tenno alien thing. but for fun, playable, combat video game...its pretty tight.",1

"i played this game for a while, i enjoyed this game a lot. i invited couple friends and it made it even better. from getting all the chartchers, to openning achivemeants and getting lots of kubrows (pets) earned about 500 platinium legit by selling prime stuff i got from missions. its a really fun game, but it i really got bored later, but... getting bored after 563 hours, is normal. also take the fact its free.",5

"actually its not bad game, but its not my cup of tea. graphics pretty good and controls are quite handy. the weakest thing is storyline. i know i havent played it a lot, but i have no motivation to play it more. its nothing for me, but i think that for someone it can be very enjoyable. well, so go for it!",1
"this game is outstanding, a real gem. unfortunately, as a gem, its a bit rough and needs quite a bit of refinement and polish. (warning, wall-o-text / bullet list incoming!) pros:",4
"what makes me the most mad at this game is they suddenly decide to start removing primewarframes and when you ask for help on reigonal chat you get kicked but noone in recruiting chat helps or even talks apart from spam the entire thing for the longest time ive wanted frost prime but all the missions to get him ive played 7 times and all i get is barrels for weapons which has just gotten me more depressed.... -----what would help and change my opinon------- open up on special day like christmas,easter,new years any special event open up the orkin home planet and you can choose what warframe or weapon to go for and they are named as mission eg. orkin home planet frost prime helmet. but anyone can do this no key or anything but a very high level and they have to be above mastery rank 5 to play it and if you play it to much you get hunted by orkin squads in normal missions, if this was to happen i would be alot happier with the game and it would change my opinon but for now i am unhappy with the game although the game play is good the mechainics arent like neurodes are impossible to find in early stages if what i suggested was added i would be happier with the game and spend more time on it although this is not much like a review currently if you like being upset by unconvient things this is the game for you!",2

"biggest money pit since mtg, but addicting unfortunatly.",4
"the 1# problem for this game is that the customer support is pathetic blizzard has better customer support and they own multiple games with accounts ranking in the millions warframes accounts : barely 1000 with endless promotes from sony the support ticket hours are 6am to 9pm only week days seem decent for the we only patch 2 small glitches a patch struggle jeez what is the poor digital extremes going through? but wait lets not compare warframe to blizzard the match up is highly uncomparable. lets see what they do with there momentum ps. pay to win or grind while experiencing hardships and glitches youd think god create",4
"really amazing f2p, hell imo the best one out there, pretty much everything is obtainable without shelling out a dime, which is sadly very rare now days in the f2p zone. also no pay to win either another major upside. only downside id say is not enough different environments if that makes sense allot of the game looks the same, theyve added tons since ive started and still continue to, anyways. great time killer!",9
"some what repetative game at times when you have played it 1000+ hours but its worth it, its a 1-4 co op game with some pvp features such as duals and so on. it has fun clan features like clan dojo that can be built by clan members. there is a lot of choice between weapons and warframes (classes). but the most interesting thing about this game is that it is not p2w instead event 2 win and the updates come faster with new content than any game out there also this game requires you to work hard for the best items and frames in the game through skill and cooperation with others.",3
"the best kind of grindfest i want to be a part of.",6
"where to start? oh over 820 hours spent in this game. this game... why would you not want to slice up enemies in numerous ways? this game does have a lot of repitition in grinding for the parts for various things, but when you finally build that thing you worked a week of your life for, you have a great sense of self satisfaction and a week of your life gone. all in all. get this if you are into fast paced parkour, killing, ninjas, or any type of 4 player co-op game. there are several different levels to play in this game. try it out and you too may some day have 800+ hours into this game. :d",7
"space ninja , co-op and free move third person shooting... its a whole new experience",2
"its a great game to play, either you like love gore, blood and love to shoot or use swords..then this is the game for you. and, as well like any other game, you can buy yourself into the game, the way warframe grew is spectacular. from the frames that came out, as for the primes as well. however i cannot say how its now. as from the new update i can longer play. its a bummer for p2w players (yes im admit that im a p2w) and no i wasnt banned. but as i see the new updates its got to be better. keep up the good work warframe, you will always be my fav game to play!",5
"if you like being a stealthy ninja going around killing people. then this game is for you if not the your wasting you gb.",1
"the game is great overall, but i am not a fan of the lag problems once you play though the game for a few days",1
"great game idea, and excellent gameplay. pros: -fukn space ninjas, nuff said. -customizable, pink rhino anyone? -you can own this dog wolf thing and some other floating robot thing and they beat and shoot the sheet out of your enemies -fukn ninja magic, i absolutely love crashing into space robots while my teammate zaps him to god knows what cons: -feels a bit like pay 2 play -matchmaker usually pairs me up with nobody and i end up doing missions alone and use up revives as a result -they removed loki from the three warframes youre able to choose from damnit -last year loki was the sheet 9/11 would keep in steam library",1
"great game ,but there is one problem some pepeole cant play online because the loading screen freezes or it is stuck or take to long pls fix in update plz plz plz plz",1
"if you like space ninjas and killing things this is for you",1
"if i fail at maths ill blame this game. i still regret nothing, 10/10",1
"this game is awesome. i really like the freedom to choose whether to go all out and rip up the mobs or complete the mission in stealth, nearly undetected. unlike a lot of games, this game has levels for each part of the equipment, and it is upgraded the more you play. moreover, there are a lot of rare items that you basically can loot, however it may be hard to find a specific one. the upgrading system is based on your decisions how to customize your character, and you can always recustomize it the way you like / the way thats most fit to your quest. once again, awesome game, highly recommended!",1
"this is one fun game. if you like cutting things up swords and shooting enemies with future weapons, and if you are a ninja, i suggest that you buy this game because all is included. it is free to play and pretty simple to master.",1
"repetitive as hell, would be much more fun if they stop recycling the maps and how the hell do i link my warframe account with steam? lol 10/10 would r8t again",2
"this game is a great 3rd person, action/adventure with some extreme shooter elements. you will find it highly enjoyable, the graphics are impressive and the gameplay is smooth and gritty. it points at extremely dystopian future, that might not even involve humans as we know them! warframes are probably the single, most intriguing aspect of the game, exo-skeletal armor done at its finest, with unlimited custimization and scary amounts of variety, this a game you and your friends could play all weekend!",2
"warframe is a very skilled action packed mmo. teams of four (and 8 for raids after update 16) on every mission vs an untold number of ai controlled enemies trying to stop you and your teammates from your common goal, wiki info: warframe is set in a distant future where the solar system is torn between the grineer, an empire race of militarized clones; the corpus, a mega-corporation merchant cult with advanced robotics and laser technology; and the infested, the victims fallen under the scourge of technocyte virus. the player takes the role of a tenno, a member of a fourth faction with a mysterious and unclear nature, and is guided by an entity called the lotus through missions. the game is constantly being updated keeping it fresh and exiting all the time. controller support witch should be fantastic for a game on this high acrobatic level needs serious work, the chat & trading menu is also lacking in innovation that other games have implemented but overall.........i highly recommend this game, it is free 2 play so download it and enjoy.",5
"failed tutorial and first mission in the game. played for 4 hours until got around finishing it. gets ddl. error with the graphics. game shuts down. tutorial was never done, takes me 5 more hours to do the same. i find steam version... dont even wanna try. i try... ddl. error, fails tutorial. 420/10 m8",1

"after playing this for 2 years since open beta first started, still going more content coming all the time and awesome devs and help services :) live streams to keep you up to date and hype trains everywhere for the new content.",1
"great game with ever changing world and developer that has great rep from the community helping them create the game! most of the content is available with effort and timing making most payed options being a shortcut or boost. the game is iffy in the sense that it has no endgame content minus one raid which imo seems like a lazy boss clone. the game has a great selection of warframes (the games classes/characters) and weapons to match anyones playstyle with a unique concept of mods that can be inplemented like runes/gems in diablo that dynamically effect how the weapons are used. the game is great fun and contains pvp and pve. personal note is that the game is catered more to pve than pvp, and its combat is varied, but lacks depth because of it (melee, ranged, stealth?) making the game feel stale after a long period of time.",6
"a lot of fun so far. a bit like destiny mixed with halo. love the customization of your character.",1
"i dont usualy post game reviews but ill make an exception this time since this game still gives me thrills 1.do not play warframe if you suffer from epilepsy(youll get nocked down like 10 min into the game by the graphics) 2.do not play if youre a lone wolf(soloing maps its really hard,trust me) 3.do not play if you have exams or work the next day(youll never make it there) play if you like fun challenging comunity games,make friends(in game comunity is really helpfull and nice). read the game channels rules,you will get kicked no matter who you are(love this one) highly recomending it",1
"very recommended, good rpg games. but run (little lag) on 2gb ram. but i very like it",1
"one of my favorite games of all time (so far). the atmosphere of the games tilesets are pretty immersive, but the lack of lore (upfront) might be a turn off. most newbies think this game is quest based, but actually quests are more of a side-thing , and your main goal is to amass a collection of everything. yes, this game is a grind monster, but something about it makes it enjoyable. (weird, huh.) starting may be hard, since you have no resources to craft, or you feel intimidated by the higher ranking players, but give it some time and youll be on your way! the devs are always in touch with the community, staff are in the subreddit, forums, always eager to ask questions, and theyare activily updating the game! my rating? 9/10",8
"ive played this same game on playstation4 you get a diffirent story and missions for each charater i think you should buy it all said and done",1
"loved this game for 3 months. now my friends dont play. wish i could have the $200 back i spent for in game currency. oh well, it was fun for a while. the team work and gun play is great and the devs are always adding stuff. the missions however do get repetitive after a while. but you should still play it.",2
"love the game i feel like the grinding isnt bad at all, basically i feel like this is what destiny should have been more like .",3
"it sucks. forgot my password and they wont let me play thats dumb.",2
"very good game looks great they put alot time into everything !! i only wish they make it a freeroam mmo later down the road or add spaceship fights into !! then it would be crazy good !!",4
"cyborg space ninjas with special powers, need i say more? i do - the tile sets are massivly repetative so once you learn where all the doors are you can get a little bored however its a fun game the shooting is smooth melee is a nice addition and the boss fights actually feel like boss fights (try soloing lech kril!) worth it, you should but this game",2
"great game, fast paced action, you can jump in with anyone right from the begining, and yet there is so much to strive for. mildly grindy to get what you need, but after 40ish hours, it doesnt seem excessive to get whatever i want. microtransaction currency is fully tradeable with other players, and is only needed to expand your inventories, otherwise everything can be achieved through grinding if youd rather not pay. you cant buy experience or skill, and for the most part you really only get the option to buy cosmetics. f2p at its core, and i love that.",1
"highly recommend if you like to farm for your ego.",1
"third person shooter. many active skills. space. ninja. parkour. crafting. nuff said",1
"love this game nothing wrong with it other than the fact that there is nothing wrong with it..... one thing though... you have to grind like craaaaaaaazy x) which also kinda makes this game fun :d luv it keep working guys!!",1
"i would give this game +1 do to the fact of how well the game is put together, and the updates as well.",1

"really well-made game that introduces features like sprinting and shooting at the same time, a little bit of parkour, crafting, shooting behind you while running, and other well-made features. i highly recommend this game!",1
"welcome to *warfarm, the game where all you do is grind a sickening amount of time into unlocking things you dont need. at first, this appears to be another fast paced fps with nice graphics and a large player base, but if you play for more than 20 minutes, you realize that all you do...literally...is farm on boring maps for hours and hours...and hours. seriously, i got bored of this game after about...5 hours playtime. and if you like the game but cant be bothered spending your entire life farming for 1 item and want to just buy some platinum (ingame money) to get something...think again! for 75 platinum, enough for 1 bad warframe or some resources, you will pay = 3.99...what?? this game is aweful, please dont waste your time with it like i did. 2/10 (the 2 is a gift). :p",1
"not bad at all, really enjoy playing it, and the graphics are amazing. do i also need to mention that its free?",1
"great game! warning : if you dont like farming or putting money on games dont play. takes time but is sooo fun and you can get everything the game has to offer without using $$!",1
"in a galaxy where leveling up causes you to die, you play as one of many alien ninja things and try to kill freaky human things, robot people, things that look like they came out of youre cats bowel movement. this friendly game of hide-and-go-die takes you all across the solar system, killing everything in your path, whether its innocent or not. youll meet many new friends, such as salad, lappy, sally, jim, bob, and tim, harvey, and many others as they try to ruthlessly slaughter you as you attempt to become stronger. but do not let this get you down! you also have an option to get a pet dog creature, which will constantly block every shot you attempt to make, get killed, and die of destablization because you forgot to take care of it! this is a must play game for those that enjoy nice repetitive games, only spending time to farm for items, level up different things, or just overall screw around!",4
"this game is awesome but if u your internet sucks dont download it u will lag a lot so yeah",1
"played the first mission got to the end, and the game stopped working, it b8ted me, spent $100 to win the game, and it didnt give me the weapon i wanted (miss click) silly game, its not like real life, aliens arent real! jks, illuminati is real, gabe is watching.",1
"this game is pretty fun, but their switching you from the easily killed grineer to the not-affected-by-punture-damage-deal-with-it corpus crewmen can be a shock for new players. there are a couple more problems i have with the game, such as the flawed stealth system. enemies are comically dumb, but they more than make up for it with their apparently psychic abilities. as soon as you fail to kill one enemy with a shot from the paris, they all know your exaclt location, and know where you are everywhere and at any time until you kill all of them.",1
"you might ask me what the game of free games steam nicest and i will answer warframe",1
"amazing co-op games with many characters and wepons to chose from get warframe its amazing!",1
"the controls are tight. the sounds are nice. the environments are appealing. the sfx are appropiate for what happens. the different warframes are all unique in both looks, and abilities. all-in-all, not a bad game, i highly recommend you atleast try it.",1
"this game has greatly improved after its mass of updates, i think this game has now become more enjoyable and interesting now it has a more understandable and proper campaign. however i dont like the fact that you have to pay real money to buy objects and that players should at least be aloud to buy things temporarally or have a test for the object they want to buy.",1
"so the developers obviously put in a lot of effort into making you a badass and thats great, but unfortunately the enemies and the environments are repeatative and boring thus making this game rather mediocre.",1
"hey linux gamer, do bother to try and get this game to on your os! its worth it! ive played it on the ps4, loved it, now im playing it on pc. however, i would really hope that de ports this game to linux, since you willencounter some graphical glitches that can ruin the gameplay experience pros: + mission variety, and it keeps it from getting too repetitive. + instead of bunny hopping like in quake, you copter your way through the level (movement exploit). very fast paced! + farming is somewhat managable if you know what your doing (refer to their wikia) minor nuancees: - still not for linux! - pvp is somewhat broken as of v16 (because youll be facing some high level primed warframes with their higher tier guns). - 3rd person camera issues in tight areas no tux, no bux. im not throwing my money at de just yet.",1
"a great cooperative game where you can pretty much be a space ninja. fancy.",2
"f2p done right, is a bit grindy but as you can tell from the time played there is plenty to do",9
"in warframe, like many free games you can aquire a currency called platinum. platinum is not used to restrict or neglect players who have not donated, it is their to make your experience go much faster. this game is not a rip off or waist of time. try it out i think that you will like it.",2
"the only thing i like about this game is the sexy robot porn i found 8/10",1
"game got everything you could desire. the combat system is almost perfect. huge arsenal filled with polearms, axes, maces, whips, ranged weapons, alive swords, lazors, something that spitsa acid, flamethrowers and this list goes on! more than 20 different characters with unique skillset. every single one is good for no matter which mission you are doing which means everything depends on your own preferences. you can play however you like. bunch of customization options, colors, atachments. amazing comunity, helpful, friendly and funny. frequent updates, great lore, funny devs. everything comes free to play. what are you waiting for, grab this game! p.s. did i mention you can play as humanoid dragon? which spits fire!",5
"fun free game to play with friends. there has been lots of improvements since i first started playing and it looks better everytime i see it. i think destiny took warframes design. great game!",1
"i have spent several hours trying to get this game to not crash after 2 minutes,but to no avail.",1
"i have about 500 hours on the game or more and i must say graphics are great runs smooth seems to for alot of other people to crashes sometimes but not to often great game over all strongly recomend it to anyone who likes third person co-op gameplay",4
"the gane its self isnt to bad. its a good bit of fun and has some real nice gaphics. ive only played a little less then ten hours of it, butive already started to see a trend. if you want to get anywhere decent and stand a chance at the pvp or at getting kills during the co-op, youve got to spend real world money. thats the one thing that sort of kills the experiance for me. i bought the game for the whole free to play aspect, but right now its looking like more of a free to play, pay to win type of game. like i said though, if you dont mind getting less kills or having a hard time killing other players, the game isnt bad. specially when you play single player or with guys around your handicap.",1
"it appears that the user base for this game are always late for something. this game has turned into who can get to the end quickest. cons: -users hurry hurry hurry mentality. -the same people that get, wow did you even taste that?. -the same people that speed past you on the road only to get caught at a traffic light as you stroll up going the speed limit making them look like . -hurry up and wait crowd. proconish: you can play with those people for free. pro: uninstall capability.",1

"welp. the time has come for a review! pros- smooth gameplay awesome characters customizable tons of weapons new maps and characters added now and then(which is cool) beautiful graphics cons- you need to wait a little to build a new warframe, or a new weapon, but its ok! its worth waiting. and..thats all from my personal experience ._. died from shockwave moa bug, got shot down from grineer ballista, burned to crisp from grineer napalm.. ten out of ten would again die from all of these things, so i can revive, and kick their  back! good job.i recomment this game to anyone who likes 3rd person shooter with a lot of guns, customizasion, and gameplay.",2
"took me over 250 hours to get bored of this game. thats only cause i ran out of warframes and weapons that i wanted. updates always adding new content, free to play and oozing badass out of every pixel. this is one of the best games ive ever played and the only game i would ever pay real money for ingame content. fair systems, strategy and action like ive never seen before. worth every second ive put into it and i know i will be back for more. (just wish events werent so easy to miss...)",3
"awsome game but sometimes allot of bugs on the game... but still its space ninjas for crying out loud :d",2
"this is possibly the worst game i have ever played. the reason i say this is, it will not even launch properly, something about the http or something, i have put a couple hours into fixing it, and none of the things i have done has fixed it. so because i cant even play the game, i must say this is the worst game i have even tried. sorry if you love the game, but its not my fault, it wont launch. it seems it is actually a reoccuring error, i hope it fixes though. my friend loves the game though. its just not my thing to sit hours on end to try to fix a game, but yeah i gotta give it a thumbs down. sorry to all the fans of warframe.",1
"a very good game to get a laugh with friends or to be mgl 420 360 noscope snyper???!!!",1

"free to play swording space ninja marines with superpowers in randomly generated squad coop levels with great graphics and polish, whats not to love?",2
"after playing more than 100 hours, i feel the game play is slow and there are no real goals with the game. you get mastery ranks wich allows you to buy new items such as weapons. dont be fooled by this system it took me closer to 100 hours inb4 i got to rank 6. there is no real focus on getting progress on the planets you unlock, becouse once you are geard enough to do void you will farm it forever and hope for prime parts wich you can use and sell for platinum(real money currency). platinum is used for new slots. theis (slots) are ment for new weapons new warframes, sentinels and so on. you only start with 2 warframe slots, so if you want more chars to choose from you have to buy it. the other down side i found is that the only way to get mr(matery rank) is to lvl everything to 30. after that you either sell it or keep it. how ever you cannot lvl the same item twice so dont buy the same weapon more then once. if you like theis types of games look up destiny, pretty much the same game.",1
"this game is really really great . thanks to the developer",1
"if you havent at least tried out warframe, its about time to give it a try. its has a lot of very interesting aspects for a free to play. different play styles, configuations and customizations to play around with. add cool looking guns and melee weapons along side a parkour like battle system and you have a game that you will either love or hate.",3
"although its a free to play, still has much more content and less grinding than destiny",1
"there has been many changes since the initial launch of the game, and all have been for the better. there is no better time to start playing wf than now. yes, theres a lot of grinding, but its fun. you not only grind for weapon parts, but warframe parts as well for warframes that can change your gameplay experience entirely. the pvp in the game is in between the crawl and walking phase but its still good fun, and i cant wait to see it polished and finished. tldr; its l4d2 in space with alien ninjas, pinatas that shoot at you, super powers, and ugly pet dog things.",1
"great graphically mastered game with a huge emphasis on updates to increase an already sound amount of gameplay. pros: this game impressed me out of the box, the free to play box in which you can actually get full content and entertainment without paying a dime - ive enjoyed most all the time ive spent on this game, and most of it was pre-release. issues are adressed quickly, constant updates, lots of customization and most importantl - great gameplay. im a horde mode and 3rd person shooter feind, this game satisfies both better than hotpockets covered in cheese made from a cow that breed with a trex cons: the infestation mode is lacking tremendously, in a defence mode i expect to have some defences setup and the ability to kill/stop most of my enemies before they even reach me. in warframes horde mode you simply get to kill 1 enemy at ranged and then you just spame melee attack and run in circles for 10 minutes - its poorly thought out, poorly developed, the ai is horrendous, its fast paced without the skill of fast paced so your just swarmed the entire time spamming one button to win. the multiplayer is p2w, extremely p2w. the fact that is just copies every other ing multiplayer 3rd person and fps game out ther eis just yawwwwn tired of this pvp gameplay, there are already 1000+ games with it out there without p2w, no reason to touch theres there is way too much p2w content that hinders my mind towards truly gorging on this game.",1

(he had recomended it earlier) and i said that i had looked at it, but it looked very complicated. i was like ummm... so i did it then and there. i downloaded it. i figured it was free so it wouldnt hurt to try. so i chose my starter warframe and got started. i remember going to a survival mission on mercury (apollodorus) and having a blast. it was so much fun. about 3 hours in, i bought a burston blueprint. i farmed on a defense mission for the components. it came into my recognition about how expansive my arsenal could be. a long time later, im still playing warframe. i have come a long way, just like the game has. i spend time helping starters and providing tips, and going on hard missions in the void and derelict. warframe is a truly outstanding game.",6

"such a simple game yet so fun to play over and over. i find myself always coming back to warframe when all other games fail me, even if its for an event or for a new weapon. the game dose get repetitive in a sence but their always updating so it practicly never gets old or boring. player design 9.8/10 frost prime need more gold. level design 8.7/10 randomly generated levels of said types. ordis annoying the  outtah you when trying to be afk at liset, 2/10 seriously his jokes suck.",7

"warframe is a very skilled action packed mmo. teams of four (and 8 for raids after update 16) on every mission vs an untold number of ai controlled enemies trying to stop you and your teammates from your common goal, wiki info: warframe is set in a distant future where the solar system is torn between the grineer, an empire race of militarized clones; the corpus, a mega-corporation merchant cult with advanced robotics and laser technology; and the infested, the victims fallen under the scourge of technocyte virus. the player takes the role of a tenno, a member of a fourth faction with a mysterious and unclear nature, and is guided by an entity called the lotus through missions. the game is constantly being updated keeping it fresh and exiting all the time. controller support witch should be fantastic for a game on this high acrobatic level needs serious work, the chat & trading menu is also lacking in innovation that other games have implemented but overall.........i highly recommend this game, it is free 2 play so download it and enjoy.",5

"warframe is an amazing game from when you start to when you stop but well it has a couple of issues, the first being grinding in recent patches to this game warframe developers have made weapons cost weapons to make while im fine with this it gets in the way because of weapon slots and time. warframes biggest problem i think is it takes too long to get 1 thing done just to do the next thing i love this game, because of how it plays out but the system needs some work. when you first get warframe your first objective to do is finish the misions and rank up that mastery level of yours, then the problems start grinding for multiple things just to get a weapon that later you find out isnt that good then you scrap it and make a better one. i still do think warframe is an amazing game just needs to have a little bit of itself changed not gameplay wise but how they manage time it takes for you to do something needs a complete overhaul but all in all i still would suggest this game to anyone.",3
"awesome free to play game, you can farm almost all the gear that you can also pay for fairly fast once you understand how the game works. best game of its type ive found i highly recommend you try this game! ^^^^^^ ignore the above, this game rips you off, i paid real cash for a load of frames, upgrades and every weapon i could, only to find any item you buy with real money will eventualy be made useless, frames that used to be good or fun are now terrible, my weapons i paid for have been nerfed to crap after i paid for them they went from worth cash to worth nothing. so in short do not pay cash on this game you will not get the item you paid for. i supported this game through beta and im extremely disapointed the devs would do this to long term players.",7
"this game is amazing! the combat is awesome, the art style is original, etc. even with the long wait for weapons and such being crafted its still one of the best games ive ever played. i would totally spend money on this game, just to show my support to the developers. amazing game, keep it up game devs :)",2

"probably the funnest, most addicting game i have ever played in all my time on this planet.",5
"i was really hoping to like the game as the videos showed the gameplay to be awesome, the game was basically completely playable for free and it required hours and hours of grinding--which is always fun. the story and the voiceovers, however, were intolerable (to put it nicely). terribly made and barrage you at every chance they get. you cant sit still for less than a minute in base without a lame, overacted voiceover talking some . another really disappointing factor was that the missions became redundant from the start. not going to elaborate on that because everyone seems to already be talking about them in most comments.",1
"warframe is by far one of my favorite games and for sure no game is comparable. there are so many warframes in this game, there is one for sure to fit your playstyle if your in to 3rd person shooter / stealth games / mmos you can make this a fast paces shooter or a slow paced stealth killing game there are a lot of different mission types there are many many many weapons in this game to benefit your playstyle, i cant even exagerate how many creative weapons are in this game there are many mods in this game (modules are basically parts to your weapons that make them more op with crit+status effects, et cet.) varius enemy types you need to keep in mind when facing hard missions. there will be various enemy types you despise that make this game more fun by killing them. clans + alliances, so you can get the benefit of having friends to play with, and the access to more weapons like any mmo has . then theres archwings - ultra amazing warframe jetpacks with op abilities like warframes have - archwing was a whole new game to me. the only cons to this game i can think of is its a bit repetitive - and playing with random players you will not be able to execute the missions the way you want it done",9
"awesome mutiplayer game! some lags, but its only the beginning, so its ok ;)",1
"absolutely fantastic game! everybody kept telling me to play it and i finally go around to it. i wish i had start playing earlier! it plays a lot like destiny, but im actually liking it a lot more than destiny. its free to play, and has options in game to pay for materials or frame/weapon slots. but its not play to win, which is what really matters! and you are able to trade the real world money to other players, so you can get everything in the game without paying a penny (with some rare exceptions). i recommend getting a bunch of friends to play this with you. its a lot better than trying to find pugs.",2
"been trying to play the game for about 7 hours now. forums say that lots of people are experimenting this problem, and that its been around 3/4 days since they cant log in.too bad that devs havent said a single thing about.",1
"i could lie to you and say that this game respects your time, and encourages you to go outside and live life. but that would be lying. and i dont lie. this game is so much fun. the 3rd-person shooter gameplay is extremely tight and engaging, and the free-to-play model is fair. you can craft a wide variety of weapons and warframes (classes) without spending a dollar. this is coming from the perspective of someone who has only put 40-some hours in this game (at the time of this review), and i could honestly say i dont feel pressured to spend yet. try it. its free, it looks damn beautiful, and its even more fun with friends. just, be aware that it is a very grindy game if you do go through the no-spending route. (it takes quite a while to gather the materials you need). i could only imagine it will only get grindier the more you play, but trust me, whatever time you do spend before you hit that wall, it will probably be great!",2
"have been playing this since launch and it has become quite the game. the customization is insane and while a bit grindy matches with friends are a lot of fun. if you like space ninjas, try this game. even if you dont like them, its free. although not nessecary i would suggest a small payment after you feel out the game (if you like it that is) - starting out can be hard and by the time you know what you want you probably have spent time earning other things so. you still have to level up anything you get but its nice to just have a reliable weapon or something to get you through the upgrade process of other things. that is not much to ask tho for a game you can try for free lol",1
"didnt keep me hooked for long enough. and i will have you know for a picky and judgmental gamer like me, that is quite a bad sign. the long updates, the scific setting rip-off, the mediocre community ratings. convince me otherwise, but plenty of other fishes out in the sea to waste my time/energy/attention with.",1

"its a good game, but the slick space ninja action is slowed considerably by the highly encouraged monetization. without dropping a little cash simple things like getting a new warframe or getting a new weapon can be very difficult, and very time consuming. whether or not thats a dealbreaker is up to you.",1
"no. i just dont like how the game plays.. i just dont really enjoy it as much as it looked in the trailers.. if this game somehow gets better ill come back to it",1
"this is a really fun shooter. at the moment it is completely free, sure if you want some color customizations you need platinum (the cashable currencey) but that platinum can be farmed by selling mods or blueprints. anyway, the game is nice and well paced. the controls need a bit getting used to but otherwise its a borderlands-halo mashup with some extra mobility and less humor. the different warframes give you various playstyles. from tank to ninja everything is in there. if you like good shooters with lots of different weapons and mods and you dont mind serious grinding, then youll enjoy this. if youre not a big fan of grinding you probably wont like this game unless you want to invest real money, since your base weapons arent all that great, like in any game youve played you have to put some effort in it to get the good stuff. if you have to break it up into pros and cons it would probably look a bit like this; pros: - good shooter - large variety of modifications for warframe and weapon - multiple playstyles possible - free to play design well made - nice graphics cons: - controls need getting used to neutral - grind heavy - fast paced to sum it up short its pretty much space ninja grinding asap.",7
"i recommend this game. but i have a complain: the grindwall is huge. you climb a grindwall, just to find another one, bigger! if you can deal with it, this game amazing. the graphics are great (and you dont need the fastest computer to run it); you can decide to play solo or multiplayer (and its drop-in); variety of weapons and playstyle is astounding; im too lazy to write a full review so i will just recommend it for you if you are interested in tl;dr fast action shooting slashing/brawling game.",2
"space ninjas!? where do i sign up? welcome to warfarm, *ahem* warframe! solid gameplay and a nice chunk of content. warframes are like pokemon, gotta catch them all! or rather farm for them. but anyway, this game sure is a lot of fun. especially with friends! definitely worth a try. and for those of you asking is this pay to win? the answer is no! its more like pay to get a mile ahead of everyone else. but you can get anything by just playing the game. and you will more than likely get everything if you like the game.",3

"great run & gun gameplay that will keep you on your toes. lots of ways to customize your warframe, weapons and sentinels with the use of mods that can give you that edge. i would recomend entering a clan as the support will help you become great at this game.",3
"simply one of the best free 2 play games ever, if you like to grind that is.",1
"more grind than a tony hawk game. more content than destiny, and more story. 10/10 ps: the graphics and gameplay are amazing, especially those archwings. and the game is 1000x more fun with a group. phantasy star online 2 is the only game like it that is better :p",1
"its a nice game , nice graphics , the story its good. its funny when you play with your friends. but at start when you choose your warframe , why you cant choose from all the warframes? there are some bugs , like when you reload you can still shot , i get stuck sometimes. i would rate it 8/10. -supersa234",1
"you start with a few hours and when you realize youve been playing long enough than you intended its usually more than half of the day is gone. was looking for a nice action mmo for months and stumbled on this one - was a lucky(or unlucky maybe) day for me. a nice mixture of melee and ranged combat. gets updated every few hours. cool sceenes and moves. wish i played this earlier. i say stop reading the comments and start playing instead. its f2p nevertheless, definitely worth it if youre into the concept -9/10.",2
"what else could i have done in 700 hours... nothing worth my time.",6
"this game is pretty sweet. with the recent updates and content im suprise this is free. its really fun to play especially if you have friends to play with. tons of weapons and customization options to choose from, plus the parkour is awesome xd. pvp is a little ok but its balanced at least. also if you want to run stuff with other players you can also join a clan too with its own benifits. try it out and see for yourself wear even in space a ninja lerks to take down there enemy.",10
"space... ing... ninjas... do i have to say more!?!?!?!",1
"the story is pretty good if you reaf all the codex pages plus you can play the game any way you want. in almost all missions you can go stealthy(which gives you good rewards) or just go guns blazing. a pretty cool feature that this game has is that every hour or less there are alerts which if completed, give you some good gear to help you out. plus with tons of colors, helmets, and armor you can customize your character any way you want. also there are always new missions, weapons, and characters being added into the game. the best part about it is that its free to play!",2
"this is a very good example of what a f2p videogame should be. see those weapons and characters? they can all be yours if you are patient enough also, your childhood wish of being a power ranger is granted",1
"its been a while since ive played this game (since the release). then, it was a good game but simple. now ive started my character over again. what a pleasant surprize. the game is retouched, it is beautiful i like it. well done devs. i recomend this to group of friends who want to enjoy a nice co-op action against ai.",1
"so far its a good game friendly community and helpful but you need a little cash to be quite stronger",5
"awsome game get it soon!!! [loading times are slow but it makes sense!]",1
"with the constant updates this game will never get old, the only problem i have is the limited inventory unless you practically buy a free game, but ignoring that fact this game is overall a great game with a large amount of lore, weapons, and well, warframes.",4
"warframe is very hit and miss for me. at times it can be seriously fun, and has a good range of levels, good player communication, is actively maintained and has a good player base, etc. but sometimes it just feels... sloppy. some levels feel boring or you just feel hopelessly bombarded by enemies or like the level is just endlessly respawning relatively dumb enemies which isnt very fun. i think if they try to hone the game a bit more - smooth out the rough edges and make the levels more convincing and intelligent (no infinitely respawning enemies, no tedious defense levels that drag, etc) it can continue to improve and be a significantly more consistent experience. as it is, if youre willing to let the faults slide, its got a lot to offer :)",1
"fun game,but gets repeatative after a while. it is ftp but i dont think it is a pay to win game. they are fairly balanced with the payment system.",4

"loved this game for 3 months. now my friends dont play. wish i could have the $200 back i spent for in game currency. oh well, it was fun for a while. the team work and gun play is great and the devs are always adding stuff. the missions however do get repetitive after a while. but you should still play it.",2
"it sucks. forgot my password and they wont let me play thats dumb.",2

"i have played this game for a decent amount of time. and from what i can tell that game is very well done, the graphics are one of the best ive seen in an mmo 3rd person shooter/hack and slash game. and the community is pretty awesome. i dont have much to write here because, the game really speaks for its self. its a master piece all in its own.",7

"i love it but can you reset warframe no i mean like anyone can reset at anytime please tell me how to and thanks",1
"nice game , nice graphics , need time to spend if not money and good company is recommended.",1
"this game is a complete bore without forking over 50+ dollars...",1
"pretty interesting premise, mixing the matrix with borderlands and gears of war, very complex customisation, very fun gameplay, buggy as all hell, game crashes sometimes which sucks, but oh well. give it a try you wont be dissapointed, partying up is alot more fun than solo, find a good clan! edit: the biggest case of failed potential ive ever seen, the devs made a great, but extremely buggy, base game, but all proceeding updates are either cash grab store weapons, bugged out community events, and new features nobody likes. play until you get a nice set of endgame weapons, frames and mods, and never log in again, because theres nothing fun worth doing.",3
"lots of stuff to do me: beginner-pro in 6 months of playing got ash now with soma, gammacor and dex dakra made my way up to eris and neptune and i am a mastery rank 6. 10/10 would play again and again.",1
"its great for a while and the graphics are awesome, some of the best on the market today. free running is fluid but youll end up mashing the  out of your spacebar if you pursue that style of fighting. however other than the lure of cool looking loot theres not much to keep you playing this atleast in my experience, ive seen the thousands of hours people and this game is just perfect for them. that doesnt mean you shouldnt try it, ffs its free.",1
"i recommend warframe to anyone who likes sci-fi third perosn shooters. you can craft practically any item in the game, thought it is kind of hard to gather all the materials. its always just easier to buy the gear, but you have the option of not buying if you have the patience.",1

"now please, before people start complaining about how much time i have spent on this game, if you have an account, feel free to find me and look at my profile, as i have over 250 hours in game. i only reactivated my account through steam as of the recent sanctuary update, but i realized, that the game is still the same grinding, pay to win  that it was two years ago when it came out of beta, onto steams open market. it was fun, for the first few weeks, when i was leveling all my gear at record speed, but then, i ran out of room to store the frames and weapons i wanted desperately. this is when the cycle begins. i made the absolute mistake of investing in this game, a quite large sum of money, that i am not willing to admit. it just kept happening, over time i sank more time, money, and effort into the game. after about four months, i quit. believe me, this was hard, but once my eyes were opened, it was like being liberated of a burden. being clean of an addiction, like meth, or heroin. to all new users who seek to play this game. dont. i played 48 hours in one week. one. week. be warned, if you are not careful, the endless vortex will suck you in. there is nothing worth it, its shiny, and good looking, but so are drugs. and dont give me that  about how drugs arent bad for you, believe me, this game will destroy you. you have been warned.",1
"this game puts most full price aaa games to shame... and its free. the devs obviously love this game and its someones baby. the fact that new content is being added all the time, new enemies, new maps, new missions, new everything. considering i played this game way back when it was open beta and not even on steam. so much has improved. this is one of the most played games on steam for a reason, its free, its extremely high quality. just download it and give it a try. remember, this thing is free.",3
"4kb/s updates? is your update server runs on hamster power? seriously, you push out updates every other day and it takes up to 5 hrs to download 7mb. forget it!",1
"ive been addicted to this game last couple of days, i came back to it more than a year latter, i played in beta but gave up shortly after since there were not that many players back then. since this is my first review here it goes. first things first it free to play, free, you dont have to pay a dollar to enjoy awesomeness of this game. its not pay to win, more like pay to look badass. graphics are really well done and mission design is absolutely beautiful. (i am not a big fan of instances, but i think it works best like that for this game). fast combat, parkour skills, variety of melee and ranged weapons (swords, bows, kunais ect.), a lot of planets, countless missions, many warframes to chose from every having its own unique stile of play. game is updating every few days with bug fixes and balances, things i dislike: - better and more balanced pvp and cephalon (allow more weapons and mods). - some bugs like falling trough elevator, getting stuck in invisible hole and damn i hate when i am climbing small box or a wall and just do backflip 20 metters behind into enemy lines. - it takes decade to craft something and when you find all parts then wait 12h to 3d (its realistic trough). - too addictive. i hope this helps you decide if to download and try game yourself (that you should totally do) or not. :d",1
"in what other game can you play as a ninja an omgwtfsauce there faces.",1
"i love this game, dont get me wrong, stuck with it since beta. but ever since the prime access updates the game has become unplayable. the lag is terrible and im on fiber optics. the frame rate is all over the freaking place so i end up dying a lot where as before the prime access update i usually died and failed missions from being stupid and goofing off too much. it took me 30 minutes to get through the freaking tutorial with my new account. that should take at most, provided you dont stop to admire the phenomenal detail of the world you play in, 7.5 minutes. this is simply unacceptable from any software developer. if ea games did this, they would receive a huge reputation drop with their consumers. and yes before you ask, im running a desktop that always gets updated with the neweset nvidia graphics card, a superior sound card, fiber optic internet connection, and 6 quad core processors. i can run crysis 2 at max settings and have a perfect gaming experience. i cant even run warframe on its lowest settings on the same computer. i dont know what the developers did, but if they can fix these recurring issues throughout the warframe gaming community, they would definitely have exponentially more 100% approval ratings and recommendations, myself included.",1

"i loved this game but then all of a sudden everytime i logged in i would get this connection error something like that but i like it so much im still trying to fix it ;d.",1
"you know you did something right when grinding becomes more fun the more you do it. its like hell going on a quantum division that satan cant stand it because youre having too much fun in his house when youre supposed to lament your fate for eternity. same goes for me. i have no life now, and i cant be happier as ever.",2
"great game to play, regular real updates, everything is obtainable without paying, but if you want to buy stuff, its expensive to use ingame cash though",2
"other key elements - create an avatar, characters speak english, have your own ship hub- can go to town hub later on if you wish or leave at you leisure, faction selection later on, class selection - 3 choices from the start, daily log in rewards, make the graphics higher or lower to let lower cpu play game, make new job classes or new weapons with blue prints with ingame money, 360 wired controller compatible, replayable missions and pvp the gameplay its a 3d realistic looking scifi thrid person shooter/mmorpg. the more you party with people, the more chance you have to survive the levels. the game will send legions of enemies at you ment for 4 people. you can solo the game but have a tougher time advancing. you can pay real cash to get items instant or use ingame money to buy blue prints to make them with parts you find in levels. you also have slots on weapons/on self to equiped abilities-lvl up to gain more points to better things. the weapon you kill enemies with gains the most experince points. the bad the only bad thing i could think of is the no skip on story cutscenes when characters start to talk, there no skip button i found to stop the replay if you failed a campaign quest. cannot do anything til characters stop talking storyline. maybe a update will erase this problem. update as i play more of the game",1
"one of the most promising games ive ever heard of. sadly, counter-intuitive controls, a sub-par tutorial and graphical options only accesible in-game cause it to deter me. its like they expect me to know exactly how im suppsoed to be playing in my first 5-10 minutes of gameplay. definately a learning curve, and no time to adhere to it. such great potential, such awesome graphics, and some of the controls are really cool on the other hand. but, for example, when i eneter my first mission, directly after learning how to use the kunai and bow, they supply me with only a sword. no other weapon to switch to, and they expect me to destroy 5 flying targets, who have guns? i started playing 5 minutes ago, cut me a break! worst part is, i was extremely excited to try this game. (try it again that is, since i played it about a year ago, with nearly the same results). meh, i dont really care though. would have disappointed anyways when they started rolling out the p2w aspects which are surely in every free game on steam, aside from poe.",1
"do you want to repeat a mission 25 times, rushing past enemies to achieve a small objective? do you want to do this potentially hundreds of times to catch all the poke-- er, frames? do you want to interact with your environment by sliding around shooting faceless mooks? do you want little to no narrative to get in the way of the action? did you dislike the metroid prime series enough to see it butchered? then this game is for you! for its genre and price, warframe is much beloved. ultimately, however, the game fails to be truely engaging.",3
"updates are very time-consuming and often. have an update to fix the update process before you make any further updates.",2

"downloaded i the deleted it and then downloaded it again but it wont download this time.",1
"while im writing this review i have about 150 hours in this game. this game is great. you dont have to spend money if you want cool weapons or gear. it can be all unlocked. the platinum which can be bought with realmoney can also be earned in the game (selling prime parts and moods etc.). in this game you play like a spaceninja you can either go in stealthy or you can go in guns a blazing its your choice. hope this short review helps pros: - great visuals - fun combat - great warframe designs - a lot of weapons - great community cons: - repetitive soundtrack - lackluster mission objectives - some bugs - grinding",2

"to people who look for addictive game and stopped here for reviews; i downloaded so many mmos so many multiplayer games to lose my self like old times. nothing worked until this game. 20 hour of gameplay in 36 hours since i downloaded and i cant stop. look no further. i dont know how but this game really pull you to itself. you forget about time. you pick 1 of 3 warframes at the beginning of the game and start level up. not just him your primary weapon, secondary weapon, melee weapon too. and leveling up is really rewarding. you can pick from massive amount of mods to improve your arsenal. you can build guns. and find its components from massive numbers of missions from numerious beautifully designed places. everything feels so different and effective so that it really connects you to the game and make wonder how about i do this and this?. and missions are so much fun. you maybe wondering how pvp is and thinking about downloading a pvp game. well you can do pvp but you will have much more fun at co-op missions especially defend missions where enemies comes in waves and you try to hold out just to get your wanted mod. community is really upside of the game. everybody is helpful. really recommend downloading and give it a go.",1

"this game is pretty fun, but their switching you from the easily killed grineer to the not-affected-by-punture-damage-deal-with-it corpus crewmen can be a shock for new players. there are a couple more problems i have with the game, such as the flawed stealth system. enemies are comically dumb, but they more than make up for it with their apparently psychic abilities. as soon as you fail to kill one enemy with a shot from the paris, they all know your exaclt location, and know where you are everywhere and at any time until you kill all of them.",1
"fun yet sometimes it forces you to spend real money on things like character and weapon slots, alot of farming is involved to get the weapons, but it takes 12 hours for the weapon to build, which i dont see the point of except for that you can skip it for real money. although it has amazing combat, great graphics, amazing movement, and it provides a new kind of sci-fi. i give it a 6/10 with great mechanics but way too many cashgrabs.",1

"orginal review its a free-to-play 3rd person shooter, 10 different objectives and a whole solar system of missions to play. solo or multiplayer. it does have the option to pay real money for stuff but the thing about this game is everything is achievable through playing for free, all it takes is time. so time=money. there are many different types of play styles because of 13 different exo-skeletons. by the way the game is currently in beta and is being updated regularly. ok, so this review was from a long time ago, and only a few things are still true: its still a free to play 3rd person shooter, support is still fast, everything is achievable without spending anything, and its still super fun. things that changed: there are now more than 13 exoskeletons. (23 not counting prime versions). many more mission types, with unique enviorments, an amazing quest system, including a tutorial quest. pvp has changed to capture the flag, new syndicates including normal ones along with conclave (pvp) and secondary mission objectives. some complain about grinding for things like resources, but if you just play through the planets and have fun with it you wont ever need to grind. at first you will seem to grind more because you need/ want something specific, but after playing for a while i just build what i want when i want it, dont have to really grind for anything. i highly recommend this game, and hey, its free what do you have to lose?",6
"for so far that i played i can say that warframe is a realy good game it takes a bit to get used to it,but overall a must own game,hell its free 10/10 ps:some people say it has a lot of backtracking...dont believe them!",1

"im sorry, this game just f.ucking sucks. it downloaded, updated, and then crashed right after hitting play. it updated a second time to no avail. i dont care if it works for other people, im not touching this game again. congrats digital extreme, you were at the very top, now to me you fell lower than microsoft. this is just my opinion, so goodbye forever warframe, you usless sack of shi.t.",1

"flying space ninjas... that is all you need to know about this game.",6
"its a good game, but i think you need to drop in at least $40 for the game to start being fun.",5
"is and insane game for being free, honostly very fun and exciting, with a little bit of challenge. graphics are awesome, and gameplay is smooth. if you are looking for a cheap (or free) game to play, with good graphics, smooth gameplay, and lots of fun, look no further.",1
"its f2p so expect grinding, but the gameplay is why this game still strives. it makes you love grinding and want to grind just for that one item and if you cannot seem to get it, there is trading in this game aswell. space ninja pve, with recent pvp gamemodes, gameplay is unique and addicting. different variations of enemies, traps, and bosses to keep gameplay interesting. 1 point i want to make is do not grind when you start. just go around to planets and play the game. going straight into grinding will ruin the experience for most people. only thing that people reccomend paying real money for is additional warframe/ weapon slots, but the game starts you off with enough platnium(pay for currency) to buy 1 extra warframe slot and 4 extra weapon slots.",4
"now, lets talk a little bit about warframe.... first off, my opinions about this game are that it is completely worth the time spent, and possibly if you want to spend money on the game, it is well spent. i have put almost 1000 hours into this game, and i have full intent on putting another 1000 in. now, just a little thing, i have this problem where i cant connect to any multiplayer games, but it is being fixed. anyways, lets get to the pros and cons. pros: flashy graphics fluid movement and combat. free to play everything can be obtained without the use of microtransactions (besides cosmetics which have no use) large frequent updates extremely friendly and helpful community cons: if you dont have a lot of time on your hands, then you may have to consider microtransactions fairly beefy graphics card and decent amount of ram the grinding can be a wee bit repetitive, but there are microtransactions if you are impatient eats your social life (which i have none) i rate this game 10 false igns out of 10 false igns. (but seriously, get this game. now. what are you waiting for? get it already!)",8
"its a very difficult game to play... but i like it... i guess. :p",1
"its very gud game would recommend 10/10 -billy mays",1
"there has been many changes since the initial launch of the game, and all have been for the better. there is no better time to start playing wf than now. yes, theres a lot of grinding, but its fun. you not only grind for weapon parts, but warframe parts as well for warframes that can change your gameplay experience entirely. the pvp in the game is in between the crawl and walking phase but its still good fun, and i cant wait to see it polished and finished. tldr; its l4d2 in space with alien ninjas, pinatas that shoot at you, super powers, and ugly pet dog things.",1
"great graphically mastered game with a huge emphasis on updates to increase an already sound amount of gameplay. pros: this game impressed me out of the box, the free to play box in which you can actually get full content and entertainment without paying a dime - ive enjoyed most all the time ive spent on this game, and most of it was pre-release. issues are adressed quickly, constant updates, lots of customization and most importantl - great gameplay. im a horde mode and 3rd person shooter feind, this game satisfies both better than hotpockets covered in cheese made from a cow that breed with a trex cons: the infestation mode is lacking tremendously, in a defence mode i expect to have some defences setup and the ability to kill/stop most of my enemies before they even reach me. in warframes horde mode you simply get to kill 1 enemy at ranged and then you just spame melee attack and run in circles for 10 minutes - its poorly thought out, poorly developed, the ai is horrendous, its fast paced without the skill of fast paced so your just swarmed the entire time spamming one button to win. the multiplayer is p2w, extremely p2w. the fact that is just copies every other ing multiplayer 3rd person and fps game out ther eis just yawwwwn tired of this pvp gameplay, there are already 1000+ games with it out there without p2w, no reason to touch theres there is way too much p2w content that hinders my mind towards truly gorging on this game.",1
"best free to play game out there. it gets even better with buddys to play with.",1
"the only other way to have this much fun grinding is with your lady. 10/10 would bang.",1
"this game is awesome and everyone should play it. :d",1
"best game ive ever seen... :d good graphics, good gameplay, and a good storyline! but too many things cost platinum :c",1
"awesome free to play game, you can farm almost all the gear that you can also pay for fairly fast once you understand how the game works. best game of its type ive found i highly recommend you try this game! ^^^^^^ ignore the above, this game rips you off, i paid real cash for a load of frames, upgrades and every weapon i could, only to find any item you buy with real money will eventualy be made useless, frames that used to be good or fun are now terrible, my weapons i paid for have been nerfed to crap after i paid for them they went from worth cash to worth nothing. so in short do not pay cash on this game you will not get the item you paid for. i supported this game through beta and im extremely disapointed the devs would do this to long term players.",7
"its bionicle meets ninjas with guns. a lot of fun and easily playable without spending a dime. for the time i played id have no problem paying a few bucks for some cosmetics or even weapons. once you understand how the game works its all good. cant go wrong with this one.",1
"warframe is an amazing game from when you start to when you stop but well it has a couple of issues, the first being grinding in recent patches to this game warframe developers have made weapons cost weapons to make while im fine with this it gets in the way because of weapon slots and time. warframes biggest problem i think is it takes too long to get 1 thing done just to do the next thing i love this game, because of how it plays out but the system needs some work. when you first get warframe your first objective to do is finish the misions and rank up that mastery level of yours, then the problems start grinding for multiple things just to get a weapon that later you find out isnt that good then you scrap it and make a better one. i still do think warframe is an amazing game just needs to have a little bit of itself changed not gameplay wise but how they manage time it takes for you to do something needs a complete overhaul but all in all i still would suggest this game to anyone.",3
"this game lets you be yourself and its very fun there is no end to the game so you can play forver",1
"best game i have ever played have been playing for 2 weeks and its amazing i just cant stop playing",1
"dont play this game cause you will have to not play it for a week to get a discount and that is so annoying so you will have to unistall the game 0/10",2
"very awesome game, i would definatly reccomend to anyonewho is interested in a hybrid of shooter and 3rd person action games.",1
"the scenario is not really good, but it is like call of duty, we play it for the gameplay and do not care about the story behind it. the gameplay is awesome, and the tps view reminds how good this game is. even if the weapon and ability systems are (really) hard to understand, the gameplay is just, yeah awesome. the only minor complain about this game is that for small rigs it can sometimes freeze and/or lag.",1
"it is a great game its a good third person game i dont like alot of third person games but this one game is awesome but should be for mac to so more people can buy it",1
"great mechanics, better optimized than many other games of the same graphical intensity (runs at about 30 fps on integrated graphics, low), variety of weapons and warframes.",9
"really fun game to play with friends! the game play/style isnt hard to get used to, just takes some time.",1
"verifying download cache. cant even play this game. my brother told me to got it so naturally i got it. i had high hopes as i saw my brother playing it. it looked like a great game with an all around balanced combat system. i finished the download and this is what i get. verifying download cache. i cant play. i uninstalled and reinstalled twice. it worked. i patched it. 11/10 ign",1
"a amazing game worth playing! i love this game its amazing at is out of beta now! i know that youll love this game after all its one of the most poupler steam games!",2
"just like your girlfriend. you dont have it yet, but when you do there is a lot of grinding involved.",1
"dont get me wrong, i love this game. the only thing that bothers me is the fact that there are only few maps, the rest of the levels are the same map, with a different objective or a few different doors open. still, 11/10",1
"two words - space ninjas. if youve played before it has since been greatly improved.",3
"free to play done right in my book... nothing has to be bought, everything can be earned though some take forever to make so its just a matter of how bad do you want it :) weapons gain levels and you can add special cards to them to add abilities like +20% damage or + reload speed %. game features wall walking and climbing. sliding melee or just straight melee your choice, not big on melee? thats fine use machine guns, snipers, bow, pistols, throwing knives, shotguns, and more!",2

"lol if my laptop wasnt from the industrial age i would play this more",1
"*farm for x amount of time to get warframe blueprints you want* f*cking final-youre out of a certain resource *farm x amount of time to get required resources* f*cking final-you need to craft the parts *12 hours later* f*cking final-you need to wait 3 days for the warframe to be built *3 days later* f*cking finally i can play with this damn warframe in the end you dont even like that particular warframes playstyle rinse and repeat",1
"its a fun single/coop tps based on the futur and quite challenging and fun to play playing with base weapons assualt rifle/pistol/sword and later on being able to diverse more weapons by microtransaction or crafting with nice color customization and class variation this game is great fun and nice to play with friends even still its in beta i give it a nice 9/10 -dakumunken",4
"a great game to play, good team play, sweet game design and graphics with vibrant planets to explore and a vast range of enemies to kill. to a degre it lacks player vs player though promotes team play very well (hack security while team covers your back) the game can at times be a bit glitchy but that in itself is a doubel edge, as you can run/slide/wallrun and leap off wals to slip and slide/slingshot yourself around the levels. which makes for some really great plays as you dodge and leap into and out of harms way. 9/10 would super jump again!",2
"future me: stop! dont download wraframe. it slowly starts to consume your time until eventually it is the only thing you do. work becomes a time passer to get to more warframe. you get your girlfriend into it. gamer win right? wrong! your sex life turns into more warframe with her. this past month was just a blur and my steam account shows 141 hours. for the love of your social life dont download this game!! past me: .........*clicks install*........",2
"the most fun ive ever had in such a grind-y game. go farm for  already. its fun, i swear.",6
"an really great game. i had put off getting into this game but finally bit the bullet and decided to download it. once i started playing i just couldnt stop. i imagine my weekends will be filled with warframe from now on.",1
"please understand (before skipping this review because i only have 7 hours logged) that i played this long before i even knew steam existed. it might as well be a seperate game from the one i started playing, but it has stayed just as good, if not improved, over the years. the graphics are nice even at the lowest settings, allowing the ability to play a nice looking game without lagging. the gameplay, while slightly overwhelming at first, is fluid and makes you feel like a boss. you can play however you want, from being sneaky and evading your foes, or rushing headstrong into a horde of grineer with your sword, so every player plays their own game. additionaly, every warframe and weapon changes that style. for example, i main limbo on my steam, who differs greatly from my old excalibur. instead of sword skills, limbo can manipulate the void to his will and transport his friends, foes, and even himself into the rift between the void and reality. every single warframe has awesome abilities like that. the customization is awesome, and once you have a clan it gets that much better. this game is a masterpiece. a blend of assassins creed, dark souls, kotor, halo, destiny, and god knows what else. its free, go give it a shot. you will love it.",1
