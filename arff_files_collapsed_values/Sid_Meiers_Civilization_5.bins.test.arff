"fun game which can make you think but be ready to spend a large amount of time winning the match.",1
"sid meiers civilization v is a game that has attempted something that very little games ttempt to do, and that is to have someone create an empire, and make that empire stay, despite war, religion, politics, money. a great imrpovement from the fourth version of this game, the fifth bersion, right now, manages to remove the stacking of units, and add tons of new troops, new technologies, new empires and their leaders, and is an all out better game than before. this is the thing that will be last compared to a waste of money.",1
"soooooooo much better with dlc. almost everyone has this game already so theres no real point in me telling you to get it.",1
"simple, but still challenging. great mods (canada mod!). worth it.",1
"one of the best games out in a long time. it takes up all of your time, so make sure you have a good 5-12 hours to play.",1
"i havent played this much, but i enjoyed what i have played! it is a great game, probably better when played online!",1
"ive always been a big civ fan since civ ii and over 400+ in im still playing. the hexagonal tiles plus the combat system change plus the changes to great people (g&k) are some really great changes over civ iv that honestly almost make it impossible to ever go back. its biggest problem is the same that its always been - its pretty slow paced. this is a game that can take a month to play through an entire game.",3
"before you start a game make sure you have nothing to do for the next 3 weeks.",1
"time waster: the game. so many valuable hours lost.",1
"this is a great game, great for newbies to the strategy genre. the vanilla game is around 8/10. now for the expansions, buy them, theyre great. they make the game a ton better. 9.5/10",1
"in my experience of this game its a high learnig curve and has a pretty good community. if you are not a fan of the previous sid meiers games then you wouldnt like this one. i give it a 6/10",1
"one of my favorite games, only gets better with gods and kings and bnw",5
"very entertaining and complete game. the only downside is that if you start playing it you will inevitably get one-more-turn syndrome that turns one hour of gaming into six like magic.",1
"just... one... more... turn... you have to strap your  to the chair until you win the game or you play for so long that you forget who you are.",2
"amazing. i played as korea and was able to progress so fast that i captured rome with nuclear robots of death while they defended with muskets and trebuchets. in another game i was attacked by everyone on the map and died in seconds. each game has potential to go either way, but in the end the only thing you can know for sure is that dido is a . (make sure you get all of the dlc, it adds so much and it is almost impossible for me to play any other way.) 9/10, pls add hitler.",1
"been a fan of the series since civ iii with conquerors expansion and love civ 5 more.",1
"this game is slowly taking over my life. definite buy.",1
"i played a few hundred hours of civ 4 as my introduction to the series and while i remember liking it, it didnt hook me like civ 5 is doing. fantastic",1
"its a civilization game - with the expansions, its one of the best the 4x genre has to offer. must-play!",1
"civilization 5 is awesome! from becoming the greatest empire of all time too becoming the greatest military force ever known, cilivilization will keep you entertain hours on end.",1
"have sank many hours into this game - a rich world and complex strategy game. flaws: multiple playthroughs can be repetitive. ai civilizations are often unpredictable, often declaring war on yours for no tangible reason, despite previous cooperation. i am told that the dlc packs go some way to fixing this.",1
"best world domination game yet! my max pay price: $15... with expansions: $20",1
"as a civ, this is really easy to play and a nice game for some time , but not a really long time motivation.",1
"hours and hours of slaughtering any empire that dared to denounce you during your early stages, and eventually conquering the entire world is probably the most fun ive had with a game that involves slaughtering entire countries.",1
"i absoutly love this game, love wonder ing but never lost a game. love nuking other civs and just crushing them with my armies. but have not faced ghandis nuke crazy wrath yet. 10/10 would nuke again",4
"civilization is one of those games you can lose hours just playing it the amount of times i have looked at the clock and wondered where the last 8 hours have gone i would highly recommend this game",1
"bought this game like 5 days ago and i have over 30 hours in it. 11/10 would buy again.",1
"putting 13 hours into a game in 2 days is very good for me considering i rarely play 13 hours the entirety of owning a game. highly recommended if you have 6 or 7 hours at a time to kill.",1
"one of the best games i have ever played! it is so addicting, and when you start, you cant turn it off.",1
"if you enjoy getting mentally butt hurt play this game",1
"i was playing this game and then i realized that i had been playing for 120 hours straight and got off",1
"yeah, lets just put all these empires on a map where they arent really. but dont worry, it doesnt need to make sense when you are winning.",1
"realy cool game much better than age of empires and others like it",1
"great game that requires a lot of planning and strategy. if you enjoy turn based games this is a must.",1
"i was deep in prayer when an angel entered my mind space. she was mixed-ethnicity and looked a little bit like a woman that worked at the local panda express (lol @ all of you who think that angels are white. god doesnt descriminate against any groups. read the bible.) you shall be the pillar of a new civilization., the angel said. then she told me her name was lucy. lucy furr. i didnt know what that meant at the time, but coincidentally, 6 years later, i see that this game is on sale for 75% off. so, i bought it. now im just waiting for a heavenly message to come through this blessed windows 8 :)",1
"this game is amazing, must buy for all pc gamers 9.5/10, very enjoyable, great for multiplayer",1
"i spent like 40 hours playing this game in the first 3 days. the variety of civilizations and their characteristcs fused with the game concepts itself will make you spend hours instead of minutes you intended to. i strongly not recommend for those who has limited time to play or has some work to do.",3
"ruined my life? well, thats pretty big talk from someone who isnt the empress of greece.",2
"kiss your life goodbye, this game is great....if yo have played any civ games before you know how awesome they are. civ 5 does not let you down. endless amounts of fun, playing with your friends online is awesome as well! who doesnt wanna take over the world? backstab your allies to dominate the world!",1
"indeed a great game. i wish so hard they fix soon the multiplayer performance, cause it is a delight to play with friends.",1
"if you want to spend 40 hours building a civilization only to have ghandi nuke it, this is the game for you.",1
"turn based strategy and loads of fun :) do not expect to be playing for an hour or two.... this game will eat away days and nights for that matter. it is by far one of the best turn based strategy games out there. so many things to do, so many people to conquer!",2
"this game is great for civ fans new and old. i simply love this game.",1
"this is one of my favourite games to play. it will take away all your time and also your firstborn. but its worth it.",2
"perfect way to throw away countless hours of valuable time and have fun doing it :d",1
"a truely amazing game. well thought out, and never tires to entertain.",2
"ive never been much of a strategy game person, but this and xcom: enemy unknown really changed that. this game is a little rough around the edges without the brave new world and gods & kings expansions. i highly recommend both of those to get an extremely complete and well rounded game. as the saying goes: one more turn. as you can see i have spent well over 700 hours on this game and i have enjoyed almost every moment of it. i always seems to fall back into and and just enjoy the game play. the game also has a very good amount of history you can learn from in just by reading the built-in wiki. i have since taken up an interest in history, just due to this game. there are just so many things i can write about this game, but i think the best thing i can really say is you should try it for yourself. i am sure you will enjoy it, especially if you are already into strategy games!",4
"amazing game that comes with the added risk of completely taking away your sense of time.",3
"once again the franchise delivers the just one more turn addiction in one of the best turn based strategy games ever! a huge departure from civ iv that actually works well and provides many hours of fun despite the deceptively simple new interface. a must have for anyone who likes turn based strategy games!",2
"if your into turned based strategy, look no further. civ has been around a long time and civ 5 is well vetted. it had a bit of a rocky start with the vannilla, but the first expansion is awsome.",1
"piece of . crashes more than any other game ive played. it is 2015... get your  together.",1
"this is game is good. perhaps too good. as in, youll continue to play just a little more till you realize its 3 am for the 3rd consecutive day. the randomized maps, different scenarios, different victory conditions and ways to play make it very replayable. definitely give it a try.",1
"this game will ruin your social life, but will leave you very satisfied afterwards",1
"just a couple more turns then ill stud- napoleon has declared war on your empire oh, that er.",1
"this game is epic ! sad that brave new world and gods and kings is so expensive !",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. it gets even better with mods.",1
"i love everything about this game except how to long it takes to get achievements.",2
"one of my favorit games well worth the price, the dlcs will increase the enjoyment multiple times over",2
"this is an interesting game, well done but also quite long. im impressed by the massive gameplay even if its a bit cahotic.",1
"civilization 5 is great game to have and play regardles if you are spending 30 minutes or 5 hours at your desk playing it. it is super easy to get into for beginners of almost all ages and provides enough challenge to keep you coming back and trying different setups.",1
"civilization v is one of the best turn based strategy games ive ever played. the graphics are great, the replay value is high, and there are multiple ways to win (you can easily play this game without having to get a military victory). all in all, it is a fantastic game. the only flaw i can find is that the game is relatively easy without mods. overall i give it an 8.5/10, its worth a buy.",1
"so many hours gone, because you just need 1 more turn. first time i played all of the sudden it was 4 in the morning. the variety makes it a new challenge everytime.",2
"somone cal me noob nd kill my troop wtf edit: i cal he faget and he quit hahahaha",1
"wonderful. i was wanting to play risk, but its so outdated. my friend told be about civ, and hot damn if he wasnt right. everything i was needing to scratch and more. 10/10",1
"great game cant fault it apart from a few bugs fun to play for long periods and to just chill on an easy going strategy game",1
"the only thing i dont like about this game is the weird effect it has on my clock. >_> (8am) ...... (civ 5) <_< ........ >_> (11:58pm). what the hell you mean its been 16 hrs?",2
"i really enjoy this game it is good fun. one downside is that it is long, but in the same it is good for me anyway because i love games that take a while to complete. i recommend it to anyone that enjoys building, war, or just playing with friends",3
"i have spent so much time on this game, trolling, being serious, nuking napolean, and just having so much fun. when you first get the game you should play a single-player game on settler! remember your learning. after a while youll destroy that game. then you get to multiplayer, and its awesome, especially when you have good steam friends! if you dont get this game youre missing out, but you also still have a life xd. 400+ hours.",4
"great game, but i dont have to tell you that. why arent you playing it right now? why are you reading this?",2
"it is a game that you will waste das on for no real reason. it is great",3
"four words on why everyone should get this game: nukes and death robots",1
"i built the great wall of china in america and you can declare war on friends. the tech tree is very good as well as you advance through the eras and improve your cities. very good stratgey game",1
"made a religion called atheism and the vatican was desperate to have me send a few missionaries. 9/10.",1
"brilliant game which can be moulded into a game of domination, science or culture victory. dlcs are well executed adding useful tools to the game which make it even better to play. this is a game sutible for beginners in strategy and experts of the genre.",2
"one to the best games ever made period. if your a history buff or love strategy this game is for you, and with brave new worlds this game just gets better.",1
"11/10. one of the best games ive ever played, sid meier again makes a fabulous game. smooth gameplay and infinite replay value make it top notch! with more than a dozen awesome civs, and dlc that is very much worth the purchase, its a game i asbolutely love. cant wait for civilization: beyond earth!",2
"got civilization v as a gift from a friend, took me awhile to install and test it out however since doing so i havent been able to stop playing. not a huge fan of turn based strategy games however civilization is slowly starting to become one of my favorite games. i know i am late to the party but i would recommend it to anyone who likes simulation or strategy based games.",1
"i really enjoyed this game until i started playing on a higher difficulty, only to discover the ais actually dont get any better, they dont make better decisions, their not more efficent, they just receive massive amounts of advantages that get them ahead for no good reason. this game could of been a lot better if they had just made the ais smarter, not give them free hard outs. i also have a bone to pick with the multiplayer in civ 5, there are a lot of issues revovling lag, sometimes it goes to the loading screen for no reason and the ais are . even with all this negative stuff, i still enjoy the game, id just wish they patch/update more often.",2
"been playing civ since the first one in the dos days. genuinely thought this game was rubbish when i first started and preferred to play civ4. picked up both the expansions which changed my mind. g+k fixes the game and makes it playable and bnw is an improvement on that. so yeah, good game as long as you have at least g+k.",1
"time flies as one heads up one great civilization after another. for an old-school civ-player, all this religion and diplomacy malarkey can get a bit hectic and feels a bit foreign at first, but it definitively adds to the atmosphere of the game. it is a well-balanced turn-based strategy game with an incredible amount of content. i have only managed to win at king once and it took some thinking in the end-game. success is not always guaranteed, but a few setbacks along the way arent necessarily fatal. recommended for anyone with a fair bit of spare time on their hands. its addictive nature rarely allows for just a quick five minutes... type of play, but that is part of its timeless charm.",1
"only down side is taking over cities takes long than in previous games.",1
"in all honesty, a game that is fun for the first few days but got boring really fast. there was no editor and really nothing else to do but the campaign. the mods were fun and entertaining for a long period but also got boring. not game worth 60$ but if they added some extra stuff i would definately buy it for 60$ again.",2
"great fun but time consuming game that you will start playing the all of a suddenly it midnight",1
"this game is just perfect, as a total war veteran i was a bit put off by the lack of tws real time combat. i thought that id loose interest in managing a single map, well i was wrong. this game is so amazing that even if theyd scrap the combat entirely id still love it. being my first civilization game i found it really easy to get into and enjoy, the expansions are great too, although i didnt have much time to play brave new world yet. i wholeheartedly recommend this game to veteran strategy fans and newcomers to the genre alike.",1
"absolutely fantastic. solid gameplay, with addictive details that will keep you playing for hours, days even. not that you didnt already know. seriously, this is a civ game, of course its awesome.",2
"good game, was russia, expanded my empire, end up fighting their riflemen with giant death robots, had 30 uranium, launched at least 20+ nuclear missles, turned world into radiation hell. needless to say i controlled every city on the map and dropped nukes on myself and still won. 10/10",3
"if youve ever wanted to be a tyrant and steamroll countries for no reason but the fun of it, this is the game for you",1
"on of the best turn-based empire builders i have ever played. 4.5 out 5",1
"what can i say? ive wasted 600 hours of my life on this game.",4
"definitely the best civ game thus far; the combat element is far more tactical when you are restricted to a single unit per tile and dont just end up with a stack of trebuchets like in previous releases. as always, there is a good spread of difficulties to play on, and you should be able to find one to suit you that is sufficiently hard to win against without seeming impossible.",1
"this is a great statagy game that is a huge improvement to the civilizatoin series and i greatly remomend this game for any strategy fan.",1
"cool as game, good graphics and nice gameplaly. a game which you have to think to succed",2
"it is one of the most addictive, entertaining games i have ever played",1
"best strategy game on the planet so far. played only 0.4 hours so far, but loved it to the max!",1
"wooow david is bad at this which makes it fun for easy wins? 11/10 its ok",2
"played as sweden got rekt by russia 10/10 historically accurate",1
"this is one of the greatest games for pc. i highly recomend it, however civ 5 and the brave new world (bnw) dlc are even better.",2
"this is a highly enjoyable game for the people who enjoy turn-based-stratagy games. it is better for people that would go indepth into the games mechanics and the scenarios.",4
"this game is one of the best, single player is fun due to the many diffrent ways to win as well as the diffrent leaders own abilitys which makes you change strategy. also there are many map types and can make is more challeging with the manyh difficulties. varity of mods you can add and multiplayer with your friends is always a laugh.",2
"its civ, you should know what your getting. i really enjoy this game with the expansions but it does have a learning curve. without expansions it can be alittle broken.",1
"this game lets you choose how you want to progress as a civilization. whether you choose to relay on scientific research to develop more efficient mechanisms or you want to build a huge powerful army to eliminate the competition. civilization 5 seems like itd be boring and a waste, but i found it engaging. the freedom of how you progress and solve problems is definately a plus. i like it.",1
"if youve never played a sid meier civilization game, this is a good place to start. its approachable but deep, and will suck away as many hours as you let it.",1
"great game. super fun. i like to make different scenerios like a tiny map with 22 civs. this game is very fun. it great. you can sit back, listen to some over-intense music on youtube and enjoy a friendly game of civ. until you turn the difficulty up, youll either need to be naturally gifted to win or focus extreme attension to it. thsts why i listen to 10 hours of the rocky theme while i take over songhai with my mongolian keshiks",1
"its really a great game. if you need proof at how much i like it, just look at my time played.",5
"my all time favourite game, strategy that is really easy to get into.",1
"a very long addictive gameplay! its really fun and worth the wait (turned based)",1
"love this game... i myself am a huge fan of the civ series",2
"the only game ive run into where you need to commit a significant portion of your life to play. played one game and by the time i looked up i had aged 5 years.",3
"if you like stratgey games this is the game for you but keep in mind the games are very time consuming and can take days to complete",1
"cant get enough of this game. so many different ways to approach and play, its always a blast.",1
"this game is amazing it is what all 4x games should be modeled after",2
"this is a very fun game that can be played for countless hours. i have last-turn disease from it! i never want to stop playing and the time flies byr. its a good game with a lot of mod support and dlc that is very fun. i would recommend to anyone!",1
"dont buy, dont play, dont go for cultural victory  history #word",1
"such a fun game! there are days when i can play this for 12+ hours.",1
"ill finish after this turn 100 turns later (finish the game) ill finish after the next game",1
"this game is well worth a play for any sort of stratergy gamer at any level. weather you prefer war or peace this game is for you! the easy to play style with diferent ways to win means every game is different. with diferent faction units bulidings and effects you can enjoy playing diferent leaders (my faverouts are russia and japan). anyway i hope you buy this game and enjoy this. if you have this game feel free to add me for a multiplayer game.",1
"civ v is a great game with lots of adventure and strategy, its fun to build your own settlement and to discover new techniques and develop your own civ. civ v does take a lot of time, though. an average game on the quick setting takes 4 hours! if you have no patience, i dont think civ v is the game for you. this game will train your strategy skill and will help you with other strategy games.",1
"it is soooooooooooo awesome!!! no, but seriously, you got to play this. psssst. play it!!!",1
"be prepared to have a 12 hour gaming session, set the game down for 4-6 months, and then pick it up again for another half-day session. this game is a good way to sink a ton of time, but gets repetitive fairly fast.",1
"what makes this game is the expansions, they add lots of content and make the game more enjoyable. with this game you can play as caeser in 2024 sending a nuke to the warmongering ghandi. if you like historical accuracy/plausability you may be shocked by this, if you like absurdity and grandness but want a challenge youll like this. if your new to grand strategy game this is a good starter as the ui is laid out well and very easy to access. a good game can last for 12 hours from start to finish. i have to force myself not to click the one more turn button",2
"once you hit that play button, theres no going back....",1
"build a nice little city. then build another one. then build one to piss off other people. then rule the wrold. then realize that it is now thursday and you have miss 3 days and you still click next turn because you have a problem. yeah its that type of game",2
"so ive had alot of time with this game, its the most played game in my library and i have 131 games....im no good at reviewing games so im just gonna go ahead and tell you to buy it if you havent do so already. best game ever. 15/10",4
"civilization v is a great game but with out the dlcs is a unfinished game that may disappointfans coming from civ iv. but of course with the dlc it turned this unfinished game into a spectacular experiance that any civilization fan should have. it has a dumbed down ui from civ iv but thats what all the games are doing so you gotta deal with it. the main point is you have to get the dlc to see the full potential of this game or else you may be left unsatisified with the gameplay. pros: -good gameplay on single and multi -easy to ui for new players -great dlcs that are worth the $30.00 -constant replayebility -great community content on workshop and easy to use map editor cons: -dumb and random ai behaviour -multiplayer session lag and disconnect oftan making it sometimes unplayable -to easy to play in even the hardest modes - not enough stratigic resources 8.5/10 get this game civilization fans!!!",2
"if you want a time machine; this game is perfect. you can launch the game at the start of the day and being called for dinner not long after.",1
"this is the utimate turn-based stategy around, it does have slight problems though,as sometimes the a.i can go on the fritz during a invasion of your country but worth every penny. p.s its dlcs are worth picking up as g&k and bnw improve the experience by vast amounts.",1
"longest longevity compared to any other game on my deskop. excellent!",2
"ive sunk hours into this game saying just one more turn and then realizing it was 2 or 3a. very fun game and lots of ways to play it!",1
"an amazing game and one of ther best stratergy games ive playd in a long time. worth buying, so addictive and really fun",2
"great strategy game, a bit laggy in the advanced stages of the game. turns from a swift strategy game into a lagging monstosity rather quickly. everything upto that point is more than fine though",1
"it wants to eat all your time. and you will like it.",2
"takes some time to build the beginning of your empire, but when it has grown somewhat larger the gameplay is tremendous.",1
"im pretty terrible at this game apparently, but its still a lot of fun. just dont start playing unless you have appoximately 1 full day put aside for a campaign. its so hard to stop playing once you start.",1
"whether civilization v is better than iv is a debate that has raged on for many years. in my own opinion, this game is the superior of the two, mostly due to the expansions. yes, it sucks to no longer have to worry about the health of your cities, and golden ages happen far too frequently, but at the same time, the combat and movement systems are far improved, and you wont have to worry about having massive stacks of hundreds of units just to have an effective military. if youre new to civ, this game is the best choice for you, but if youve been playing civ for a long time, iv might be more up your alley.",1
"sooooo many hours poured into this game, ive forgotten what the sun looks like",3
"this game is awesome hours and hours of great entertainment this is one of the best purchases of my life",1
"the jury is open on how civ v compares to previous games, but personally i havent enjoyed the series this much in a long time. some systems have been simplified, but it only serves to make more room for others to become deeper. empires are now creatures to be fine tuned rather than sprawling beasts, as the rule of diminishing returns will work against land grabs and conquerers. diplomacy is intuitive, and when that fails war is satisfyingly tactical. for decades civilization has held the crown as the pinnacle of open ended strategy gaming, and this iteration only strengthens its grip.",1
"this game is just awesome, addicting and adorable to watch. civilization is a turn-based strategy game where you can play as a world leader of nation or an empire. this game has 2 expansion packs who are worth its money. the soundtrack is just plainly beautiful to hear and it will never be annoying after hours. the character models look great and sometimes also intimidating. i havent played multiplayer yet but the singleplayer is how it should be. civilization 5 belongs to one of the best strategy games of all time. singleplayer rating : 10/10",1
"this is such a great game! you realy need to try it!",1
"the single best strategy game i have ever played. sessions of this game take a while, but it keeps you enthralled and offers a lot of replay value due to dlc and a huge amount of characters to play. if you have ever enjoyed a strategy game, and have not already played this one, buy this game.",2
"sunk hundreds of hours into it. cant say much other then im addicited, its become the game i play while listening to podcasts. the only thing i dislike about the game is that one turn before i build a wonder some  of a civ beats me to it, frustrates the everlasting  out of me. oh well, the expansions gods and kings as well as brave new world turn this into a really fantastic civ game.",2
"this game will test your trust bonds with your friends",2
"if you like building a empire from the ground up this is definetly a game to check out. its got everything from diplomatically resolving all war in the world to bombing everyone but yourself into the stone age.",2
"in my current game against bots, i am king of arabia, who conquered all of south america by defeating england in 300bc, i then explored until i found africa where i allied myself with china and waged war against germany, greece and the ottoman empire, which was laughably one-sided because i, arabia, am the wealthiest/most powerful/most cultured/most technologically advanced society in the world. i am also taking over earth. its an amazing game, if you love strategy games, an easy 9/10, if you dont usually play strategy games much, its still a definite 8/10. you should really play it, yes im talking to you. you. you should play this. not john, not bob, not saint mary mcloius jeebus, but you.",1
"great replay value, although you unfortunatley will not be able to replay it since you will die of old age during your first game 10/10",1
"i sunk over 100 hours into this game and i think that was just the tutorial. this game is amazing. a-maze-ing. with a capital amaze. it has problems, but i cant remember them due to my mind being blown. major time sink. divorce your wife before starting.",1
"kinda steep learning curve, but as soon as you grasp the basics you will lose yourself in this game, it has so many things going for it, from the nice clean layout to the different victories, civilisation v will keep you interested for a long, long time.",1
"nuking other nations as ghandi has never been more fun! 11/10",1
"for fans of the classic turn based strategy look no further than sid meiers civilization v. ive sunk 200+ hours into it and still havent explored everything that the game has to offer. no two games are alike. explore the world and maybe become the dominant civilization of the world. a nice and quick game can be short like 300 turns, while the marathon sessions can be 1300 turns if you let the game advance to the 2000 ce. if you are a returning player from previous installments or even a brand new person to the series purchase this game and its expansions to continually add more content as new updates come out all the time.",2
"dropped 32 nukes on the iroquois, didnt even take there cities. won a diplomatic victory. 10/10 would irrationaly nuke again.",1
"amazing! pure beauty of the graphics got me into this and the lovely gameplay got me playing more and more... you seem to lose sense of time playing civ ... that is so true :d i recommend this to all history, strategy and turn-base fans!",1
"a whole lot better than the other civs ive played. but why they cant live up to their old game alpha centauri is beyond me. so im being unfair and judging it purely on that. and why is iron so much rarer than uranium? come on, game.",1
"awesome game. i cannot wait to see where this franchise is going to take us.",5
"what can i say about civ 5? it is the greatest strategy game ever made thus far, and i doubt that will change until civ 6. sid meir is single handedly dragging the stratagy genre through a time when strategy games are about as popular g.w bush. there is no reason to have steam and not own this game. it is the greatest concept ever conseived by a games designer. now put down your tools workers and worship at the feet of or lord, sid meir. 10/10",1
"this is by far the most addictive game i have ever played. it is definitely beyond any other strategy game even though i like more the rts type. i ended up hating napoleon for always spawning huge armies right at my frontiers and ramses ii for finishing first all the damn wonders i had started to build 15 turns ago and cesar for cutting through all the weaker ones and charge my wonderful knights with tanks and mech infantry. ive never given ghandi a chance though. yet again, i cant stress enough on how addictive this game is, after sitting for ~6h (which seemed like 2h) i closed the computer only to start thinking how on earth am i to fight alone the alliance between the arabs and egiptians and beat a nuked up ramses to scientific victory. briliant game.",1
"civ v is the turn-based strategy game for the ages. soon after playing for the first time, youll be glued to this game for hours upon hours, and youll love it. great for anyone who loves them a good strategy game, or for anyone with a passing interest in them. the astounding variety in civilizations and game possibilities, as well as multiplayer make this game worth every penny and gold piece. hex grid master race.",1
"nothing really surprising here but still a lot of fun. ive been a civ player since the original twenty years ago.",1
"very addictive, 34 hours logged in 3 or 4 sessions. gandhi nuked me 10/10 would play again.",1
"my new favorite strategy game! simply explained, you guide a civilization through history, from the invention of agriculture onwards, and compete against other civilizations and states in cultural, scientific, military, and diplomatic matters. the events that occur during this are just awesome and hilarious, and the ways to win or lose a game are numerous and enjoyable. despite the seemingly complicated nature of this, the game is very easy to learn on lower difficulties. if you havent played civilization before, i cannot urge you more to try civilization v!",1
"a good enough successor to civ4. some things it does really well, like hexes. other things i miss from civ4, like its significantly harder to field an army, and enemy cities are significantly harder to attack now. if i outnumber him 5:1, i should just win. but no, one unit per hex, so not everyone gets to attack the same turn... makes combat slower. graphics are beautiful. no more leonard nemoy narrating. :(",2
"you will never lose more of your life playing a game other than this one, and for good reason, because this is probably the most time-consuming, addictive game there is.",1
"a lot of fun, not too steep of a learning curve and the multiplayer is great. can be a bit laggy at times, but not usually anything that is not worth dealing with.",2
"it is a very fun very tactical game. i like the play it. it. is. great!",2
"just. awesome. anyone who missed the humble bundle for this... you should be",1
"awesome strategy game. great replay value. can be set up as a short game or an epic one.",2
"if you like turn based strategy games then you will most likely enjoy this. although if you enjoy turn based strategy games you will already have it. so hope youre enjoying playing it.",1
"love this game. at first it got boring after a few minutes of gameplay but upon learning the core of the gameplay and strategies, this is one addicting game.",2
"so you like being a leader?how about war?want to found the countries with out history in the real world?then this your game.but in all honesty this a good game play it now.9 out 10.",2
"hours upon hours of fun. if you are new to civilization games, this is the perfect one to start with.",2
"this game is so addicting! what am i doing with my life? oh wait, i hold the fate of millions in the palm of my hand. mwuahaha!",1
"played a game against russia. never got along with them. a new cold war dawned. i lost and was nuked. 10/10.",2
"its a very fun game i am a big fan of the series but better than beyond earth",1
"while im sure many of you already own this game, i would absolutely reccomend it to anyone whos a fan of turn-based strategy. while i feel many of the aspects of civ iv were toned down in complexity, i feel like the much more strategic combat helps the experience significantly.",2
"i cant believe how good and addicting this game is. i tried to play freeciv in the past and never got how people could think that was addicting, but civ v solved my main issue with it: theres too much to handle, but civ v forces me to handle everything before ending my turn. and gosh, im playing with d. pedro ii!",1
"i wasnt big on strategy games until i came across this. very, very addictive, and i still havent learned everything about the game, so theres still a sense of wonder to it. bonus points for being tablet-friendly; i often find myself playing this on the road.",1
"every civ and city state in one of my singleplayer games allied against me and destroyed me for no reason 10/10 makes me want to kill myself",1
"not much to say about it. a very deep game with different styles of play. i reccomend this to anyone who is into these kinds of games, if ou liked age of empires, youl like this too",1
"just one more hour... oh look, the sun is coming up",4
"i thought i wasnt going to like this game very much, i totally fell in love with the strategy and game style.",1
"the customer support for this community is unresponsive, and fails to let paying customers play their game. this is unacceptable. i want to know who is going to be fired for this.",4
"just one more turn.. always one more turn. so addictive you will spend alot of time on one game, either with friends or by yourself. 9/10 tasty crusts",1
"very well made turn based game. beware, very long games, not for an occasional casual player. found single player games fun for a while, but got extremly boring after a while. multiplayer on the other hand though, never gets old for me, adds a much more interesting game, after all, your dealing with real players. excellent to play with a friend[s].",2
"sidmeiers civilization v is an ok game. fun to play with friends overall but gets boring after a little while. i do recommend this game to you if you like puzzel and history games. other than that its an ok game.",1
"time consuming political game, is what it comes down to. like a turn-based ages of empires but with intelligent political ais. played it for over 40 hours in 3 days of getting the game.",1
"started a game with max players, 2 ghandis and 2 napoleans and 2 montezumas. 11/10 would paradox again",1
"never played any civ game. tried today and dindt stop playing for 4 hours straight.the singleplayer its a very low pace game (at least i think it is), and i think thats great because it gives you time to learn the game. you should try it.",1
"historical figures controlling countries and living for thousands of years, with nukes and giant robots from the future. 10/10",1
"cliche joke about something bad in the game that i find funny 11/420",2
"lacks a little depth compared to its predecessor and the ai is beyond stupid in battle, but this game remains a fanstastic strategy title and a good introduction for newcomers to the series.",2
"if you like games similar to cod, bf, or other first person shooters go ahead and buy this game its basically an upgraded cod clone.",1
"an amazingly large game. thousands of hours of gameplay. the random stuff that can happen is just great, like starting in america as india and vise versa. a really great game that becomes more interesting the more people that play in a round.",2
"among the best and most engrossing games i have ever played; anybody who considers themselves a gamer needs to pick it up.",5
"probably the greatest game ive ever played involving strategy. could have more features, but it already exists for add-ons.",1
"if you like 1. strategy games 2. civ 3. fun this game is for you !!! have fun",1
"a fantastic game for passing the time, and an even better game to join up with your friends, and kick some .",3
"as you can see, the developers are clearly incapable of spelling civilisation correctly and based on that: you can predict what the rest of the game is like. you would have at least thought that they got someone to check the spelling before putting this game on the market. its just as bad as dishonored. 0/10 - would not bang.",1
"im totally in love with this game. im not sure what it is but it caught my attention very fast and said i have to grab this game. havent stopped playing since then.",1
"took over the world as ghandi and nuked everyone. 8/8 m8",1
"its an amazing experience if you can get past te grafical glitches + bugs",1

"this is just another review about how ghandi is a *%$@ passing through 69/666 would nuke again",1
"this game stoll me life away. i would not recomend to people with a family.",1
"the game is endlessly replayable and each game lasts such a long time. multiple days depending on the amount of civilizations. the expansions make even better with more early game fun as well as late game fun. i would highly recommend this game to anyone who is intrested. even the online is smooth, so i love to spend just one more turn with my friends",3
"it is the kind of game where you keep saying just this one turn and then i go to bed. an this keeps going untill 5 a.m.",2
"this is a awesome game. dont get me wrong. the games crashes are so frequent i can no longer play this game, i have literally recorded the amount of time it takes to crash. the time was 3-5 mintues. not even enough time to make a unit move a couple hexes. i have over 1gb of ram dedicated to this game, thinking it would help. no luck. tried using a mod to increase fps, nothing. nothing works. i cant decide whether to recommend or not. i guess i recommend.",1
"civ 5 was a bit disappointing after its release, but it got much better with the expansions and although i still have some reservations about some game mechanics (especially in comparison with civ 4), it is definitely worth playing.",3
"very good game, if you like strategy based games, than this is one for you. very robust game with loads to explore. would recommend to anyone.",4
"- announced protection to city state, portugese fat lady declared war on them. raided her capital city, didnt get denounced by other leaders. - caught enemy spy in my capital, declared war. caught everybody elses spy during the war, destroyed the original perpetrator and everybody was ok with that. even after 10 hours in, still scratching the surface. 10/10",1
"incredibly fun game. much like the civ 4 although far prettier and now with a redesigned combat system which i find very enthralling. terribly addicting and incredibly well designed. a must buy for a fan of the series.",1
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",2
"i need to make declarations of friendship with real people for a change... 9/10 amazing game",1
"just one more turn... is all you going to say after you found out that youve played a map for all the night.",2
"this game is amazing. definitely have to dedicate a good chunk of time if you want to play online, but it is well worth it.",1
"holy shnaps!!! a masterpiece 11/10. babylon is a true badass",1
"if you love causing mayhem and you are great with strategies you will love this game!!!!!!!!",1
"my friends told me not to go japan. i went japan and we lost our friendship. 10/10 would lose more friends again!",1
"great game - more complex gameplay than previous versions and gorgeous graphics.",1
"amazing game. will keep you playing for hours and hours.",1
"very good a lot of fun and the mods are super 10/10",2
"i love the civilization series, and civ v is a great game to add to the series!",2
"its a good, fun strategy game, but it can be a bit buggy, and requires and pretty good pc.",1
"if you have even looked at this game and considered hm, looks kind of neat. then you should buy the complete edition right now. gods and kings expansion is optional brave new world is extremely good and pretty much required to make this game a 10/10 the complete edition is highly suggested. theres far too much about this game for me to ramble on about. if you need more information go look up multiple reviews that arent from steam or one source. however, you can trust me when i say, unless you absolutely hate the grand strategy genre civ5 complete edition is a must buy, especially when its on sale.",1
"the true meaning of a stategy game with patience and high amount of planning and perception of enemy moves and plans. also every dlc offers an ever bigger satisfaction and length to the game without making it too tired or extremely complicated 9/10 because there is no thing called perfection",1
"best civ i have played so far: i have played civ 2,3,4 and civ rev i would suggest this one to anybody the game is brilliant for singleplayer, multiplayer and modding and even though civ beyond earth is now out i would still recommend this to any gamer. truely a great game :)",1
"despite some of its issues such as mod incompatibility in multiplayer, sid meiers civilization v still stands out being one of the best turn based strategy games.",2
"this game is extremely fun, interesting and entertaining. i love being able to play as different nations, each with their own unqiue play style and perspective.",1
"one of the best strategy games ever made - too much strategy 7.8",1
"you cant go wrong with the civilization series. all the dlc is great too, and worth purchasing.",3
"amazing game! well put together, and the graphics are great, especially on a desktop.",1
"what can i say for civilization series? everyone who doesnt leave under a rock knows sid meiers masterpiece. i played the series since colonization and i am looking forward in the moment from the sequel beyond earth! all civs all worth to play though!and if you add the mods= endless gameplay!",1
"well, the 251 hours played on this game most likely explain how much i like it however it can get a little boring if you only play on your own so sadly, if you have no friends, your screwed...",2
"this game is a ultimate strategi based game with a lot of great dlc and extras. if you are willing to but time in it you will have a great time building up your empire.",1
"one of the greats, and one of the few my wife will play.",1
"one of the most addicting games i have ever played. hours will go by feeling like minutes. buy this immediately.",1
"let me spin a tale of truth and sorrow....you know all these nations, some of which you previouly admired? well  that. you will unleash the fury of your inner demons upon various pixels after watching them *attempt* to fight back. long story short: get the game.",1
"good game with clear graphics, it works on my comr even though its fairly old.",1
"best game i ever played, i used most hours playing this than any other.",1
"four years after its release, its still an entertaining game. much of it can nourish your brain with strategic imaginations, lifetime ideas as well as historical learnings. much of what the era is here all depends on you. you can even control historical leaders too! notably bonaparte napoleon! pretty much like those city games but this one delievers alot more than those kinds of games. and hey, dlcs of this game is twice the fun!",1
"if i were a king, id be a pretty  king because id be playing this constantly. is better than the sex. 11/10 would bang consistently.",3
"great game, good fun and brilliant multiplayer, best with all the dlc.",1
"if you like any of the other civ games you will love this one. i have 40+ hours into it already",1
"engrossing turn-based empire-builder with simultaneous-turn multiplayer, an excellent game.",1
"a little bird told to me: go! go, socialize, talk to those fine leaders! and then kill every last one of them, drop the nukes into their lands when they are not looking and then burn their cites to the ground!!! well that silly, isnt it? hahahahahahahahah...",2
"feels very great when you win after a full 8 hour long game. you can either play the game simple or go in-depth and micromanage a lot. but dont play it without the expansions. best played online with people you know on voice chat, so much comedy can happen",2
"this game gets a -1000/10 for not including laser sharks that swim in lava as a modern era unit. gods and kings is no help, still no laser sharks.",2
"really enjoyed the offline play... it was a little easy to complete though, if you want to play multipleyer id recommend the complete version with all mods or else it becomes very challenging to match games as the multiplayer service is deeply flawed.",1
"i love this game first civilization and love it cant wait for beyond earth!",1
"very good game, i would recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy genres. the graphics for me are supurb and the little animations when you battle singleplayer! in my first game, my tank anihalated a spearmen and the animation to me very funny. great game!",1
"specific historical accuracy aside, civ gives you a quick look at all of human history. a very addicting game, dont be suprised when you look at the clock and realize that a couple of hours have passed.",1
"for friends of turn-based stategy games very recommended. it wont get bored and is even for players with less experience and time.",5
"civ v is a fun game, but be sure not to take anything the wrong way. this game tends to ruin friendships. xd",1
"one of the best historal battle games ever made! this game will drive you crazy as you want to build your empire more and destroy other empires even more! you will discover the attitude and grow relationships with other empires as well as start wars and take over citys. this is one of the best games ive ever played, and in my opionion one of the best games on steam and in stores!",4
"besides my constant crashing its a pretty fun game",1
"really great game guys. look into buying it if your into strategy games!",1
"this game is very addicative has a very good time that you play on it! 10/10 would do!",1
"ace game tonnes of fun online and off if you havent got no internet and you wanna submerse yourself into your own world for a few hours (more like 8 hours)",1
"this game is alot of fun and easy to get into! but also has alot of game play and replay value",1
"fun but a little frustrating. i grew up playing age of empires and this was much more technical (and fun).",1
"civilization v alone: 7/10 civilization v with gods and kings: 8/10 civilization v with g&k and brave new world: 10/10 civilization v with all dlc and alot of mods: 11/10 rules dont apply anymore",1
"normally i dont review the big titles but civilization deserves it. this game, and all predecessors are the best turn based strategy games every made.",1
"this game will suck the life out of you; very addictive, very well made. and if you have a moster rig as i do you will enjoy it even more.",1
"this game is nice and is worth to try out.it is a stratergic game and you can also play multiplayer with your friend",1
"never ever play this game again. you have been warned ! 11/10 addicting, destroy my university life -1/10 dont play again.",1
"a great turn-based game. make sure you have a spare few... days... spare.",1
"a very addictive game. countless hours of (re)playability. the gods & kings, as well as brave new world, expansion packs add so much good stuff, it is strange that some people dont have this game yet. as you can see from the amount of hours played, you will not be disappointed when you buy it. only gripe is that if you play with friends against the cpu in multiplayer, the ai is very stale. furthermore mods are not enabled for multiplayer, although they are for single player though (and irecommend the european and world maps made by the community with true placement). buy it and prepare for hours and hours of fun gameplay!",3
"sid meiers civilization v is a very enjoyable game. points detracted for its treatment of women (almost all of the leaders are men in this game) but otherwise i think its worth the money. they say that the victors write history; i say that, in actuality, its the men. down with the patriarchy.",1
"i started playing this game once..... 10 hours later it was dark out and i was nowhere close to winning. you want a time sink? get this game. you want to nuke ghandi? play this game. you want to rule the world as ghandi through sheer force of military will? get this game. do you ever want to see your family or friends again? dont get this game.",1
"absolutely love civ 5. even though it is lengthy, it is definitely the best turn-based strategy pc game ive ever played. the mechanics are beautifully mastered, and the gameplay so smooth, you wouldnt even think it was turn based.",1
"one of the best 4x strategy games out there. recomend the latest version (brave new world) since it fixes many of the things found in the first release and expansion of the game. buy it, build your empire and conqure your enemies!!! or if you wish, create paris and win with culture instead! :)",2
"if you like strategy this game is for you! it is the perfect game if you like forming a civilization and conquering the world in many different ways",1
"awesome game!! awesome turn based strategy game i absolutely loved it. there is an amazing modding community that can greatly increase the longevity of the game and the mods are supported in steam workshop. i have sunk a ton of hours into this game with abosolutely no regrets. it almost always goes on steam sales so wait until then and snap it up!!",1
"a very simplistic sequel to the civilization series, but thats not a bad thing. the game is gorgeous and although a lot of the micromanagement between your cities has been removed, combat is a much more enjoyable experience with a hex-based grid and the inability to stack units. ive yet to play brave new world, but gods and kings is a very worthwhile addition to the game, as well.",1
"buy this and the brave new world expansion 7/10 civ v 9/10 civ v+ brave new world",3
"this game is so great. but beware it takes forever to complete a game and if you have a bad computer with no fan, you might wanna do it in sessions",1
"more addictive than the purest heroin, allows limited forward time travel, fulfils your darkest historical fantasies, incites hatred against gandhi and ruins chances of meeting all forseeable deadlines. truly a game for the ages.",2
"this game is fantastic. once you begin to play you cant stop and you loose track of time.",1
"civilization v is one of the best strategic games i have played in a long time. while the ai can be a bit ridiculous (putting this very lightly) at times, the game itself is well crafted. the interface is clear, but not overly simplistic; and the tutorials, mixed into game itself, allow new players to quickly jump into the game. whether youre a veteran to strategic games, or someone just starting out, civilization v is the perfect addition to your steam library.",1
"this is without doubt the greatest turn-based strategy game ever made.",1
"spent 150+ hours on this game. absolutely incredible. 0 out of 5",2
"whats with the game last i played it ,it was last night 10/23/2014 but the game said last day i played it was on tuesday that would be 3 days before now it wont let me play the game without paying for it, so in my opinin the game is not worth downloading, playing it for 3 times then gotta download the 49.99 to 23.99 upgrades is not worth the time on free games,, i would not recommend to anybody to take the time to download this game!",1
"when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold, dyes, and ivory, take my advice. ready all your tanks and nukes, arm them, and shoot them like your life depends on it. they are evil, traitorous demons. never trust them. however, genghis khan is my best friend. he came up to me and was all like, de full do bu la chi mendo. and i said, okay! lets be friends! i can never understand that guy, but something about our relationship just works. ghandi hating simulator 2014 11/10",1
"all shall fall before glorious mother russia. also dont trust etheopia, that guy backstabbed me but its okay because i killed everyone in his kingdom with chariot archers.",1
"very solid game, only dissapointed in the fact that it left core things like religion and espionage for dlc (things that were included in civ 4).",1
"only game ive ever written a review for. its amazing, gameplay is perfect and addicting...never gets old... hope the next game is the same! 10/10",1
"fantastic game. love being able to dominate the world. :d",2
"sid meiers civilization v is arguably one of the best strategy based games of this decade.",1
"awesome game. better that i can play on my linux box!!",1
"yeah, well... no, i dont like civ v. basically, you need a good start, and then you dont have to mess it up. the game is repetitive and very very veeeery slow. its a time drain. if you like time drains, you could love this game. but i never got the satisfying feeling of having accomplished anything. when i lose, i usually know why, and it was something i did hours ago. yes, i could get the skills to turn the game around in such situations, but i dont see what for. i dont feel entertained. even if i played 100+ hours. i wanted to like the game.",1
"one of the best strategy games ever made, especially with the upgrades",4
"better than ing dark souls by a mile long . but really this game is really good if youre either a science or history buff or you just like conquering the world highly recommend it",1
"so there i was minding my own business building structures in the name of montezuma when my next door neighbor arabia(historically accurate btw) invades with thirteen units. so i hold up in a city with my three units and they give me money. then i look south and decide to invade america with sweden. me and swedeland are now best buds. but that dont matter because on another continent xerxes is building a spaceship and theyre arent any trojan condoms around. so as a last ditch effort i send two cruisers a carrier and the enola gay to nuke there capital. 10/10",1
"honestly the greatest steam game ive played to date. i highly recommend. 10/10",3
"overall i enjoy civ series and this brings a new twist as no longer able to stack units. definitely adds some new challenges to the series.",2
"ive logged 420 hours into civ v and just as many in every other civ game there is. this game is worth it.",3
"its fantastic! my favorite strategy game of all time!",3
"civ 5 is my favourite civilization game of the series . in 2015 when civ 6 comes out hopfully i can say civ 6 is my favourite",2
"a damn good board game as it is, civilization 5 was a best example of how to do it right, with of addons and add-ons, it became a overcomplicated turn-based strategy. for some its for best, for some - not so. and because u cant delete once bought content, game itself became something different then something what u loved so much once. so, buy urself a game and dont think of all other bulls**t like dlc, and ul get urself a best of civilization!",1
"beginning to ruin my life. 11/10. would nuke ghandi again.",1
"probably one of the most addicting games ive ever played. every playthrough seems to present a new challenge!",3
"civ v is one of those games that youll hardly put an eye out. has lots of things to offer and its firendly to new players that havent played the civ franchise before. youll spend lots of hours on it, and time will pass hell quickly before you notice lol. its an amazing game with lots of pros and few cons. cons are hardly noticeable so dont even bother to look up for one.",2
"highly reccomend to any civillization fan. a little different than previous expansions but it adds a lot more complexity and fun. just one more turn.... one more turn...",1
"great game, expect to forget what the sun looks during the 2-3 weeks after you buy this game",1
"absolutely fantastic game, a litttle pricey but goes on sale often enough. expect to keep saying one more turn until you collapse from sleep deprivation.",1
"this game annoy me just gut ask by rome if i could help them kill germans and i say oki but he had to wait 10 rounds so i could be ready they 10 rounds pass and im haf way down to germany and then rome decleare war agianst me insted of germany the computer have no problem whith attacking you from behiend whith out warning then you kick their  and they want peace you refuce and take the capital and some how they make peace whith out you know it and you have to wait and in the mean time the computer talks bad about to the other contry saying you are the bad guy so they also wanna attack you you never know if they are your friend or they wanna attack you dislike",1
"this series has always been a major upside to my gamer life. i love a challenge, and i love games that take me a long time to 100%. civilization has always fufilled both of those requests for me, and it just keeps getting better. civ v is no exception.",1
"addicting strategic gameplay that we keep you involved through all ages of civilization.",1
"been a fan of civilization and other sid meiers games since i started playing pc games. this one will not let you down and the vastness of cheap dlc that enhance the base game and throw new challenges make for an easy thumbs-up on this game. buy at whatever price and rack up on the dlc when it goes on sale.",5
"best game ive ever played has hooked endless and replayable",1
"awesome game. recommend it to anyone who likes rts games or tbs games.",1
"great game, but only really worth getting with all the dlc unfortunatly. its only with the dlc that it feels like a complete game.",1
"for a research agreement you have to give me 500 gold uranium and oil plus all your gems. 10/10",1
"i would love to write more but ive got to go and destroy another city. all i will say is that it is a super addicting and well designed game.",1
"9,5/10- its one of best strategies in the world. you can do everything you want, game without dlc packs= half game",1
"near perfect 4x game - you can and will easily spend hundreds of hours with this game.",2
"this game is awesome, maybe is cuz im sid meiers follower, but im also sure that if u like the strategy by turns u love this game too",1
"this is a game for someone looking to break into the world of strategy games. even expierienced players can enjoy having fun with this, ive played plenty of strategy games, starting with civ 3 and all the way up to europa universalis 4. i still enjoy playing this for fun. p.s. never trust anyone peaceful in real life(e.g ghandi) ~remember to never stop slamming! -probably space jam",2
"a very fun and addicting game, anything can happened and it keeps you from getting bored.",2
"this game is amazingly fun, just take breaks every 7 hours so you avoid a blood clot in your leg.",1
"if youre a civ 3 and/or civ 4 veteran like me, youll enjoy this new version of an old addiction. some elements simplified others expanded on. i boycotted buying this game until a friend of mine made me play it. most dynasty games dissapoint, this one does not.",1
"when you first play civ v you wonder... how many times will i need to restart this until jolpe finds a decent spawn place. then you wonder... will that guy just hit ing next turn already.... but the true magic of civilization v is when barbarian  come and burn down your horses, so you repair them with a hammer. only in sieve thive",1
"a fun game without the expansion gods and kings, but with it, it becomes one of the best turn based strategy games ever made. fun in multiplayer or singleplayer, easy to run and max out. it also has a bevy of fantastic mods, all easy to install with the steam workshop.",2
"fun game, like a virtual board game. games can be long so dont expect to finish one in a single sitting though! (unless its a duel)",2
"excellent strategy game. matches can last for hours. playing with friends online or via lan is loads of fun. highly recommend.",1
"i pretty sure 90% of the hours ive put in have been on one single game... unit stacking needs to come back but besides that highly recommend.",1
"a great gamr i think that the hexagonl dimesion adds something to it.",1
"great strategy game for anyone who has a little too much time on their hands",2
"this game helps with strategy and lots of planing through",1
"george washington lives for over 2000 years. best history combat simulator ever. 10/10",1
"awful game dont even bother, a complete total let down the turn based style is dull and very confusing. the grapics are ok at best the story is so ing dull. i wanted nothing and still felt let down.",1
"too addicting. some really great improvements over civ. 4 (one troop per tile, etc.)",1
"started a new game at 3 pm monday, 1 hour later it was wednesday....",1
"want to control other civilsation in a parallel universe? then this is a great recommendation. exterminate, exteriminate! for a domination always",2
"great game. it will ruin your life. seriously, buy this.",2
"no turn-base strategy games are better made made than the sid meiers civilization 5. i love that game.",2
"this game is absolutely fantastic. it will eat away hours and hours of your life, and you will love every second of it. it has awesome strategy elements and the turn based gameplay makes it more addicting than ever. its very deep, but beginners can still have a great time. not only is it my favorite pc game in recent times, its my favorite pc game ever. i highly recommend it to anyone. it is a phenomenal game.",1
"whats not to like about civilization v? the title that was famous for one more turn is once again back with a vengeance. the new fully rendered leader speech and full facial animation depending on your nations relationship is only the icing on the cake. there are a lot more improvements being introduced in this latest installment. the one i enjoyed the most is the new grid introduction. this made combat feels a bit more strategic as you have more room to manuever and at the same time attacked. if you still have not purchased this game yet, i strongly recommend it. just make sure you leave 72 hours of your time free.",1
"another civilization, another masterpiece. still the best game in terms of turn-based strategy.",1
"have been a fan of the civ franchise since civ 3 came out and i was in highschool. i love these games. this is the most fun i have had on a civ game since civ revolution on consoles. the learning curve is not that steep and if you are like me the montra of just one more turn will be your cake. very fun game.",1
"countless of hours spent on this game, one more turn untill you fall over your pc. worth the money. and its a game you will always come back to to play a round of. i remember when i just got it, belive i did a all nighter. :)",2
"become irrationally xenophobic in only a few playthroughs. 10/10",2
"this is one of those games where you start playing, then look up at the clock and say ive been playing for ten hours?!. if you like deep, immersive, and time-consuming strategy games, you need to be playing civilization.",1
"ill write a proper recommendation after this next turn. *click* maybe next turn. *click* next... *click* *click* *click* *click* *click*",1
"i would recommend this game to anyone looking for hours of fun thats made even better with friends!",1
"endless hours of fun. once you begin a game its very hard to stop playing just like all of the previous civilization games. if i were to give this a 1-10 score, id give it a 9/10.",4
"it is super fun to play and you learn a new thing very time you play",2
"good game if u like turn based rts games but get all the dlc as the original is balls",1
"this game is so good its what i like to call life ruiningly good cause youll spend all your time on this game great game immense worlds and replayablity is endless every game is different",1
"one of the best games ive ever played! highly recommended,",2
"i single handedly wiped out the americans and my iroquois brothers as the shoshone who in historical times never numbered much over 4,500. 10/10 would exact revenge again",4
"its awesome, by far ive logged more hours n this game than any other. no matter what i can always sit down and play a game of civ.",4
"i really adore the civ series and civ 5 is no exception. very fun and there are so many ways to play. with all the expansions and the free dlcs the fun is endless",2
"one more turn turns into 40 more turns. incredibly addicting",1
"love this game!!! tons of options. can play short or long games. multiple size and types of maps. can play slow or fast games.",5
"this game is amazing!!! if youre not playing it you need to!",2
"do you want to claw, lie, steal, murder your way to the top? do you want to go to prison or be invaded by the usa? if youve answered yes to the first question, youre in luck...if you answered yes to the second one...gabe help you. now on to the topic of saying yes to the first question! this is the game for you! -----features may include but are not limited to----- 1.) painfuly losing your entire civilization. 2.) mental scaring due to the pillage of your entire civilization by one of the most peaceful protesters in human history, ghandi. 3.) losing hundreds of thousands of hours of your life that will leave relationships crippled, bodies lacking vitamin d, and bills unpaid. 4.)becoming grossly enfatuated with mass genocide my opinion? great game 10/10",4
"going on 300 hours and is no less fun than the day i got it 10/10",3
"i know for the moment that i only have around thirteen hours logged, but that was one game where i needed just one more turn. im too scared to go back... 10/10",1
"time-consuming as hell, but this game is totally worth it. anyone who likes turnbased strategy in a realistic world setting will have a lot of fun with this game. even though i can only speak from playing with the add-on gods + kings.",1
"amazing game. addictive and really fun. dont start playing right before finals week",1
"this is a great turn-based game. its really fun. i would recommend that you play it.",1
"civilization v is a huge technological jump over its predecessor. as a standalone vanilla game, its pretty solid and enjoyable. with add-ons gods and kings and brave new world, it becomes a masterpiece in the 4x/turn based genre. great game that will easily wrap up your time and get you hooked before you even realize it as finishing up one more task before you save the game and quit, turns into another hour.",1
"theres something about taking over tamriel with celestia as your long time ally, then suddenly the penisface city states declare war on me. time to break out the tsar bombs again...",1
"this is a very fun game and it will suck you in for hours!",2
"well worth the price, much easier to get into than the other civs",1
"hours of fun every game is different and tons of user created content 5/5",1
"civ v brings the civ game to a whole new level of fun, however it is highly recommended to play with friends for the ai can be very predictable (predictable does not mean easy however) despite tech trading being out of the game the new features higly make up for it and turn the core civ gameplay into something much more in depth. civ v is a solid fun title and if you enjoy turn based strategy civ v is the game for you.",2
"the most brilliant strategy game currently available, this game keeps providing both fun and entertainment in educational wrapping.",5
"this is one of the best turn-based strategy games ever created. its like chess on crack. 10/10",1
"love this ga,e, just the right pace for an old guy like me.",1
"i love and still love this game the best civilisation game yet :)",1
"i believe with enough friends, an online match would be amazing",1
"must have for every civilization fan! great turn-based game which mixes classic civ-approach with some new features like hex instead of square fields and more tactical approach in battles. if you want to try it i have to warn you - have a lot of hours prepared, because it is really time-eating game!",2
"wonderful game, the best installment since civ 2. hugely addictive and the long games can really take up so much time. a must for stratergy fan gamers.",2
"ive played the game quite a bit. id say its is pretty damn rad. and you should definitely get it.",1
"my 100 hours cannot even explain how amazing this game is. if you love expanding, creating militaries, and ruling the world, then this is your game. i love the dynamic relationship process, it works almost like real life. the system can teach you how real world politics can work sometimes, and no world is ever the same.",1
"if youre reading this 20 years in the future for some odd reason, scroll up and buy the game. i dont even care if civ vi or civ vii has come out in that span of time, you should still buy this, and get addicted in the process.",3
"this game is probably the best strategy game i have ever played. its extremely fun with friends, and its not too difficult to understand while still being somewhat complex. i think it deserves its metascore rating of 90. however, it crashes on me frequently. so frequently that i may have to reload 20-30 times in order to play a single game. after researching this problem, its apparently common in the steam version.",1
"possibly the best in the series and ive played them all. wish i had more control over the interface layout, but its a huge improvement over iv.",1
"great game, very addictive. the game was good but the dlcs make it worth while with both gods and kings and brave new world. so much to do and so many ways to win!",1
"love ths game...with new expansion..it is def more challenging..",1
"i am in no way a lover of this type of stratergy game, bit i had heard good things about this so i decided to give it a try out of curiosity as it was in my fiancs shared library. i started it up only thinking i would be bored to tears within 5 minutes, but 3 hours later i was still going to make myself dinner in one more turn.",1
"whew! after a few fun hours its time to turn this off and go to bed. whats that? its time to get up already!? yeah. it happens. with all of its dlc, 50 hours is only scratching the surface. its addicting, its exciting, and its challenging. playing with friends in to the early morning is a common occurence as you to try to out-perform and out-maneuver your opponents. its satisfying when you emerge victourious after an 8 hour game. (lets ignore the disappointment of being defeated after 8 hours). this game is well worth your money as there are many hours of fun to be had. also, the music is pretty darn good.",1
"outstanding game, nice strategy game and the game requires an actaul thought process. dont be put off by the turn based system its what makes the game awesome, the system allows you to make decisons and take your time or you can speed up via pressing the turn finsihed button quickly.",1
"if u are a 4x fan i would definitely recommend this game. and likewise if your not really a 4x fan it is still a great game to play. not just hours but weeks of fun. 10/10 from me.",1
"like a good book, you wont be able to put this down.",1
"this game is so good on the 20 hours ive played i had so much fun. the reason why i dont play much is because i perfer the multiplayer but my friends never wanna play it so in my opinion: 8/10",1
"fun game with modding capabilities. a fun time all around.",1
"12 hours a game gr8 with friends but will get mad if they take forever to end their turn 6/9",1
"this is a great game you can spend hours playing either casually or competitively. this is the best turn based strategy game i have ever played and would recommend it to everyone even if the genre is not one you would normally play.",3
"really addictive and deep, one of the best strategy games out there today. recommend buying on sale with all dlc packs.",1
"fun game learning curve but fun with lots of friends and baes",1
"you have been warned, one more turn ends up becoming a few hundred more...",5
"way too much time spent playing this, great game for long trips.",1
"great game normally when i want to get off i cant because its just so addicting. the game can last forever there is hardly a chance that you will finish a game in one day even if you do a quick match.",1
"its a good game,a little slow when starting a game, but speeds up as you go along.",1
"this game is worth every penny. its easy to lose 12 hours in this game without even noticing",1
"sid meiers civ v is a must own game. personally, i would have never seen myself playing this game. but i bought it on sale one day and i can say its one of my top games. its a fun, well made, and all around enjoyable game. the different civilazations create a different game every time you start one up. the variety is really really relaxing as you dont feel a grind, or a sense of repetition. the gameplay it self is awesome. turn based game with lots of things happening at once. you build up your civ. and your battle it out with other civs, or you may go a passive route and win economically or culturally. plus there is awesome online play which make it really fun to battle it out versus friends or team up with friends and fight other ai or users. must have!",1
"this game devours your life hours at a time. let it not be said that history is not entertaining.",2
"its goood if u like to kill everyone in the worldddddz!",1
"buy this and the brave new world expansion 7/10 civ v 9/10 civ v+ brave new world",3
"time for bed: i can spend an hour playing a game. 2 hours later: another hour wont hurt. sunrise: damn you ghandi! 3 hours later: screw work, ghandi must pay! got the picture yet.",1
"this is recommended! even better than prtal 2. you are capable of building a great country, and your goal: victory. i like the gameplay, graphics, and themes for empires. you should get dlc. (denmark,korea,polynesia, g+k, bnw)",3
"best game i have played in a long time! one play through and i have played for over 13 hours!",1
"as someone who was attacked by civ 3, manage to survive civ 4, and now is fighting civ 5... i can say: buy this game!!! if you played civ before than you know how addictive this game is. if you havent played it than you should get it now, and give your free time to this game... thats a lie.... you will give it all of your time, because its a civ game.",2
"this game pretty much sucks all your free time away. be aware it is more addictive than crack cocaine and you may need to visit rehab if it interferes with your social life.",1
"very fun game. adds some new features that i think give it a more realistic feel. great buy.",1
"sid meier is the king of tbs games. i have been in love with this franchise since the beginning and have invested more hours into it than i would like to admit.",1
"another fantastic installment in the civilization franchise. i have been playing since the original version and although they evolve and change release to release, they always deliver. civ 5 is no exception.",2
"history, a. learn you some past and get to beat some historical . also,  gandhi that a attacked me unprovoked.",1
"very good game, especially if its just one those sick days where you cant get off of the couh, very time consuming",1
"huge time-vampire. worth every minute though- its still fun, challenging, and mentally stimulating. my 95 hours is about 5 whole games on the fast-paced setting. this is the game you play when you want a week of your life to disappear suddenly. its easy to learn, but hard to master- especially with the all additions to mechanics the expansions make. again, 95 hours, no where near mastery myself. i reccommend that you get both gods and kings and brave new world- without them, the game is a little lacking.",1
"super addicting turn-based strategy. can be played by newcomers to the genre & by hardcore gamers. i have had a lot of fun with this game in single player & also in multiplayer co-op mode with my non-gamer girlfriend. highly recommended!",1
"takes a really long time to play, but its pretty worth it if youve got some friends to play it with.",1
"a thinking nyqqas game, be prepared for betrayal and normal history while you embark on a journey to nuclear warfare and congress-like diplomacy.",1
"5/5 a classic for anyones strategic game library, one more turn. i recommend getting the two expansions.",1
"sure, it could have used some work, and maybe the ai is still finnicky and some gameplay mechanics could be improved. this is however, no detraction from the legacy of civ iv and other civilization games past. this game still continues to improve the legacy of the genre defining series that is civilization. go buy the game and all of its expansion packs. seriously, go buy it all.",1
"with all the dlc, its a very good game. dont try it without them though. ah, thats it, others write proper ones.",1
"awesome to play with few people, but only if you can afford to buy all expantions. if not then simply buy one of previous parts.",2
"this gam is awesome! although it may not be historically accurate... i p155ed of ghandi and he declared war on me and nuked beijing. he then captured my people and held them as slaves, and then set fire to my one beautiful cities... also i am in a gam that has lasted me at least 5 hours and i am not even half way through, also i modded it and beat up hitler so yeah... 10/10 and stuff.",1
"very addictive game! the (expensive) gods & kings dlc is a must buy though.",2
"this is my favorite civilization yet. its beautiful, fluid, and still retains the just one more turn addictiveness the series is known for. the music is outstanding as well, with themes written for each country that shift and change as you progress through the game. the new tactical warfare really makes a difference too; gone are the stacks of doom from previous games. its a meat and potatoes tactical addition that really sets this iteration apart from previous games imo. its a must-own for fans of the series or turn-based strategy in general.",2
"one of the best strategy games ever. its so easy to lose track of time and get sucked into this game for hours and hours.",2
"how long could one game on marathon really be? - 107 hours ago",1
"wickedly addicting. there is more content than you can imagine, and with a new expansion just around the corner expect to waste away hours and hours.",1
"this is about the 5th time ive stayed up untill 4:00 am playing civ v. i hate myself for buying this game.",2
"buy. this. game. i have over 400 hours invested into this game and it has not gotten boring yet. make sure you get the downloadable content with it. it makes a huge difference and brings all new and exciting ways to play to the table. you have to be careful when playing this game because you will start playing and bam next thing you know you have been playing for 6 hours straight. one of the best games i have ever bought. there is one con to this game. when playing online make sure you try and play with all human players so there are few or no ais playing with you. this is because for some reason the ais wont declare war on anyone while it is in online mode. they will in single player, just not online. honestly that is the only negative thing i have found about this game. word of advice, the zulus are s and mahatma gandhi is an even bigger . 9.5/10",2
"do you wnt a game where you can nuke ghandi? well its your lucky day!",1
"omg this game is amazing. i really havent played many of the other civilization games so i guess i can say this is my first. if youre the type of guy that likes to run an empire through different eras, then this is the game for you. i must say i had my doubts when i bought this game, but it is so addicting when you get into it. (if youre into these kind of games that is)",1
"time consuming but incredibly fun strategy game which has the ability to take hours and make them feel like minutes.",1
"judaism foundation in istanbul? chingis-khan has nuclear bomb and treating caesar with it? why not, it is civilization.",2
"all-time classic. each installation in the series has been a welcome change and re-balance to the consistently addictive gameplay.",1
"always fun. can put it down and pick it up whenever and ill have a good time",1
"do you have a free weekend or no job? do you enjoy sitting in a chair beind a screen for extended periods of time? maybe you are 14? possibly 25 and no job and your mom doesnt bother you much? well, civ 5 is the game for you! watching small groups of people inhabit a hexigon and watching other people invade other hexigons is a blast. youll need to beat your wife and kids so they know not to bother you. order pizza turn off your phone and let the magic happen. you cant stop this. this game will end relationships.",1
"this game is crap, crashes every 10 turns or so. its not worth the money i paid for it. fail sid fail",1
"one of my favorite games of all time. i definitely recommend the complete edition as the game is not nearly as good without the gods and kings and brave new world expansions",4
"amazing game, already 400 hours logged and i havent had it a year. tremedous replay value. can`t wait for beyond earth.",3
"this game would be awesome if the ai had a brain instead of a cheat button",1
"love the game and have loved it since civ i. played all through out my life and get hooked each and every time i start it up",1
"i have put so much time into this game. the civ series always delivers.",1
"civilzation is most definatly one of my favorite strategy games. civ v is a wondeful game, with drastic improvements from civ iv, while still keeping the core gameplay. but to get the full experiance, you really need to get your hands on the big dlcs. these really help the game out, changing how the game is play from the plain version. the only gripe i have about it is the graphics are way more over the top then it should be. yes they are nice, but for one who has a  pc like i, its irritating and slows my game down, making a 5 hour game into a 2 day game.",2
"this game actaully relates a lot to history, not only as the people you play and the items they use,but making dicisions that lead to war, and who you can trust really, as when i have ww1 lessons in school i really thought about how i went threw some of that through this game. its just a fantastic game,so go get it.",1
"fun game tht can last for hours! great for when nothings going on and you want to have some fun either alone or with friends!",1
"civ 5 is the perfect game to play if youre going to be stuck on a desert island for 20+ years if you some how end up with a working computer.",2
"one of my favorite games allthough i dont like the mass-dlc crap and the kinda expensive mini-addons.. if you happen to be able to pick up the gold version + brave new world you will have a great experience once you overcame the entrance to the game and understand how it works :).",1
"best version of civ yet. if you want a faster game i would recommend turning off brave new world though.",3
"single player is fun, i have been playing it a lot the past week and even though i feel like i still dont get everything i dont have to in order for it to be fun. after getting a really good deal for the game and all existing dlc, i feel like i havent even scratched the surface in things i can do. only major complaint i have is that players online suck. not as players, though they will mostly pick overpowered civs to try to compensate for something... no... as people they do. they will quit the first time something doesnt go their way (lose units to barbarians cause they are being dumb, lose out on a world wonder they were building, etc) to the point where you are playing against all ai before you can even build up an army to face the other civs. that takes all the fun out of trying to play online.",2
"i love civilization v. it is the most addictive game i have ever played.",1
"so many hours of my life have been stolen by this game series. damn gandhi with all his nukes... risk+chess+stratego+computer=this game",1
"i have to say that after two purchase, i cannot play yet. the game is not opening in the full screen and i cannot access the button to push truough the initial screen menu i have checked everywhere in the manuals, but no hope. for few months worked properly, then suddenly it stopped to function, and even i purchased an expansion, so to eventually have the chance to have the inital setting back, it doesnt work.",1
"although most games (within this game), start out slow, the late game is fun, and too fast. use nukes to destroy armies, and pollute your enemies lands. use killer robots to walk through people. maybe start early and use knights to destroy warriors. the game is very fast for the skilled, and very slow to the beginners. dont let that scare you though, slow beginnings only strengthen you for the quick ending, youd rather fight off.",1
"beware! you will lose all sense of time and waste many hours. 8/10 hours wasted, would recommend",4
"i love this game, one of the best strategy games i have ever played.",1
"great game, the best game i have played on steam so far. get it!",1
"civilization v is one of the most interesting strategy games ive ever seen! this game gives you absolute freedom. you can build anything you want, you can conquer any country you want, you can buy everything and everybody (yeah) you want, you can explore new territories, you can create your own great empire. dont know how to start? your councillors will give you some advice. dont want to play it only by yourself? you can take your friends to play with you. moreover, everything is accompanied by various sounds; figures are not static. and what i found really good is that you dont have to do boring quests like:build 10 factories and 5 farms, because you decide what to do by yourself. i think that everyone, who like strategy games, should try this one. it worth every penny (btw, it isnt expensive at all).",1
"be me, gamer with friends all buy civ v during holiday sale because 10foreverything.tif play it twice in the course of a month, one friend plays it quite a bit and gets fairly decent host a lan, friends come over boot up civ.exe attempt to recreate all the actions from world war ii something goes awfully wrong when germany steals nuclear fission from the us mfw in a matter of 6 turns the world is annihilated and the fuhrer stands tall and dominant 10/10",1
"this is a wonderful game! love to point and click my minions to seek and destroy!",1
"2 hrs in: just one more turn. 6 hrs in: ...just one... yeah... one more turn. 12 hrs in: ....just.... one.... more.... turn!....",1
"og god, ill just say: most complex and epic turn based strategy game, both for singleplayer and multiplayer ever. you want to buy civ. beyond earth? go ahead, ahve fun. but buy this one first. it is not just a classic, it is a must have must play for any turn based strategy enthusiast. manage culture, military, economy, social, diplomacy, religion, strategial and limited resources and much more. go nuts!",1
"no other game quite matches civilization for the level of revilement and repulsion instilled in my partner whenever i play it. i say, one more turn, aware of the damage my lies will cause. she will say, ill leave you! ill call her bluff and hold out my non-dominant hand, looking away from the screen only between turns. shell plead, at least eat something! ill devour whatever meagre portion of food she gives me. assignments become secondary. work becomes secondary. life becomes secondary. holding your bladder for 15 straight hours isnt normal, on civilization it is. 10/10 would destroy life again.",2
"if youre getting this, make sure to pick up brave new world. the gods and kings expansion has basically been worked into it (with a ton more content). the extra civs you can live without, but make sure to pick up some form of expanded game. the base game is a bit flat.",2
"one of the best games i have ever played, it constantly introduces new ways to be fun, and allowes for several hundred gaming hours. civ has a single player that on its own is amazing and also has a multiplayer that is massively fun. 10/10",3
"only play if you intend to not do anything else for the next day or two. its addicting.",1
"10/10 when playing singleplayer because theres no one to wait for. 0/10 when playing multiplayer because theres everyone to wait for.",1
"beautiful and intrigiung game. highly recomend for all audiences.",1
"amazingly fun and addictive. splurge yourself and get brave new world. its seriously the best.",4
"cant stop playing! this game is just awesome. buy it now if you dont have it, you wont regret it.",1
"this game is unbe.lieveable. if you like stratagy, well it just never ends... and i mean that literally, i dare you to sit down with friends and finish one game.... i dare you",2
"ever felt like you want to be a king? a president? & a ruler? this game will really make you feel like it. a 10/10 strategic game for me. the best strategic game ever! this game will never make you feel bored due to its gameplay. will make you think for hours and not a game for a no-brainer!",1
"addictingly brilliant. ive lost entire days playing this, and i have no intentions of stopping anytime soon. each playthrough, leader, map, and (perhaps most wonderfully) mod, presents a new an unique experience.",1
"have you ever wanted to knock in swedens  as japan? conquer the world as germany by the year 2013? buy this game and sink so many hours into it, you wont possibly have buyers remorse. so much fun, so much.",1
"this game is like a more complex settlers of catan!",1
"just... one... more... turn... this game is amazing but if played multiplayer you will learn which of your friends are warmongering ninnybunnies.",1
"a true classic for all strategy lovers. ive never seen a game so complex and amazing looking. the movements are smooth but later in game the game start to slowly get an fps drop due to the vast amount of units. i guess that is natural, as most games would fail to get that right as well. the ai is smart, difficulty is at the right level to what you choose... maybe a little too good.",2
"as it turns out if you buy the base game you are only buying 1/4th of it. the rest is included in dlc...",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. play it on the weekend otherwise you will wake up late for work or school scored it for 10 on summer sale, win!!!",1
"hands down: best civ ever! and it gets better with every expansion pack. never played civilization? then you missed out on a lot. but dont worry, just start with civ v, its awesome.",4
"this game shows a lot of different ways to improve your own civilization, i think that everyone have to try this game.",1
"its fun fun fun and more fun. you will play the whole day and you will still want more siv.",1
"do not buy if you have a career, friends and/or a girlfriend/boyfriend.",1
"countless games later, one more turn still becomes 3 am already!?",2
"great game, owned the x-box civ revolution first but this version is much better and more in depth. have had lots of fun playing by myself, and with friends. the hotseat multiplayer can be lots of fun!",1
"this is one of those games that everyone on steam needs to have in their library if you dont already have it as your most played game.",1
"a worthy sequel to sid meiers epic game saga. the only short-coming is its lack of some specialized features (espionage, religions, political variety, ...) compared to civ iv & expansions, but im sure firaxis will sooner or later provide such through dlc or civ v expansions.",3
"everything you have come to expect from a great 4x game. itd be nice if the ai was a bit more capable/varied, and there was some way to finish a multiplayer game in less than a month.",2
"i find only the beggining of every civ game to be interesting, the rest is pretty much always the same and can get boring. the game really needs all the dlc to shine and mods can make it much more fun. i do recommend the game.",1
"an utter piece of  unless you have every piece of dlc, especially gods and kings as well as brave new world. with these dlc, the game goes from being an abomination to an actually fun sequel to the brilliant civ iv. it has its issues even with all the dlc and patches, but there is definitely still a lot of fun and enjoyment to be had with it.",2
"civilization v is sort of like a time machine.. you start playing friday night ---> you look up and its saturday morning.",1
"fun game, but my friends are  and never stick with a game. 0/10",1
"i found this game extermely fun and also time consuming. it is like most games of this nature but more about being the better culture and not just an all out war, even though it can be. its a really fun and enjoyable game and it never gets old because there is always something new in every game. only drawback for me is how slow the beginning of the game takes.",1
"with all the expansions and dlc, this iteration is finally living up to the name civilization. although very different from earlier games in the series, it retains the depth, character, and addictiveness. my only disapointment is with the lack of completely game-changing mods that made civ iv into such a wide platform. overall, id recommend it with all expansions to any strategy gamer who hasnt already picked it up.",2
"it took me a while to get used to the whole turn based thing, but now i realize that its addicting as hell and therefore great for the developers, so thumbs up for that. unlike other strategy games ive tried its not that much to organize and gather, which makes it easier to focus on the strategy/occupying land/backstabbing/building armies part  and i guess that deserves a thumbs up as well. and as others already pointed out: beware of gandhi.",1
"i can get lost in this game! hold on...where im i? holy moly! where the hell am i?!",2
"great strat game. not a lot differnet then civ 4, but still enough to warrent a buy.",2
"average time spent per login: 500 minutes straight buy this .",3
"one of the mst fun rts ive played in a long time.",1
"dominated gandhi and george washington in the same turn. 11/10.",1
"one of my favourite games of all time. the content in the vanilla game is huge but pair that with g&k and bnw expansions and the game has the most content i think i have ever seen.",1
"it is an amazing turn-based strategy game where you can build empires and fight other empires for their land and property. it is amazing for its science aspect where you can build spaceships. it is good for making decisions that will change your empire.",1
"i got sid meiers civilization v a bit ago and i have to say that it is probably the best game i have ever played! it has hours upon hours of singleplayer gameplay, hotseat and multiplayer. it also has one of the greatest selection of mods to choose from with the downside that some may require a dlc which is fine since the dlcs themselves are a great and worthwile purchase. 9.5/10",1
"this game is very, veeery addicting. gandhi nuked me, 23/10, valve no not nerf.",1
"very nice strategic game. i like the historic part.",1
"as adictive as civ 2 and has better rules and graphics. i still miss the live-action advisors, however, and the advisors in this game are pretty useless. that said, buy it and kiss multiple nights goodbye.",1
"this is the most addictive game ive ever played. anyone who wants to rule the world needs this game!!!!",1
"if you like history and ghandi acting like an a*hole, sid meiers civilization v was made for you!",1
"although this is one of my favorite games, if you dont currently own it, i would hold off. the one main reason is that the dlcs are moneygrabs (but dont get me wrong, they really change the gameplay of the game). if you love strategy games then this one would be perfect for you. in hindsight, i would have waited to but it (i bought the gold edition) simply because they continually release dlcs that arent the cheapest (for example: brave new world and gods and kings)",1
"i have discovered i have led i have conquered i have inspired i have built a civilization to stand the test of time what your civilization stand for?",2
"i dont know much about the civilization series as a whole but i have played civilization revolution (i know some dont consider it apart of the series) on the xbox 360 and the game stays true to what it is all about, that one more turn addiction, and single matches that can go on for weeks to months. i highly recommend this game to fans of strategy with the new hexes instead of the usual average tiles and the elimination of stacking units. to fans of the series you probably already bought it and to those who arent particularly a fan of strategy still try the demo im sure youll find something good on it that will keep you hooked.",1
"most likely the best game i have ever played on the pc. its great when you play it sp because you get to try the game out, and figure out how the victories and different types of units work. but mp i find is the best because well with random people i find it ruins it because they are extremly aggresive and are usually unreasonable and more but with a friend games can last hours if played right. overall just great graphics, great gameplay and great game.",3
"civilization v is probably the best balance of in depth customization mixed with easy accessablility. it can be as hard as you want it to be, or it can be very easy to allow you to learn the mechanics. ive played through a few games, and im very impressed with the way this game feels and plays. i know when it comes to civilization games, nostalgia runs wild and everyone always thinks the older ones are superior. but i honestly think, combined with at least the gods and kings expasion, this is the best civilization game to date. if youre interested in this game, you have to at least get the gold edition. this game feels pretty incomplete without the gods and kings expansion, but with it, it feels perfect. i havent gotten brave new world, but i hear it is amazing. anyway, civilization v is highly recommended by me, and should be picked up by any strategy/civilization fan.",1
"best game ever! if you love strategy games this is for you! it is great to play with a table of friends too!",3
"i love this ing game.its history but ing fun as hell!!!!!!!!!1",1
"this could have been an excellent game, but bugs and poor ai make it boring after a couple of games.",3
"awesome game! 100/10 endless possibilities to your civilizations and hundreds of hours of replay value",1
"one of the best games ive played in a while! good graphics, good ai and solo gameplay. the new expansion only increases the amount of replay value this game has to offer!",1
"just one more turn. thats the phrase the has been uttered by almost everyone who has ever played a civ game. this game is no exception. the music is tailored to the civilization you play, the graphics are beautiful, the strategy is intense. you will find yourself plotting your next victory, whether it is through military force, economic maneuvering, or scientific research. different ways to win or lose, so position your forces and click next turn.",1
"i nuked gandhi. killed millons of people. wiped out entire civilizations. mowe(e)d down armies with superior technology. did`nt feel bad about it. then i got back to real life. ate something. walked in the nature. accidentaly broke a little stick on the ground. thats something i feel bad about.",2
"ahh civ. time vampire extraordinaire... not much to say about the fifth installment if you already know the series other than: a) get both expansions, they add largely essential systems into the game (religion, tourism etc) you can usually pick them up in a sale somewhere for pretty cheap now. and b) picture the scene...its 4am, the curtains are still open...it must be getting light soon. the birds are chirping in the trees. you havent moved in the last 8 hours, those chores you were going to do, yeah, umm maybe tomorrow...you should probably think about going to bed, but.... eat my nukes ghandi!!. yep. that still happens, so 10/10. daylight, exercise, proper diet, sleep patterns, theyre so overrated anyway.",1
"this game is rather exquisite. it inspires me to raise an army and conquer the world with brute force. thank you for your time.",1
"there is a reason i have over 200 hours played on this",2
"still the greatest time sink you will find on steam.",1
"civilization v is a very tactical game filled with fun and excitment as you take your turn. i suggest any of you who are a fan of strategy games or conquering things :3 i give it a good 9.5/10",1
"with the brave new world expansion it became the best civ game to date. i cant stop playing it! one... more... turn... damn! its 7 am in the morning!",3
"ghandi started a war with me because i did not give him sugar. 10/10 would not give sugar to ghandi again",1
"this is one of the best turn based-strategy games i have ever played and i am so happy i paid such a low price for it :d",1
"very addicting, fun, makes you think, worth every penny.",1
"sooooo the other day me and a few friends decied to play a game of civ. and after a bit i looked at how long we were playing and it said 1023 minutes which is roughly 17 hours... i guess time does fly when youre having fun!",1
"this is the most fabulous game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"great stragedy game. its going to take you a day or so to complete one country.",1
"this is a wonderful installment to the civilisation franchise ive played civ iv and this to me is a big step up in graphics and depth of play and i love the expansitions mostly the bnw because for the 98 i played the civ brave new world i felt the connection that i had to that game. i would happily keep buying games like these and even more from civ",1
"intensely fun if you like turn based race games of which this franchise began (as far as i remember from my youth). a little buggy, but not so bad that it detracts from the game once you get in. in game animations go away durring multiplayer mode, which annoyed my brother but didnt bug me.",1
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",2
"its civ. if you like to conquer and rule countries, maybe even the world, youll enjoy the game. if you like to shoot things, try something else.",1
"once you understand all the ins and outs, it can be quite humorous.",1
"very fun game. requires a lot of strategy, and is a great time waster (not that its a waste of time). really good mods, also.",2
"absolutely worth the money ! make sure to get all the expansions though, they improve the game in so many ways.",2
"i like this game, but they need to fix teh problem where if you are playing online with friend, and you leave then join again the its says please wait. this is extremly ennoying speaking i played 8 hours for nothing. dear sid meier, fix this damn problem.",1
"if youre bored and need something to do for a couple of weeks, civ 5 is the game you need",1
"yes, this game will remind true fans of minecraft. build, fight, and become king of the world.",1
"have only played in local co-op and have enjoyed that, will probably make further comments as i play in sp. have satellite for internet so that does limit my games that i can play.",1
"anyone that tries to play this game competitively is literally the worst person",2
"you begin to play your first game of civ 5, curious. after a few hours, you are pleasantly surprised. you finish, and you are addicted. this game will consume you. its strategy... you say to yourself, attempting to justify the days you spent attempting to keep ai citizens happy. 100+ hours later, you look back and wonder, why didnt you just play tf2? 10/10 must buy immediately.",1
"the game is fun, but there are so many bugs. half the times i try to install this game it just crashes after the intro movie. a google search reveals that this is a common problem but no fix has been found. waste of money when it only works half the time.",1
"if u havnt heard of the civ series where have u been, this turn-based rts game is so hype hours ive spent makin the best empire i can, such a great game... .....just one more turn then ill go bed....",2
"addicting strategic game, will keep you busy for hours.",1
"nuking my best friends when they are 3 ages below me its a feeling like your a god.",1
"its a good game. why? -it takes away 3 gb free space from your hard drive -it makes you experience feelings youve never experienced before as you watch the city you spend 9 hours building gets destroyed by enemy forces -what, real life? is that a server? -you can get nuked by ghandi -you can nuke ghandi back so overall great game, should play it.",1
"fun, turn based strategy-game taht all should own. can be annoying (having some one build a wonder that you had one turn left on or having a friend back stab you), but is an enjoyable game that has endless possibilites. want expansions sooo bad. the complete edition pack looks like a very good deal. love civ!",2
"this game alone is amazing. i have always loved this genre of games, i remember being very young and playing age of empires 2 and 3. well, theres that and then there is civ. its amazing the amount of customization that is available to the player. you can quite literally be the leader you choose to be and if when you win you waant to change that you can always continue playing after you win. however, i do recommend that you get brave new world expansion as it adds things to the game that make the game seem so much more superior when you are using it.",2
"civilization is, by far, the greatest strategy franchise of all time! and civ 5 just adds to the greatness of the franchise. i highly recommend this game, but be prepared to lose a big chunk of your life, because i know youll be hooked.",1
"an extremely addictive game, will have you playing for hours!",2
"i gave ghandi truffles, he gave me nothing to call home. 10/10 would ghandi again",1
"amazing strategy game! it is the -child of aoe ii and starcraft, even though it is turn-based. i would highly reccommend playing with a group of friends as playing ai can get monotonous, however it is still very enjoyable. dont feel bad if you lose on higher difficulties though, it will happen often before you find your favorite civ and play-style.",2
"you can spend absolute hours in this game thinking how to fight that one invasion off, how to deal with that one other player or what to build next in this one city.",1
"how can i write a review if i dont own the game pls explain. 10/10",1
"i fng love this game. it is awesome, spent hours loving this game. japans samurai are awesome.",1
"vary good game not hard for new people to civ and vary fun you old ones to. i say all should get this game",1
"i liked civ iv more, but v is also nice. and it has a better fighting-system.",1
"if you buy it, get at least one of the expansion packs. vinalla game is kinda meh.",2
"0 out of a million i have to pay money to play sweden",1
"played a game at 2 pm, was not even halfway done at 12 am! very fun, and time will fly.",1
"this is simply a master piece, with unlimited replay value and outstanding complexity, this game could just be the end of all other games.",2
"sid meier has been providing excellent turn based strategy since the release of civilization in 1991. civilization 5 is no different. civilization continues to expand upon this great franchise. i recommend everyone gives this game a try. visuals- 90/100 gameplay- 95/100 audio/sound- 92/100 overall- 92%",1
"addictive fun that will cause you to sink hours of your life into it. the gradual but constant progression means that you almost always feel like your about to reach a stopping point in game resulting in you playing just one more turn and before you know it its morning. advised not to be played if a deadline is coming up.",4
"on multipayer you get rage inducing crashes, eternal loading times, corrupted saves and a lot of infuriating little problems, but if you have the patience to sit throug that, this is an awesome game that will suck a lot of time out of yor life",2
"one of the best strategy/turn based games ever. it is complex at first, but it truly shines once you grasp all of its mechanics. additionally, the expansions add needed depth in combat, diplomacy and trade. brave new world improves the gameplay significantly whereas gods and kings did not add much to the game.",1
"a lot of fun. make sure to keep it on prince/king since there needs to be a challenge. i find that randomizing everyhting really makes it exciting.",1
"really the best strategy game, and with the expansions, my favorite in the civilization series.",2
"you will not realize you put a week into this in one sitting until you die of thirst. yeah, its that addicting and absorbing.",1
"try to befriend washington => instant 100 tons of democracy and freedom straight to your homeland try to befriend gandhi => oh look your land is so green , mind if i make it greener ? with my nukes of course >:d try to befriend catherine => boobs try to befriend gajah mada => instant hinduism and 300 candis all round you try to befriend napoleon => horses !!! i demand horseesssss!! try to befriend oda nobunaga => kamikazee banzaaaiiiiiiii !!!!!!!! 11/10 would befriend catherine again",1
"excellent game. i always seem to end my gaming sessions with one more turn that turns into another hour played.",1
"i dont understand how this game can be one of the most popular strategy games... its s-h-i-t... im not kidding, awful hexagone-style gameplay, didnt like it at all, but i have to admit that in the beginning when i first tried it out, i liked the diplomacy aspect of the game... the rest.. no so much",1
"extremely in-depth and a tremendous amount of fun solo, or with friends. i highly recommend picking this up, however, add it to your wishlist first because you can have steam email you when this goes on a sale which is every 2 minutes.",1
"its deep. its captivating. its made me neglect husband, children, home and work. i love it.",1
"excellent turn based strategy game, cant recommend it enough.",4
">buys game >decides to play for 2 hours to see if its cool >builds some buildings >conquers asshat napoleon >realizes i have been playing for 5+ hours. 10/10 would play again",2
"hours upon hours of playing. 10/10. would play again.",1
"really nice game, and the game mechanics are interesting",1
"ive lost many hours of sleep to this game. very fun.",1
"just an amazing very calming game, very fun to play with friends and you can mod it to hell in both single and multiplayer.",3
"civ 5 is very addicting because you all ways think one more turn then ill save and quit, but like 100 turn later your still thinking that. overall very fun. one problem is you dont get the brave new world dlc in the golden addition which disappointed me.",1
"take over the world. mess up anyone who dares cross your borders. 10 out of 10.",1
"it can be a very fun game despite the casual graphic and run time error. i would consider it ... 7/10",1
"incredibly in depth rts game. requires a lot of thought if you dont want to lose and can be both easy and hard, both long games and short games, and both simple and complex. incredibly fun and very relaxing to sit back with a drink and snack and play. very good game.",1
"i can lose entire weekends in this game. its a must have.",2
"if this game was a potato, then it would be a good potato.",1
"a work of art. sid meier once again hits a homerun with this amazing game, which gives a better and more extensive expreience than its predicessors. 10/10, would buy again.",1
"with 300+ hrs playing this game, i assure you that you wont get fed up with the gameplay. try yourself with playing on immortal or deity for maximum challenge!",2
"it starts off as a work in progress but in the end it is something i am beginning to love. this is as a first time civ player.",1
"this is my first steam review for one of three steam games i own. anyway, i like playing the hell out of this game. it works like coffee.",1
"a very solid successor to the civ series, with excellent polish available in the expansions and a vibrant modding community.",2
"this game turns the phrase just one more turn. into the biggest 5 hour lie youve ever told. you will think, ill just fire up civ v and play a few turns before bed. at 10pm and the next thing you know, its 5 in the morning. even if turn-based strategy games arent normally your thing, you should still play civ v. its that good.",1
"love this game, reccomend you to buy both gods&kings and brave new world.",2
"this game is a true must-have for any pc gamer. i read an article, i believe on pc gamer, that said that this is one of three must-haves for any pc gamer, and i agree. the addictiviness of empire building in a stregy setting may not be readily apparent to the average gamer, and i must admit, i was skeptical the first time i heard of this game. but then i played it. and i fell in love. the depth of the simulation is offset by the simplicity of the interface of the game, and it can be as in-depth as you want it to be, allowing it to be a deep, hardcore government strategy game fore the more hardcore fans of the genre, or a simplistic delve into some fun empire building for the more casual. 0 outta 5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"if someone asked me what game i would reccomend to introduce them to pc gaming, i would immediatly reccomend this. this has been one of the more involving and rewarding games i have ever played, and would reccomend it to anyone. i will go ahead and say that if you have never played a similar game to this before, there is a pretty steep learning curve that will at first be overwhelming, but power through and you will understand why this game recieves such high praises.",1
"very addicting, time consuming game, but it is very fun overall",1
"dear college students... dont! ... or prepeare to see your time vanish",2
"this game is amazing. complex at first, the game has a good tutorial that explains the main concepts. the game has lots of layers and multiple ways to win, either through, science, culture, and diplomacy, or war and domination. this enables you to not always crush everyone, but to be diplomatic or be more cultural/scientific. your social policies can give you edges in certain areas of your civilization, and often one thing is connected to another. more science research means better army which leads to more diplomatic power and so on. only negatives are that sometimes the worker automation does not work and that one game can take days to finish. multiple characters and dlc enable endless replayability without the game becoming boring. overall, a great game.",1
"this is a great game and i think its the one of the best games out there",4
"i installed the game one evening looking for a few hours of fun. i checked my phone at 3am only to realize it was actually 8am and the sun was peeking up over the horizon. oh god, what have i done?",1
"a horribly addicting game. hours upon hours lost to this game.",2
"this is a great game :d addictive... played for five hours and didnt even notice that :)",1
"i give this game a 9/10 i spent countless hours playing this time sucking game, and i loved every bit of it. there were a few bugs here and there but nontheless, great game!",2
"very good game, and with the dlcs its even more fun!!!! for a great price so much fun????!!!! and certainly with a sale!!!!",3
"this is the best investment ive made on steam so far. ive put 60+ hours into this game and im still hooked. playing as different civilizations and using different strategies creates endless possibilities and keeps things fresh. amazing game. 9.5/10.",1
"this a highly fun and addicting game. it is a little different from civ 4 like getting rid of health of cities ( sadly ) and the stacks of units ( thankfully ). i also recommend getting the expansion packs as they add much more bulk to the game ( more diplomacy , international trade , religion , etc. ) 10/10",3
"this game is probably the best turn based strategy game of all time. civ 5 has so many victory options and so much replayability. (though military domination is the most fun in my opinion) there are also many great mods for civ 5. if purchased i definitely reccommend starting on warlord/ chieftain difficulty to get your bearings.",2
"very good game. it has brought me lots of joy and fun. if you are looking please get this game it is amazing.",3
"civ v is a fantastic strategy game. plenty of depth with nearly unlimited replayability. definitely worth a look if your into taking over the world.",1
"i bought uranium from the japanese and used it to build a nuke and used that nuke on them, god its good to be an american 10/10.",1
"this is a game you can easily lose a day too. 4x games always look incredibly boring too watch but once you start playing one you just cant stop. gods and kings and brave new world are pretty much required too get as the base game was a little too basic. the five different victroy types make finding new strategys all the more fun.",1
"civilization v is one of best strategy games around, its a great game and wether your playing with friends or on you own its fun, although the multiplayer is a bit iffy and it can be a little un realistic but alot of fun i recomend",2
"the mayans sent missonaries to take over my cities with religion,.. i murdered them with wooden boulders and catapults.",1
"sid meiers civilization v is the best strategy game currently on the market. civ v is a game of economy, science, culture, diplomacy and warfare. this turn-based strategy game was originally a board game and is worth buying and getting dlc for.",3
"heres the concept - you get to be the english empire(other inferior civilizations are available) and take over every other civilization in the world. also, sometimes you get to have what can losely be called a war with the french. this is a must have game, it is genuinely fun with friends and even singleplayer.",1
"i spent like 40 hours playing this game in the first 3 days. the variety of civilizations and their characteristcs fused with the game concepts itself will make you spend hours instead of minutes you intended to. i strongly not recommend for those who has limited time to play or has some work to do.",3
"this game really drove the sid meier experiance home. sometimes whille playing i really did feel like i was becoming sid meier. its hands down the most realistic simulation game since fez ii so it was basically real life. at some points of game play i literally thought my name was sid meier, so that means the graphics in the game look so real that it makes you feel like youre in real life...for real. thats why i give this game: 8 cans of mountain dew / 3 family sized bags of doritos. graphics:real life gameplay:1 commentary:63 directors cut:9.9999999 story: dank/10 verdict:yea",2
"super involved and very deep. can be daunting to get into, but once in, the largest time suck you will ever encounter. 9/10",1
"great game to play with friends whether youre in a friendly helpint mood or want a mock war. also a great way to learn a few facts about world civilization. great game for those who love stategies.",2
"best civ game yet, i keep coming back to it for endless hours of fun both alone and with friends. if you enjoy turn based stratey games spanning the entirety of the human race, civ v is the game for you.",2
"great game if you are looking for a game you can invest time in, would reccomend that you get the gold edition for the gods and kings dlc.",1
"one unit per hex, combined with the fact that a nations capital has the same size as a company of archers makes for unintuitive cringe-worthy gameplay. on the plus side it looks good enough to make civ iv annoying to play.",1
"this game is amazing. nothing else needs to be said.",2
"i personally enjoy this game very much and find it fun to play, the graphics are pretty good and it doesnt get boring.the only problem i have with it is the builder automation wont build roads as it did in civilization 4.all in all that is just a minor inconvenience and almost everything else about this game has been improved from civilization 4.",1
"this game can be summed up in one phrase: one more turn! so addictive that this one quote will be repeated so many times you wont even notice. awesome graphics, animations and soundtrack and one of the few games that not only welcomes but encourages the use of mods, adding massive amounts of gameplay to a game that already can give hundreds of hours of entertainment on its own.",2
"four words on why everyone should get this game: nukes and death robots",1
"civilization is a series that needs no introduction. civilization v and its dlc is a turn based strategy game that allows you to take control of a civilization from ancient times through out history and into the future. alot of the micromanagment from previous civ games has been done away with and the game has been made very comprehensive and user friendly for someone who has never played a civ game before so dont worry about being over whelmed. will you conquer your way into the history books? or will you be known as a diplomat, or scientific civilization? time will tell in civilization v.",1
"im new to turn-based strategy games, and i really love this. granted, i mostly play against the ai, but it can still be very challenging. i like that i dont need to form a group before deciding to play. and when i do play with friends, its a fun race to see what will happen.",3
"this game has taken away my life, its highly addictive and therefore much enjoyable. o wait, its my turn again, gotta go!",2
"maybe not as groundbreaking as civilization iii or maybe even iv? however, this one is much friendlier to those new to the series, and stil appeals to those longtime players. you will be wanting one...more...turn...",2
"not worth it. stay with civ 4. i tried to like this game, but its not catching on. civ 4 had more polish and was a very good game, civ 5 even with the expansion packs just does not compare to civ4.",1
"even if every atom that ever has and ever will exist could be broken down and reformed into a giant, all encompassing picture of me rolling my eyes, it would still not adequately convey the contempt i feel for this game. jon shafer, burn in hell.",2
"i would greatly recomend this game for anyone who enjoys turn based strategy games. youll find yourself addicted to it in a matter of minutes, trying to become the worlds most cultural and military dominate empire. if you are not a patient person however you probably will not enjoy this game, because it takes alot of waiting and planning before you make your next move.",1
"it is almost physically impossible to get bored of this game. the community keeps giving and the workshop has a lot of good items in it.",2
"scroll back up the page and just buy the game 8/8 m8",2
"even though a bit old, sort of fun in singlplayer, very fun in multiplayer. i would advise getting gods and kings or brave new world, as they fix some stuff. (liberty being op)",1
"one of my all time favourite games to play on steam",2
"civilization v is honestly one of my favorite stratigy games. it can be fun in single player but when you have friends to play with it gets even more fun. for anyone who likes a got stratigy game then this is a game you should have. there are quite a few difficulty levels you can choose from to make your game more challenging. you have to keep up with so many asspects at once that it can feel a bit overwellming your first few games, but you will get used to it. with the brave new world and gods and kings dlcs it can add a whole lot to the game and almost make you feel like your having to change your play style completly. overall i would recommend buying this game.",1
"latest edition in the fantastic civilization series, this one is just as good as the previous ones. varied victory objectives allow multiple strategies, and the option to play as many different nations with different abilities and units keep you coming back for more. the latest expansion, gods and kings, added the much needed religion feature to the game, making it, in my opinion, a complete package.",1
"i know a lot of people compared civ v unfavorably to civ iv when civ v first came out. as a long (and i do mean long) time player of sid meier civilization games, i never understood that as i had a completely different impression. to me this is one of the best civ games since civ ii and alpha centauri. it was a return to some of the basics that made the game great with a number of tweaks (hexogonal grid, no unit stacking) that i feel improve it. add in the additional options in the wonderful expansions and you have, in my opinion, an all-time classic. i recommend this for everyone.",2
"sid meiers (why is his name all over this?) civilization v is honestly one of the most fun turn-based strategy games i have ever played. if you have any interest in ancient cultures, i would highly recommend picking the game up. although it may feel rather simple at first, the game has a surprising amount of depth to it, and the multidue of victory conditions make almost any playstyle viable, once they have been fine-tuned. civilization v is not fast-paced, wont get your blood racing, and likely wont satisfy the gamer looking for a hardcore experience. instead, civilization v serves as a nice relaxing game that gives you time to think, a relaxing escape to wind down after a long day of work. just dont start playing right before you have someplace to be, because you will get sucked in to playing just one more turn. before you know it, its 6 a.m. and you have to go back to work.",2
"you might check the time and wonder if the last 12 hours of your life was worth it, it was! civ v is an amazing turn based strategy game that will entertain you for hours. try not to be too competitive when playing with friends though, it can get ugly!",2
"great game, and very fun to gather a lot of friends to play it with",1
"classic civilization revamped, the non-stacking units add a new and refreshing flavor to the battles and everything feels familiar despite the tweaks and upgrades done to the classic formula. worth trying for any civ fan, i dont regret a single penny i spent on this game.",2
"whenever i play this game i cant stop. maybe i have a problem.",1
"if you buy this game, you will slowly lose all connections with family and friends.....",2
"do not play this game, it will devour your life. it will pull you away from other games. it will pull you away from your family and friends. it will tear your soul apart!!!! 10/10",1
"worth every penny. 10/10, one of the best games of all time. if you havent picked it up, do so now.",1
"this game is definately built for people who went from risk to axis and allies because risk was too basic, then thought this isnt complicated enough either... that being said, i love it, 5 stars.",2
"civilization v is truely a new masterpiece. after playing over a hundred hours of the original game, i have since put more time into the expansions (which i highly recommend). while the game is not as in-depth as civilization 4, it certainly retains its fun and charm by making you want to click that turn button like a addict shooting dope. on another note, as of october 9, 2014 i have installed this game on my linux mint build to test the game on linux. it is far better than the windows version; mainly because the performance is much smoother and there is less cpu overhead from background processes. linux is a less demanding operating system, thus after 300 - 400 turns i have not experienced any sluggish behavior during turn cycles. this being said, i am quite pleased with how well aspyr media did on the job of porting this game. i give the windows version 8/10. i give the linux version 10/10.",2
"this game is a ton of fun if you like strategy. the original game is awesome but if you want the complete package get the two dlc packs to get religion and trading. if you like carefully avoiding war by keeping trade lines running between other civilizations or just want to crush everyone else on the map with blitzkrieg or nuclear warfare then this is the game to you. when the base game gets old(which it wont for a while) there are scenarios like the fall of rome or the civial war, and then there are tons of mods! truly an epic game for multiplayer or singelplayer. the only con i have is that games can take forever to get good.",1
"one of my favourite games!! 100% recomend you buy this game!",1
"this game is so addictive, 1 hour feels like 10 minutes",1
"got nuked by ghandi when i was still in the ancient era. 10/10",1
"it is good autism treament for my autism with autistic autists.",1
"games take forever, but even if you stop after 5-8 hours its still fun to do. great for everyone who likes to be able to fine tune forever.",1
"sid. meiers. civilization. i think that just about sums it up, doesnt it?",1
"this game couldnt be more addictive if it injected heroin into your bloodstream while it was massaging your balls.",2
"best strategy game ive ever played. 10,000,000,000/10",1
"the strategy game ive waited my whole life for. finally!",1
"following the release of brave new world, this is as addictive as ever, brave new world really fixed the end game which was somewhat lacking. the diplomatic victory is unfortunately still very easy to attain, so i leave that turned off, but the revamp of the culture victory with the introduction of tourism really helps the game where the culture system previously only really served to expand your territory.",3
"how can you not be overwhelmed by civilization v? its a perfect example of a series thats getting close to perfection, step by step. the new improvements are great and feel like theyve been there all along. a must-buy for the fans and a great way for newcomers to finally get familiar with the series.",2
"great game, but you really need both expansions to get the real deal",1
"this game gave me trust issues. f*ck you, egypt and arabia! 10/10 would play again",1
"this is the type of game that you will start playing one afternoon and dont notice how long youve been playing until the sun rises the next morning.",1
"so much fun, to play single and multiplayer, and if youre worried about not having enough time for a complete game, you can change the settings to accelerate turns and make you able to do more in them but less turns, it can easily cut game time to a third",1
"great game, will kill time immensily. great replay value a def. must buy.",1
"buy adult diapers, unless youre gonna save and go back to it like a",1
"fun, love the game, all the civilations have their own perks and i must try them all :d",1
"in this game you dont need money, you just need time, lots of time, lots and lots of time, or ghandi ing your  up.",1
"live the life of scrooge mcduck and play as venice",1
"its really great game with great music and gameplay!!! 10/10 its genius!",1
"i never would of thought this game would become one of my favorites of all time.",1
"its worth buying now that they have finally released the entire game, but buy it as a bundle.",1
"amazing strategy game, nothing bad to say realy however you need alot of spare time to complete a game.",1
"using mods, i can have big boss as a jedi conquering the world using culture whilst up against blasto the hanar, hatsune miku, cthulu and canada. best game",1
"this is a really fun game. i had only seen one civ game before (civilization revolution) and had only played it for a few hours and wasnt a huge fan of it. but this game is truly extroardinary. i didnt play turn-based strategy games before but know i do. definite buy. 12/10",1
"this game is like digital crack. as soon as you try it your hooked and sooner or later youll realise that its bad for you and pleadge to stop. you try  do you try but you always end up back here playing this game hour after hour thinking damn i need help. just as gandi nukes you",1
"if i could only play one and only one game for a year, this would be it. you will lose all your time playing this.",3
"beat up other civilizations. what else could anyone want?",2
"very fun strategy game recomend to people who enjoy learning about history or enjoy strategy games!",1
"a good strategy game unfortunatley kinda falls short to its predecessor without the brave new world expansion but with it, its much better.",2
"probably the most addictive game i have ever played. you keep thinking that next turn will be your last, but no! you just cant stop. very fun that your leader can live from 2000 b.c until the future which is about 4000-5000 years. also funny is that you can choose different religions to your city. for example- christianity in arabia and so on. 9/10 - cons: slow multiplayer players pros: probably everything",1
"one of the best strategy games on the market. you will definitely lose hours of your life and you wont even be mad.",1
"i would recomend starting at warlord difficulty for new peoples",2
"verry fun game. looks great,sounds good,music is award winning.",1
"this game is really fun for the stratgeists out there and can make some pretty intreasting fun if you have friends for multiplayer",2
"starting the game up saying to yourself gonna play for 1 hour. 25 hours later oh this hour went by quickly.",2
"gave gandhi some uranium and he used it to nuke me. 10/10 all jokes aside this is an amazing and addicting game that you have to play if you like strategy. you can make your own stories and tales by your choices. you can win by war or peace. if you do want to buy this game i recommend getting the expansions as they help balance and create more opportunities etc. real score: 9.5/10",1
"a great game for those who love strategy, the complex features of the game allow for addicting gameplay. it is interesting because it is so good yet i see so much more potential. it adds a layer of depth in many real life situations such as politics and military strategy.",2
"i enjoyed the game its got a decent amount of content dont buy any dlc untill you have maybe 20 hours on it to make sure you like it. i wont be buying the two major dlc in the forseable future because 30 dollars each isnt enough motivation for me. i anjoy the game but time passes far too quickly. i havent encountered many mods that actually work, if any. a good game but i only recomend it to already older strategy game fans.",1
"such a fun game, if you dont have it you should buy it :d",1
"this is, by far the best strategy game i own. on a whole, the range of victories, techniques, and the actual exploration/expansion abilities you are blessed with make it a brilliant turn based game. even on my failed victories, i still had tremendous fun, because i have to say, it is just enjoyable to build your own civilization. but, of course, it is even more enjoyable when your civiliazation has the power to crush all others! definately recommend, for hours of fun.",1
"create huge worlds and conquer the world without having to leave the house to start a third world war. its a very big and fun game. definitly worth a buy, especially when its for sale.",1
"there is a reason why civilization has defined the strategy game genre for over two decades. its not just because, like chess, its simple to learn and complex to master. its not that it brings out your inner ruler/warlord/diplomat like no other game. its because, in addition to all this, ruling an empire in civ is more fun than sitting naked in a roller-coaster and more addictive than heroin-induced coffee. in other words, playing civ is an experience. with civilization v, the series updates many stagnated issues (ref: unit stacking) and takes a leap into new areas (ref: social edicts). highly recommended, even for those who thought civ 4 was the high-point.",1
"fibl has publicly denounced civilization v, warning the world this game is not to be trusted!",2
"the best thing i liked about this game was the realistic approach towards battle and improvements in a country of your choice. if you have the dlc for this game it gets even better! not only does one understand and go through a learning process since the beginning of time and how war was waged and how countries and small states had alliances with each other but you get to make your decisions and they effect you in the long run. you can play a short game starting from the nuclear era and nuke cities and civilizations or you can go back all the way when iron and coal was found and work your way up into a new era! superb game with great and realistic rulers, buildings, monuments, wonders and warfare. a must if you like strategy games or were a fan of games like generals. but believe me, this is way ahead of generals or any civilization game you have ever played !",1
"civ v is great. although it seems blasphemous to say, i like the hexagonal tiles, the no-unit-stacking rule, the addition of a maintenance cost to roads, the ability of cities to defend themselves, and the various other changes relative to its predecessors. overall, civ v makes small actions (like connecting a city to your empires road network) seem significant and large actions (like building a wonder) seem genuinely game-changing. if you want the best experience i recommend getting the gods & kings expansion, which fine-tunes some mechanics, like civic policies, and adds others, like religion. religion, in particular, is much improved over civ iv.",2
"good game for people who like controling world! :d",1
"worth the money xd. still one of the best strategy games and definately the best game of 2012 and 2013.",2
"a great competative game to play against your friends! :d",1
"really good for wasting days when i should be working. if i didnt have this game i might actually have to do something productive...",1
"great game. basically the latest/best civ. only real negative for me is that they seem to have simplified diplomacy/trading (cant trade maps,etc..)",1
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played, although it does have a couple of bugs and glitches it is still fantastic, definitley worth the money.",1
"this is quite a heavy game to get into! there are so many ways to play, to win, and to build your civilization that youll go crazy if you try to formulate a single way to win every game. i really love the hexagonal grid that this game uses; it really sets this turn-based strategy apart from others. the hexagonal grid allows for much more movement and mobility than square tiles.",3
"good game, spent hours playing it to death. no regrets. the ai is somewhat stupid but the difficulty settings make it quite the challenge. lots of replayability and great multiplayer to go along with it.",5
"my new favourite strategy game! civ 5 offers a new experience every time you play. a ton of playable civilizations and lots of historical and fictional scenarios to attempt, as well as one of the best modding communities ive ever seen. firaxis prove once again they are the masters of strategy games.",1
"if you are looking for a good strategy game this one is perfect, even if youre not pick it up or try it you wont regret it. sid meiers civilization v is game based on creating a civilization to rule them all, for example: fight other civilizations out the way or even win by a cultural victory. first time im giving a score but: 9.8/10",1
"this game pretty much ruins my life in 12 hour chunks. by the end of a session, i hate myself. highly recommend.",1
"i love playing stratgy games and civ 5 is by far the most in depth. best graphics on a stratgy game other than rome total war 2. every game can be played differntly and stratigies vary so its all up to you.",1
"awsome, but could be improved upon. endless space is better",2
"this game is really amazing but i suggest you buy the dlc pack brave new world it adds a lot more to the game and it makes it more enjoyable to play overall...",1
"this is a good game once you get the hang of it fun solo and multiplayer",2
"needs all the dlc/extension to be really good. kinda disapointed by that. great game overrall",1
"great game. consuming all my free time. even better with brave new world!",1
"big fan of the game. very addictive, you spend most of your time going just one turn more.",1
"i have spend 200+ hours playing sid meiers civilization 5. it has got to be one of my most favorite games i have ever played. it has wonderful ways to play how you want to play and still have a fun time doing it.",2
"this games is one of the most addicting games out there. youll keep telling yourself just one more turn then you look at the clock and a few hours have gone by. its a lot of fun. positives: -provides hours of gameplay -no two games are exactly the same -big diversity in playable civs and units -city states are a cool feature -many diverse maps negatives: -computer controlled civs can be extremely irritating -happiness feature can also be irritating overall great game. highly recommended. also highly recommend getting the expansion packs as they make the game significantly better.",3
"i great strategy game that you chose the outcome of your civilization and others. i would highly recommend this game to anybody who wants to play a strategy game.",1
"have you ever played any turn-based strategy games? this is the best one since i became a gamer. from the idiom rome wasnt built in a day, its not true after you play civ5. build rome or other civilizations in 1 day (but i always spend 2 days in each games.), conquer the world with nuke or gigantic dead robot and stealth bomber, discover the ancient sites and collect artifacts, meet the world greatest people such as l.da vin ci, sir isaac newton, ludwig van beethoven and many!!! gather all wonders of the world and natural wonders in your cities. dont miss this and you will shout the sentence - give me back my time!!!! - out after playing this greatest turn-based strategy games ever!",1
"there are two kinds of players that love strategy games; the ones that love civilization and the ones that have not played it yet.",1
"fantastic game, so many civs you can play as. if you love strategy games then youll love this one. its great on its own but even better with the dlcs. it requires skill, patience and determination as theres many ways to win e.g. domination, culture, science etc.. i highly recommend it.",5
"this game sucks you in. like a black hole. a giant, scary black hole. youll be wondering at the end of the night how several hours have passed so quickly...",1
"very good successor to the civilization series. although severly broken upon release, later patches have increased the playability.",5
"one of the best strategy games i have played in a long time i would get it if you are a big fan of strategy 9/10",1
"after installing this game, i lost roughly 40% of my waking hours to world domination for a good two weeks. totally didnt need that sleep garbage anyway.",1
"this game is good, i reccomend it to anyone that wants to have a good time in bed with their mouse and keyboard.",3
"hours and hours of fun. apply strategy and tactics, almost unlimited scenarios and re-playability. with the mod and mapping communites this just keeps getting better. worth every dime, and so are the expansions. well done game, solid running too, this is not a buggy attempt but a well thought out design by some very talented devs and a mastermind of the genre behind it, sid meier.",3
"such a good game the dlc make the game feel completely different, would recommend it to anyone. nonetheless a great game overall",1
"great game, a just one more turn feel to it. i have been playing it since the first version and i still completely love it. i have been recommending it to the people i work with.",1
"one of the best strategy games of all time. would recommend to everyone.",2
"disappointing. the punchline is: its just not fun. i love 4x games, and i do sometimes play civ v, just to get my fix, but even with the newest expansion (brave new world). its not that fun. civ iv is better in almost every way. - interface is clunky. lots of information is hidden. e.g. a research treaty just finished - what did i get out of it? - diplomacy still feels weird. why must all deals be for a fixed period of time? why cant they be indefinate, for as long as you want? and with the ai being such an unreliable partner, playing the game of diplomacy just feels like a waste fo time. - resource usage feels arbitrary. why does a swordsman require iron, but not a submarine? ... and much much more. if youre new to 4x, you may enjoy this game, but if you want a game that makes sense, that is elegant, that balances strategy, complexity, and fun. this isnt it.",1
"napoleon offers me a deal. i accept it. he says it isnt good enough. this has happened 4 times. 10/10 would hate the french again.",1
"i dont think im smart enough to play this game. i want to, but i just think im too dumb.",1
"this game takes hours to complete a single match. once played a 6 player multiplayer with my friends, 8 hours later we were not past turn 150, granted some of them were new, but we just couldnt move it along any faster. i love this game, i just wish the multiplayer was somehow more efficient.",2
"i rarely enjoy strategical games in the long run. usually stop playin them after 1-2 hour of gameplay. but this game got me hooked, specially the online part of it. playin against or teamin up with friends is so much fun. this is not a game you wanna play 20 min before going to bed, you will sit all night long then xd quotin another reviewer: just one more turn..... ",1
"civ 5 is so addictive and so fun to play, i would definitely recommend purchasing it.",2
"spent plenty of time on this game, its an awsome time sink, definatly recommend.",2
"sid meier is back with civ v. after a rocky start with the base game, the two expansions gods and kings and brave new world add the meat back to the civilization hot pocket. recommended with gods and kings minimum.",1
"best strategy game. ive put tons of hours into this game. 10/10",2
"if youre a huge fan of the older civilization games you may be disappointed by the vast amount of changes they made in this installment of the series. i, however, loved all of the changes. the game feels sleeker, more streamlined and is just a lot more fun. whenever my friends and i start a game up together we find it hard to get off.",1
"civ v is relatively easy to get into, yet there is almost no end to what you can do in it. to be honest, i bought this game right when it came out because i somehow had it confused with simcity. i would definitely recommend this game.",3
"with all the available mods, its a never ending game.",1
"this game is a masterpiece. civilization v is just a great game which includes many great historical civilizations and their armies. this game is really strategic. anyone playing with friends will have a really good time.",1
"just a great game sort of like a dumbed down version of shogun and the total war series",1
"bribed city-states for a diplomatic victory, even though i killed one half of the map and the other half hated me. fun times.",1
"day 3: no food, no sunlight, and no water. ever since i got this game i cant stop playing. this game is too addicting. please help.",2
"this game was expensive, time consuming, and destroyed friendships bc my friends and i suck big weens (especially andrew bagel beard) 8/40 would double blaze squad wulf gang",1
"a very addicting game. just a great, wich you need to buy !!",1
"i think this game is really fun and really good. ive rushing like non-stop and its really addicting, my advise is buy all the dlcs like the brave new world dlcs its just amazing. btw this game is extremely easy to pick up for someone who never play turn base strategy games. hope u enjoyed it as much as i do",1
"this game is amazing. if you like those 3rd person world control games, like halo wars or command & conquer, this game is for you.",1
"best city building game which evens out between fighting for your cities and fighting to take over the world.",1
"tried to be diplomatic, tried to unite to world as one, tried to bring peace to all humanity and usher in a golden age of knowledge and prosperity. i tried. really i did. but then ghandi declared war on me and turned everyone against me. i had to nuke everyone. now im the last civ standing. that was my first game of civ 5. tenoutaten.",1
"this is one of the best strategy games ever. if you never played it, go play it now!",1
"when you start playing this game time gets away from you way too fast! excellent game cant wait for civilization: beyond earth",1
"find out exactly how constantinople got the works in this stellar 4x turn-based strategy game by firaxis.",5
"this game is awesome and it will keep you busy forever",1
"ive been playing civilization since the very first and i have to say this is the best one. for a game with the same core mechanics going back almost 20 years, it feels fresh and new. each different nation is unique enough to make you want to play through them all, and the game has kept its depth and difficulty while being easier to play at the same time. if you have ever enjoyed any of the civ games you will love this one.",1
"look, ive played this series since civilization ii back in the day of pixel sprites and beatles music. civ v, the latest installment is great. the base game is sort of lackluster compared to the complexities of civ iv, but gandk and bnw (the expansions) help to flesh out the gameplay and give it that true civ feel. do i recommend? yes, i do. a/5.",2
"they sold an incomplete game. its still fun at least.",1
"pretty good - i managed one complete playthrough during the free weekend. i always do the same thing with civ games... play it once, discover the entire tech tree, take over the world by force, and then never touch it again... until the next civ game",1
"absolutely perfect soundtrack, plenty of variety in your choice of strategy, a selection of leaders and civilizations that means every game can be completely different make this the perfect addition to the library of any fan of strategy or history",2
"great game meant to last a long time so dont suggest playing it all the way through. wonderful game though :d",1
"its wonderful and requires lots of strategy. very time consuming, but worth it.",3
"the best strategy game ever played. great on multiplayer, great on single player, i recommend definately giving it a try at least.",3
"yes. hell yes. but just a psa, you cannot save in the tutorial.",1
"you thought you were going to do something today? nope.",1
"every want to take over half a continent, or name all your cities tick? in this game you can, as you strategise on the plan for your civilization, wether it is building the notre dame or conquering every civilization in sight. it is rather hard to finish a game, one game can last for hours. i rate this 8 curries out of 10 curries",1
"civilization series were always the most addicting, difficult and rewarding games ever. civilization 5, alone or with gods and kings & brave new world is the most time consuming devil that posses your time and will never give it back. although your only way to resist is to click next turn and bring glory to your civilization. most complex game with many victory types, strategies, difficulty levels (from easiest for even strategy noobies to most experienced generales who were raised with rts by their sides), units, resources, everything... this game has everything that us - nerds love. and you can read a book in one time while playing on huge map around atomic era :d",1
"great game you can be friendy with your friends or kill them with your navy",2
"literally just random countries racing to space first no one even bothers to fight",1
"worst game to play if you want to lose hours upon hours out of your life! in other words, i like it! now to go conquer some continents.",1
"it was a beauty to play, cannot stress how much fun this game is. anyone looking to spend a good few weeks playing hours on end with their mates on this easy to understand game, i would reccomend to get this. will need to however consider getting a good pc, as i have found out that laptops are not ideal, however a normal desktop on a low setting will do just grand.",1
"its no 3 but its still better than 4. ghandi is a , btw. 10/10 would nuke him again.",1
"whether you like these types of games or not, this game will keep you up all night regardless. everybody i know, even all of my i only like call of duty because im a hardcore gamer friends enjoy this game. just get it.",1
"i originally got into civilization back when civilization revolution was free with games with gold on the 360. i decided to try it out, and loved it. ive wasted so many hours on that game, and i regret none of it. then, i find out that the game is part of a series. i can say that the discovery of civ 5 can only be equated to that of a divine revelation. i decided to get the complete edition when it was on sale, and the next thing i knew, i was obsessed and terrified of beloved historical leaders. the game is very well made, and not too difficult to learn how to play. after a game or two, i got the hang of things, discovered how to use trade routes and religions and such. so much time has been spent on this game. 10/10 would recommend. good gameplay, not too difficult to play, fun mechanics, hours upon hours of play.",1
"one of the greatest if not the best round based strategy game out there. be whoever you want to be. a cruel dictator, a merciful king or even gandhi. multiple options of victory and a coop mode. go and grab it! 9/10",2
"just one more turn i promise just one more and i am done. honestly.",1
"so far i like this game. its real easy to learn the game as well :0",1
"one unit per tile makes combat much better while turn times are awfully long. as long as i play on smaller than average maps its not too bothersome, though and its a great game nonetheless.",3
"if your lookingfor a strategy game with almost endless possibilites becasue of the steam workshop. your in luck!",1
"great turn-based strategy game with beautiful graphics and tons of neat dlcs. if your computer has the power to run this, i would highly recommend it.",1
"great rts but has a big lerning curve, but most is common sense..",1
"if you come from previous civilization games you wont get dissapointed by civ5. it might not beat civ4, but it sure is a step beyond in the franchise worth playing and play one turn more. pd: dlcs are a scam, not because they dont add good content, but the price/content ratio is a joke.",2
"now this is a game to play with friends and ruin your friendship with them.",1
"a massive game which brings several new features to the franchise, most importantly fresh combat mechanic. its been a year since the original release, and we now know that this title has set the standard for turn-based strategy games for years to come. it boasts fantastic art, a wealth of background information, countless possible paths to victory, infinite replayability and various difficulty levels which make it accessible to everyone from casual gamers to hardcore geeks - who will also appreciate the huge content readily available from the community workshop right here on steam. to put it short, if youre at all into strategy games, this is a title you need to own.",3
"boring kelley a$$ game that is only good for one playthrough. dont regret the purchase though.",1
"a truly fantastic game, rich in depth and replay value. if you get anywhere near finishing the steam achievements, your a better person than i!",2
"this series is always in my top 5 most loved games.",4
"if you currently have a job then you might want to come down with a flu because sid meiers civilization v is fun, and extreamly addicting. youll spend hours on here without realizing it, and it may even ruin your relationship status for the first couple days. enjoy!",2
"tons of replay value - and just playing through all the scenarios included in the base game will take quite a bit of time. still lacking the mod-scene that was there for civ 4; but its getting there.",1
"i have been in love with civ since i played the timeless civ ii. whilst civ v will never capture the simplicity of civ ii it is certainly worth the investment especially if on sale. the add ons do add a lot so it is worth checking those out too.",1
"i love this game. it is an excellent time waster on long trips, and the ai is sophisticated enough to keep you guessing. highly recommended to anyone who enjoys strategy games.",2
"it is a great game with a better system than any civ game to date. settling citys is a bit more difficut but that aside you can make hugre armys easily and crush your enimeys or take the peace and be friendly to everyone make your citizens happy and make trades often once again you should buy this game and play every nation and find the one that fits u great game buy it",1
"while it may start off with a highish learning curve, after twenty hours in the same game all you can think to yourself is how much you hate those damned inca who backstabbed you while praying that ghandi doesnt decide to launch a nuclear missile at you during his blitzkreig across asia...",1
"what a fantastic standout from this newist addition to the best strategy franchise in history. so many things to do. it is also the most replayable game i have played.",3
"love the game, unfortunately if you want the full experience the expansion packs are pretty much required. its only half a game with out them.",1
"if you like civilizations, and the roman numural v, then i strongly recomend this game!",1
"grab a 30 rack or 3, sit down with a few friends, and lan this game all day long. most fun ive hd sitting in one place for 16 straight hours.",1
"this game is absolutely amazing, the way it works, the fact i can kill bradley, the foundation of empires... killing bradley.",1
"ive never played any other strategy games likes this before, but that didnt stop me from getting addicted to this. my first night, i played something like seven hours.",1
"only one thing about this game that i can say. it is amazing!!! the graphics are awesome and let me tell you my graphics card and processor are horrible but this still runs very well, even on higher graphic settings. each game can will take you a good amount of time to complete and if you want all the achievments youll be at this a long time. each game is different so youll need to work out a different strategy each time. all the different dlc adds so much to the game (in my opinion they are a little overpriced so i reccommend buying the game of the year edition off of amazon) and wait for a sale to get brave new world and gods & kings.",1
"one of the most addicting games ive ever played. this game is a must for anyone who loves strategy games. i highly reccomend it.",1
"i love this game, its very easy to get the hang of and youll find yourself playing for hours. even better with a friend or two. whether youre an aggresive world leader or a peaceful politican, theres plenty of ways to win the game.",1
"this game could be one of the the reasons crime rates have gone down while obesity rates go up.",2
"this is a great game!!! within the first hour i found myself hooked, and the mods make everything even better. this is the best turn-based strategy game out there. i would definatly recommened buying civ 5!",2

"2 words ing awesome .... just remember dont trust gandhi -awesome gameplay -god of rts -speacial units makes it more awesome 9.5/10 from me",1
"sid meiers civilisation v is, quite simply, the best strategy game i have ever played, if not the best game full stop. with its ease of access for newcomers, plus depth and multi-facetted strategic gameplay for crazy strategists, this game is just as good as you hope it will be, and then some!",1
"this game is such a time killer. make sure to get the gods and kings expansion if you plan on getting it. so buy the civ 5 gold edition. one more turn!! 9/10",1
"civilization 5 is an amazing game full of surprises and alot of fun when playing with friends! but beware though as you can easily lose your friends aswell. play smart, play innovative play civilization 5!!!",1
"the last time i played when i was done i realized it was 2am and have played for 13 hours straight",1
"beware: do not start a game of this unless youve got atleast 3 hours of free time, it is suer addicting. that being said, i absolutley love this game! i was apprehensive to buy this at first because i had never played a strategy game before and didnt know if i would enjoy it. well i did, its very easy to get started with with different difficulties, locations, leaders and other variable that affect your playing experience. it also has great controls that are simple enough for anyone to uderstand. the graphics are gorgeous and the ambient music that accompanies the gameplay is a nice little bonus. bottom line: buy this game! this is a great introduction to strategy-based games :)",1
"addictive and interesting strategy game. although ive heard that it only started to bloom after the release of the brave new world. only downside is the lack of a campaign and a scarce selection of scenarios. multiplayer is easily the greatest though.",1
"not as good as civ 4 when it comes to the logic but is a very fun game to play. defo worth getting the expansions too!",3
"why shooting zombies if you can play civ v and become a zombie urself?",1
"this is simply one of the best games (if not the best game) ive ever played. for new players, the long game span may be quite intimidating, but if you start out on easy with the tutorial on, its very simple to understand. if i were to verbalize every feature that i like about this game, it would probably be several pages long, so ill keep it concise by saying that there is almost nothing i dislike about this game.",2
"very fun game, i livestreamed it and people loved it :d",1
"just one more turn... -said everyone who has ever played civ v. *played just one more turn* -no one who has stated the previous quote. oh yeah, and f*** ghandi.",1
"this game well swallow hours like no other. absolutely incredible.",1
"love it. have so much fun with friends and destroying the world. 11/10 would buy again.",1
"its a great time killer. can be pretty in-depth and enjoyable. i recommend for fans of the series and for those who are new to it.",1
"if you are a fan of the civ series then you will probably like this game.",1
"never trust gandhi, that  has nuked me way too many times.",1
"the only game where a nuke wielding gandhi will threaten to wipe you off the face of the planet.",1
"this is worse than crack , 11/10 , would buy again !",2
"best strategy game ever made. ive been playing it for more than 20 years and still love it!",3
"amazing a few minor issues but not enough to say no to the game. all in all great compared to the past versions. if you loved civilization in the past worth a buy. if you had a hard time with past civilizations this game has fixed a lot of issues why you may have no liked it. i give it a 4.5 out of 5",1
"amazing game, fun to play alone or with friends! this game should be used in teaching history.",1
"one a scale of 1-10 id give it a 9; it is a great game overall, but it doesnt account for the little things that make history dynamic, such as internal revolutions creating brand new nations, and it could use a bit more in the diplomacy, no removal, just addition.",1
"why dont you own this yet? the game is its best when you have both the brave new world and gods and kings expansions.",1
"very good game: i play it all the time. its a great semi-strategy game that can be played completely through in 30minutes to an hour, or all day! very customizable.",1
"amazing game! good graphics, amazing gameplay and a great time killer! must buy!",1
"awesome game to kill a couple hours when you should be sleeping.",1
"look at my playtime. there goes so many weeks of my llife, and being brutally honest with you guys all i can say is weeks well spent. i love civ and have been appropriatley named an addict by the few friends i have, putting so much time into this game has ensured that the number of friends i have remains at a few. a great turn-based stratergy with almost no flaws, and damn it, who needs friends when you have nukes? ;) 10/10 ***** sincerely a huge civ fan, me",4
"i absolutely love this game. being in highshool makes it kinda rough to play long multi-hour game. i picked up this game in mid november and i have managed to rack up almost 40 hours so far. i wasnt sure if i would like it before i bought it; after all, i had never played any turn based strategy games. however, after playing it, i have fallen in love with it. i have but one gripe, and that is that it is most enjoyable with all of the dlc. the cheapest way to get all of the dlc is in the complete edition, so it would be wise for someone who doesnt want to drop $50 on a single to buy it when it is on sale. price complaints aside, this is probable one of my favorite games.",1
"loses a lot of the intelligence from civ iv, but a great civilization game nonetheless. much more approachable and easy to understand. perfect for listening to podcasts or killing time.",2
"complete edition: almost a masterpiece! the only problem i have is boring, strategic ai, that makes me completely feel like im playing by myself. thankfully, the rest of the game is so wonderful that its easily worth the purchase! and surprisingly the new mechanics are so easy to learn, which i was intimidated about before playing. yes there is multiplayer, and yes during the regular waking hours there are people willing to play (if you set your steams region to a big city in the real world), but multiplayer on med-large maps is unplayable as people bail out off the game 90% of the time. what would have kept people to play was an official world-wide tourney ladder & visible scoreboard. a true 8/10 buy with confidence on sale.",1
"as all sid meiers games, civ v and its expansions are amazing. you will play this game for tons of hours and never see everything it has to offer. all games are unique and the game is never boring. a modern classic and a must buy . rate 9 of 10.",1
"very fun game, very strategic. the npcs will punish you at the higher levels of difficulty, but it is worth the challenge. excellent game to play with friends, as long as they dont take an hour per turn :p",1
"como um grande f de jogos de estratgia, eu afirmo sem dvidas que civilization atingiu o pice do gnero nesta verso do game. recomendo  todos que gostam de pensar e desenvolver estratgias, pois possui quase infinitas possiblidades e mundos diferentes. as a big fan of strategy games, i can say that this game goes further than any other game from this genre. i recommend to all people who like to think about new strategies, because it have like infinite ways to play, possibilities and worlds.",1
"you start playing at 2pm...nexxt thing you know its 6am...10/10 would waste life again.",1
"apart from skyrim, this game is one of the top 3 reasons i got into pc gaming. i love everything about it and feel like it could never get old. as much time as i have put into it, i feel like i have only skimmed the surface of what i believe is one of the best games ever made. one more turn will be a though that crosses your mind constantly and on into the hours of the morning. if youre into strategy, get this game immediately. my only complaint is the loading times, but that is my only complaint.",1
"delivers as expected, a must have for any civ player.",4
"plays this game 5 minutes later why is it 4 am? but seriously, this is a good epic game, but if your computer sucks, i advise you not to get it cause the graphics are too good.",1
"ive spent more hours of my life than id care to admit enjoying the hell out of this game. its not just entertaining, its kind of educational and makes me feel like im accomplishing something. watching my little town grow and expand, and then kicking the butt of some poor mongolions...its like crack. the interface is easy, the tutorial was simple and once you get into it you can dig into the finer details of the game, and will likely enjoy every minute of it.",1
"this is a must play game..it feels quite a good..got it cheap after 4 years :p. played it and had much fun..a 10/10 game..even if i am not a big fan of strategy and simulation games",1
"cant start it up most of the time one of the glitchiest games for me and i no longer own it and must re-purchase it because it hates me.",1
"i would recomend this game to anyone who just wants to play a game without much of a learning curve. it is a turn based strategy game where you take control of a lead from a great nation in history and as though tried to do, take over the world. it could be world domination by military, economic, technologicly, or by making a utopia. the choices are endless with who you want to team up with, who to destroy, who to backstab, and who to just completely ignore. even without all the dlc this game is very fun and has a lot of replay value in it.",1
"they did not give me the gold i desired. i nuked them. 10/10",1
"spent nearly 600 hours playing this game, where did my life go? e_e",4
"one of the best turn-based strategy games. totally recomendded!",1
"civ 5 is an amazing game that is based on history of the world you can either play it out with friends or you can play single-player but either type is just as fun.",1
"this game is amazing! i dont even like turn based games but man does this game have a good system. i can see why some peaple do not like this game. (9/10 system,replayable,soundtrack)",1
"i spent 7 hours on the tutorial alone, constantly realising i hadnt fathomed the sheer depth of this game at all! so many possibilities, so little time... must play!",1
"truly a game that never ages. once you start you better have the next few days free.",1
"really great game! one of the very best turn-based strategy games. the only problem i myself have is that the ai is attacking me out of no-where and its not possible to make a no-aggression packt. (itd be great, tho.) however, really enjoyable game with lots of thinking. (normal civ v - no dlcs or addons.)",2
"8/8 super good, it has incredible replay value, and with the incredible workshop community, this will always get new content.",2
"one of the best games ever! so simple yet so much fun. can easily loose a day or two and not realise when your ruining japan as napoleon",1
"fun, i love games like these, i can play them for hours on end. i first encounter this type of game while searching my phone for a decent app game to play, i initially only installed it just to give it a try and was very much addicted to the game. before long i would just play the game over and over again even though i had beat it. so one of its many features is that it has a lot of replay valu to the game. so trying the bigger version of the game was a plus for me, and contains a heck of a lot more content.",1
"the joy of this is in the variety, the small but important differences engendered by the various civilisations and their unique buildings and units. the game is made infinitely playable.",4
"who woouldnt recommend this game? its mega-fun and addicting!",1
"just over 100 hours in, and i finally finished my first turn. pretty fun so far, i hope nobody tries to attack me. 3/2 would click again.",1
"this is a truly great game. one of the best. at times it may be slow but that end reward of destroying all of your friends long and hard work is extremely satisfying. the soundtrack is stunning with cultural music made specificaly for civ. it is one of the most intense games ive ever played. the split second desicions that can affect the rest of the game are perfectly placed. this is one of my favorite games. if you like any sort of strategy you will fall in love with civ.",1
"just 1 more turn never seems to be enough when playing any civ game, and this one is no exception. great gameplay, with new hex maps and different twists on ideas from the older civ games. cant go wrong with this one.",2
"it is my favorite of the series. it simplifies the game compared to 3 and 4 which was always a turn off to me. the matches will last a good 8+ hours even if its against a computer. 8/10 for me.",1
"sid meiers guess ghandis attitude v 5*s - the times on sunday",1
"its civ. if you like to conquer and rule countries, maybe even the world, youll enjoy the game. if you like to shoot things, try something else.",1
"no other game feels as epic. the feeling of building a great empire that can stand the test of time is really where civilization 5 shines.",2
"civ 5 is great if you like strategy games. once you learn it, the game is really fun and not too complicated. playing with friends is the bomb diggedy.",1
"while this game has been given high scores from professional game reviewers it has also been given bad marks by some longtime civilization players. i dont think these naysayers are necessarily in the majority though. personally the game is pretty good. it is not as good as civilization ivs beyond the sword expansion but i do like it a lot. 1upt (one unit per tile) is a refreshing change that will only get better with further expansions. build choices matter more than ever now because you have to balance happiness, culture, expansion, defense, & conquest all through gold or buildings. it is no longer as simple as adjusting a slider.",5
"this game will get you playing for a long time, at times it gets old and i play some other game but it always comes back at any moment to be a fun and entertaining game. the dlc are slighty expensive but it puts a lot more purpose into the game and makes it all around funner. i would for sure recommend this game.",2
"very long game, only play with friends and it gets really action packed [i lose everytime]",1
"civilization 5 is a very good game, no doubt, but there were some flaws that made it not as the first game, civilization revelution.",1
"obviously a classic series that continues to improve with every release, but be warned: the ai is inherently bad and does not play better on higher difficulty settings. instead, the game simply assigns better starting resources and disposition to the computer opponents, making the game incredibly unfair in the beginning, only to level out and eventually fall in your favour towards the end. when i discovered this fact, i was compelled to stopplaying, but i still dont regret the nearly 400 hours i spent on it.",2
"sid meiers civilization v is a strategy game where you can play as many different empires ranging from rome, to the united states. the goal is to become the best civilization through domination, having your culture overthrow evryone elses, building a rocket, and many more ways to win. plus, there are many fun scenarios in the game! wanna play as the union in the american civil war, or the confederate states? do you try to prevent rome from falling in the fall of rome scenario, or try to take some if it? there are so many possible stories you can make up about your game too! just one more thing... never trust gandhi! give it a try!!!",1
"where do i even begin? this was my first civ game. i have to say that it is fantastic. the core gameplay is amazing. the feeling of starting from nothing and building an empire is not matched in any other way. my favorite thing about this game is that it is turn based. you have time to think about what you will do. the choices you make can cause a ripple that will last thousands of years.",1
"this game is so good! beautiful graphics perfectly gameplay and really addictive!",1
"great game, before you know it, youve spent 10 hours on it, late for school...",1
"great game. one of the best strategy games out there",1
"a game that puts your civilization skills to the test... and playing with friends makes the expierence even better.",1
"i like being that city that everyone loves. makes me feel like i...belong.",1
"wonderful strategy game! ive already beeb addicted to it",1
"its a very in-depth strategy, and tactics game with a lot of different possible outcomes, the most common one being world wars and nukes and sieges. it takes a little while to get used to, but when you do, its amazing. overall id rate it a 9.5 out of 10. the only thing keeping it out of a perfect 10 is for me it takes forever to join multiplayer lobbies. otherwise its a superb investment.",2
"best strategy game on steam :d in-depth and great for a long, enjoying experience. warning: you may not be able to get yourself off the computer due to the one more turn impulse.",1
"addictively fun with streamlined options for faster gameplay with the civ feel.",3
"siv v.. a very good game indeed but needing some improvents including some new characters like stalin and hitler.. because when i get home after a hard day of work i like to recreate the genocides that happened in the 1930-40s.. it brings a tear to my heart of happiness when i see it being done. this game is great for almost everyone that likes to think (1% of the u.s population). 1 final problem with the game is that when you are allys with a city-state or ruler, not once can you ask friendly troops if they want to have sex with other troops, very prejudice against homosexuals i see. anyway, would recommend to most folks. 69/69",1
"the expansions are really what made this good game, great.",3
"awsome game looks so cool runs so good the game is a blast best sid game ever put 50 hours in the game got the dlc you need this game if you love turn base",1
"a wonderful turn-based strategy game. fun to play with your friends especially. i recommend that everyone give this a try, and those who do like it should purchase the complete edition. 10/10",1
"awesome game! not as much micromanagement as civ iv but for me that is a good thing.",1
"civ 5 is just a awesome game in general and with its xpacs (gods and kings + brave new world) the game is on steroids... with the introduction to faith / trade routes / tourism / revamped social policies / archaeology / new units are added for every era / more civs / more city states (faith / mercantile) / more luxury resources / more great people (admirals / writers / musicians) spys (engage in espionage and steal other civiliazations tech or make them diplomates and spread propaganda about the wonders and glory your empire is) world congress (vote new laws for the world.. embargo hostile civs or usher in grows in science or art) the game has totally changed in terms of strategy; more angles, more possibilies, more fun!",2
"though not without its faults, for fans of turn-based strategy this is one of the best games currently available. addictive, with enough variability and opportunity for skillful play, it can keep your attention for sessions of 14 hours or longer regularly. highly recommended for anyone who enjoys strategic thinking, resource management, and games that challenge you to dig deeply into mechanics to learn and improve.",2
"love this game. game play is excellent, but i do miss the cheats from previous version. i dont like that i have to run steam on mac to play it, the software slows down my computer, runs with out my consent, has to be manually configured to not launch whenever boot the machine for example.",1
"george washington p*ssed me off so i nuked him. the end. well, for the us. william guy from the netherlands p*ssed me off. i nukeed him. the end. japan gave me uranium. i made some nukes. they p*ssed me off. guess what?! i didnt nuke him. i sent my army of massive death mech bots. the end. for japan. not the mech bots to clarify that. rome ftw.",1
"gandhi accepts peace agreement 2 turns later nuclear war.... 10/10 would play gandhi again",1
"i had played this game when it first came out and hated it. now with the expansions and patches it is honestly the best civ game i have ever played.",3
"a great intro to strategy gaming; has some depth but not to overly complex.",1
"though i was new to the civilization series this game did a very good job at teaching me how to play. this game is a must have to all tbs strategy fans. its fun, good, and not that complicated but still complex.",2
"great game 11/10 got rekt by scrub online. love it.",2
"really good, i suck balls at it. if you are into turn-based strategy this is your best shot.",1
"one of the best civilization that ive played. but, the game isnt that simple like the others, if you wanna a full gaming experience you should try play civilization iv so that way you can improve your skills to play the v version :)",1
"10/10/10/10 best tbs game ever. but i only have one problem with this game: ghandi",1
"in my opinion its one o the best in the series (ex aequo with civ 3). performace isnt too bad even on old (~4 years old pc) or my not so powerful school laptop. definitely its worth full price (now even better with 50% off). grab it and grab a friend or few to play and have fun!",2
"one of the best time machine games, first impressions may seem a bit complex, but once you learn how to play it you wont regret.",1
"i bought this to see up catherine the greats skirt. i was sorely disapointed.",3
"mah a mah a mah mothering a, yeah i recommend this . buy it or some crap like that, dont torrent #torrentsnot4me",1
"omg stop i am bankrupt i wont be able to buy any more expansion packs.",1
"first civilization game i have ever played. i regret purchasing it and wasting my time on it. my productivity has gone down and it takes many more turns in order for me to accomplish anything irl. 10/10",1
"very disapointed steamwork shop is not supported with the mac.",1
"this game would probably be a lot better if my friends werent so  and played with me. but other than that great game, make sure you get both expansions!",1
"a great game, but pretty b ullshit for one main reason: dlc; expansion packs which actually make the game worth playing, is priced at 40quid (20 for each). thats 5 quid more than the complete edition. this means that people who bought the original base game are now shafted. this price point is unacceptable and 2k should suck my knackers",1
"ok, that is a great game! the ultimate social life terminator... love it <3 its awesome... what are you waiting for? buy it and play it! awesome! :)",1
"very indepth and challenging lots of fun, a good way to pass the time.",1
"fantastic game, cloud storage is an awesome feature if you like me often re-format your computer forgetting that you have saved games :l by it and you wont regret it.",1
"very enjoyable when it works, but too many bugs that hev been ignored for too long.",2
"my favourate game. awsome tile graphics and great game interface whether you want war, peace, or something else. thiss game has it all!",3
"multiplayer is a bit buggy but it is still a brilliant game. especially in this sale, the full version for 9 is incredibly cheap",1
"one of favorite games, a little crashy at times but still fun!",2
"the best game i have ever played when i got all the dlcs but without them its a ok game",1
"completely fun and addicting would recommend to everyone. late game can be a little frustrating if you are going for a domination-victory.",1
"great game. extremely time consuming. i never thought i would play a game for a whooping 325 hours (so far) in some 6ish months. i you think about getting it. do yourself a favour and get the gnk and bnw dlcs; they add a crapload of gameplay. vanilla game: 75/100 game with all dlcs: 95/100",3
"the title seemed inferior to civ iv at first but with all the expansions, particularly brave new world its now the definitive version of civ.",4
"great turn-based strategy game with tons of dlc and scenarios that are never the same! best when played with friends.",1
"with over 500 hours spent in the game so far, civilization has extreme replayability. there are so many random elements, no two games are ever the same. this is one of the best strategy games of all time. all versions of the game are good, but this latest one gets it all right: graphics, ambient sound, music, physics, gameplay, and balance.",4
"step 1. play as the english step 2. ally with the iroquois step 3. skype with iroquois leader step 4. scream manifest destiny mother er!!!!!!!! into the mic, and slam your troops into him. step 5. destroy everything except a group of settlers and workers, and send them northward into the lands of barbarians and enemy nations 10/10 would conquer again.",1
"only an ok game in its vanilla form (compared to civ iv), g+k and bnw expansions propell civ v well above its excellent predecessor. on a scale from 1-2: 2",3
"my review for this game is that i love it. it is a great game i would recomend it if you wan to try it out use the demo for anyone that is not sure if they like it or not",1
"the defining modern civilization simulator. everything is excellent, makes even the best computers hot with all the amazing engine work and calculations it does.",3
"extremely addicting game, and is the sole reason that i have an adequete history background knowledge",1
"extremely addictive and time consuming game, you can play for hours and not realise because youre having that much fun!",1
"this game reminds me a bit of age of empires. ill have to give this game a 7/10 for three reasons no campign mode(only 1 campaign as genghis khan) muitplayer is buggy and it gets boring and repitieve after a while. but for the price this game is good.",1
"a hardcore starcraft 2 play lose himself in a turn base strategy game.....",1
"surprisingly addictive game, extremely diluted grand strategy fit for newcomers to the genre/idiots. if you play games like crusader kings avoid, but if your coming from games like call of duty or starcraft this might be for you. wait nvm ghandi just nuked my capital brb",1
"very nice and relaxing and not so stressfull at high levels like real time strategy games.",1
"this is so much fun. even for a turn-base-game i got hooked on it ,and im not a fan of turn-base-games. it is like risk and age of emipers ,or risk and command and conquer. can you make a civilization that can live or die? will you make peace or die? the world is in your hands. what will you do?",1
"this game is wonderful the series has been running for ages and it is 10/10.",1
"this game is suck worth is. now it is not as much worth it if you dont get the gold edition. anyway if you like rts games and dont own this, own this!",2
"new installment in civilization series. now with hexes!",4
"this is a very good game one min it is 9pm and 4 turns (exaggerating) later it is 3am, but in all it is a very great game but takes a long time to play one game but it is very good!",1
"the most elaborately exquisite game i have played such that the beginning of this recommendation used not one, but two condescending words",1
"civ v, as it is called, is definitely one of the best strategy games out there. it is perfect for both newcomers to the genres of strategy and turned-based games, and experienced players as well. there is not an intimidating learning curve, and there are plenty of mods and dlc adding new nations, and other little goodies. the dlcs also bring a unique bit with the addition of tourism and religion. the game can be a bit of a challenge, especially on higher difficulties or on certain missions, or scenarios as the game refers to them as. the game is also barely taxing on a computer system and runs fine with nice graphics and a friendly interface, with very minimal bugs and mistakes. from tribals hiding in a tiny village, to building a mega empire spanning the world, this game is sure to be fun for anyone who is a fan of, or looking to get in to, strategy games. 10/10",2
"never played any previous installments of civilization games. bought this when it was on sale and was hooked from the beginning. it has a bit of a steep learning curve when you first start out, but that didnt stop me from enjoying the game.",1
"an amazing game that involves so many great features, with great dlc, community and mod support! i would strongly recommend this if anyone is thinking of buying it.",1
"the game is addictive if not frustrating...especially those bloody babarians stealing my civilians...-_-",1
"this game is hours of fun! each expansion pack adds a new demension to the game making it even more fun. this game can make you easily forget that there is a world going on outside your computer room. the game is awesome to play with friends. best installment of the series thus far. endless fun.",2
"the ultimate time travel device. simply begin playing this game, learn its subtle and addictive gameplay and as soon as you utter just one more turn it will immediately be between 6, 12 or even 24 hours since you began playing. simply put, many hours of fun to be had.",1
"ghandi is trustworthy ghandi is your friend. ghandi wont nuke you. ghandi wont screw your civilization in the . ghandi wont use mind control. ghandi is love. ghandi is life.",2
"our biggest threat right now is a nuclear india.",2
"i am totalu hooked to this game! i recomend this to everbody who likes controling large empires!",2
"really good turn based stragety game, live europia in terms of potential difficulty, but ith a faster pace. you can change to game to the point where the settings are enjoyable for example cranking up the game pace, or if you like to play europia style slow it down.",1
"ive spent nearly 200 hours on this insanely briliant game! is it good? you bet yo  it is!!!!!!!!! but if ur getting it buy the complete pack",1
"... masterpiece! just give me one more turn and ill finish this review...",1
"kill that scumbag ghandi before he nukes you, trust me, he will. 10/10",2
"great game in the series, great graphics. highly recommend for any civ fans!",1
"i never learned how to tune a harp, or play upon a lute, but i know how to raise a small and obscure city into glory and greatness. the great questions of the day will not be settled with means of speaches and majority descisions, but by iron and blood.",2
"this is definitely one of the best strategy games that i ever played. its dlcs expand the contents of the game dramatically and make the game worthy playing again and again to try different strategies. one thing still need to be improved is ai takes too much time every turn in late game, especially when aircraft comes out.",2
"used up all my sick calls for this game.... one....more...turn....",1
"well, let me just have a quick round... holy  why is it 4 a.m.",1
"play ittt! i need more people to play it with. its sooooo funnnnn",1
"this is an amazing game, it is 9/10 for me, i love everthing about it and wouldnt change much. i cannot wait for civ beyond earth.",2
"if you love strategy games then this one is good for you. it offers a very custom experience, everything from landmass to how man empires you face down can be altered. and one of my favorites is to turn off the varied options such as culture, science, and social victories to focus on domination, squaring off against eleven other great nations in a race to rule the world is an entertaining experience, especially if you throw everything into science. steamrolling horse mounted archers with tanks is oddly cathartic. and with so many options and choices you can play through the game dozens of times and still discover new play options. the game and its expansion packs are worth every dollar.",1
"be warned: playing this game will make all your friends hate you and you will never go outside again. dont try the multiplayer, you will become a genocidal maniac. also gandhi is really violent. 9/10",1
"this is an extrememly addictive game which will take hours of your time, the single player and dlc hosts hours of play time and plenty of replayability, whilst the game does cater towards a millitary victory and the randomers in multiplayer drop out before the end of the game, it still isnt enough to stop you from buying the game 9/10",2
"this game is a ton of fun, but requires strategy to win in the end.",2
"best strategy game i played so far and very adictive. i would recommend to people who love this type of game.",1
"ill just wait two turns for this unit to be done before going to bed... oh i should probably move him here now that hes done, then ill go to bed... i should probably give my workers orders now, i might forget to next time... well this worker is almost done with his job, ill just wait for him to finish... well since im waiting for my worker, ill make another unit... ill just wait two turns for this unit to be done before going to bed...",2
"the ai keeps being grumpy with me. sure i attack them, seige their cities, spy on their capitals and kill their troops but is that really a reason for them to stop being nice, they should still happily buy my stuff...so i can build more troops to take their cities. it is for their own good. sometimes i feel like im the bad guy, but that cant be the case...",1
"best when playing w/ friends!!! most fun ive had playing civ. games!",1
"i like this game beasase it includs lot of stratagy. it feels like you are aculy runing a governmen in acent times. the trading in the game is epic you can creat friend ship with coumputer controlled peaple or with real peaple. for the cunclshonh you should buy this game.",1
"fix the multiplayer. it reconnects like every 5 turns and its not our internet. fix this and ill recommend.",2
"before playing civilization i was skeptical about how addictive it was supposed to be, boy was i wrong. nearly 100 hours in and im terrified of starting another game because of the way weekends disappear. i hadnt played the game without its expansions but with them the game feels fluid and complete with early, mid and late game requiring changes to focus and strategy. highly recommend.",1
"it is probably one of my favorite games ever!!! so, with the mods, i can just about do anything with this. this game is super fun, eventhough i play on the easy mode. i love the game b/c of the wonders. im a wonder-freak, so this game provides it. the graphics and game-style make it to the point that it isnt the regular boring turn-based game. this game rocks!!! 9.99/10",3
"took over the world and made everyone hate me. 10/10",1
"this series is still the only one that makes me absolutely loose track of time. if you like 4x games at all this is a more than worthy addition to the civ series.",1
"highly addicting. i downloading on a whim and was actually stuck playing the game. i rarely get stuck playing games but was glued from the beginning.",1
"if you like age of empires and turn based games. i totally reccomend this game.",1
"civilization 5. pretty damn good if youre into turn based strategy games. the game unfortunatly requires some dlc to get the full experience. if you finish a game youll probably realize how deep this game goes. there is multiple ways to play and this creates a replayable heaven.",4
"a good small start-up strategy game. good for those who want city management, nation management, military management, and even diplomacy. dlc adds features found previously in older titles, but still the core game is quite good.",1
"a very good strategic game but requires a lot of patience and time. gripping adventure to conquer nations in peaceful or war ways. a must have for strategic awe.",1
"turn based tactics at its best. you got to reserve time to play this because games do not last 30 or 60 minutes, they can easily last for hours. its great to see your civilization prosper and how it stands the test of time. great to play with friends so let me know if you buy this game or want to play this game. one... more... turn...",2
"one of the most addicting games i have ever had the pleasure of playing. i dont know how many times ive started playing at 10pm or so and looked up at the clock to find it was 4 in the morning. so... i guess dont buy this if you really need your sleep, haha. otherwise you totally should if you like rtss, solo or with friends.",4
"this game sucked and it is highly unlikely you will play it for more than a day. i tried to and in the end, i felt that i pissed my time away.",1
"if i were a king, id be a pretty  king because id be playing this constantly. is better than the sex. 11/10 would bang consistently.",3
"this game is one of the best strategy games ever (i havent played total war shogun yet so shut up) the variety in this game is amazing and the many settings you can put in your game before you play can massively change your gameplay (in a good way.) i could play this for hours and thats good because the games are insanely long 8-16 hours long. for one game.",1
"this is a hard game to play if you havent played other civs before. but i would recommend and is very fun.",1
"i love this game it is all about human history featuring real charcters throughout history. be careful though dont get mixed up between what happends in the game and what happend in real life :) i reccomend this game because it gets complicated when you start but in the end its great fun and its all worth it.",2
"what can i say that others havent? this is a great game that i keep coming back to!",2
"lobby simulator 2014 would press ready again 11/10",1
"great and addictive game, but has a lot of bugs. this game sometimes is disappointing, but worths of buying for 12.5 euro.",1
"strategy isnt too necessary to play or even win, but when its used, its a game changer. very fun to play with friends or strangers, it doesnt matter.",1
"i have been playing civilization ever since the first game came out. the latest version has some nice features. however, i would like to see civilization vi incorporate some of the features of civ iv and v together. the graphics and the cultural boarders expanding one area at a time is nice. also the hexagon layout is reminiscent of the old military strategy games. the features i would bring back would be the ability to stack units: even if the terrain would dictate how many could stack. otherwise you may spend more time shuffling units around than actually using the units. the second thing i would bring back is the ability to install and play the game offline. i dont know what kind of kickback steam gave the civilization designers, but i miss having a game that is free of this annoying and useless system.",1
"best game ive ever played. just one..more..turn..",1
"addicting game, much fun. good if you like turn-based strategy. good time-sink. dont start before exams...",3
"fun game. lots of different options keep it different every time.",3
"built the pyramids, stonehenge, eiffel tower, and statue of liberty in the middle of the pacific ocean. 10/10",4
"civ is great as it isnt something you can beat in the first few games, you have to play over and over with friends and by yourself to learn all the different strategies as what works for rome might not work for england. however you do have to change the setting to your preference as you may not like your screen juming around from troop to troop with out you telling it to do so.",1
"still a solid game after so many years. cant wait for beyond earth.",1
"this is the type of game that you start playing around 8 pm and not realize youve been playing for 6 hours until you look at the clock. a+.",2
"i go offline to play this so no one knows how much i play this game...",2
"i barely even played before it quit working. tried 20 or more reinstalls, your steam server constantly loses communications, it i did get it loaded it would say unable to load something or another. constant issues. cant even play in offline mode anymore. a great game turned to crap.",1
"great fun at some points and a tad dry in others. best at sapping away at your day without you even noticing, especially since a standard match tends to last around 15-20 (or more) hours.",1
"the best strategy franchise for single players, i just wish the community was more active for multiplayer. if you like the idea of playing 10-40 hour single player campaigns where you stress over every detail, then this is the game for you.",1
"played as mongol empire. 20 mins in - destroyed 10 city states. op 11/10",1
"one of the best strategy games ever, i never get bored playing this game i always come back and play more of it! i highly recommend this game :)",3
"when you start playing this game time gets away from you way too fast! excellent game cant wait for civilization: beyond earth",1
"this is the greatest turn based strategy franchise of all time. civilization 5 will suck your life away as, let me just do one more thing, becomes a day of gaming. the unit balance of this game is extraordinary, and the random world creation keeps the map/environment fresh and new every game. there is a large number of leaders to pick from each with their own abilities and special units/buildings that can allow for different strategic options even given similar set ups or in game technology/policy under a different leader. raging barbarians ftw!!!",3
"i started playing the civilization series from version 1 when i was a kid (back when games came in boxes and had big instruction manuals) and have been hooked ever since. civ 5 is great game and still feels fresh after all these years however the game does crash frequently which really ruins the immersion. that said once a game has started kiss goodbye to at least 24 hours of your life!",1
"very enjoyable with friends. the base game is alright, but i think that despite the expense of the dlc, it dramatically adds to the fun.",1
"theres this thing called civilization v. its pretty swell. then theres this thing called civilization v: brave new world. its even more swell. i would tell you more but its 3am and i accidentally 19 hours of it.",2
"never have i sunk more hours into a game. one memory, i decided to take over paris, next thing i knew bird were chirping outside my window and it was 7:ooam the next day",3
"coming from a guy that never really was into strategy games. this has to be one of the best buys i have ever done during a summer sale! a must have game!",1
"one of the best strategy games of all times, and the most customizable with the support of a massive player community. see the light from yon window? thats the coming dawn. i hope you dont have work this morning. ;>",5
"civilization is like the best. its so relaxing to just have it your own pace and i am only writing this because is have too",1
"incredibly clever strategy game, offers tons of achievments to unlock, and lots of civilizations to play as. :o this game is much more advanced than those only with war; here you must focuse on currency and sciense while keeping your people happy. :o if you really wanna try a challenge, play one of the many scenarios available as dlc. :d this game is a 10/10! get it now! ps. new expansion packs are being released...",3
"civilization v is truly the best game when it comes to building your own civilization. its complex, its beautiful, and you will find yourself playing more than you planned. beautiful experience worth playing and adding expansions.",1
"definitely one of the most addicting games ive ever played. im completely satisfied playing singleplayer alone, it just doesnt get old. its the only game ive stayed up until 7:00 in the morning playing with a friend. multiplayer is a little hard to work with because a lot of servers require the new (quite expensive) dlcs gods and kings and brave new world. however singleplayer is satisfying, and if you have friends to play it with, that should satisfy your multiplayer needs.",2
"the depth and replayability are unsurpassed. it took a couple of expansions to catch up to the enjoyment i felt playing its predecessors, but now with all of the new systems in place it has become one of my favorite iterations in the series. thank you sid meiers, brian reynolds, jeff briggs, microprose, hasbro, infogrames, atari interactive, take-two, 2k games, firaxis and any others i am forgetting for providing me with years of such boundless entertainment. i can only imagine what the future holds for such an amazing and storied franchise.",4
"sid meiers civilization v is probably one of the most addicting games i have ever played. i bought it thinking it would only be a 10-20 hour game until i got bored, but then i just kept hitting the one more turn button.... and, if you have the dlc, say goodbye to your social life, love life, and life in general, because your new life will be the new ruler of the earth.",2
"a fitting sequel to civ iv. however, quite simplified and more in the vein of civ 1 than the increasingly more complicated and intricate civilizations. the one-unit-per-hex system, while cumbersome at first, makes combat interesting and more than simply a stack-and-drag extravaganza. definitely worth it if youre a fan of the civilization series.",1
"ive been playing civ since the first game came out years ago. this latest iteration is one of the best.",1
"just wait until sid makes civilization beyond earth expansion pack.",2
"so i bought this game when it was on sale for 9.99 for me and my friend. realised i needed all the dlc so we bought the complete edition for 17.99 each. so 19.98 already wasted at this point. then the complete edition goes on sale for 8.74. gunshots echo. oh right the game? yeah its good.",1
"civilizaion v is probably one of the best tbs game i ever played. the addition of gods and kings and brave new world makes the game better and adds many features. civilization v is a 10 out of 10.",3
"just one more turn and i promise i will go to bed.",1
"this is on eof the most fun games i have ever played!",1
"online games get kicked and dont last but otherwise it is good game for sure!",1
"a fantastic 4x strategy game, especially with its expansions.",1
"amazingly detailed and superbly balanced rts game that sees you take one of the many historic civilizations of the worlds history to full dominence of the whole world, through all past present and future time periods.",1
"honestly one of the best games ive ever played. definitely need to give it some time to understand it and it not always a fast game so not an ideal game for people who want a fast exciting game unless you play on the multiplayer.",1
"best turn by turn strategy game ever. but remember to tink!",1
"only ever completed one full match but is rlly fun if you have time to actually play like quit your day job to play this game it takes so long",1
"ha ha, that nelson mandela guy and his nukes, too funny, too epic.",1
"this is a great strategy game to play alone or with friends.",1
"hours of possible playtime, and many facits to enjoy",2
"must buy. no more needs to be said, absolutely amazing!",1
"one of the best games i have ever played.outstanding gameplay and a unique and easy to use interface that is picked up in seconds! once you start plaing it, you wont be able to stop, its so addictive.",1
"the fifth iteration of the original time-vampire...",1
"a fantastic strategy game. i would recommend it to anybody that enjoys strategy games, and also a good game for people to start on if they have never tried strategy games before.",1
"for those who knows how to think! not best in series but almost incredible with new dlc.",1
"oh civilization v....theres too much to say honestly. if youve played the board game risk before, this is a much more detailed version of that with options other than military domination to lead to victory. if you havent played risk, then this is more like a very complicated version of chess where what you do off the chess board matters too. and if you havent played either of those...this game probably isnt for you. civilization v is a turn-based strategy game at its core, and it is damn good at what it does. however, i do not personally reccommend to purchase this without its dlc bundle, as the main game by itself, doesnt have quite the kick and a lot changes with the dlc additions. i give this game a 9 / 10. definitely worth the pick up if you like strategy or turn-based games.",1
"this is the second civilization game i have played and i must say it is the best one. i also played civilization revolution but this civ 5 is better than revolution. civ 5 is more complex and requires you to think more than revolution.",1
"i nuked the aztecs as an egyptian warlord. what other game lets you do that?",1
"i love this game. it keeps you thinking at the right difficulty settings, and there is always a chance of failure. if you know how to react to certain events you can almost always make them work in your favor. just dont let the enemy get too far ahead.",4
"do not buy this game if you like having free time. its not a game one simply picks up for an hour or so. it is the video game equivalent of heroin: it will suck away hours of your life at a time, leaving you in a stupor afterwards, thinking only about when you can boot it up next and finally knock off that a-hole suleiman for good. its terrible but, its so, so good.",2
"great replay value :d currently very cheap on humble bundle!! get it! thats all.",3
"game is great as content, but runs very slow while advancing through game on older machines who only meet minimum requirements",1
"i like the game but they make it so hard to multiplay with someone sitting right next to you.",1
"this game is worse then drugs! if you start playing it.... you cant quit!",3
"very good strategy game.exceeded my expectatons.solid gameplay and easy to learn.9/10",1
"ever want to go to space via the great polish space program? ever want to destroy the world as gandhi? have you ever once thought what it would be like to build the great wall as ethiopia? well then sid meiers civilizatio v is just the game for you!",1
"spent endless hours on this. its my first venture in to the civ games but it sure was a nice experience. learning different ways to play has been enjoyable and the dlc and expansions make it a really fun game with friends or on your own :)",1
"pretty fun game. great for those who crave power and bloodshed. oh and diplomacy. but betraying your friends in order to destroy them and claim their lands is great fun.",2
"incredibly fun even with out dlc single player multiplayer what ever you play it an incredible game defenitly worth every penny you put into it",1
"this is one of my favorite games of all time. when you first start playing it, you are hooked for hours upon hours, and it may start to get boring. then you leave it for a few months, but then as soon as you say hm, i havent played civ in a while you play it and are instantly hooked again for several hours, and the process repeats",1
"im a big fan of sid meiers franchise since sid meiers civilization ii. this fifth of the series is for me, another big success. i spend many hour on this game and im not tired of it. some people prefer the third or the fourth of the series but this one is not soo bad. in fact, with its last brave new world extension, sid meiers civilization v is one of better strategy game that you can have. once you begin playing, you will never stop. i guarantee. ;-)",1
"barbarian invaded my sheep, they started to smoke best game 10/10 would recommend.",4
"played a game where i was winning, later someone started a nuclear winter. 11/10",1
"this game provide an excellent strategy platform which is both tense and relaxing due to its turn based mechanic.",2
"a really good turn based rts game. if you liked the previous civ games or age of empire/ rise of nations youll like this.",1
"i have seen some negative reviews on this game. ignore them! this game is awesome! get it and all the expansions and dlc and you will not regret it. have a great day!",1
"this game is beyond awesome. what else is there to say",1
"i predict many hours ahead in my future... steam sales ruined my life gg",1
"sid meiers latest entry in the award winning civilization series is fantastic. it allows you to rule a country however you would like, be it peacefully allying yourself with others or steamrolling them with the feet of your armies. the two expansions, although steeply priced, is a must for the full experience and i reccomend the dlc strongly. if you love 4x games and have a lot of money in gifted steam cards, than i highly reccomend considering civilization v. however, if you couldnt put a lot of time into one saved game (a standard game could be awhile,) then you might want to look at less time intensive titles. 10/10",4
"started playing tutorial at 12am. what feels like 45 minutes later, i check the time. 5am. i think ive found an actual time traveling device. 11/10 would mcfly through space and time again. many more hours in: just one more turn. one more turn. more turns.... turns.......................",1
"probably the best tbs ive played. 10/10 would ghandi",3
"after playing this for just an hour i was instantly hooked on it. this game is amazing and i recommend it to all strategy fans. 10/10",1
"its a great strategy game and can be played for thousands of hours without getting bored once. infite variations and scenarios to be had",2
"this game is so addictive. i suck at it and i still keep playing it. awesome game!",1
"the fact that i only found the civ franchise when brave new world came out and im already looking forward too whats next is a sighn of how good this game is awsome game",2
"this may be the single greatest game ever, from its awesomeness, to its epicness, it makes you suck a  and like it.",1
"i do not like having to use steam for this game. i have to reload steam every time i do a malware scan. i would prefer having a cd to play from. also, with steam the game is too slow.",2
"while i havent logged much time in this game. i must say it was all in the course of a day. its absolutely mind numbing and addicting. must have!",1
"this game is worth the money. i bought it the first year it came out, but i constantly come back to play it after a while especially since im a history buff. every playthrough is different, even if you still use the same strategy everytime. i would definitely reccomend this game to anyone who loves strategy games, but i also think this game is a great starter for those who dont usually play strategy games and want to jump into them. 9/10",3
"the ultimate turn-based strategy youll ever play, with a amazing single player and a fantastic multiplayer, even more fun with friends!!!",1
"dont play this game it will consume all your time like it has mine",2
"i have never spent so much time on a game only to work towards being more angry. still angry. still playing.",1
"do you have hours to waste? like looking at maps and thinking? well then this will be like porn",1
"dota2 is better though why do we russians love these strategies anyway?",1
"so this is basically how a game of civ goes. start up the game. meet ghandi. oh thank god ghandi is suppose to be peaceful in real... wait... ghandi what are you doing? ghandi captures your capital and wins.",1
"civ 5 without dlcs is clearly bad compare to civ 4. but with the dlcs its just awesome. we have all good things of civilization with the better battle system ever (cities can defend alone, the range units have really range, just one unit per case... so need new strategy for tis game) finally available on linux ! so 100/100 for me",1
"the greatest strategy game of all time. the best of the series. beautiful, educational and great fun.",1
"i cant stop playing. send help. also, never trust the ai. ever.",3
"this is the best game i have ever played omg yes plz get it its hot as heck yaaas listen to me im telling you.",1
"sid meiers civilization v is a great game filled with hours apon hours of entertainment. civ v is a turn baised strategy game, it involves skill, knowlage and commitment its also a great game to play with friends. some of my favorite things about this game is the strategy behind it and the mods made by the community. i would also recommend the dlc for this game, the dlc adds a lot of fixes and new mechanics. enjoy - millerman",2
"very addictive if you like long sessions of gaming, then this is the game for you.",2
"its really fun but recently it has been crashing so if a patch comes out i reccomend buying it",1
">started first ever game >settlers and warriors appear two blocks from barbarian camp >send warriors to mess up barbarians as their camp is on very good ground to build city >warriors are mercilessly slaughted >settlers molested to death >game over 10/10 would get molested by big hairy men again",1
"the game where you set up a big group game with your friends one night, and then the friends who start falling behind get bored or need to go to sleep, conveniently before their capital gets nuked. 5/5",1
"if you buy this, you will lose your sense of reality.this  is more attractive then drugs and trocadero combined!!!",1
"i love this game and best of all i can play it anywhere with my surface pro.. the touch screen functions work amazing! great great great game",1
"allows me to let go of my anger through killing things",1
"is best game ever. buy it and waste hours upon hours on it. worth it.",3
"barbarians who will  you up from the start, city states needing help and .. did that mf just build a city right near me? and all hail gandhi or else he will destroy you!",2
"very addictive game! the (expensive) gods & kings dlc is a must buy though.",2
"really fun game. you will always play one more turn....",1
"outstanding woooo! after 2 years 2k games finally fixed the multiplayer! now you can play with more than 4 people! and it actually works once in awhile! amazzinngggg p.s. brave new world is great fun, but venice is overpowered and broken in multiplayer",4
"not only do i learn something new everytime i play, but i cant stop playing!",2
"even if you dont have a life, civilization v will take it away from you. countless hours will be spent defending your empire, building it up, and dealing with the bi-polar leaders you are up against. ridiculously fun. buy it, but be warned: it will suck you in.",1
"the premier multiplayer simultaneous turn based game out there. rich in variety and options. late game is the only weakness as games may bog down, however the game is still fantastic.",3
"this is the best stradegy game i have ever played. dont hesitate to buy this, you wont regret it.",2
"what can i say about this title that hasnt already been said by its mass success as a turn-based strategy game? featuring some of the most iconic characters in history, from montezuma to george washington himself, you are able to take control of them and their respective nations and work for peace to achieve a greater good... or wreak havoc on any who dare cross your path (i usually use ghandi for that). with an extensive list of options to customize your game and a very long technology tree, this game offers replayability like no other. get together with some friends or play a solo match on god difficulty... whichever you choose, any strategy game fan will have a blast with this title. i guarantee it.",1
"great game, its also a good way to stab ur friends in the back",1
"the game has awesome gameplay, but it recently started crashing all the time after running perfectly any advice?",1
"go on. press next turn again. its calling for you. i know you cant resist. just press it.",1
"make sure you have plenty of free time because this game just eats it up.",1
"terrible, its like total war but campaign map only. no battlemechanics what so ever, even if its not a wargame it should not play like a ipad game. the tech tree is dull too. overall - really  dont buy it, totalwar rome i is much better.",1
"awesome game. great strategy, and doesnt get old. 5/5",2
"it is my first civilization game ever and im addicted!",3
"recommended game! maybe boring at first because the long text at tutorial! but after you play its not!",1
"i have wasted countless hours of my life on this game, but it was definitely worth it.",1
"good game if you want to destroy nation and take over the world",1
"simply a perfect game. buy the game, play it and be happy!",3
"one of my top 5 favorite games of all time. highest levels are always challenging. 10/10.",2
"after many hours of play i can say this game ruined my life.",1
"ok, even the base game by itself is to fun, now add dlc to mix this game is gold if your a strategic thinker!",1
"this is a great game :d addictive... played for five hours and didnt even notice that :)",1
"my review of civ v: this game is amazing!! basically what you do is: grow your empire, make friends with other empires. and when the time comes, you could fight with all the opposing empires once you have built your army. it was surprising how each country had different looking military, this game is unique and fun! definitely recommend worth your $30, go check it out its awesome and epic and is the best strategy game ive ever come across in my life. not even exaggerating, this game is so beautiful and just epic go for it",1
"great game, easy to learn with tons of variations gameplay for incredible replay value.",3
"i bought this game thinking the reviews, though exaggerated, were positive. 24 hours later, i realized i had to work in the morning. took one more turn, then another, once more, then went to work. almost fell asleep at work. got home, more turns. perfect distraction on the way to the grave. 10/10",1
"builds on the franchise with an improved gui and graphics quality. remains true to form, simple yet immersive to start. complexity scales to player experience and desire. expansions offer a whole new element making the game worth a revisit.",4
"the civ series is now more in depth than it ever was. i love it",1
"amazing game,and the expansions improve it alot to",1
"if you have never played a turn-based strategy game before make this the first one that you get. it plays beautifully and its extremely easy to learn the basics and from there you can do pretty much anything and trust me when i say the fun never ends i hope that if you get this game please play with your friends first because the online can be a scary place with unpredictable people. may your civs forever prosper (unless they are nuked) :)",1
"the god king of 4x games. this takes everything great from civ 2, 3, and 4 and puts them together fix nearly every complaint ive had about the series. it has the elegance of 2, with improved graphics, streamlined strategies, more intelligent ai and maps, and a multiplayer thats engrossed me for hundreds of hours so far. if strategy is your thing, this game is required.",3
"love the game, the graphics, and gameplay. its easy to play and fun. i give it a 5 star rating and a 10/10. anyone who loves strategy games will love this.",1
"easy to learn difficult to master as some people say. i love this game more and more with every passing hour of play. dlc adds tons of new units which is ok, but also adds spies, religions and lot more complex elements i wish i could turn off. also, ai is , convince friends as soon as possible",1
"i had to uninstall this game to keep miself from playing it",1
"where did all of my time go? i want it back, please give it back.",1
"i broke up with my girlfriend because of this game. its amazing!!",2
"ccccccccrush your enemies! raze their cities to the ground! nuke them into mud puddle drinking half-apes! or be a  and win some otherway which is losing as far as im concerned! the taste of blood this game invokes doesnt get sweeter...",1
"the complete edition of civ 5 is really a must-have. with the addition of bnw, the game finally feels like a finished, fleshed-out product. the ai of your foes is fixed and the ideologies get the attention they deserve. often i felt i was repeating actual history when faced with in-game dilemmas. 5 out of 5",2
"a great time killer with so much to do and so many valve supported mods to add to the fun!",1
"one of the best turn based strategy games ive ever played. it offers a variety of different options and a good challenge both in single and multiplayer.",3
"not much to say about civ v other than what everyone else says about it, its an awesome game!",1
"this game is absoulotly amazing it is one of the best strategy games ive played and i recommend it to anyone",1
"this is one of my favorite games. caution: extremly addicting.",3
"games can take days depending on your settings and yet i have never been bored of the game. each game is different on its own or you can proceed to victory in different ways. at this point i have spent more then 200 hours playing the game and it is the first game i install when i format my pc. if you like turn based strategies you will love this game.",2
"i bought this game recently and already sunk nearly 200 hours into it.. amazingly well structured sim.",2
"very fun, but avoid askia and gahndi, dey be untrustworthy.",1
"i do highly recommend this game to anyone who likes stratergy based games, in past civ games they werent the best but this has topped it. and its also a good laugh to play with your friends with sneaky betrayal haha.",1
"i used an iroquois lumberjack tribe to conquer the british nation, then peaced out to space before india could nuke me to death. 1/1",2
"this is an awesome game, ive played it for almost 100 hours already; and barely scrathed the surface of it! the only thing that you should know before buying this game is, it is highly addictive! definitely worth the money!",1
"its a really cool game if you like strategy games. this is a really fun strategy game, that has action but also takes a ton of thought. one downside is it takes probably 12 hours minimum for each game.",1
"this is my most played game on my steam account to date. this game has sucked 100+ hours away from me and i enjoyed every one of them. i highly recommend you pick up this game. final verdict: one of the best games i have ever had the pleasure to play",1
"civ 5 is a excellent contuination of an amazing rts game. although some games can feel like they go on forever, it is still an amazing game to sink your time into",1
"this is a great historical city builder that you half to get your hands on. the dlcs improve the game by so much, and the depth to this game is so great. this game is a must have!",1
"fantastic game, very well balanced and alot of fun in general. difficult for begineers to civlization though, there are plenty of guides and to my experience just playing on your own your way ends up to be the most fun and addictive gameplay instead of you just using a tactic that everyone else uses and trully ruining the purpose of learning the game your way, just like any individual shoulf play it, but thats only one mans opinion.its a great game, i have 510hrs played of it, and i taught myself everything about the game even though it was my first civ game i had ever played without using the internet xd.",4
"civilization has always been a god tier style conquest game. unfortunately civilization iv added a cartoony feeling that ruined the concept entirely. now comes civilization v, all the goods thing found in iii and iv combined with an awesome graphics overhaul. 5/5",1
"best game ever played. love the sratergy and the selection of countries. amazing game. plus it has nukes!",1
"why write a review of this game when you can be playing this game?",1
"i dont think ive stopped playing it yet..... just fantastico",1
"you should know whether or not you like civ games by now. if you liked civ 2, civ 3, and civ 4, civ 5 is more of the same. the series gradual flow towards simplification, polish, and tightening come to a new apex in civ 5. the new hex system has improved combat significantly, the city-states give diplomats something to do, and the whole ui is so much cleaner that - in my opinion - civ 5 is the first civ game that you can use to really introduce someone new to the series. while firaxis stubbornly refuses to release an alpha centauri 2, civ 5 is going to have to be my current large-scale strategy fix.",2
"i love this game buy it and fall in love with the power and control",3
"if youre reading this, and have not yet purchased this, go do it now. thank me later.",1
"this is one of the most addicting games that i have played. i have found myself starting to play and then looking at the clock after what felt like minutes and seeing that i had been playing for hours. it is the perfect game for anyone who loves strategy games and it plays out almost like a digital board game. my friends and i can not get enough of this game.",1
"this game is really fun, though i havent played very much. but for all those out there this game takes a really long time to play so i would suggest you make some time to play this game. i got this game about 4 days ago and ive already spent about 30 hours playing this game but all those hours were well spent creating the perfect civilizations.",1
"a great game a must have for any civ fan easy to play hard to master",1
"best strategy game created since superman 64. the warfare and how everything works is spectacular, but it has seen better days when superman 64 was the king of games.",1
"great game. it will ruin your life. seriously, buy this.",2
"paid france to declare war against my friend behind their back. friend wont play the game with me again. 10/10",1
"i played over 325 hours on this game and still havent finish half of the achievements. worth your money.",3
"i have been playing sid meiers civilization ever since it came out on dos. civ v follows the same formula that stood the test of time in any turn based 4x games. with the addition of steamworkshop, the modding community, expect hundreds of fun time playing,experimenting and wasting hours. just....one.....more......turn and its already morning.",1
"this game is pretty much one of the best games ever released. it does, however, have a major drawback: it will ruin your life. i have spent literally hundreds of hours playing this game and have no intention of stopping. anyway, is fun.",2
"absolutely timeless, if you havent played this and youre a fan of in-depth strategy with the ability to pick your game back up at any point, why haveny you played this? replayability, mods, random maps and play how you choose to. dont pass up this game!",1
"250h+ and still so much to learn, play and do! start with just civ5 and move to the expansions as you get bored with the mechanic and switch it up!",2
"i love this game!! cant wait for civ: beyond earth!! i recommend this game to anyone looking to rule the world (not in real life of course). its great fun, and very exciting to strategize in order to get what you need.",1
"i conquered all of holland when they stopped trading me citrus. venice gifted me with silk for being a great and fearsome conqueror. everything was going fine, really, until gandhi nuked me for not trading him silk and citrus. 10/10",2
"say good bye to your social life..... just saying.",4
"ive lost many hours of sleep to this game. very fun.",1
"sink hours of your life into making a lovely home <3! 10/10 who needs time for your very own world.",1
"amazig game, i didnt think that i would like it but its amazing, i love it!",1
"if i had a choice between having sex with kate upton on nantional televison or playing this game, id pick playing this game 10 times outta 10",1
"one of the all time best strategy games ive ever played",1
"time blackhole. 9/10 real review. +great turn-based rts. +managing friendship between country. -expension pack are too priced for me.",1
"been playing since civ 3, and loved every advancement.",2
"long fun games. just make sure you get all the dlc. the game is pretty useless without all dlc.",1
"quite frankly, few attributes of games ellicit such anger and discontent as those found rampantly within the broken and consistently inconsistent formula that constitutes this game, civilization v. other games offer more refined methods, with more visually and mechanically sophisticated gameplay options than can ever be conceived of within this joke of a strategy game.",1
"i dont get hooked onto many games but this is amazing!!!",1
"if you are like most civilization addicts, your story began innocently enough way back in 1991 with the discovery of sid meiers civilization by firaxis games. the original civ, as its called on the streets, and its two subsequent sequels, ii and iii, allowed you to create or conquer vast civilizations-from the dawn of man to the space age and beyond. the unique turn-based strategy game quickly became the game of choice for gamers around the world. for some, however, it became more than that...it became an addiction.",1
"this game destroyed my womb within mere seconds of installing. never before have i experience such a shrek type experience in all my years of playing games. note: this game will require the nintendo 64 expansion pak to run despite it saying otherwise.",3
"one of the best turned based games ive had the pleasure to play. it runs well though i have had more crashes than i hoped for. the game is fun with friends but can take a lot of time but you can always save it. the only problem i have with (apart from the crashes) is that to fully enjoy the game, you will have to get the dlc, gods and kings and brave new world. though its worth it.",1
"vanilla version (the base game without any mods) is broken due to a bug causing your workers to be manually reminded what they are doing at every turn in the game. so if u have 10 workers each doing a task that takes 30 turns, well get ready to sit there and issue 300 commands in stead of 10. you will get sick of that in a hurry. this didnt use to be a problem when i bought this game way back, and the bug has been solved in the expansion packs. but if u payed for the vanilla game and did not chose to spend further money on the game, well... it feels kind of like that they stole the product that you paid them money for because they broke it with a patch. or even worse: they are holding your product hostage for the price of an additional dlc.",1
"great game i greatly enjoy this game even though i have only started playing it. its very casual with minimal micro managing and an easy user interface. those of you that have played sots ii will enjoy this game. this game could have a little better graphics though with more effects(its all about the nvedia phisx particles).",1
"incredibly addictive yet peaceful. you sit down to play and then suddenly it is four hours later.",3
"fun and addictive game. doesnt do much to improve on earlier civilizations. the expansion packs are annoying because they are used by mods and are sometimes highly priced.",1
"i bought this game and played a match. its been 15 hours so far.",1
"my nuclear powered robot was killed by rifleman. apparently it was chuck norris.",1
"fantastic game, highly recommended to any fans of turn based strategy.",3
"ive now played civilization v for a year and i both enjoy and have things i dislike this game for. as a whole the game is nothing more than a significant concept. the depth of the game isnt that deep but the spirit of the original shines in this game. with a community and steam-workshop the game has unlimited content for free. its a must buy for those that likes to relax and play, i wouldnt recommend to play this with someone else but its a good option nonetheless. everytime this game gets highlighted i come back to it and play some more, like now. its out on linux/steamos and i am playing some more because of it. its a game you easily forget but a game you easily come back to as well.",2
"sic game blud. terrible to play with friends as it takes forever to finish as people always leave. like joe. yeah thanks a bunch joe.",1
"this is game is one of the most fun games that i have ever played, good for strategy game junkies, or for people who are just looking for a fun game to play. by the way, if you are going to get the game, get the gold edition. youll save a ton of money. 11 uncooked weiners/10 uncooked weiners",1
"do you like stratagy games? if so, then do not play this! its way too fun!",1
"great game, owned the x-box civ revolution first but this version is much better and more in depth. have had lots of fun playing by myself, and with friends. the hotseat multiplayer can be lots of fun!",1
"i love this game! to the point where i have to limit myself to the weekend or else ill be up all night playing it! its a great turn based strategy, in the more difficult levels you really do need to think far ahead and plot your way to victory! although its quite different to civ 4 it still has the core gameplay and feel of civilization, and over the patches and dlc have ironed out problems that most initially werent happy with. it comes highly recommended from me, but be warned, its also highly addictive.",2
"if you have friends to play this with you, its a blast",2
"amazing game 10/10 but could add more dlc expansion packs",1
"this game ia a plague, first it looks fun and harmless but then you get addicted and cant stop playing, save yourselfs",1
"honestly? this game is better than civ 4. it just is. there is no more stack of doom, hexagons make more sense on a tactical scale, and winning the game through diplomatic/peaceful means is now more of a possibility and more interactive. of all the games in my library, this one has me coming back time and time again.",3
"i found it to be a great game it makes you think and is chalengeing but now so much as to make it frustrating i adsolutly recomend it for anyone who enjoys economic strategy games.",1
"if you plan to get this, make sure you get the brave new world dlc. this pack makes the game one of if not the best civilization game.",1
"civ v is a great game filled with everything you can think of to rule a nation.",2
"while i was disapointed at first with this game and its lack of historically plausible scenarios like with total war i still found myself enjoying it immensely. even if ghandi will attack sweden without provocation.",2
"its basically like mixing peaches and apples. 10/10 would write review again.",2
"great strategy game, especialy if you have a friend to play co-op with.",1
"killed a hell of a lot of time, had a great few laughs. learned that ghandi is a prick. 10/10 would recommend",1
"whats to say that hasnt already been said? fantastic game and bane of all your future free time. i strongly recommend picking up the gold edition and the latest brave new world expansion pack to make the gameplay as complete as possible and address the issues that long-term civ fans had with the original release (religion, espionage, etc). with both expansion packs and all the add-on content, this is the best game in the series!",1
"possibly the greatest (and most addicting) turn based strategy game ever made. it has great graphics and an amazing soundtrack. i honestly am hardpressed to find anything to complain about, other than the fact that it literally eats my time.",1
"complex, addictive, fun. dont trust anybody, especially gandhi",1
"you must have enough time to play it but i love it. lol",2
"its a very fun and strategic game good for people who like strategy beacuse thats the main focus of the game",1
"hours of fun whether you love building or war mongering!",1
"well what can this girl say sid meier did it agian civ 5 great game as usual cant wait for the next this is the first civ ive picked up since 3. fun game but you need alot of time just to play and win this game which currently i dont have. if you dont mind mixing stratagy with buiding a substaning empire this this is the game for you. even if you dont like it try the more cartoon version civ revolution on the ps3 and xbox 360. good luck and hope to see all the civ fans in the next one.",1
"soooooooooooooooooooooooo adicting. best game ever.",2
"civilization v is one of the most addicting strategic simulation games youll find. you start building your simple empire, and soon will feel the pull of power just begging you to take over the world. friends become foes, their resources become yours, and nothing can stop you. 10/10 would recommend.",2
"where to begin? oh yes! two words: ing gandhi! i r8 8/8 m8 would carpet bomb babylon for stealing my great library again. in other words m80s, this is the dankest game youll ever play. if you dont buy this game, ill slap your mum.",3
"incredible game, its easy to pick up and have fun straight away. if you like risk, this game is pretty much the same since its turn based.",2
"great game, can lose a whole day playing it though",1
"spectacular game. a blast to play with friends online.",1
"great game. i have played a few of the civ games and liked them to varying degrees. civ 5 though has probably the best all around game play though. i thoroughly enjoy both the long and short run games. the workshop makes the game even more fun. i also highly recommend all the dlcs as they add a lot of unique features that increase the playability of the game and various scenarios that can be quite challenging",2
"this game is supa awesome and i have spen tway too much time playing it... so its good :3",2
"its really addicting and fun but the matches are very long and its easy to start losing interest after while. still very enjoyable though.",1
"one more turn. thats what you will keep saying even when you know you have to stop. be it total world domination or establishing diplomatic alliances, civilization is the foundation of empire dynasty building throughout the ages. the feeling of going from a group of settlers with only sticks and stones to reaching for the stars in their rockets is still not lost in this 5th outing. with new crisp and easy to distinguish detailed graphics this game is nothing but superb.",1
"this game made me pass world history with flying colors.",2
"after brave new world this game is pretty complete and would recommend getting all of them while they are on sale.",3
"i started playing to see what it was. when i saw what time it was, i had suddenly played it for 6 hours straight. amazing.",1
"i have to recommend this game because it is a really fun strategy game where you pick a civilization and win by science,culture, or world domination and every civilization has its own skills and downfalls, but i always will be in love with the french because it is in my culture!",1
"incredibly fun even with out dlc single player multiplayer what ever you play it an incredible game defenitly worth every penny you put into it",1
"the wee hours of the morning will sneak up on you while playing civilization v. highly recommended!",1
"saw american minute men get steam rolled by native american tanks. 10/10 would play again!",1
"who needds sleep? napoleon is talking junk, time to kick his derrire!",3
"this game is my time machine! enter and play for 10 minute, after exit the game, instead of 10 minutes, 10 hours already past~~~ with great mods community for this game, the replay value increased+ with lots of way to end the game, the replay value increased+ too bad, after play a while, i realised some civs are pre-set to win early, some civs are pre-set to auto win if u not harass them early but still, replay value, and magical time sink mechanic, every money u spent for this game -> worth it",1
"this is recommended! even better than prtal 2. you are capable of building a great country, and your goal: victory. i like the gameplay, graphics, and themes for empires. you should get dlc. (denmark,korea,polynesia, g+k, bnw)",3
"the rule of the not more than one unit for each emplacement is totally silly. the possibility to buy units and buildings make the gameplay strange. the game is really boring, with no interest even in mp. the only interesting aspect and improvement is on the religious matter (but you need the dlc). civ4 is far, far, far better.",1
"civilization v is really addicting! when you buy the complete edition, you save a ton of money if you want the dlc... i logged 32 hours and i just bought it this week... in my opinion, it is great, no second thoughts on this game...",1
"choose a world leader. create a civilization. make cities, name them, improve them. conquer other lands. choose your government. immortal communist george washington. great merchant steve jobs, born in 1576 to japan. a+",1
"an amazing game that gets better with each expansion",1
"civ 5 has made several changes to the base game systems. some have worked (medieveal warfare is a blast), might work (simpler happiness system) - some not (culture, ai cannot handle the 1 unit per tile rule). that being said, the game is still solid, and the major dlc (gods and kings, brave new world) has only added to the experience.",4
"amazing never has there been a bad civ and they always get better rarely do titles get better for the community because past games seem to be better take for example cll of duty ghost was hated soo much as it was compared to black ops which was amazing but civ looking back i thnk this is the best one yet the machanics are way more smother there are better graphics i love it good work sid miers anyone who loves this game should try beyond earth seriously it is amazing.",1
"this is a really good game for those who like to strategize and dont mind games that take a while. so if you like strategy and have a good amount of time, then i really think this is for you.",1
"potentially my favorite steam-enabled game of all time.",2
"great game so differnt empires so many differnt so many ways to play your game could turn around with deal that was not thought through",1
"this game really is awesome. i love the historical edge to the game, as well as the mulitple ways and difficulties to play it. it is a new experience every game, win or lose. five out of five stars. well done",1
"this game will ruin your damn life and you wont even care. great for people new to the series; everythings explained very well, and its easy to pick up.",1
"civ is one of my favorite game serise of all time. i have countless hours on all the games literaly, as i played the others on a diferent computer. ive been with the franchise since civ 2 and just reacently bought the deluxe edition of 5. im excited to figure out whats diferent from gods and kings in the brave new world expansion.",2
"this game is very addictive and also a time machine. when you start playing it in the morning you suddenly notice that its already afternoon or even later and feels like you havent even started it.",1
"ive been out of the game for a while now and recently got back into it after acqurining it in the christmas sale. i played a few hours in one go and boy oh boy is it epic :) if youre a long time fan of civilisation, youll enjoy this one all the while, lots of dlc brings hours and entertainment at a very reasonable price too!!",1
"i love it. i love it. i love it. thank you for making this game. 10/10 makes me wanna go out and command people to move a tile forward",1
"this game is beautiful. does it really need another recomendation? im sure youve heard of it or seen gameplay. one of hte absolute best turn-based stratgey game. p.s. if you get the gods and kings expansion, be prepared to look at an ugly pubic haired jesus wanna-be staring off into the sunset wandering where his life went wrong every time you start the game up... freaking hated seeing his face.",1
"a game that makes me feel great. creating the single most authoritarian superior atheist society on the planet, while i send my crusade of euphoric intelligence across the planet in a stream of blood, tears, and nukes. all in the name of chairman walrus. all hail the hail the master of euphoria 7/10 it was okay",1
"im normally not a big fan of these types of strategy games with my add... but i ended up putting in 100+ hrs on this bad boy! great game for a newcomer to the series. pros: easy to get in to and the learning curve was more forgiving than i thought it might be cons: the diplomacy aspect of the game was non-existent and winning by the new brave new world options was very complicated",1
"this game sucks so bad i never even bothered to download it -14/10",2
"very fun. scenarios are cool and definatly worth it",1
"amazing game through and through. cant wait for the next installment.",3
"this game is perfect if you have hours to kill because it is easy to get lost in it. a very rewarding game. and the mods for it are amazing!",3
"its awesome but takes a loooong time and when i finaly got to a gun i crashed d: although i recommend it!",1
"its civ. i dont love it quite so much as i loved civ iv, but for my marriages sake, thats probably a good thing.",1
"let out your inner world leader. great time killer.",1
"made me lose track of time whilst an apocalypse happened around me 10/10 would play again",1
"this game will take away all of your time. not spare time, all of your time.",3
"really fun and challenging. when you get the hang of it there is endless amounts of fun to be had such as ghandi taking over the world with a massive army, having ghangis khan be diplimatic, or making other ridiculous scenerios come true.",2
"the only other civilisation i have played was back in the dos days... you know, civilisation or civ.exe. this is game is exactly as i remember it from back then. even the controls seems to be the same f fortify, space skip turn, etc... im ecstatic. my wife much less, though i havent seen her much since i started playing...",1
"this game is very entertaining, and i recomend it to anyone. i dont like turn based games, but this game is so well done and so entertaining that i never even notice that i have to wait for turns. the npcs move so fast, its almost like you never stop being in control. there are so many unique strategies to follow and the outcome of any two games are never alike. this is a spectacular game, and if i were you, i would seriously consider getting it.",1
"if your the type of gamer thats into slow-pace, turn based, strategy games, then i would recommend giving this game a try. its full of suprises and fun packed battles that will keep you coming back for more.",3
"a brilliant game. on the higher levels, it is challenging, yet just as addictive. multiplayer gameplay is amazing, especially with expansion packs enabled, however, make sure you (and your partner/s) have a stable internet connection, as the game may have a tendancy to drop mid-way through. there are many mods available for this game and i adivse you all to check them out. i am an avid fan of sid meier and cannot wat to see what they come out with next. definately recommended.",1
"to be honest, i prefered civilization iv until the release of brave new world : this add-on makes the game much better than the original one (or even gods and kings) ! still, the game without any add-on is good, but at least take the gold edition, not so more costly than the basic one. :-)",1
"logged hundreds of hours on this game. tbs and even rts gamers will not be dissapointed.",3
"amazing game! all of the replay value ever, each game is different, great ai, game looks very nice as an added bonus. a must get, nuff said",1
"this is a very fun and addicting game! some things can be unlikable, like the hexagons, but you can disable that. all in all, this is totally worth it. reserve at least 5 hours at a time when you play; theres no such thing as one more turn.",1
"it is my favorite of the series. it simplifies the game compared to 3 and 4 which was always a turn off to me. the matches will last a good 8+ hours even if its against a computer. 8/10 for me.",1
"very good game, a shame there are almost no nordic/germanic civs in standard. got gold now!",1
"one of the best games i have ever played. incredibely fun when playing with friends.",1
"as a huge civ 4 fan, i recommend sid meiers civilization v if you want to take this franchise to the next level. the graphics are far more beautiful, the soundtrack more inspiring and certain game elements, such as hex-based grid, let you strategize in new fulfilling ways. i also like that the leaders are voiced in their native languages, what i dont like is how time-consuming this game can be. seriously, civ 5 has the power to keep you enthralled for hours on end. it really is that good. one other thing, low-end machines can run the game in direct x 9, which is great if you dont have a powerful monster at your side :)",1
"the original civ 5 was... okay. the first expansion was a nice improvement, but nothing special. the second expansion (brave new world) blew my mind. this is now, in my opinion, the best civilization game ever released. theres extremely satisfying depth and variety (lacking when the game was first released) without the need to micromanage every minute detail as in previous versions. the premade scenarios are varied, challenging, and enjoyable. there are also hundreds of (often obscure) achievements to obtain from all facets of the game. if you enjoy turn based strategy games (or think you might) theres literally hundreds of hours of enjoyment to be found here. one of my favorite games ever.",5
"spent nearly 600 hours playing this game, where did my life go? e_e",4
"think board game without the messy packing and maintaining of pieces. think semi-intelligent, competitive ais. think age of empires and empire earth rolled into one, minus rts. time consuming, but when it comes down to pitboss (turn based multiplayer you can come back to any time), youll keep going, one more turn! this is a game for you if you excel at planning and predicting other players moves. just think chess that includes worker pieces, and against up to 31 other players.",1
"so addicting. i find myself playing for hours on end. 10/10",1
"ing great but dont ever play it with friends because you will hate them by the end of the game",1
"surpassing 250+ hours and counting, civ v is and will continue to be the greatest strategy game of all time. nothing ive ever come across can top the attention to detail, the vast number of playable nations, or the replayability of civilization v and ive played a lot of strategy games. theres a reason this is #1 on my steam list for games played. its outstanding.",2
"it is a very good pick if your into strategic games. you can wage war or peace with other nations and peoples and eventually rule the world wether it being by scientific dicovories or just being the best civilization there is. will you rule the world?",1
"this is a very good game. almost all my friends have it, so this review is near pointless. i am only writing it to let you all know that once you have aquired the dlc, the levels of fun will be doubled. brave new world (bnw) really brings a new meaning to immersion when you get down to it. without bnw, this game is simply just no where near as fun as it could be. so get bnw. yeah. thats it. have fun.",3
"specific historical accuracy aside, civ gives you a quick look at all of human history. a very addicting game, dont be suprised when you look at the clock and realize that a couple of hours have passed.",1
"this is one of the best strategy games i have ever played. at this point i have clocked around 700 hours of gameplay and i still only really feel like im scratching the surface of all it has to offer. the single player is great, the multiplayer is great. it does take a considerable amount of time/patience/dedication to actually finish a game - quite often they can literally go on for days. if youre looking for a strategy game with mountains of content, challenging scenarios, and endless hours of entertainment then civ v is for you! youll never be able to stop . . . just one more turn . . . .",4
"> build the great wall of portugal > lose the nuclear arms race to gandhi > bring the tenets of judaism to every corner of germany > construct the great pyramids of honolulu > make ethiopia the most well fed civilization in the world > share your crabs with friends to make them happy 10/10, would give crabs to queen isabella again.",1
"this is game is simple amazing, never gets old. if you love history and being creative this is the game for you.",4
"my most favrouite game ever love it love keep up the good work guys",1
"worth every penny, really brings out your curiosity and....mental strive for world domination and violence.",1
"if you are looking for a relaxing, turn-based, high replay value, time eating game then you have come to the right place. just one more turn.",1
"this game can be summed up in one phrase: one more turn! so addictive that this one quote will be repeated so many times you wont even notice. awesome graphics, animations and soundtrack and one of the few games that not only welcomes but encourages the use of mods, adding massive amounts of gameplay to a game that already can give hundreds of hours of entertainment on its own.",2
"a great strategy game. a must have for fans of the genre.",1
"love this game. 500+ houres loged. single player is fun but i would recomend getting a bunch of your friends together every once and a while on ts or steam chat and go at it for a while. beware however that this game will test those friendships!!",3
"what can you say about civ v? if you dont already have this....buy it. addictive as anything and so much fun. yes its an rts but the turns dont get in the way. you will want to win on each and every civilization available.",1
"very good game, really recomend. i love how you can see units fighting.",2
"im going to try and keep this review short. so ill just start by saying, this game doesnt cease to amaze me. if your interested in buying it, i would highly recomend it. the only downside is multiplayer, which is often secluded from the vanilla version of the game, as out of the servers open for playing, most require mods. but overall, a very good game. it nevers stops being fun, and is brilliant for strategy lovers.",2
"good game with lots of dlc and content , very fun to play with friends.",1
"the game is a dream, what else to say. it is a pity that in addition to the presence of pain in the  of the enemy, and the fact of robbery hunting traders little useful.  of",1
"make sure you have plenty of free time because this game just eats it up.",1
"absoutly love this game. it has a playstyle that will keep you hooked for hours just wanting one more turn. if you have got 8 hours to kill i reccomend sitting down and playing this game.",1
"great but takes a long time and might get boring after consecutive sessions.",1
"want time to suddenly fly out of your grasp? looking for a game that will suck away your soul? this is the game for you! (seriously, i lose my life ten hours at a time. this is both awesome and horrifying. buy now.)",3
"brilliant game for you and or friends. even if your friend leaves the game and doesnt want to play anymore, youre able to carry on playing as their slot is taken over by an ai. the only problems that occur for me is when the game progresses on the big maps e.g. earth. as the animations stop, along with most of the sound. 9/10 :)",1
"great game. be sure you have the operating system to run it though. it can be quite the load.",2
"fun game that you can play for hours on end and never get bored.",1
"great and fun game! a definate buy for the collection!",1
"fun strategy game. would reccomend to any fan of the series or to any turn based strategy in general.",2
"amazing stragey game! love it build your nation your way! so good!",1
"a game that when you say, more of the same. is the highest reccomendation you can give it.",1
"this game is very fun. it has alot of ways to play the games and alot of ways to win. but the game is funnest when you have all of the dlc. you should definitly get this game if you like strategy.",5
"very fun and interesting. the game runs well and has an interesting gameplay style. but sometimes the trades can be total bs",2
"136 hours in and still loving it. cant imagine it ever being boring.",2
"really tried to get into this game after playing previous titles but its just not as good.",1
"its basically civilization 4, only now with shiny graphics and less  to do.",1
"hope you dont have much to do, because this game will suck you in! i downloaded it because it came with my pc purchase, and good grief - next thing i knew i had over 100 hours logged on the game. excellent play, great graphics, tons of add-ons.",2
"this game is one of the best strategy games out there. it is easy to learn but hard to master. ive put about 150 hours into and ive not regretted any of it. there are plenty of difficulties to play on depending on your skill level. however vanilla civilizations ai can be very aggressive and the funnest victiories are domination and science. the diplomacy and culture victories are boring to get. for the best experience, get at least brave new world too. it comes with all of god & kings features, but lacks some civilizations to play as. if you have enough, id definitalley recommend picking up the gold edition and brave new world.",2
"just.... one... more... turn.... *looks out the window to see its light outside*.... why are you so addicting, civ5?",4
"okay, ill just make a water mill in my new city, and its 5 in the morning already?",2
"very original game which has brought lots of fun memories for me and my buddies :) if you want a strategic game based on real time events, buy this!",1
"bada bap bap im hating it! because the way you play god if i were to be given a timemachine i would go back and not buy this game!!!!",1
"a most excellent rts. my first civ game, most definetly not my last !!!",1
"this game is suck worth is. now it is not as much worth it if you dont get the gold edition. anyway if you like rts games and dont own this, own this!",2
"one more turn.... just one more turn... just one more-- oh, whats that? ive been here for four hours? oh well, im already running late, just one more turn shouldnt hurt... and maybe one more after that...",1
"when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold, dyes, and ivory, take my advice. ready all your tanks and nukes, arm them, and shoot them like your life depends on it. they are evil, traitorous demons. never trust them. however, genghis khan is my best friend. he came up to me and was all like, de full do bu la chi mendo. and i said, okay! lets be friends! i can never understand that guy, but something about our relationship just works. ghandi hating simulator 2014 11/10",1
"amazing game. the learning curve is not high and its replayable and fun.",2
">so many hours. >game is good. >think its a life simulator. >no gurls. >fap to gandhi(dem robes) >he finds out. >nukes me. >gandhi is an .",1
"good game, not as good as civ iv, but good none the less",4
"fun, but buggy graphics wise. i have a lower end laptop. tech support was less than helpful. even so, i found the problem and enjoy the crap out of the game!",2
"this is the first game i got on steam and it is very fun and has many but also quite time consuming and can get repetitive after a few rounds",1
"this is a good starter to get into the strategy based games. its enjoyable and will suck up allot of your time without you realising it. i dont feel that the addon packs are all that worth it though, what is included with the game is more then enough.",1
"destroy hours worth of your friends hard work with nukes in high definition.",3
"wanted to wait a while before writing a review...so let me start out by saying i highly recommend you add this game to your library. this game does a great job of teaching you various ways of how to play the game. i wont spoil too much...but i will say keep an eye on your real world clock/time. you can lose 6 hours just casually playing this game...which i find a little troubling. if you are an adult with no children or house-mates...do remember to step away to eat and sleep. * do try and remember these words *",1
"with all the dlc and amazing care taken to make this game the masterpeice it currently is has paid off. this is a must play for any fan of strategy games.",3
"youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you, but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter. 20/10",1
"one more turn.. aaaaaand its monday. amazing game. my first civ game in fact, so nothing to compare to. but cant wait for the next one.",1
"ive really liked civ 5 a lot. ive been going around buying a lot of reasonably cheap games recently trying to find something i can really be dedicated to and civ 5 hit me on every intrest level. its a game of politics, economics, war, ideology, and trading. i love all of the historical leaders you can trade with, become allies with, go to war with, or be one of them. i played march of war which made me not a huge fan of turn based games. civ 5 completetly changed my mind bringing a whole new meaning to the term turn-based for me. the only thing i would really say was bad in this game is the multiplayer. i strongly advise you just make a game with freinds and organize it if you want to have a successful online game. if you want to just play with anyone you want then it will probably crash or people will quit. overall this game is a 9/10",1
"tis a great game if your a strategey fan (turn based games) and if you know your way with money, its great with freinds and i highly recommend it to you and your freinds.",1
"welcome to civilization v! where everyone wins by conquest and the points dont matter.",1
"amazing game, extremely addicting and fun. just dont play it without the brave new world expansion, it adds really nice stuff and fix a lot of problems in the base game and gods and kings expansion. totally worth it to buy the complete edition when its 50% off. :)",3
"if you are prone to addictions, do not buy this game. 10/10 would get addicted again.",1
"i have a hard time not falling into the same path everytime with this game>start civ with goal>abandon goal for shiny wonders>lose to other civ due to lack of ingame points. but, ive spent a lot of hours doing that same exact thing whilst having fun, so this game must be doing something right. 9.5/10",1
"more than 800 hours.....my life guys....no i have shared it with my family. but as someone who has above 800 hours of this game on there account trust me when i say best pc game of the year. simple. cant wait for more.",4
"all my history lessons amount to nothing compared to what i have learnt in civ. rulers live for eternity with little or no challange by the people, often leading to the peoples death. ghandi is infact a warmongering dictator who enjoys watching your people suffer as his elephants destroy you fields and despite the advance in technology some of these immortal tyrants still chose to have a spear and stand outside of a mudhut when talking to you about research agreeements and trading oil. the most important thing to take from civ is that fact we dont have many years left on this world. the end of the world isnt 2012 but instead 2050.",1
"nuked america as japan. revenge tastes good. best history game on steam. 12/10- tons of dlcs",1
"great game to play solo, and even better with friends!",1
"this game is damn-near perfect, especially with the brave new world expansion. the only thing holding back perfection is that hitler is not the german leader. its perfectly fine to have ghengis khan, who  and murdered his way across europe, but hitler is totally not cool cause he might offend some sensitive-sally. makes perfect sense.",2
"took over america. renamed philidelphia flip-a-delphia and washington byyyaaahhh!!! 10/10 would bang again.",1
"they make it easy to mod the game with built in search tools to browse mods guess that is why i have 600+ hours logged in... 750 hours and counting and with the expansions it is like a whole new game",4
"great game! turn based strategy reaches its maximum level in civilization series and civ v inherits all basic characteristics of previous games, adding some new game mechanics that render the game even more enjoyable. good variety of units and buildings, good managing of technological improvements, interesting combat mechanics... those are just a few aspects that make the game worth to be played. possible improvements may be related to greater customization of units and building for each civilization, not just 1 or 2 unique units, but maybe a complete unique tree of evolving units, several unique buildings or dedicated technologies, just to differenciate the gaming experience for each selected civilization. multiple end goals make it possible to define your own strategy of winning, without requiring you to obliterate your enemies or expand throughout the whole game map. cant wait for civ vi! :)",1
"i buy game. i like game. i love game. you do anything to my game i hate you. i hate you i invade you. you ghandi. you nuke me. i invade you. you nuke me. im sad. 10/5 best game",2
"civilization v is the great strategy game youre can make a big civilization and social with other civilizations youre can fight with them or be friendly all decisions i yours",1
"this game is great, but not worth it unless you get the expansion packs.",1
"the game where one more turn leads to hours of gameplay. first playthrough took ten hours. you wont get bored, guaranteed.",1
"good fun and taught me more about history than highschool",2
"civ v is a unike game. i have played this game alot because it brings a lot of old memories back from age of empires. just with a few friend you can get more than 30 hours of fun easely. you can make the game hard or easy because the ais are just soo good! :d",1
"well made game with a mostly intuitive interface and great game mechanics. some minor glitches that can be resolved with mods and it just feels so satisfying taking over another civilization and claiming the continent to yourself! also the interaction between leaders adds an interesting perspective and convinces you that these are real civilizations you are blowing up with your giant death robots.",1
"a game where ghandi will nuke all your cities 10/10",1
"literally hundreds of hours of potential gameplay and content in here, and it only gets better.",1
"this game will get you playing for a long time, at times it gets old and i play some other game but it always comes back at any moment to be a fun and entertaining game. the dlc are slighty expensive but it puts a lot more purpose into the game and makes it all around funner. i would for sure recommend this game.",2
"one of the best games ive ever played totally recommend it!",2
"amazing turn base stratergy game, can get lost in it for hours",1
"ive spent an unhealthy amount of time playing rome and invading neighboring countries for spices to dabble my olive oil coated bottom in.",1
"basically the crack cocaine of strategy games. do not be surprised if you spend significantly more time than you planned playing this game-- last night i was planning to go to sleep at midnight and stayed up until 4 am playing this (lucky its the weekend!) if you arent familiar with civilization, its a series that basically takes risk to its absolute extreme-- you enter each game as one of the many civilizations available and proceed to try to win the game through military might, diplomatic superiority, scientific excellence, or becoming the cultural capitol of the world. with all the available expansion packs, these are all well balanced and viable options. definitely recommend.",1
"hard to learn, but when i get to know the game and learn basic stuff it very fun.",1
"good, and a great time killer, play as any world leader, from ghandi, to washington",1
"one of the best ways to spend a day, literally. you will spend at minimum 8 hours playing this game once you have it. be warned.",1
"great way to pass some free time. whats not to like about attempting world domination? get this game.",1
"not as good as fall from heaven, but quite excellent. the diplomacy especially makes this perhaps the best civ of all time.",1
"one of my favorite games of all time. definitely on my top 10 list. this game is so fun that hours seem to turn into seconds, and it is also the reason why sid meier is one of my favorite people in the world.",1
"hands down the best strategy dame to date, especially when you have both expansion packs. brave new world adds mind boggling diplomacy and trade features that make this game top notch.",1
"best game i have ever played. ( i dont paly to many games. tight on money)",2
"an awesome game that has been loved for ages through all the games it has",1
"this game is great!! huge time sink, you think just one more turn then before you know it an hour has gone by. highly recommend it!!! just make sure you have plenty of time.",1
"yes this game is very awesome dont ask questions just buy with all expansions. ive only been disappointed with the fact theres no germ warfare or chemical warfare. heres tip for you guys though dont trust the siam or the aztecs.",2
"great turn based strategy game. very in-depth with lots of worthwhile dlc available that adds significatly to gameplay.",1
"fun, but buggy graphics wise. i have a lower end laptop. tech support was less than helpful. even so, i found the problem and enjoy the crap out of the game!",2
"i love this game. it has an awesome soundtrack, great mod support, and really addicting gameplay",1
"if declaring war on everyone as gandhi isnt realistic, i dont know what is.",1
"better than civ 4 so far. no more unit stacking makes military victories easier. culture rush is nerfed. even cities without any units can bombard barbarians. no more transports needed to travel overseas is very nice. no more religions. the social policies are simpler too. a-",1
"amazing strategy game, nothing bad to say realy however you need alot of spare time to complete a game.",1
"i have over 200 hours between me and my roommate invested in this game. it will eat your soul, and is a totally awesome advance over the previous installments. i really love how you can actually use tactics in civ v, because 1: it uses hex tiles for the map, and 2: you can have only one military unit per tile. it makes flanking and cutting off supply mean something in game. the tech tree fells a bit weird (i dont recall other civ games allowing you to advance up to steam power before you even had steal.) but its still pretty fun to mess with. youll play through this game many times (or at least start a ton of new ones) before you get it all, but its a learning experiance worth doing. this game is worth every penny. a great advance in the civilization world.",4
"very fun and addicting, but the complete edition really shouldnt be $50, i recommend getting it when its on sale.",1
"i got the game and steam when i hit play i choice the version but then i dosent work help",1
"very fun! excellent graphics, and an easy control scheme. definitely worth purchasing! :)",1
"another civilization. quality strategy game, but yeah, its still much of the same thing so if youre burnt out on the typical civ-take-over-the-world gameplay, you may want to try something different. its been a few years since i played a civ game so i dont know if this was implemented in civ4 and i dont remember it, but i really like the new mechanics for religion and diplomacy. espionage too is much more fair. i bought the gold edition so i get to play as a civilization that is sometimes shunned -- the vikings! another terrific civilization. if you played the older verisons, youll learn quickly. if youve never played civilization, youre missing out. maybe the best turn-based strategy series ever designed exclusively for the pc?",2
"grand strategy at its finest without being too complicated. great fun alone or with friends and easy to pick up. just beware that its a time sapper. before ones knows whats happen 12 hours have past and the game still isnt finished.",1
"though my power level is only in the 700+ range, i will have a blast rising towads the stronger fighters in this realm",4
"amazing strategy game, increcibly adaptable to any play style, excellent multiplayer adaptability, and it doesnt get old once you beat it. you simply can replay the game again and again and it will never be the same thing twice. i would highly reccomend this game along with all of its dlcs.",1
"its really addicting and fun to play with your friends!",1
"was very apprehensive about getting into such a deep game. not complicated and an amazing amount of fun though. a.i. is diverse and i will hurt spain if they dont stop warmongring!",2
"unless you dont have the patience for the initial learning curve, or for the turn-based style of the game, get civ v with all the expansions--well worth it. it the most engaging time-suck ive experienced.",2
"fun fun fun get the game its very fun and you can start a world war and trade with other countries.",1
"this game is an accurate roleplaying game through time that will keep you clicking for hours on end.",1
"the game can be a little boring without any of the dlcs but with gods and kings and/or brave new world it is a masterpiece.",3
"not the most complicated or in depth strategy game out there but, defintely worth every one more turn you take.",2
"i dont think its as good as 4 bu its still fun :) one more click.....",1
"if you like a game that you have to think this is the game for you",1
"yes however, a lot of maniupulative online bugs have been found",2
"this is an awesome strategy game. i havent played any earlier civ games so i cannot comment on how it compares, but it definitely ranks in my favourite strategy games.",1
"a really good game that is hindered by some big issues. go play iv or iii, wait until they have worked out the kinks in the next installment. simple as that, i like a lot of the additions, especially hexes, but the game still needs a lot of work.",1
"play a game where all 12 players are playing as ghandi. game crashes. nuclear weapon/10",1
"good game. warning may cause you to not stop. 10/10",1
"i have played this game twice, which is why i have 11 hours of gameplay. gg sid meier.",1
"i you havent bought the game, buy. if you havent played the game, play.",3
"very good game if you like strategy, you can have rounds that last a couple hours or can last weeks depending on your preference. lots of detail in the playing map and the gui is very easy to use. highly suggested if you like playing strategy games.",1
"simply awesome, one of the best games ever, i mean its not overly complicated and not too simple at the same time. once you learn the basics, it is fantastic!",1
"if your lookingfor a strategy game with almost endless possibilites becasue of the steam workshop. your in luck!",1
"the first game ive ever played for 3 hours striaght 10/10",1
"this is a very fun game to play with your friends or by yourself.",1
"if you get this amazing game be sure to clear your schedule. but this game is a freaking amazing game that will have you spending hundereds of hours on.",2
"i love this game. it is the type of game that you can take a break from and come back to it weeks later and feel as if it were your first time. there is an infinite amount of ways to adjust the difficulty and no two games ever play the same. you may strive for world dominance and yet find yourself a cultural empire that is winning the hearts and minds of the youth around the world. a must buy if you like strategy games. just check out my hours logged...",3
"be aware, this is a time machine. one...more....turn...................................",3
"one of the best turn base strategy games ever created. if youre into stategy games than this is a must!",3
"really fun game...tbs game and from a great maker.",1
"an amasing experiance thatis worth the price for thousands of howers of potenchal gameplay",1
"very easy to get invested into this game. put on a movie, or season of a tv show and play this on the side and time will fly. after winning a couple times on easy and losing a couple times on hard its fun to transpher over to online multiplayer where you can play with your mates from class.",1
"its a great game till gandhi gets a nuke so make sure hes gondhi before he can do manhattan",2
"this is a great game. i played it while it is briefly free, and i wish to purchase it. i recommend this to anyone who likes strategy games.",1
"the most magestic game i have ever played. 101/100",2
"great game, the vast amount of ways to win and loose in this game make it full of replayabilitie to play as diffrent civilizations. games can last for hours and the back stabbing, the secret relations, war, this game is just fantastic. the game can get a little slow in the start, especialy if you are playing alone but it really pics up a few turns in especially if you play with freinds. if you play you will have a complete distaste for barbarians after you experience this game, 8/10.",1
"great for those who like a game where the key to winning is either brute strength or working with other civilizations and you get to see some special things that history may not teach you",1
"one of my most favoriet strategy games of all time",2
"this is amazing, a huge improvement over civ 4. the graphics are way better, and the hexagon like grid system makes it alot easier to move around. you can see mountains through the fog, the game no longer continually nags you to build unit a when you want unit b, gameplay is fast and fluent and it steam workshop support is a big plus. my only issue is that there is no way to turn off the camera moving when the mouse is at the edge of the screen. i seriously recommend this to anyone who has played any previous civ game, or any fans of the rts genre",1
"the game is magnificent any fault in the game you can probablly find a mod for. and tons of extra goodies added in from the other civs, no longer will you have to worry about that one guy who just builds millions of cities. and than spams cheap units. because now there is one unit per tile, and maintainence on armies. only problems i find with the game is that i cant get krakatoa in my games and gandhi keeps f****** nukeing me!!!",5
"fun in depth game. if you dont like turned based games then this isnt for you. the dlcs expand the game alot and add alot more to it. you will learn to hate the world congress if you do not own it. and no matter what you do on the higher dificulties like imortal and diety, you will struggle. but you will go out with a bang. or you play lower level and are equal to everyone. or basic and destroy everyone",2
"good for unwinding after a long day. great for playing with people whos ping has suddenly increased to such a level that makes playing other multiplayer games impossible. this game rewards long-term planning and strategizing, as well as the ocasional what the heck, im just going to nuke everyone scenario.",1
"best turn based stratergy out there. if you have friends with skype tell them to get this game and play it with them, you will have countless hours of fun and then just be dominated by that guy!",1
"a crazy addictive game that will have you playing day after day to refine your play style and skill. truly a great game and a big improvement on the last game in my opinion. this is the sort of game that you could leave for a few months and come back to and still enjoy. tones of replayability and enough options to make each game completely unique. 9/10",2
"awesome game. full of history and interesting gameplay. tons of achievements, too.",1
"fantastic visuals! such an easy game to just dive right into and just hit play now! easy to be good at, difficult to master. online play is an absolute train wreck however.",1
"seriously, if you played age of empires, and you loved it, but wanted more, this is the game for you. its so freaking good, i cant stop playing it >~<",4
"this game is amazing i love every bit it is so much fun but it can be hard to get to know the game but after that it is an amazing experience there is so much detail and so many choices to be made",1
"this game lets you act out your anger on the chinese by building a mass army and taking over their cities and renaming them stuff like land of the small weewees 10/10 goty",1
"as you can see by how many hours ive played this game, i definitely recommend it to anyone who likes this type of game.",5
"civ v is a slow-paced strategy game that has nearly infinite replayability. its even more fun if youre a history buff. ive played it vanilla, with the g&k expansion, and now with bnw, and these two expansions improve it significantly. i wouldnt recommend starting it up without at least g&k, its just a tad too barren without it, and religion is a really fun mechanism. dont be thrown by the initial complexity- civ is a game that will reward your attempts to figure it out.",2
"completely addictive game! can sit down and play for hours without even realising. recommend to anyone",1
"i recomend this game if you have atleast 3 solid days to dedicate to it, otherwise youll be like its friday, time to get down on some video games... oh , i missed work yesteday, this is gonna be an awkward tuesday",1
"i would like this game. played hours to conquer civilizations and i think its fun.",1
"awesome game. it is definetly something you have to play as a gamer who loves strategy and economics.",1
"amazing game if you want to do a world domination game with friends or a.i.",1
"great game but it crashes here and there dose anyone know if there is a patch out for it to get it to stop crashing while playing. dose not happen all the time tho.",3
"this game is super complicated and hard to learn but its fun so theres that.",1
"i spent 7 hours on the tutorial alone, constantly realising i hadnt fathomed the sheer depth of this game at all! so many possibilities, so little time... must play!",1
"10/10 this game is so cool. i would get it if it was on sale or not it is so good",1
"one...more...turn...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. problem: several of the steam achievements appear to be broken. the game itself is fantastic (definitely go for gods and kings - the extra features are certainly worth it).",1
"sid meier still get it, civ 5 is awesome ! with the first addon gods and kings it kicked civ4 from my favorite place of all civilization parts (played 1, net, 2, 3, 4 and 5). new tactics with a few changes like the hexagon fields on the map, only one military and only one civil unit on one field. great looking graphics and still one of the best gui i ever used in a strategie game. top !",3
"this is the worst civ ever. do not waste your money. iv beats it all around. this was just a lazy pile of junk that got dished out to make some quick cash. last time i ever spend money on any civ game period.",1
"this is possibly one the best games ive ever played in my life, the modding community is brillaint and ive spent more than 339 hours playing it... do i recommend it? hell yeah!",2
"after playing for over 200 hours, i can tell you that this is one of the best games of all time.",2
"god i love this game... im a real sucker for history and civilization v is everything i want from a game; strategy (you need some brains to play), its rich in history and you can spend hours playing it on your own or with friends, both are awesome ways to spend an evening. i couldnt recommend this game more",3
"dont let the title fool you. this is actually not trusting gandhi simulator 10/10 would get rekt by gandhi again.",1
"a fun game that is recommended to people that like building crap",1
"i really love this game. i highly recommend it. each new civ game just gets better and better.",3
"love it! really great game. i recomment it to anyone who likes strategie games.",1
"this game, the successor to the widly successful civilization iv, is even better in some respects. with gods and kings and brave new world, the diversity and playability of this game never ceases to amaze me. a good multiplayer match on civ v is one of the best ways i can waste my time.",2
"hands down: best civ ever! and it gets better with every expansion pack. never played civilization? then you missed out on a lot. but dont worry, just start with civ v, its awesome.",4
"this game manages to make running a nation really fun by making it really streamlined and well organized. you can be the power-crazed warmonger who rushes nukes in the technology tree, or the peaceful type who just wants to get the highest amount of gold without getting in anyone elses way.",1
"im not one for long reviews, so heres the simple review: vanilla civ 5: 6.5/10 has the potential, but doesnt perform. ai makes questionable moves is the primary thing, as well as no religion. civ 5 with either the gods and kings dlc, brave new world dlc or both: 9.8/10 with either one of the expansions, one of the greatest turn based strategy games ever made. adds new buildings, wonders, civs, religion, balancing, tweaking and ai putting up a challenge. just superb.",1
"be prepared for the game that can take anywhere from 1 hour to about 40 hours. this game has many aspects to it that make it fantastic, and even better with brave new world dlc, like trade routes, tourism, or religion. each civ has a different playstyle, and this grants for a new, refreshing experience every time you play.",1
"as a fan of the entire civilization franchise, civ v ranks up there as one of, if not the very best. many functionalities have been streamlined while most core elements remained, providing a true civ experience, with rich depth that was almost lacking in pervious iterations. brave new world expo is a must, as it adds the perfect amount of customization and choice to the player for it to be one of the best 4x games out there. loved the game and would reccomend it to anyone.",2
"on the one hand, this game is incredible. on the other, its near-impossible to stop. so.. maybe... dont buy it? it will eat your life.",1
"i really enjoyed this game, but it takes a very long time to play a single game.",1
"this game just keeps getting better and better with every new release. i am a huge strategy gamer, and this next to age of mythology, are the best strategy games out there. this one focuses more on the cities, than just building armies and conquering, which to me seems more realistic in regards to doing what you want to do.",1
"the civilization games were always top notch, and the following always better than the previous. the civ5 has one downside compared to civ4 - abscense of the planet view. that was fun. aside from minor differences they are pretty much the same - quite good, balanced and both easy to grasp and variative, - games. i totally recomend it, but only with all dlc and gods and kings addon. without those theres just no reason to get it instead of civ4. and when it comes to it, the game is massively overpriced. to my mind, for no reason except love of the fans for the series.",1
"sure, it starts out slow, but once you take out an entire nation you know, you just know, that this game was made for you.",1
"an absolute time killer! :) mulilayer games take a bit long though!",1
"this is the best game ever! in my opinion it is the best strategy game ever!",1
"the game is addictive and fun to play. you can easily spend 100 of hours into the game.",3
"to anyone who hasnt played the civilization series, i definitely recommend it. building whole civilizations and destroying others, while choosing your path (militaristic, cultural, etc), building wonders, are a few of things that make this game addictive. the mechanic of having fairly short-term goals under a main longer-term goal makes you forget time and this is the game that inspired the termone more turn. :d",1
"this games preatty epic. you can win by compleating the utopia projgect, compleating the space race, being the most successful by the year 1900, or my favorite, becoming warlord and nuking everything mwahahahahah!!!!!!!!!",3
"the best strategy game ever continues to be the best strategy game ever. ive become a god.",1
"the gameplay stayed the same over the years but why change things if it works?. graphics got better, mechanics got finetuned, things added, things dropped. still a pleasant game for a lazy day at home. ...and no, i dont know either what happened to civ iv :p",1
"one of the best games on steam hands own! i cant stop playing it!",2
"this is a good strategy-turnbased game were you start as a great leader of a civilization. even though it is a very good game by it self i would recomend getting th expansion pack brave new world as it adds lots of new and interesting content",1
"easily one of my favorite games, but beware! most begin playing and then realize 10 hours later that they should really go to bed or work or something, but you just gotta finish this war or found that last city and get your happiness up. its easy to fall down the hole of ill just take this one last turn and then im turning it off and continue to do that for hours. great game. if you love strategy games, youll love civ v. highly recommend the gods and kings and brave new world bundles which will really expand your game play options and keep it fresh.",2
"this is the strategy game to own although the matches take a very long time to finish (up to 2-3 days) its well worth it every match is different. there is almost no glitches what so ever so its a very smooth game to play and a wide vareity of things to do",1
"yes yes yessssss! there is nothing like the satisfaction of dropping your first nuke in this game!",1
"just add this game to your cart. then during checkout, choose a friend to receive your gift.... and they will both love you and hate you for the rest of their computer-chair bound life.",2
"*do not buy this game if you have no self control or are really stubborn. with that being said, it has been a while since i have gotten this addicted to a game, my only complaint is that i have stayed up way to late playing a game because i have to keep taking turns! a fun game and its laid back! so yeah, i reccomend this if you dont want to have a social life any more!",2
"this game is so immersive i lost my wife to it for 3 months.",1
"pretty good game, if you do not play with frank g.",1
"get the game if you like this type of game because it is fantastic",1
"this game is a turn based strategy title based on actual history. it makes learning history fun as you take control of countries as far back as the ancient era and rule them in your own way.",1
"we shall be as gods, watching over our people. guiding them to new eras of peace and prosperity. then ghandi went and dropped a nuke on me, who even does that?",1
"i love this game by far the best game you can get for wartime fun. the strategy that goes into building your empire up and making everyone happy and fat with food. after you build it up i normaly shot for a fight to death to see who wins and its epic the way you feel after beating the  out of your bff in multi player.",3
"i think i may have just found a game to replace tf2...",1
"love the game. glad my computer can actually play it. might use some free time to play this again. :)",1
"for strategy lovers everywhere, just make sure you dont have anything important to do for the rest of the day before starting a game.",2
"my butt plug really enjoys this games, it makes fredrick (the butt plug) really happy.",1
"really in to history and looking for an awesome game... this is it!!",1
"you start out trying to be nice to everyone, as they all offer you  deals and denounce you for no reason. as you get further and further ahead, eventually someone declares war and you, having had quite enough of their , bomb them back into the stone age. then they offer you horses if youll stop murdering them, while in the midst of the modern age. you seize one little capital, and suddenly everyone in the world hates you for warmongering. so you decide to live up to their expectations and conquer the world. such is life in civ v. - anonymous, of fj",1
"very awesome game , the gameplay is fantastic , must buy this! its very fun",1
"love playing rts games. its not a surprise when i lose full days in this game.",1
"this is by far one of my favorite pc games of all time. the reason i think this game is so good is that it never really gets boring, there are so many mods for the game, and its so dynamic, its just really hard to get actually bored of this game. to top it off, it has great graphics, which in all honesty arent really required for a game like this. i might be a bit biassed of course since i love all of sid meiers games, but this one really takes the cake, i would recomend buying this game to all of my friends.",1
"the grand daddy of 4x games. simple and easy to understand yet deep enough if you so desire. be ready to find yourself with missing blocks of time after beginning a session of this game. oh and start from the ancient era, dont be a wuss.",1
"one of the most played games on steam since its release. it is one of my most played games on my libary. absolute 10/10 if you like strategy games. make sure you get the game with all the expansion packs or else it will feel like it is lacking content. if you dont know you will like the gameplay, just get the demo first.",2
"this latest installment of the civilization franchise is (imo) the greatest, i thoughly enjoy this game and find myself returning to it time and time again.",3
"fantastic fun if you like turn based strategy. defintley great if your a history buff like me and can nerd out cranking out 40 panzers to simulate your own blitzkreig on the poor underteched cpu and then get nuked by gandhi the ...seriously...gandhi is the biggest prick of all the ai, but apart from that the games great. get all the dlc, g&k really improves the combat with new units (and civs i think?) while bnw just overhauls the entire late game to make all victory conditions more engaging, interactive, and entertaining.",1
"this game was reccomended to me by a few friends, and when i bought it, i was sceptical. but now, with nearly one thousand hours on record, that scepticism is gone. the game of civilization is great both on the surface levels with basic gameplay, and in the more strategic and complex features. anybody can play this game, the turn based aspect is great for people like me who like to think about every move before they make it. the only thing that i will caution you about is the fact that the ai hold grudges bigtime, as in you will declare a war and take one small city (not even the capital) and another player will hold it against you for four thousand years... i know this from experience. 10/10",5
"probably one of the best 4x games released in the past few years. get the brave new world expansion, as well.",1
"best strategy game 10/10 also you can play with russia so 11/10",1
"this game is dangerous. you sit down to play for 2 hours after dinner, aaaaaand its 1am. loads of options for nations, strategies, best civ yet.",1
"amazing game that will definitely make the hours fly by.",2
"most addicting game ive played since minecraft, humblebundle ftw! 10/10",1
"hands down my favorite game series ever and it keeps improving and expanding.",1
"very fun, high replayability. (this game also has some awesome mods)",1
"good game. much better than sid meiers civilization and revolution. apparently not as good as sid meiers civilization iv but i wouldnt know as i have yet to play it. very enjoyable game. plenty of free mods available. have to admit though, the multiplayer is slightly disappointing but you can spend hours on singleplayer.",1
"this is one of those games you start playing casually at night, next thing you know its 7am and youre eating cold hot dogs in your underwear, contemplating your next move. enjoyed it a lot.",1
"great game if you like strategies. (turned based) it focuses on choises that you make to help you (trade with this guy, attack this guy etc) 1 problem is that its not very fast paced... g2g faest.",1
"sent ghandi a nuclear bomb to express my friendship :d 10/10 would bomb my allies again",1
"civ 5 is a great game if you have tons of time to pour in or very little, one of the few games i love recomending.",2
"with the two expansions, civ v is a brilliant 4x game, perhaps one of the best out there (although i couldnt say; i dont have a lot of experience with the genre). an epic strategy game with an accessible learning curve but a very high skill (and knowledge) ceiling, with hundreds of different techs to research, distinct units for different eras, a functional diplomacy system, stellar religion and covert ops mechanics and big- nukes made better with friends. just make sure you pick up brave new world and gods and kings with it, because without it the game feels bare-bones.",1
"there are tons and tons and tons and even more goats in this game. its crazy 100/10",1
"i have been playing sid meiers games since civnet back in 1995. almost 20 years later, im still here. over the years there has been a huge decline in strat games but sid has kept realeasing these civ games for which i am eternally greatful. the game has changed drastically since the original, keeping it fresh and challanging. if you havnt played any of these games before, i would urge you to give them a go, they are one of the most rewarding experiances you could ever encounter in front of a screen.",1
"civ v brings the civ game to a whole new level of fun, however it is highly recommended to play with friends for the ai can be very predictable (predictable does not mean easy however) despite tech trading being out of the game the new features higly make up for it and turn the core civ gameplay into something much more in depth. civ v is a solid fun title and if you enjoy turn based strategy civ v is the game for you.",2
"a complex turn-based strategy game that is worth every penny especially with all the dlcs! there isnt a campaign mode but more of a set your own kind of game however there are scenarios you can play. just remember to never trust ghadi he will nuke you!",2
"its like monopoly, you cant finish a game in one day",1
"shiity game i clock in 100+ hours of game play, but u know what i cant play it now dun know wtf going on with it. check online alot of people same as me cant get it to start after seleting directx.",2
"for a relaxing afternoon , i will always choose sid meiers civil v , the best way you can spend your time on a pc :)",2
"ill review this game right after i finish this turn.",2
"it is a fun game of strategy and can go any way you want",1
"have played none of the previous civilization games, i didnt expect to get a whole lot out of this title... but i was very wrong! the turns move quickly, the game is easy to get into, and the maps are fun to explore. plus, its fun to play co-op with friends against the ai!",1
"just one more turn, one more campaign i swear... (6 hours later). not recommended for low-end computers, as late-game turn processing can make the game lag and heat up your computer. definitely play dx11 mode if you can handle it though, its much prettier to look at and you get animated world leaders.",2
"a must have for every fan of the series. especially with g&k and bnw expansions. shines in multiplayer as well (though its lacks stability a bit and has a few other bugs).",2
"if youve ever wanted to see if madoka could take out ghandi and eggman in continental warfare within 8 hours, this is the game for you. the games awesome on its own, the expansions make it better, and the mods make it more enjoyable.",1
"they make it easy to mod the game with built in search tools to browse mods guess that is why i have 600+ hours logged in... 750 hours and counting and with the expansions it is like a whole new game",4
"i wake up and look outside to see a great day.  i think i might go outside today. i say. but steam pops up on my desktop.  but look jake, my pc teases.  i have civ 5 up for you and only one more turn wouldnt hurt. i sit down and look at my screen and think  whats the worst thing that can happen? days later my finger sting from the blisters covering them. my steam feed says 420 hrs. in last week. i crawl to my bed and fall back asleep only to repeat the cycle again tommorow.",1
"what started out as a glitchy mess with (for me) less than 100 hours of play, turned into a glorious game full of replayability with friends or alone thanks to its potent dlc. this game, with its large workshop/modding community, is easily one of my favorite games of all time, allowing you to recreate historical dynasties or forge your own path. games can drag on for hours, which may be seen as a draw back, but the desired way to play this game for me is to relax while watching netflix or a movie on a second monitor and save when ive had enough for the day. id recommend buying the dlcs with this game, as it will greatly improve the game overall. it goes on sale often.",4
"i didnt trade horses with gandhi so he nuked me. it was fun.",1
"totally worth the price tag, one of the best strategy games ive played.",1
"1 word can describe this game, amazing, but that makes for a sucky review. this game is all about building a civilization, and trying to develop it to be better that the others in the game. you develop new technologies, fight wars among the other civs and city states, conquer land and found cities, spread religion (dlc required), and nukes. :uranium: there are some amazing mods out there for this game, just an amazing game overall,",2
"this is a vast game, with the highest replay value of any other i have ever played. the differences among civilizations range from slim to huge, and they all have a very unique style of gameplay. put in the many factors that can be modified before a game session, such as map size and resource abundance, and youll find yourself living with this game for a long time. big points for the soundtrack and graphics as well. the ai is really well adjusted too, compared to older versions of civilization. it is now possible to actually stand a chance playing in the hardest settings and still feels rewarding if you lose and yet tried your best. there is nothing left to say other than... play this game!!! oh and get the expansions too!",1
"freaking amazing. best top-view strategy game i ever played. i love how you can control who is in the world and the difficulty level, map type, etc. i felt like i was competing against real players when i was faced with the ai leaders in the game. i actually checked to see if i was in multiplayer somehow by accident. 10/10",1
"well, let me just have a quick round... holy  why is it 4 a.m.",1
"ive played every civilization game and every expansion; with civ 5 brave new world, theyve finally achieved a balance of victory conditions that transforms this game into the only strategy game equally suitable for single or multiplayer that genuinely offers opportunity for victory with whatever strategy you choose, provided your choice is clever and adaptable.",3
"can you create a civilization to stand the test of time? no. because gandhi will nuke you. 10/10.",3
"if i can not have the original microsoft age this is all i am left with",1
"are you seriously just considering buying this game? just buy it, it is such a great game. you will have endless hours of fun if you buy this game. get your friends to buy it also. the multiplayer is so great. this overall is a game that you dont want to miss out on. now, run along and buy this game, now!",5
"highly recommended if you dont want to go outside ever again",1
"- so youre saying that i need to accept the religion of your civilization? - yes, dido! from a conversation with the babylonian missionary for 8 years before the fall of babylon.",3
"this game is a total time suck. and i mean that in a good way. when i start playing, i want to keep playing for hours on end. i find it very hard to turn off in the middle of a game and save it for later. i need to see what will happen on the next turn, and the next, and the next... the different scenarios keep things fresh. my favorite is the steampunk scenario in the gods & kings expansion.",1
"like nukes? like giant death robots? like strategy? good. you will like this game",1
"the most addictive turn-based strategy game so far. watching your nation progress from ancient time to future tech is what makes the game really interesting. building cities, wonders, armies, grow wealth, trade with another nation, make alliance, declare wars, in fact everything you want you can get it.",1
"other than slow load times, especially when you are running mods and playing on a large scale with lots of civilizations this game is too fun. adding wonder and building mods also adds so much more depth to the game, yet can slightly imbalance some strategies.",1
"i played the role of ghandi, and i repayed the kindness shown to me by the british by sending them a giant death robot. **zaap!** thats what i think of your stupid navy **zap!!!** take that longbow archers!!",2
"buy now i mean it i have never had so much fun in a game i stayed up late just to play it worth the price but get it form amazon as it better.",2
"115 hours logged in this and still not slowing down. ignore the haters still obsessed with 4.",2
"this game will eat your time!!! all of it and you wont even know its happening.",2
"give gandhi uranium they said. itll be fun they said",2
"love the game!!!!! it never really gets boring because you can switch civis every game. i like how the ais are really smart. you do not have to buy the dlc for it to be fun.",2
"i only just got this game, honestly did not think i would like it, 6 hours past and realised i was addicted. just look at other peoples reviews and see how long they have played it, that should pretty much sum up how good it is.",1
"really fun, only problem is that you need dlc packs to add more to the game and make it more fun.",1
"ill finish after this turn 100 turns later (finish the game) ill finish after the next game",1
"my great civilization was destroyed by the great warlord ghandi. 11/10 would play again.",1
"this is the best stratgey game ive played, ounce i learned how to play i couldnt stop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"civ v is on of those games that you have heard great things about, but arent sure if youll like it. you buy it when its on sale and then immediatley lose your entire day playing it, strategizing on when you should declare war or who should be your ally. it does have some minor flaws but the fun you have both by yourself or with friends outsizes the few flaws i found.",2
"one of the best tbs games, but for the series fans it still needs quite a lot tuning. i am really happy that the series is going in the right direction with the new content.",2
"want to make history? want to have your own empire? need to be worshiped like a god? need to nuke someone today? play this game and all your wishes will come true. express your inner king, whip those lazy peasants, rule the world! beautiful game with amazing game mechanics, now even better with the 2 expansions, makes you want to play all day long.",1
"after their series of cash-grab dlcs i had to reinstall my game cause apparently, if you dont pay for all the dlcs and download them, you get thrown under the bus with game crashing bugs.",1
"this game is very interesting. i have only won 2-3 games so far in 80+ hours of game play. i keep coming back to the game and doing more with it. i suggest this game for everyone!!.",1
"probabely the most addiciting game ive ever played. this is the type of game that play you can play hours on without even realising. ive played it endless times and i still love it. the community mods are a big factor in re-playability and will keep you testing new mods aswell as the insane improvements that the dlcs add. it is true that the begininning is really boring however, later in the game you start making game plans which can go horribly wrong. especially when you trust ghandi... but in all seriousness its one of my favorite games and i really reconmend anyone to play it, even though the new civ is out 9-10/10",3
"i hope you dont have a life because with this game your going to forget you had one. civilization is a srategy game where you command your cilivilzation by build cities, going to war and trying to dominate your enemy, or going to the moon any many other things you can do when you play this game. this is one of the funniest and most time consuming games i have ever played and it is worth the price and the amazing dlc that lets you make trade routes with other civs out there or even creating your own religion to spread faith across the globe and gives you many more civlizations the play as. buy this game now! the only thing you will regret is that you havnt showered in days because of this game.",1
"veterans of the civilizations franchise may be immediately put off by the lack of features in this hexagonal iteration, but the expansions (gk+bnw) add a lot of content back and steam frequently has them for sale. to be honest the smaller scale of warfare due to 1-army-per-square and reduced warfare abilities in general as a result put me off at first. however, i really came to appreciate how much more significant country borders became as a result of this, making each expansion risky due to quick flanking maneuvers by the ai. i still think the ai for civ is still too predictable and even when set on random, a bit harsh depending on your difficulty level. still recommend the game for fans and newcomers, you will easily end up spending way more time than you thought carving your perfect civ.",1
"one of the best strategic games ive ever played. you have to take your time for this game though as it takes quite a while. that does however make this game a great strategic game as it takes and gives you time to plan out all your tactics in making alliances, building up staying neutral or declaring war on all who oppose your ways of treading the world.",3
"epic turn based strategy game from one of the if not the biggest series in the genre. the newest update doesnt disappoint! and who doesnt love montezumas unique style of crazy?",2
"fantastic visuals! such an easy game to just dive right into and just hit play now! easy to be good at, difficult to master. online play is an absolute train wreck however.",1
"if you have any respect for your free time, do not buy this. it has a small tendency to suck you in (in a good way). you play for hours in what seemed like minutes. also, got denouced for being a warmonger by atilla the hun. 10/10",1
"i purchased this game recently because a friend reccomended it to me. i can definately see why he told me to get it! i really enjoy the game and i plan to buy the dlc in the future. while the game takes awhile to complete, it is still very fun to play!",1
"i spend hours playing a game to lose...and then i play again...",1
"the game is amazingly fun, and rather addicting. once i start a game, i find it hard to stop playing, always trying out different tactics to win. definitely a must have if you like strategy games!",1
"im roughly 30 hours in and i have to say that this is now one of my favorite games of all time. its very time consuming but i absolutley love it.",1
"very slow starting game, but thats what makes it great. chosing what your civ researchers first can help or hurt in the long run. its a new game everygame and games do take a long time to complete depending on the settings you chose. very fun does have mods for it. 8/10",1
"great game, it looks like a real life ruiner and i couldnt be happier",1
"this game is way too addictive and worth the money, even at a full price because the play time you put into it balances it out. even when you take a break from playing it, its always fun to come back to and it pulls you in each time. definitely an amazing strategy game.",1
"highly addictive, typical civ game but more polished.",1
"love this game. if you like the other civilization game you like love this. the gameplay is pretty mush the same but just better especially the game now have hexagons indstead of squares makes such a difference. and lots of nice mods.",1
"civ v is a very worthy entry to the legendary series of 4x games. finally it has hex-spaces instead of squares for better unit movement. also the kinda ridiculous unit stacking is gine, now you can have one military unit and one civilian unit per hex. (though this leads to its own new problems) but i highly reccomend civv to be played with the two large expansion (gods and kings, brave new world). they make the game just plainly better and only with them civ v might be on par or even above civ2.",2
"the best turned based game i have ever played. music is awesome. super addicting. i give it a solid 9/10",2
"by far my favorite game on steam. i this game is a must have if you ask me. there is almost no excuse considering how often this game goes on sale and how cheap it is. i have spent about 8 days in it which is by far my most on steam. there is just something about civ that keeps you going one more turn...",2
"this game is a great concept but very buggy for months and months unfixed. the multiplayer options as far as mods go leave much to be desired also. know this stuff going in and it can be a fun experience.",1
"too busy taking another turn to right a review, but this game is genius.",1
"this is a great game for those who are newcomers to strategy games and those who are either familiar to civilization or strategy games in general. its simple and easy to understand but good enough as both an introduction and continuation to playing strategy games. i highly recommend it on its own but even more so if you buy the brave new world expansion.",3
"one of the best-if not the best- strategy games out there.a must have for a gamer collection !",1
"the best civilization game yet! lots of annoying micro management removed to make the game much more simplistic (in a good way), countless improvements, plenty of dlc, built in mods database, lots of civilizations to play all with unique units. favourite civ game to date. :p",1
"i knew i was ment to rule the world. {evil laugh} this is a pretty laid back, turn based game. its fun :d",1
"civ 5 is a turn based stratergy game which is extremly enhacned by the mass amount of dlc. 10/10 no negatives. all positives. why you even reading this just buy it !!!",1
"civilization v is my favorite game currently. a game i can get lost in for hours and find very elegent. it gives you a god complex. i feel as if its a game about secert society using there puppets nations to really rule the world.",3
"a very addiciting game for sure. i love it. it is the best interactive strategy game ive played.",1
"a brilliant strategy game. fighting opponents that act correctly to your actions. fighting real situations such as poverty, starvation etc. my favorite game of the civilization series. great work!",1
"if you enjoyed civ iv, youll enjoy this game. heck, if you enjoy any kind of strategy game, youll like civ v. for all those who have played civ iv, a lot of the same awesomeness has returned, if not a bit dumbed down, but youll still enjoy every aspect of it. i do recommend purchasing both of the major dlc for it, as they add a lot of content that is well worth the extra price. the game is very easy to get the hang of, and it is easy to lose a few hours thinking, one... more... turn. 100% recommend!",1
"an overall fun game with tons of replay value that is detrimented by the sheer amount of dlc. if you didnt buy all the dlc from the get-go, enjoy forking out a bunch of cash to be able to enjoy the full game, or have fun in singleplayer since almost all multiplayer matches require dlc. edit: i managed to get two of the expansion packs and it makes the game more deep and enjoyable, but i still think those who are suckered into buying any other version that the complete edition are going to be disappointed at the money they have to spend to fully enjoy the game. still a great game.",2
"why are you not playing this? stop reading and go play. the 2 expansions are a must, dont even think of not geting them.",2
"extremely fun game. with the the complete edition going for 25 dollars its an absolute steal of a deal. you wont regret puchasing this game.",1
"this really is an addicting strategy game, and one of the best ive ever played. it has an interesting gameplay system and a fun multiplayer section. while it may be an old game by now, it still has the useful replayable feature. pros: - addicting, and the urge to keep playing in order to win is always there. - different playstyles as different people, according to how you want to play. - mods section which allows you to customize your game using the steam workshop. cons: - ai which can be really irksome, especially in the multiplayer section. leave them for 5 minutes and all your moneys gone. - a tutorial system would be really handy, as for some new players it can be hard to get used to. overall i would give this game a 9/10, as while it can be fun to play, there are still some features that need some work.",1
"highly addictive. the just one more turn and ill go to bed mentality has kept me up late to many times playing this game.",2
"incredible game, i have over 400 hours, trust me when i tell you this game is beyond amazing. ive had it for roughly a year now and its just a bundle of joy.",3
"best strategy simulator out there. the dlc makes brilliant changes to gameplay. highly recommended",1
"one of the best-if not the best- strategy games out there.a must have for a gamer collection !",1
"really good for wasting days when i should be working. if i didnt have this game i might actually have to do something productive...",1
"awesome game. it took me a little effort to learn to handle the city menu, but the game is pretty addicting",1
"amazing stratergy game, only real con is overexpensive dlc",1
"dont play this game. recommended. 10 out of 0. p.s. beware of gandhi.",1
"i dont have enough money for the expansions, but i play this game a lot. gift me if you love jesus, if notyou are an obvious satanist.",2
"a very outstanding game but very easy to get the upperhand on the outher civilizations but outher then that a awsome stratigec game 8/10",1
"this game is so fun! i always win by nukes, wait no its domination.",3
"spent 20 years building the eiffel tower, the japanese finished it right before i did so we abandoned the project. 10/10",1
"civilization is already one of the best strategy games, but take its expanding dlc and it becomes one of the deepest games you could spend your money on.",1
"do you have a free weekend or no job? do you enjoy sitting in a chair beind a screen for extended periods of time? maybe you are 14? possibly 25 and no job and your mom doesnt bother you much? well, civ 5 is the game for you! watching small groups of people inhabit a hexigon and watching other people invade other hexigons is a blast. youll need to beat your wife and kids so they know not to bother you. order pizza turn off your phone and let the magic happen. you cant stop this. this game will end relationships.",1
"great sandbox game, but most multiplayer servers are crappy because of the required addons.",1
"a few significant strategical deficiencies exist in the base version of civ v. the game is genuinely unbalanced without both the brave new world and gods and kings expansion packs. if you can get the whole civ v package for a reasonable price, go for it, but i do not recommend purchasing the base game by itself.",2
"this game has stolen many hours of my life. i surrender them happily. combat makes sense, except when you have a modern tank taking on barbarian warriors with axes and you still lose one hp for each one you defeat. everything else is fantastic.",2
"this game can make you go on for hours. i never played civ series before but i have played some other several turn base strategy with management with cities,resources and other things. it may not be complex. the game is quite simple in both gameplay and understanding. although it may not be complex it still is fun to play with. either for casual or hardcore strategy gamers. if you do not like to spend hours, bored from the repititives or any other reasons that you may be disliking this game.. i will tell you to give this a try. you might change your opinion.",1
"no wonder the uk dislikes polish people. back stabbing s. 10/10",2
"i liked this game great city management. i liked the hitorical accuracy of the special units great people and leaders.",1
"this game is amazing! i like it very much, it has such good detail in the game and its very easy to learn. a great experience with friends.",1
"addictive but the high usually wont last a whole game.",1
"probably myfavorite fps. has a lot of the core elements in any good shooter.",1
"takes a long time but its pretty neat. not enough pictures of monkeys though. 3/10",1
"civ is brilliant, definately worth the money, especially for the multiplayer.",1
"we nuked china 50 times and they were still kicking. 10/10",1
"good strategy game,it will consume time without you realizing",1
"> start first game > do a lot of  > get uranium > gandhi wants your uranium > you give gandhi uranium > gandhi nukes you tl;dr: play as gandhi, and everything will be good. (in case youre not playing as gandhi, never trust gandhi, and try to kill him as fast as possible. he acts like your friend, but hes the real backstabber.) oh and also, gandhi is a warmongering piece of .",1
"good game. usually slow paced, in my experience, but you know, thats not necessarily a bad thing. get it.",1
"this game look very good, indeed, i like the complex of each turn, unique and interesting. i can not get out of this just....one...more...turn",1
"if you like the civ games buy this with the expansions and have a hundred hours of fun",2
"this my favourite strategy game (excluding moba genre) its balance is great (excluding the shoshone  people who play them) and its so much fun to play w/ friends. i wish more of my friends owned this.",2
"if you have something to do within the next week, dont buy this game you will need a support group.",1
"well, what can i say about this game? hmm...i bought it, downloaded it, proceeded to play for 10 hours straight. uh-huh, yeah. this game...this game. i didnt think i would like it, but my all my friends bought it, so i decided to. i quickly got addicted. a big factor for that was all of the fps games i had been playing, so this was a nice change of pace. definitely a game that is worth your money (although i got the base game and all dlcs on sale for $17.00). so yeah, um, yeah.",2
"really good game to play wih friends. really recommend it!",2
"build your nation, research technology, create wonders, evolve your cities, befriend city-states or bully them, create your own religion and spread it to other civs,destroy your enemies with catapults, cannons and tanks or erase them from the map with nukes. become the greatest nation ever.",2
"this game is for patient mortals, great game if you are a visionary. good active coommunity and some nice mods. i reccomend this game to anyone who like oxygen.",3
"civilization 5 is an amazing strategy game with no equal. the game can be played at a leisurely pace and comfortable difficulty all the way up to a mind melting marathon pace and the extremely challenging deity difficulty. not only are the single player games fun, challenging, and well crafted, but the online multiplayer adds a new dimension to the game with added challenges and excitement. lastly the scenarios allow you to reenact some of historys greatest moments. 10/10.",2
"its a bit like chess. its very easy to learn what everything does and how you can use each building and unit, but doing anything actually meaningful with all those things over the course of an entire match will take you a lot of practice and learning. a single match can easily last around 10 hours, and alliances youve made (or broken) in the beginning of a game can have surprising effects on the end-game, although the ai sometimes makes this work a bit weird.",1
"one more turn... one more turn... oh, its 4am in the morning already?! oh well, one more turn...",1
"this game is tedious do not buy it if you are somebody who likes turn based games go ahead. zzz",1
"extremely fun, challenges even the best strategizers, addictive! get it!",2
"a streamlined civ4 minus the stack of doom. civ5 is the best of the old with the new. 10/10 especially if you have all of the dlc and expansions which balance the game mechanics.",2
"this is the best version of civiization!! give it a try and youll like it.",1
"the civ series has long been known as digital heroine. civilization v is no different. despite some ling complaints i have with streamlining the user interface, this game is undeniably an amazing sucess. the hours will melt away into days!",1
"said i was gunna play for 10 minutes,ended up playing for 10 hours",1
"if you dont have this game.... you have no taste in good games.... or youve never heard of it. in which case, buy it ffs!",1
"simply one of the best games ever. recommended that you play with all expansions added. it took me a short while to make the leap from civ 4 to civ 5 but now id never look back. indeed, i look forward very much to civ: beyond earth and, hopefully one day, civ 6.",2
"passes vasts amounts of time in what feels like minutes",1
"this game has been on of my favorite series since i got civ 3 as a kid. civ 5 certaintly does not disapoint as the next step in an awesome series! 10/10!",2
"a very fun, time consuming game, rounds can take hours, and thus spread over days to play, be prepared for that. the base game on its own is very strong already, but i believe all the dlcs are quite the enrichment to the gameplay (especially the two big ones, brave new worlds and god and kings, also the ones that add more factions).",1
"i dont really like turn based games, but this game is differnent and i love the way there are progression trees for both policies and tech, thus maximizing possibilites for each player in the game. the multiple victory conditions are also good as they variate how people play the game so it is not repetitive and not everyone has the same goals. there are plenty of civilizations to choose from ranging from england to even civilizations like the zulu. unfortunatly i find multiplayer can be a bit poor because the games can last a long time and people like to quit, i find this makes it best to play with your friends as you can save game and continue with them later.",1
"this game is well worth the price for single-player mode. i have spent a lot of time beating the cpus. it loses its flavor after about the 10th match, but that is what mods and online play is for. this game is fun and has endless replayability.",1
"you have to get this game as it is amazing and the mods give even more replay ability",2
"if you like long drawn-out strategy games and building things, then this is the perfect game for you. the biggest difference of civ v with its predecessors is immersion. when playing civ v, its very easy to become emotionally attached to your civilization. be ware, however, that civ v is long and drawn out, even on quick mode. a full-scale game can often last weeks and even months, and its difficult to keep your body alive while partcipating in a game of civ v.",1
"my favourite game of all time 10 of 10 in everything.",1
"freaking awesome game, tons of ways to win and many avenues of approaches!",1
"very fun, but not sure about the mechanics, and games take a very long time; which i guess is good :)",1
"fun, easy to learn, and very addictive. needs more detail. oveall one of the best.",4
"this is the greatest strategy game out there, as far as im concerned.",1
"i love this game. for a not-so-avid civilization player, this was a great start. some civ iv players will argue about the quality of this game, but if youre new to the franchise, its definitely worth a try.",1
"an absolutely fantastic game for anyone who enjoys strategy games!",1
"solid and in depth turn based strategy. games take just about forever to complete, especially when youve got a large bunch of players. regardless, its a lot of fun and very interesting to those who appreciate management type things in their games.",1
"very good game. becomes even better with the dlc expansions.",2
"buy this game if you want to kill any chances of ever having a social life again. 10/10",1
"so...civilization 5. as long as you buy the game with all the dlcs, then you will have fun. good points: fun exploration action banter destruction nuke everyhting bad points: supreme overlord mini is a tryhard supreme overlord mini is a tryhard supreme overlord mini is a tryhard supreme overlord mini is a tryhard bantari dominata supreme overlord mini is a tryhard supreme overlord mini is a tryhard supreme overlord mini is a tryhard supreme overlord mini is a tryhard",1
"epic game, emotional and stratigic! quite relaxing. 8/3",1
"excellent game. it is different each time i play it.",2
"i dont know how anyone could release *this* and call it a finished product. multiplayer is just lagging piece of ...(your word here)! ive tried playing in 2 games with different people and on different host and both of them ended up in some horrible lag. netcode is so unfinished that i doubt that *this-piece-of* playable outside of lan. other than that game is decent, but failure to deliver and most importantly patch existing issues is so annoying that im not recommending this game to anyone who desires to play in multiplayer via internet with few peoples.",2
"you can play as ghandi of india, nuke ancient persia, fly to alpha centauri, and muster an army of giant death robots, all at the same time. enough said.",5
"this game is loads of fun. the multiplayer is a blast, and the gameplay can be challenging. many different playable factions, each with different quirks, strengths, and weaknesses, give the game a high replay value. even if you have a sure-fire strategy for one civ (and even that probably wont work every time), it isnt likely to work as another civ. even if the regular gameplay bores you, there are scenarios and mods than can freshen up the gameplay. however, as a turn-based grand strategy/4x game, graphics arent its strongest point. while theyre nothing as stunning as some of the games out today, theyre still good, and the game wont be hard on the eyes by a long shot.",1
"the civilization series of games are my favorite games. while i felt more immersed in civ iv, and even civ revolutions, civilization v is a great strategy game and is the game i have spent the most time playing of all in the series.",4
"step one: meet ghandi step two: ghandi drops a  of a-bombs for no reason step three: you drop a bunch of f-bombs at ghandis a-bombs step four: ing defeat. repeat steps one through 3.",1
"this game is quite fun and is always a good place to spend free time. 10/10 would buy again.",1
"i got the game when it first came out. experienced random crashes. tried every fix i could find online but none would work. my pc then was a high end i7 custom built. i had no issues with any other games. now, over three years later. i have a completely different pc that spec wise should have no issue with this game. i figured i would try again. i downloaded the game and started playing. after about 20 minutes guess what. crash! no problems playing other games. i go online to see what i can try to fix this issue. i realized that all the fixes i find from recent thread posts and articles are the same ones from 3 years ago. looks like bug fixes are not a priority for the developers.",1
"i love this game its so awesome. i like the aztec and the us.",4
"hated strategy games before playing this amazing game. 10/10!",1
"if you havent played a civ game or only played civilization revolution on the consoles, its pretty complicated but its super fun even when youre -30 gold per turn and everything is terrible. its very satisfying to wipe a whole civilization off the map as they try to negotiate peace when theyre down to their last city. its marvelous.",1
"one more turn addiction, check. lots of nations and emergent storylines, check. send people to thier deaths in the name of religon, just like in real life, check. annoying advisors, check. unlimited replay value, check. should purchase, check.",1
"ing buy it so i have someone to play online you s!!!",1
"the best strategy game i have ever played. solid graphics, gameplay, music, and endless replayability. get it now. 10/10",1
"this game destroyed my friendships, ruined my social life, killed my dog,  my sister, burned down my house, tied me to a bed, and left me there for about a week. 12/10 would recommend.",1
"great game. long hours of fun. easy to learn. pros: fun replayable different every game ai has relative smart thinking process long hours of gameplay con: long hours of gameplay (very hard to play less than 1-2 hours)",1
"amazing strategy game! very challenging, but definitely worth your time...literally all of your time.",1
"you kill one civilization and no one like you but they all want you to go to war with germany for some reason. most realistic game 11/10",1
"definetly finer graphics then 4 and alot more interesting options plays slightyl differently but gods and kings is a fine addition",1
"not much more to be said on the subject, but this game is great. my wife and i love playing together and we have put more hours into this than any other game in our steam lists. brave new world is a great addition to the already great core game.",1
"sid meiers civilization v is a really nicely created turn based stratagy game. you will find your self playing the game for long 8+ hour periods as you expand your empire. i only have 200 hours on this game and i am sure i will get loads more. my only issue is that i would say the base game is somewhat lacking. its still a good game but could use more, so if you are intrested on getting the game i would reccomend the gold edition as it comes with some new civs and g&k wich is an amazing expansion. the other expansion bnw is also a fantasic addition to the game and recomend you pick it up also.",2
"base game has large amount of content and is very good. brave new world dlc added new breath of life into a game that was staring to get a bit boring, would reccomend buying after getting a feel for the game.",1
"a great strategy game. say goodbye to half of your day when you begin a match. addictive as crack.",1
"fantastic game, definitely recommend it. it has good gameplay, good graphics, good music, the only problem i have is an occasional graphics and audio bug when i play the game too long. but, its not a major disfunction, and the pros far outweigh the cons. worth every cent!",1
"i never really was interested in the civ series until i finally decided to try civ 5, this is probally one of the best grand strategy games i have ever played. this game is very fun to play with friends who also own this game, i highly recommend this game.",1
"this game is amazing loads of fun and if you have all the expancions/dlcs your in for a even bigger blast just get the game i think you will find yourself playing it for hours",1
"yes, im a dumb gamer who sits around playing fps games, i dont like platformers that much, or puzzle games, or rts games, but this is the best thing since aunt phanny put her foot in a shoe! careful! you need to do this in long sessions. *i am not in any way responsible for any ill health effects caused by being addicted to this game",1
"had a 2,000 year war with germany just cause they wanted my second city, and when they finally allowed me to negotiate peace everyone else started hating them. skip ahead 2,000 more years the second war with germany has begun, hopefully it will end it all - 10/10 would fight wars again",1
"think this series is one of the great simulation games especially civ v",1
"1. asks russia to help in the killing of aztecs 2. they send over one troop 3. i get the capital down to 1 hp 4. russias pikeman attacks the capital 5. they get the capital then declare war on me",1
"i have sunk tons of hours into this game...great game for your money.",1
"great visuals and fun game. not as difficult to understand as predecessors but still lots of fun.",2
"fantastic game, its a shame that the base game itself isnt the best. the dlc (g&k and brave new world) are basically needed to get the full game experience, which ramps up the price quite a bit. still, one of my favorite games of all time.",1
"great and fun game, worth its cost during summer sale!",1
"a great game to play when you have a few hours of spare time. the fantastic gameplay, as well as firaxis games amazing attention to both detail and historical accuracy, make this edition of civ its best yet.",1
"omg the clicking! love this game, love the dlc, but i do not love that i never seem to have enough time for one more turn. ive played for more than 400 hours, and there are things in this game i have yet to experience. worth. every. penny.",3
"once you buy this game and know how to play it your butt will stuck on a chair for a day .. 10/10",1
"i need to play this game more. once you get into its very addictive! im glad i got it!",1
"i recommend this game only is you like strategy games. otherwise you may find it a tad too boring (for lack of a better word). i personally love this game simply because of how time consuming it is. one game can takes hours even days to complete solo; great for making time fly by. when i first got the game, i never really played it that much. but when i started to get back into it, i was so addicted to the game. i would play it hours on end. if you did this too, you may even want to invest in its gold upgrade which includes all dlc (except brave new world of course). brave new world would top off your civilization v gaming experience if you are willing to pay for it.",1
"this is one of the most addicting games ive ever had. a must own for any rts fan.",1
"one of my new favorite games, and that is saying alot about strategy games for me as someone who fell in love with games like aoe 2 and 3 for the longest of time.... not at all the same type of game, much more fun. do you find it to get boring from time to time? buy one of the two great expansions for the game it really ads alot to the experience! -have fun-",1
"do you like extremly slow paced empire building games that will suck days weeks months and even years of your life away? look no further. then look harder cause this damn game is still getting dlc packages to expand the gameplay it should have started with.",4
"really fun, but can be time consuming. i start a game at 2 p.m. , and before i know it, it is 9 p.m.! very addicting, and requires strategy. i built the great wall of brazil. ghandi made the great pyrimids of canada. washington made america where china is today. i lost the space race to the aztecs. 20/10",1
"absolutely superb game! i would reccommend this to anyone especially previous civ players because this game really does bring in additional aspects that have been missing from the fights in previous civs. definitely worth buying the dlc in the sale too!",1
"absolutely amazing, especially with all of the dlc. perfect for those with a political mind, or a personality that longs for power.",2
"if you have any experience with civilization games previously, do yourself a favor and buy the complete version of this that includes gods and kings and brave new world. the dlc for this game takes what was otherwise an okay, but kind of pared down and boring version of civ, and turns it into the best civ game since alpha centauri. other things of note if you are an older civ player looking at this game: - units are restricted to (basically) one unit per tile. at first this seems terrible, but in the long run youll wonder why you ever put up with stacks of doom. - instead of squares, you have hexes. this increases the strategic depth of the game a lot. - india will still nuke the hell out of you the first chance they get.",2
"this game will ruin your life. stay far, far away for the love of god.",3
"i modded this game and destroyed the vanilla version. 0/10 no multiplayer mod support.",1
"was doing midterms when the question was what was the capital city of the aztecs? then i remembered the time i was invading the aztecs empire huh, tenochtitlan is an odd name for a city... i got an a on that test. 11/10 would reccomend.",1
"my mum came home with this instead of theif, and i was really dissapointed. now, i cant stop playing! it keeps you hooked with its many different aspects of playing, and no two games are the same.",1
"this is probably the most amazing game ever made.. but it also takes all of my free time.. sooooo much time..",4
"the base gsme is good but with the expansion brave new world it is amazing",1
"simple, yet addicting turn-based strategy game that got me into the world of historical strategy games.",2
"this is a good sim if you wannt to play and control a civ! i actually havnt played a whole lot of it and its been very far and in between but i enjoy it when i do play it.",1
"one of the better city building stratagy games out there, and there are quite a few. this game is great for anyone that is a fan of stratagy.",1
"killing ur time baby! but as the return, you should have a lot of fun",2
"holy  this game is addictive. being persia and nuking berlin and wiping out entire civilizations. i couldnt get into it at first, but  me i cant stop.",1
"building workers for 53 turns. resync. workers disappear. 1010",1
"amazing game, you can get some really interesting things happening in it, backstabbing, trading all kinds of stuff, so if you do or even do not like strategy games, this is an amazing one to try out",1
"on higher difficulty be careful, because everybody lies in this game.",2
"really good game, love it, maybe it would be cool with religious victory, but super aweseome one of my favourite games ever!",1
"whether civilization v is better than iv is a debate that has raged on for many years. in my own opinion, this game is the superior of the two, mostly due to the expansions. yes, it sucks to no longer have to worry about the health of your cities, and golden ages happen far too frequently, but at the same time, the combat and movement systems are far improved, and you wont have to worry about having massive stacks of hundreds of units just to have an effective military. if youre new to civ, this game is the best choice for you, but if youve been playing civ for a long time, iv might be more up your alley.",1
"my god is this game a beauty. i honestly have no explanation for how good it is other than nukes. exploration. conquest. 10/10",1
"i was dropping nukes on the spanish while they were attcking me with pikeman. 10/10",2
"gam is fun, wold reccomind this 2 ppeople out ther. -suggestionz: kim jong-un dlc : adolph hilter dlc if u c dis, show 2 gayben, plis. this gaem is r8 8/8 m8 (i mastrb8)",1
"where do i begin, civ v is the one of the best games i have ever played in my 9+ years of gaming. i love the strategy aspect and the fact that there are so many things you need to pay attention to in order to win the game other than other games being like ahhaha im just guna shoot and den i win haha. this game takes thought, intellect, and time. i highly recommend buying this game.",1
"i can honestly say that there are only a handful of features that previous versions had that this one would benifit from; quite the dramatic improvement given at launch i really only played it over 4 for the hexes.",3
"great turn-based game, although bit can be a little slow at times.",1
"time flowing like a river, till its gone forever. gone forever. 10/10 should play",1
"america invaded me when i was a single city country for my oil. 10/10 for realism",4
"very enjoyable and addicting game i reccomend buying more than 1 copy for you and your friends to play",1
"truely amazing game, at its base it can be a little dule but with all of the expansions its a lovely game.",1
"its a great game. if you like history you will love this game. conquere the world, be a deplomat, nuke gandi, build the pyrimids, and descover philosophy and found a religion. awsome game. totaly worth it.",1
"incredibly in-depth, tactical experience, unrivalled by any game ive played to date. its epic in scale, fantastic in gameplay and huge in scope and size. purely magnificent.",1
"opened game at 6 in the evening, looked at the clock when i finally took a break, 4 in the morning. 10/10 would lose social life again.",1
"strap a toilet to your , because you wont want to move for a good long while once you start a game.",1
"uhhhhhthe flagship turn-based strategy game returns become ruler of the world by establishing and leading a civilization from the dawn of man into the space age: wage war, conduct diplomacy, discover new technologies, go head-to-head with some of historys greatest leaders and build the most powerful empire the world has ever known.",3
"a great sequel to a great series. thoroughly enjoy playing it. the only controversial change to the battle mechanism - (no more stacked units), this does make for a different battle which is quite fun. i miss being able to update your cave / throne room from the previous versions of the game. the ai seems pretty easy to counter  (hint) never allow open borders, expand quickly securing strategic tiles and land.",2
"do you want a really addictive turn based game? well buy this game and you play it... alot",1
"this is quite a fun turn-based 4x game. i own all the expansions and playable cultures, and i really enjoy the variety of playable peoples. the game is moderately taxing on the graphics card, but the real bottleneck comes from the cpu while it processes all the ai turns, particularly in the late game on a large map. i really enjoy this game, and i must admit that i have succumbed to the one more turn... bug on several occasions.",1
"a game i can truly see myself never getting bored of.",4
"not much else needs to be said after you see that ive played this game for almost 700 hours since it came out. im a huge fan of civilization and have played every iteration since the first. each has built upon the last and i cant wait to see if there will be a civ vi sometime in the near future. a turn based strategy classic that will remain in my top 5 of all time.",5
"amazing game. easy to lose hours while playing it though!",1
"as a massive civ fan, this game was a bitter dissapointment. i wanted to love it. but i cant. a great interface and some cool innovations dont cover the many flaws. ill be sticking to civ iv i think. however, if youre new to 4x games, this is a good place to start. civ v has a much smoother learning curve than any other game in the genre.",2
"a great strategy game! the tile-based mechanics gives it a board game feel making it even more awesome. its hard to resist the one more turn... urge to play this game for hours. the expansions in the culture, religion, espionage, etc. makes it even more alive, as if you can see every gear in your entire civilization turning. its in my list of games that you must try at least once in your life.",1
"great game! fantastic visuals, realistic gameplay, and decent ai",1
"civ iv players, dont hesitate to upgrade. civilisation is back + every 2011 technologies.",2
"i get to play as russia settling in south africa while attempting to build the pyramids. 10/10 no but really, this game is pretty addicting. as there is little to no actual historical accuracy it does a great job of familiarizing you with ancient wonders, different civilizations, and ideologies. the game is great and has a lot of different things to try. maybe one day you want to play with only native american factions while playing on a great plains map; maybe another day you want to play with only the european powers on an archipelago map. or maybe you just want to play as a faction and see how fast you can get modern infantry and straight dominate a hunter/gatherer faction. this game has it all. with added mod support via steam workshop, there is always something or someone new to try out.",1
"civ 5 is just an amazing game if you have both expansions, brave new world and gods+kings. if not, then the game will suck. so it is basically a dlc-driven game which is not that recommendable, but the game is just so great and soooo addictive. man. never support a dlc . except for this one. go get it.",1
"this is possibly the best game i have ever played and it definately rates no 1 on my have to play list (if i had one)",1
"got trapped on an island and got nuked by ghandi 9/10",1
"its nice but you must play it in long durations of time in order to enjoy the game. playing in in a short period of time is like eating one potato chip",1
"amazing game, proberley the best stratedy game i have ever played. strongley recommend for any person who enjoys stratedy games.",4
"my lord yimotep, this game has half my hours on steam, :d",2
"addictive, fun, immersive strategy game. keeps me entertained for hours on end. amazing work.",1
"awesome game, totally different feel than four(which i consider the pinnacle of the classic civ style of play). introduces city states love them or hate them. the dlc is way too expensive though. i bought the game pre-release which was a huge mistake and resulted in me paying twice as much for the games content where as people who waited for the complete edition(about two years), get a way better deal still to this day. its cheaper for me to buy the complete edition now which duplicates half the content i already own than to buy the content piece meal which is total bs. good game though.",1
"the game with the two expansions (g&k + bnw) changes completely from the vanilla game originally released... it is a completely new experience. you have new units plus a lot of new features to try. the new ideologies, plus tourism and the related cultural victory is a great new addition really. i havent got any problems finishing the game first on marathon length on prince (no special ai bonuses). the only drawback i find is that without many bonuses, the ai has a hard time to keep up with the player after the industrial era (especially if you run for the artillery unit and start decimating the rest of the factions). higher difficulty levels give many different ai bonuses to balance the game (some people may not really like this because it is very easy to notice the ai bonuses, especially early in the game).",2
"nice game, good graphics at least on windows. less fun singleplayer, but hours of enjoyment with friends. 9/10, from me.",1
"i like this game but for some reason it crashes a lot. if anyone can help me figure out why that would be splendid.",1
"the best 4x game out there, period. sid meier makes great games. this is also way better than civbe. dont bother with that for another two years.",5
"list of supplies needed befrore buying this game: - have no social life - have nothing important to do for the rest of you days - have a very sturdy chair - make sure you say goodbye to the sun (whatever that is) and finally... - have an irrational fear of the name ghandi now if ou have this list of supplies ready, then you may proceed in buying this game.",1
"when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold, dyes, and ivory, take my advice. ready all your tanks and nukes, arm them, and shoot them like your life depends on it. they are evil, traitorous demons. never trust them. however, genghis khan is my best friend. he came up to me and was all like, de full do bu la chi mendo. and i said, okay! lets be friends! i can never understand that guy, but something about our relationship just works. ghandi hating simulator 2014 11/10",1
"awsome game fun if you like strategy games but if you get it i suggest brave new world because it adds a lot of things that felt like the game was very bady missing.",1
"civ was one of the first games i ever played and to this day each new addition has been a staple in my life ^_^",1
"love it, have over 300 hrs. not the game. would definitely recommend to people.",2
"as a person who hasnt played a previous installment of civilization, i found it very easy to learn the systems and gameplay and was easily able to have fun with no frustration to what i originally thought to be an overly complex game. while there is certainly complexities for long-time civ fans, it is very easy to pick up and play as a beginner 5/5 the nuances of this game make it a challenge for veterans of the series and simple/fun enough for beginners to play on lower difficulties.",1
"really great game. a must have for gamers that love strategy.",2
"you can get so addicted so this game and spent hours playing",1
"this game is great! a lot of people claim to like civ 4 better, but i kind of like 5. it is a little simpler to manage your empire, city-states are a great addition, and the new combat system requires a bit more skill (no more unit stacking). if you have played the older versions, youll love 5... and if you havent, i would probably recommend started with 5 over 4 :)",3
"a game so addictive it will eat your soul. the game feels extremely rewarding no matter which victory path you choose, be it diplomatic victory, space race, domination victory, or cultural victory. each game expansion dlc drastically changes the game, from the launch cinematics to core game mechanics, making the dlcs worth their value. from great wonders, great people, great works of art and literature, to social policies and idealogy, the game also incorporates historical places, people, and ideas into the game, making it even more attractive to our inner history-nerds.",1
"this fps is soo cool killed 100 space cowboys in this game it was great but the no regenerating health bar kinda sucks but love train simulators 10000000000000000/10000000000000000000",1
"its a  game. for patient people only, very long games, like, minimum of 6 hours. 2 seaters can kill a small child.",2
"this game is a turnbased game, which at first made me dislike it, but that changed, as i began to play more, which showed the true gameplay. the sheer need for actual strategy, makes it worth it.",1
"the most epic game ive ever played (and i have minecraft)",1
"ive put more time in this game than any other steam game i own, for a reason.",1
"i have spent too much time playing this game. it is too addictive, save yourself dont buy it. the only thing i have agaisnt this game is that the ai seems wholy incompetent and the multiplayer interface isnt easily customizable.",3
"can play this game for years at a time, no pun intended. this game does take up so much time. well worth it.",2
"must buy... i find myself playing for hours when i orginally planned to only play maybe an hour or so. the complete edition is worth the cost difference.",1
"awesome game!!!! cant wait for the next one to relsease.",1

"if you havnt become familiar with sid meiers civilization series you dont know what comr games are about. its deep, challenging and you can learn a little about our world. cod lovers need not apply.",2
"destroying other civilizations simply because you can",1

"yaw dis shizz be a pretty good strat 11/10 would play again",2
"civilization v might just be the most addictive videogame i have ever played. the allure of building a civilization from nothing to a global superpower is one that nobody can resist. the games political and militaristic intrigue is more absorbing than anything else youll find on steam, and for a game that doesnt even have a predetermined story that is saying a lot. its expansion packs are more than just glorified dlc; they actually add heaps of extra depth and possibilities to every session. this game will chow down on your free time like atilla chows down ancient era cities. civ v will ruin your life, but you will not give a single .",1
"great example of a turn-based strategy game at its finest. easy to begin and learn the basics, but at the same time difficult to master, civ 5 is a great game if you are the type that is interested in leading an empire. i highly recommend it.",2
"good game but terrible online connection issues which never get sorted.",2
"this  pretty tight its like an asian girl with big boobs just very suprising and underrated",2
"this is the best slow paced strategy game i have ever played.",1
"great game. but it feels like committing a crime to recommend this deadly addictive game to anyone. thus i will.",1
"if you were a fan of any previous civs, this is a game for you. with all the dlc and mods, you are able to shape this game to fit your needs. great game. 10/10.",1
"i really enjoy this game. i can play it while watching tv with the wife.",2
"nice game, you gotta put down a lot of time to be pro, end game for pro player isnt that fun :(",2
"extremely addicting i lost my family and friends while playing didnt give a  cuz i got the hitler mod",1
"its asewome im defenly gone buy beyond earth :)))))",1
"i loved civ 4 but the improvements to this one make it even better, i would recommend this to anyone who likes turn based strategy games.",1
"civ 5 is an awesome game if you are patient and like strategy games. if you are not patient or do not like strategy games you will not like this game at all. before you start you pick a civilization to rule as, the lenth of the game, the size of the map determining the amount of other civivlizations, the map shape, and the difficulty. then you start the game and play as your civilization you picked from 4000 bc to 2050 ad or until you win or get taken over. there are a few different victories; cultural, scientific, economic, and domination victories. you can also play after you win so you can take over any county, win the un, or launch a space program whatever you want to do. i would recommend this game for any one with a decent amount of patients.",1
"i do injoy the game style of the game, as being both challenging and fun is aways a plus in a turn based game.",1
"acivilianhasbeencapturedbybarbarians!awonderyouwerebuildinghasbeenbuiltinafarawayland!acivilianhasbeencapturedbybarbarians!awonderyouwerebuildinghasbeenbuiltinafarawayland!acivilianhasbeencapturedbybarbarians!awonderyouwerebuildinghasbeenbuiltinafarawayland!acivilianhasbeencapturedbybarbarians!awonderyouwerebuildinghasbeenbuiltinafarawayland!acivilianhasbeencapturedbybarbarians!awonderyouwerebuildinghasbeenbuiltinafarawayland!acivilianhasbeencapturedbybarbarians!awonderyouwerebuildinghasbeenbuiltinafarawayland!acivilianhasbeencapturedbybarbarians!awonderyouwerebuildinghasbeenbuiltinafarawayland!acivilianhasbeencapturedbybarbarians!awonderyouwerebuildinghasbeenbuiltinafarawayland! fml, why do i love this game",1
"soo good game! you just have to own it, if you like good strategy games! :)",1
"awesome game! so many variations of game styles allow for a new experience each time",3
"this game is like crack!!! you just tell yourselfone more turn, just one more turn and then you realize that your in the future just like you are in the game!",1
"god has given us the glory of bretrayal and nuclear war with gandhi, thus i give the title of funniest/ funnest game to civ 5, but realy its an amazing game and worth the money.",2
"great strategy game for anyone who has a little too much time on their hands",2
"skip this title, it is not worth getting. it crashes and its ai is broken, dreadfully so. this is the lobotomized edition of civilization, stick with civilization iv, it at least is worth playing.",1
"extremely good, gave me the opportunity to recreate history, i loved!",1
"definitely worth the money, its actually pretty fun to play. the satisfaction of destroying another players entire empire is just too great. the only problem i have is that the dlc is a bit overpriced, but that doesnt affect the standard games gameplay. definitely a good game and definitely worth of game of the year.",2
"well... over 18 hours into the game, and i barely have finished the tutorial and 1 game. need i say more ? alright. apart from its extensive playtime, the gameplay mechanics are excellent, the game is very easily modable (thanks to steam workshop, you can play campains on wwii, lord of the rings, game of thrones and so on), easy to set up as you want, a game can last (from what ive seen) between 10mn and 9+ hours, im sure this is even not a lot compared to what you can do. the mechanics are really easy to learn, but seem to be hard to master. and once you grow tired of being pwned by the computer, you can also get pwned by other players online ! thats wonderful. this game is truly a masterpiece, and should be in every strategy fan library !",1
"i sat down at 5:00pm and started to play this game. dinner time came, and i passed up food so i could keep playing, 11:00pm roled around and i stayed up, the sun camp up and i stayed up to play some more....at 8:30am i realized ive not only been playing for 19 hours without stopping, but i missed my first class....if you want a game to eat your soul and make your life a peace of crap.....please join me in my sadness!",2
"amazing game you could spend hours on and would still be entertaining. with new mods always being added there is always something new to try.",3
"outstanding game, it essentially goes to the begginning of human civilizations and you can deal with problems the way you want to. some mods are cool, some break the game. dlc are great as well and they dont break the game. in all, epic game.",2
"i love this game, one of the best strategy games i have ever played.",1
"just one more turn, then ill call it a night..... eehh one more turn.... wait, when did p.m turn into a.m?",1
"buy it, play it. done. nothing else needs to be said.",1
"thios  is addicting, i spent so much time on this, i sucked  in a parking lot for bnw",3
"this game is simply a must buy, even at full retail price!",1
"one of those games that, once you start, you cant stop playing. civ v is a great starting point for newcomers, you dont need to have played any of the previous games or even games in the same genre - youll understand what to do very quickly. the base game lacks depth, meaning that veterans of the genre may get bored after a few matches but, luckily, the expansions add a lot of much needed content and depth which is bound to please jest about anyone. highly reccomended, but only if you pick up the expansions with it.",1
"love civ so much and this incarnation doesntt dissapoint",1
"the chain had to break somewhere i guess. civ ii, iii, & iv all brought a new dimension to a solid foundation. whereas, civ v sucked so much that it took all of those progressions and pretty much just flushed them down the toilet. i cant get pass the reminder thrust upon me through the clunky  interface as to how much this game truly sucks. slow, boring, depthless gameplay provide a sad fate for the civilization franchise. we had fun while it lasted sid.",2
"civilization 5 is one of the most recent additions to civilization series, which has been defining the rts genre for decades. if you have not played a civilization game before; civilization 5 is a great starting point. amazing game! sooo much fun single player, more fun with a friend! the expancion packs are a great addition to the original game and add alot more depth and complexity to the game. if you are new to the game consider playing without the expancion packs at first, and then add them on. i would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of rts games, is looking for a great single player experience, or has a group of friends to play with; as both the single player and multi player are hours of fun. 10/10.",2
"most time consuming game ever. the best in its category.",4
"great game, you can nuke any country that disagrees with you. 10/10",2
"if you want to play civ 5, suck it up and buy brave new world. it adds the religion system from g&k(you dont the few extra civs) and fixes cultural victories. bnw is what civ 5 should have been on release.",2
"amazing game, would recommend to anyone wanting a fun single and multiplayer game. the skill level required is easily adjusted in the game menu, making this a game suitable for anybody and everybody. ;p",1
"i honestly prefer civ ivs movement grid and that i dont need to keep one melee unit in my millions of archers who seemingly cannot take a town, not to mention the modern infantry being out-ranged by bows and arrows. still, the religion/city state/ideology concepts are enough to keep me playing for just one more turn",1
"america destroyed denmark in thermonuclear warfare 10/10",1
"truly amazing gameplay, immersive landscapes, and an engaging combat style make this game one of my favorites!",1
"first off the bat, this game is amazing. its a strategy where you build you empire as one of the worlds greatest leaders. its highly addicting and worth the purchase for anyone thats a fan of the genre!",1
"good game. however, im not really much of a fan of the civ series. i still much prefer the eu or tw series. its a blast to play with friends though and the ai is pretty good too.",1
"civilization v continues the tradition of 4x games started with sid meiers civilization. when this game first came out i had reservations and doubts but since playing through a number of times ive grown to enjoy it. im still not sure this game needed to be in 3d since when i play these games i love playing on the huge map and trying to win either the diplomatic, culture or space race victories. unfortunately the further into the game you get the texture maps start taking a while to properly map onto the landscape. i have a gtx 550ti with 1gb of ram on this computer so its not exactly a slouch. other than that the usual quibbles about any civ game applies here. the most annoying is the amount of micro-managing later in the game. all in all its a good game and can be very addictive. id recommend getting it if you enjoy 4x games.",1
"i did it! i actually got off after that last turn! -said no civilization player ever",3
"great game to just relax and unwind with. if you get bored, just add mods.",2
"your last words to civilization will be one more turn... youve been warned.",1
"crazily addictive game in single-player. prepare to get shafted in multiplayer.",1
"a great game if you have a weekend to spare. slow going but has lots of strategic gameplay. i enjoy playing with friends. dont expect to finish any of your games though.",1
"great game, worth the money, keep you busy for weeks...",5
"i recommend this game alot. if you play it multiplayer it might be a bit laggy, but it still works. its a really good game where you can challenge the ai in a stragetic game with no possible way of nothing how theyll react.",1
"i have read alot about dont trust ghandi and i get it. the guy is an  in this game. one moment you two are peace buddies and the next he is launching nukes at you while creating an alliance with ghengis khan to  and pillage your cities. oh and by the way dont piss off the city states. and if you do make sure to take all of them over or they will band together as a nation to destroy you. and then ghandi sits in the corner laughing at you. because thats what ghandi does. he lets everyone else kill eachother then nukes the survivors. you hear that noise? its the sound of screams from the nuclear blast and nuclear fallout which ghandi interprets as forgiveness. long story short dont let ghandi get the nuke.",1
"amazing game! well put together, and the graphics are great, especially on a desktop.",1
"one of the only games i cant stop playing! addicting and frustrating! one of the most strategic games you will ever play and one you will either feel accomplished or regretful by the end. a great buy 9/10.",2
"you can build the great wall of china, in britain, not historically accurate but its awesome. i love this game it doeant have the massive scale of total war but its much more simple, and you can make a lot of choices ranging from, how smart you want the other civilizations to be to how much yummy yummy iron you want in your area. its great!",1
"amazing game imo, but only fun for people who are patient and enjoy long strategy games",5
"great game both for playing single player or playing with friends for a long time.",4
"i dont like turn based games much. feel very slow paced and combat is boring, especially if u are used to fast paced rtss.",1
"this is a must have for any kind of strategy player. hundreds of hours of potential game play. easily a 10/10, a gem of a game.",1
"if you have a lot of time to kill...play this. no regrets.",1
"it took only one time through the civ 5 game to appreciate it. now, its my favorite civ game (and i started with civ 1).",4
"good strategic elements. high amount of replay value. getting the steam achievements also make for interesting challenges allowing you explore the other leaders and civs.",3
"new graphics, new people new units, same great game !",2
"i thought i wouldnt like this game because it was turned based but i loved it in the end , and i think it the best turn base game out there! if your a stragety gamer i definetely recommend this game!",1
"time sink: the game holy , its 4am. no like seriously, im writing this at 4am. youd think im up this late because i was playing this game, but youd be wrong. im too lazy to go to bed. but still, this game is amazing. 4.75/5",1
"excellent and vastly time consuming. great game by itself, but really starts to come into its stride with the brave new world expansion pack. love it!",1
"if you like crack, this is the game for you! often times i would find myself thinking man, i wish i had some crack. but just after one day of playing this game i realized, i dont need crack! i only need this game! so for all you hardcore fans of addicting things, you havent not lived until youve played this game! 10/10 cant stop playing",1
"one of the most time killing games ive ever played. its addicting like mad. completely recommended.",1
"if you have a life and buy this game, youre gonnna have a bad time.",3
"you can play hours of this game in one go without wanting to leave! it is an amazing mouse only game you you can sit in your chair and not have to worry about any typing! get it naow!!!",1
"the game is a blast in multiplayer. i highly recommend this game for groups of friends to play.",1
"fantastic game, very addictive, but will suck every minute out of an entire day if you dont watch the clock",1
"legendary game! have to get the expansions also, though.",1
"very good game, reached perfect with the expansions. must buy! very addictive!",1
"i have been a long time fan of civ games and this one is just the natural progression of what has been a very good line of games. anyone a fan of strategy and 4x games would do well to play this. combined with the workshop, there is endless replay value to an already great game. i even recommend all the dlc, and that is something i rarely do. get it, play it, its good. 85% greatness. (where 50% is average)",4
"i can spend years playing this game! fun solo player, and fun with friends :d a great way to destroy your friends egos!!!!!",1
"dont buy this game it will ruin your life you will lose all friends who dont have civ please hear my warning",2
"deep,addictive and fun thats all you need in a game",2
"brilliant game, best strategy game i have ever played",1
"civilization. sid meiers civilization 5 -     ,      .       , ,   . .      .",1
"a lot of fun multiplayer or singleplayer i recommend this game if you want a strategy game to play offline, it has a very high replayablity. the ridiculous situations you can find yourself in are amusing enough but that is just icing on the cake the feeling of toppling a rival nation is quite rewarding.",1
"this is the perfect game if you have no friends. once you get this game you wont need them. if you have friends...eh screw them.",1
"man,,, this game is addicting.. i got straight 12 hours nonstop from beginning. the gameplay was good turn-based, the content was amazing, and the soundtrack is mesmerizing simply beautiful, i forget everything when playing, even breathing :p pros : - amazing turn-based game - splendid rich content - mesmerizing ost cons : - need more content :p",1
"this game is awsome fun and great to play with friends",1
"create huge worlds and conquer the world without having to leave the house to start a third world war. its a very big and fun game. definitly worth a buy, especially when its for sale.",1
"awesome game. id recomend it to the people who like to stratizise by managing a country and keeping to ghanids from biting your face off (that was a refrence to when me and my friend played with 8 ghandis!)",3
"a strategy game made simple. there is a very small learning curve, so impatient people such as myself are able to get into it quickly. graphics are pretty, and fill the world with color. civilization v is probably the only strategy game i enjoy playing as i cant really get into fantasy or sci-fi type strategy games (e.g. civilization: beyond earth), and civilization v is alone in being a good, recent game out there that takes place on our earth. playing with existing countries, historical figures, and real life wonders brings the whole thing closer to home. im sure many share my sentiment. overall, its a fun game in which ive managed to eek out well over two hundred hours, and im looking forward to civilization vi. i highly recommend the expansion packs, if thats what theyre called.",2
"this game is amazingly addictive... buy it! it has insane replayability, and you can download thousands of addons from the steam workshop to change the game for when (if) you actually do get bored of playing it.",2
"buy this now. why havent you bought it yet? its one of the top 3 games ever.",3
"excellent strategy game, definitely worth a try! (watch out for derpy ai tho)",1
"ghandi will mercilessly roll through your entire civilisation, murdering helpless women and children in an attempt to satisfy his desire for destruction. a man not to be trifled with, may mercy be upon you if you ever become his neighbour.",1
"want a game that will keep you busy for hours, maybe not fun but certainly keep you busy... buy this game. wont say its my fav. of the civ series, but its not bad. my issue is with the expansion packs; you pay a lot of money and it never feels like you get much overall for that money. this is one of those cases while the game id buy if want it, id hang about for a sale on the expansions, especially brave new world as thats often more expensive then the actual game. :-/",1
"my first experience of a civilzation game (took advantage of the complete set being onsale) - all i can say is awesome and what a day killer! very enjoyable way to waste time :-)",1
"great strategy game! the endless ways you could build your city keeps the game interesting upon playing over and over.",1
"civilization is a amazing turn-based strategy game. you don need fps reflex or precision you only need your brain! you can choice between many famous civilazations to rewite their history, you can shape their culture, military and economic how ever you want what ever your playstyle is diplomatic, science or just destroy them with force. civ is the game for you! 10/10 - it wil consume your time, like a blackhole",1
"this game is the game that will make you late to work if you play it. right now im still getting used to it, will update review later, but right now, 100% worth getting it!",1
"woah! what is this? a strategy game? hell yea, its a damn strategy game. and thats a strat-a-gey! in this game, you need to think up a plan right from the start, and stick with it! well, try to anyways, but the instant you find gandhi, elizabeth, or even george washinton, you may find yourself going from a peacemaker to a warmonger, or vice-versa, or maybe youll just stay as the guy who stays in the corner of the world doing nothing other than having one company endlessly make games for the rest of the world, but yknow, whatever. this game is definately worth the time wasted. #tenouttaten. well, more like 9.99999/10, but this isnt math class.",1
"this game is simply a must have for all people who have steam.",2
"have you ever conquored a nation? well, have you ever conquered a nation on weeeeeeeeeeed?",1
"one more turn please............probably the most addictive game ever....",1
"dont piss off gandhi. 10/10 would get nuked again.",1
"pretty fun game, but when you add brave new world, it becomes awesome. many hours spent playing this.",1
"one the the best turn-based strategy games i have ever played",4
"ok so i got one big gripe with this gsme: its got more than 5 civilization!",1
"very enjoyable, slow and time consuming, but fun nonetheless.",2
"if your a fan of multiple choices than this is your game. even though there is no campaign there are thousands of ways to play and all of them have their own benifts. if you choose to kill and  everone than youll town will be unhappy and rebel or you could be a peaceful sceintific civilization and life in harmony, you choose and thats what i like, the choices.",1
"if you like strategy games in general, or just want a game that has replay value to the max, civilization v is the game for you. it is one of those games where its easy to learn, but hard to master. i have played civilization v more than 350 hours, and i can say that you get alot of game for the money. i give this game a 9.5 out of 10.",2
"this map script uses various manipulations of perlin noise to create landforms, and generates climate based on a simplified model of geostrophic and monsoon wind patterns. rivers are generated along accurate drainage paths governed by the elevation map used to create the landforms.",2
"i cant stop playing this game with my friend xd singerplayer and multiplayer is awesome",1
"amazing game but if you played command and conquer and liked it and the how short the games are (about an hour on average for me) civizilation is way different kind of the same concept but each game (depending on map size) can take up to all day the shortest game ive had was 3 hours but steam some reason didnt save my longest game so it says i only have 7.5 hours my longest game was 13 hours with maybe an hour of brake time so when you play this you better have alot of time on your hands! id reccomend the elder scrolls map (cant think of the name of the map with all elder scrolls games) and middle earth they are both really cool",1
"when i first saw this game i thought it was crap and it woulnt be worth my time but thankfully i was mistaken this game is amazing and worth buying if youre a fan of chess and worth getting because of this but beware cod fanboys this game is not  hor you casue this game you need patience to play this 7/10",3
"a great way to lose seven hours without realising it. if youre going to play this game, be prepared to lose track of time very easily.",1
"fantastic game! you can sit down and play what you think is 5 min and look outside and its dark its so imercive",1
"completely addictive game! can sit down and play for hours without even realising. recommend to anyone",1
"satisfyingly you can play a whole game of this masterpiece lose and then want to start a whole new game with new ambitions and goals.",1
"a very addictive, fun game for players/strategists of any skill level!",2
"peaceful strategy game with fantastic music, wonderful quotes from famous people, and amazingly accurate historical information within. due to its slower and highly strategic gameplay, its probably not for everyone. but it is easy to learn; it plays like a much like if chess, risk (stratego), and warhammer 20k had a baby; but with historically accurate units and structures. however, be aware that this game is a horrendous resource hog. no matter how powerful your machine, this game will slow it down.",2
"this game is pretty good and i spent a lot of time on it",1
"excellent turn-based strategy. its like risk, monopoly, and simcity combined.",1
"great game, great stategery, great explosions, great doges.",4
"one of the greatest strategy games i have ever played.",2
"this game will rip your balls off and have you begging for more.",1
"toss up between civ v and civ iv for best in series, but definitely a close match. a lot depends on preferences. this one is definitely more streamlined and probably easier for a newcomer though.",2
"say goodbye to your life if you want to get this game it is the only thing you will want to do absolutely amazing strategy game",1
"i had to stop myself at 19 hours but this game will make you lose sleep if you start playing before you go to sleep.",1
"awesome strategy game. reccomended to anyone who wants to create their own empire from nothing and then nuke the  out of ghandi.",1
"ive been a fan of civ since civ 4 which i know isnt long but nonetheless civ is still one of the best strategy games ive played and probably always will be. i would highly recommend it.",1
"one of my all time favourite games to play on steam",2
"started playing at 3 pm, suddenly i realize its already 1 am.",1
"just doing this for a badge. though is a good game",1
"this is ranked as my number one game out there. this requires thinking and strategy on how to play your game and each decision you make changes the course of the whole playthrough. would highly recommend this to people who are looking for strategy games and want to challenge themselves.",2
"it says ive played 47 hours, but there are about 20 that werent tracked for some reason. ive started two games and finished one in that time. just one more turn...",1
"i have spent more time on this game than probably any other game ive ever played. if you can get the gods and kings expansion with it, but it stands up on its own well enough to warrant a purchase.",4
"its a really good game most people dont like it because they only play the 1st 100bc years so really they dont play but its a really good game so i hope you comment this and buy the game :d",1
"i cant recommend this game highly enough. there are so many different ways to play, to win and to lose. not to mention the virtually limitless replay value.",1
"best strategy game that is around now!!!! most definitely a keeper",2
"amazing game to play alone or with your friends. very relaxing at times, but you do need to think about how you will win or at least not lose in the first turns :d i have played it for years now and i absolutely love it. 5 stars, recommend it.",1
"great and fun game to play.... love every minute in game!",1
"this is my favorite game of all time. i really like how the game is based off history, but it makes it fun.",1
"the obsession.....unending, unstopable, all three expansions....so addicted....help me......",2
"a true overhaul of the civilization franchise. this game brings in big changes. the most notable being the hex-based gameplay and the removal of unit stacking. those two things greatly change the way you play the game, and definitally for the better. the overlay is improved, and now when you end your turn the game doesnt pull you to each city and force you to choose what building/unit to build. which is a small, but much needed improvement. the new systems also make smaller empires more vialbe. being the biggest and baddest empire is no longer the primary concern. the game also makes it very easy to download and install mods, which further improves the game. its good, and feels like civilization while still offering a fresh experience.",1
"it may be prettier, and the combat may be substantially better, but overall civ5 is several steps back from civ4. if i wanted to kill stuff in a turn-based strategy game, there are a lot of games that do it even better than this, and civ4 is better in almost all the non-combat areas of the game (aside from graphics, but whatever). disappointing. it does have potential though, and im hoping the expansions will eventually improve on the things that are lacking. it is significantly more approachable and easier to get into, at least. note that this is based on the base game only, and im somewhat unfairly comparing civ4 with all expansions to civ5 with no expansions.",1
"step 1. play as the english step 2. ally with the iroquois step 3. skype with iroquois leader step 4. scream manifest destiny mother er!!!!!!!! into the mic, and slam your troops into him. step 5. destroy everything except a group of settlers and workers, and send them northward into the lands of barbarians and enemy nations 10/10 would conquer again.",1
"as mayan i discovered a war between poland and usa in the same continent. finally japan conquered the continent but i won by cultural victory with mayan rock and rollers 10/10",1
"i recommend this game, sadly when i was in sweden... the pirated version is a lot quicker on fixing bugs than the company. i bought two of these games because they did not accept donations and are probably mad that sweden allows pirating.",1
"a relaxing evening of strategy amongst friends is recommended for the best experience.",1
"sid meiers civilization v is the best strategy game ive played. the new hex grid tile system works extremely well for combat, allowing for a much more strategic, intellectual battle. sadly, the game doesnt fully feel complete without both the gods & kings and brave new world dlc packs. g&ks revamps the technology tree, adds more buildings, units, and civilizations, includes an espionage system, and adds a religion system to the game. bnw adds a new cultural system/victory, new civilizations, ideologies, trade routes, and a world congress. both dlc packs are a must-have for the full, complete experience. be prepared to be a victim of just one more turn.",5
"this game makes me so happy. you get to choose your own civilization and u gets to rule it. you have to care about eonomy and military things in this game and this is why this game is so fun!!! i would say this is a second best game every.. (first is cod)",5
"civ v is the most comprehensive strategy game i have ever seen and with the steam workshop it makes it more fun than ever.",3
"i have learned one thing from playing this game: dont mess with gandhi. he doesnt forget. he doesnt forgive.",1
"this game has eaten uncountable hours of my life that i can never get back. it has also polluted my mind with a false history that continues to muddle itself with reality to this day! ghandi did nuke bismark in 1967, right? right?",3
"civ 5 is a very interdependent game copying the phyics from go go ninja boreo. each of these games consist of one of the players using their fedoras to seduce their enemies untill loving them to a point where one cant love anymore.",1
"this game destroyed my sleeping schedule....... but within the same day, it fixed my sleeping schedule. 24/10 would destroy and fix my sleeping schedule again!",1
"this game is so much fun!! i bought it before 4 days and i got 23 hours on this 0_0. just play as your country then destroy everyone :d. i love when other leaders want to kill me but they are too scared to :d. i recommend you to play as arabia it is the beast :). this my first review.",1
"sooooooooooooo good yooooo, if you dont have this game yet than your missing out! 10/10 sick brah!",1
"fantastic game! if you have played past civ games, you will love this. certain elements to the game, such as barbarians, have improved to seem far more realistic.",1
"nuclear warheads, what more could i possibly say other than death robot. oh wait, it has those too.",1
"this game is almost a s addictiong as drugs. great game.",1
"never ever trust ghandi or germeny they will kill you",1
"so addidictive, so many hours of sleep lost for one more turn",2
"10/10, would bang. god, i love this game. i cant think of a single negative thing to say regarding it. if youve got the money go buy it right now. the expansions are also worth the price. adding thos game to your library will most likely be one of the best decisions youll ever make.",1
"one of the best strategic games i have played. hell, this is the best ever. you can play it for years and you will not get bored, theres always something new to see or achieve. just one more turn...",2
"dis game is the best game ever made by anybody except those other games that are better but its an okay game the previous one was butter",1
"this game blows. after decades of civ2-4 play, i tried over and over to get into this game. i couldnt. its civ in risk: the board game form. actually, id venture to say its less complex than risk. dont waste your time. its unfortunate im about 4 years too late on this one.",1
"civ 5 is a huge improvement on civ 4, both in mechanics, visuals and gameplay. i feel it is more friendly towards the first time player. the additions made in the brave new world expansion pack make it by far the best in the series and one of my favourite strategy games of all time.",2
"an amazing strategy game for newcomers and civ veterans alike! theres so much customization available in this game. if thats not enough for you, theres some great stuff in the workshop that the communitys made. really great, addicting game!",1
"ignore everyone until i reached nukes. then i nuked everyone. i won, but the victory was hollow. there was nobody else to enjoy the irradiated earth with me. next time i shall keep a pet civilization to entertain me. 10/10. highly recommend.",1
"for those who played civ2 for the whole life and now trying civ5 - dont build the same amount of roads/mines and farmlands. now they cost. a lot.",1
"awesome, in-depth turn based game. recommended for anyone who enjoys world history and/or complicated strategy.",1
"very good game, lots of fun and easy to play with friends.",2

"i was gonna stop playing, but then i didnt, and i just kept on no stopping playing... yeah, i have a problem.",2
"civ is civ. the only thing i didnt care for is that units arent really what they appear, stats are the only thing that is taken into consideration. so if enough spearman gang up on your tanks, your tanks will lose.",1
"awesome strategy game... 21st century chess. very addictive too! great graphics and sound, music, fun, and lots of strategies to win!",2
"one of the greatest stratergy turn-based games of all time. easy on the eyes and an extremely enjoyable game to wrap your head around. turtle and amass your strength, or spread everywhere as quickly as possible and claim everything.",1
"this is an amazing game. ruling the world couldnt be more fun. has the option to play a more casual quick game, or a more hardcore long game (can take days to finish). great game. hours and hours of possible gameplay, and there are almost always good deals on it. buy it!!",1
"this game ruined my life, ive spent countless hours playing this game in the hopes that one day i will control the world. many nights spent awake sitting on this game figuring out what the  do research agreements do. 10/10 game.",3
"amazing game, but dont expect to play a quick game. i have spent over 50 hours on this game (at the time of writing this review), but have only just finished my first civ. simply wonderful strategy game.",1
"easily one of the best strategy games of all time.",1
"excellent game. gant wait for the next expansion.",1

"very deep and involved turn based strategy game where you take a nation from nothing to top of the world. is extremly fun and can end up sinking quite a few hours if you arent careful.",1
"great game. im an achievement fiend, and achieving these brings me back to this game over and over again. love the variety and enjoy that i can play different things and learn different skills depending what i want to achiee.",1
"absolutely amazing. literally nothing bad i can say about it.",1
"fantastic update to the civ. franchise. i love the variety that the newly added civs bring to the table.",2

"love this game, thumbs up for sure. played the different versions before purchasing the steam compilation. wish i could rotate the loading videos from the original, to g&k, then bnw.",1
"literally crack. dont expect to play this game for only 10 minutes. those 10 minutes will turn into 5 hours and after those 5 hours you will still want more. possibly the most addictive game ive ever played. 10/10 seriously.",1
"ive played this series from civ2 onwards and i continue to be amazed with the depth of gameplay. be warned that this is is one of those, ... just one more turn. games and will keep you up late at night.",3

"this game stole what little i had left of my social life... you should play it...",1
"founded radical islam and spread it all over the world... 10/10",1
"a really good game! the single player is very good and the multiplayer is even better. but its the dlc that really makes the game come alive. the mods dont always work.",1
"this is an exceptionally great turn based strategy game. i havent played many other games like this but it has encouraged me to. i actually hadnt played the other 4 games in the civilization series and i found getting into the game a bit tricky but with the help of some mates and the wiki i managed to love the game. i ended up creating a relatively awesome empire only to be crushed by a backstabbing friend. so if youre wondering wether to buy this game or not i would recommend you do and buy the dlc brave new world, it adds so much and makes it so much better. buy it, get into the game and start up with your friends.",1

"really fun. it just get better with friends online too. perfect if you have the time for a good marathon game.",1
"i like role playing as the glorious female leader of carthage.",1
"this is a game of strategy (obviously) and forethought. you have to go into a game with a plan and be able to adapt to your surroundings provided your plan goes south. i grew up playing warcraft 2 and warcraft 3, even age of empires for my choices of strategy games. this is the first civilization game in which i have played but after playing it i have to say that it is my new favorite strategy game.",2
"i love this game and others like it. i can sit down to play and before i know it the sun has set. its a great game!",2
"awesome game, wide varity of game styles with all the different civs. been playing for 6 months now at least and i can still happily spend an entire weekend playing a single game.",1
"civilization v is one of my favorite games i have on my computer. its like creating your own history. da is good :)",3
"great game if you like fps shooters. has many perks and killstreak rewards. amazing game, one hit knife kills, quickscoping action. what more could you ask for? be grateful theres no annoying 6 year olds always screaming for booby milk through the voice chat. conquer, unite, explore, or thrive. your choice",1
"im like master chief, who is such a boss, we both look good in green, very cool, and very strong.",1
"fantastic. a great mix of strategy and action. pros - graphics - mod support - dlc is superb - customizable maps - customizable scenarios con - takes up your time, because of how long some games/playthroughs can be.",2
"if you like strategy games like xcom. buy it. if you like pew pew games. buy it. if you dont have cash get a friend to gift it to you.",1
"this game will riun your life.... so worth it!!! amazing game, very addictive.",5
"i remember being captivated by civ1 back in high school while at a friends house. when civ2 was released, it dropped my college gpa possibly a whole point - it was that good. civ5 has taken the franchise to new heights. most of the annoyances are gone and there are many new facets of gameplay to explore like the faith system. im a little late to this game - its been out for a while but i really regret not purchasing this game earlier.",1
"amazing never has there been a bad civ and they always get better rarely do titles get better for the community because past games seem to be better take for example cll of duty ghost was hated soo much as it was compared to black ops which was amazing but civ looking back i thnk this is the best one yet the machanics are way more smother there are better graphics i love it good work sid miers anyone who loves this game should try beyond earth seriously it is amazing.",1
"a fun game!! but it is a black hole for your time... ()",1
"playing this before going to bed = morning. wait what happened?",1
"a well made game. includes tons of fun and opportunity to learn a little about historie while playing.",1
"i simply cannot get enough of this game. i play very often and for long periods at a time. in my opinion, it is the best thing i have ever played, and i have played a lot. i love the concept, the ideas, the execution, and all the many things that go into this game. i preach the gospel of civilization v to all of my friends. im not the best at explaining why i like it though, so you should really just try it out for yourself.",4
"its one of the best games of his category. very enjoyable in single player but multiplayer is hard to play with others",1
"by far the best strategy game to play with friends",2
"turned u.s.a into nuclear wasteland while playing as rome 10/10",1
"this game is amazing.. its eating up every moment of my free time.. which is somehow a good thing :)",1
"do you enjoy crushing your enemies? overwhelming your friends with your intelligence? do you seek a strategy game that doesnt require any skill in hotkeys or keybindings? buy this master piece right now",2
"extremely fun and relaxing and is great to play with friends. gaming can last for hours and a time.",1
"this game is great if you like the strategy type of city/civilization builders. *note* gandhi is a smug piece of . he will come to ruin you if you denounce him... even if you trust him hell stab you in the back. theres no winning with that jerk.",1
"its so easy to lose hours of time playing this game, and its easy to have fun advancing your civ and plotting against other civs. amazing game.",1
"hands down my favorite game to waste time on. its endless hours of fun and i am still not bored of it.",2
"what does it say about a strategy game when im able to figure out a first-order optimal strategy in my first complete game against the ai? this is technically my first civilization game--i never played the other civ games as a kid because i always found them a bit impenetrable, but firaxis deserves credit for their attempts to streamline the experience for newcomers.",1
"awesome game with hours of playability. the best part is it never ends up the same way even if you go to a save game part way through the game it is still going to be a different outcome.",1
"solid. true to the series. nice sound and graphics. fairly well made ui. tons of achievements, mods, and re-playability. can get bogged down after many hours of play, but restarting clears the problem.",3
"recently picked up brave new world, and i must say the civ franchise just keeps getting better, and better, and better. i have probably logged more hours of civilization in all its incarnations than any other franchise, and i heartily recommend it to anyone with a decent attention span, especially if they enjoy history!",3
"little too different from the good old original games",1
"dont ever play this  vanilla. thats a mistake. boy get the expansions, both if you can but at least gods and kings. now lets build an empire.  your workers were stolen by barbarians. go find their bandit campm all right, there it is. lets get our worker back, yeah? warriors and archers all up on that camp! get rekt bandit nerds! hahaha! yeah, now we can finally improve some tiles and maybe build that great library you wanted.... the great library has been built in a far away land.",3
"best turn base game out there if you have all the dlc you will get bored after 500 h +. it is amazing !!!",2
"civ v, a semi-complex turn based strategy game where you are a leader of a civilization trying to stand the test of time and become the best civilization and be lost in history. this game is pretty addicting spending about around 2 hours to complete a quick game offline, though i have not tried multiplayer (as i feel as if im not ready) im sure you will find lots of fun in this game. also, steam workshop! 10/10",1
"im just gonna do a quick match -10 hours later- i cant feel my legs !!! 10/10 would chop off my legs",1
"from the beginning, there were several things missing to make civilization 4 the more superior game, with all of the added expansions and dlc, coming from someone who has wasted thousands of hours on the civilization series...i much prefer civilization 5 to the others now. this is the closest its going to get to managing an empire, forging a large group of people the way you want and almost everything about them. there is a large learning curve but i assure you, if you get past the initial bump you will amass countless and countless amount of hours as i have in to this beautiful game. i reccomend this to any one even remotely interested in strategy games, or games of the slower nature. i do not recomend this to anyone who is impatient by nature.",5
"if you like deep strategy games, where a military conquest isnt always the right move, then try out civilization v. this game has kept me up late at night with its engrossing gameplay, brilliant interface and wonderful design. ...just...one...more...turn...",1
"best game i have ever played! only buy if you dont mind getting addicted to games!",1
"sid meiers civilization v nothing more needs to be said....",2
"great game for anyone who likes strategy. pretty addicting too. overall, great game.",2
"civilization v single-handedly drew me into the strategy game genre. the streamlined mechanics allows simplicity for a new player to pick up, but still retains depth for those looking to get more out of it. each playable civ is extraordinarily unique and the multiple paths towards victory increase replay value to a tremendous degree. this game is defintely worth purchasing, for history nerds like myself, strategy gamers, and just about anyone else (you cant go wrong with snagging this during the holiday sale). try it out!",1
"love it goes threw history great sound affects, music, and art",2
"i vouch for this game if you got ocd like me. ill beat it, then say im gonna do it a different way next time around... then i done played it half a dozen times and still wanna try new ways.",2
"uh huh, this is my  all the girls stomp your feet like this a few times ive been around that track so its not just gonna happen like that because i aint no hollaback girl i aint no hollaback girl -washington",1
"civilization v is probably best strategy game ever made. it has countless hours of gameplay at your disposal and many ways to win the game. there is really not much to say about this one, just if you want many hours of fun developing your civilization to rise on top of every other buy this game! 10 / 10",1
"its pretty fun to just do a lan or play with friends. remake alpha centauri!",1
"if you want to play a board game but cant be bothered to set it up, then empire earth is the game for you",1
"civ 5 is the last in the series of the civ 5 games, a turn-based empire building game. a lot of fun as long as you have the patience and get the statisfation of building a nation and dominate the world. >:d",2
"my first steam game, purchased on release god knows how many years ago. i will likely play this game until civ6 appears.",2
"first got into it from the yogscast series, finally bought it and it is now one of my favourite games. highly recommend",1
"this is a game where you will spend hours playing. you will neglect to eat, sleep, or even go to the bathroom just to watch your country grow and prosper. if you have 5-7 hours to spare, this is a great time sink.",2
"it gives you a reason to stay up until 3 every night, even when you dont want to or really shouldnt. it just does through pure unadulterated substance. 10/10 will play every day for the rest of my life.",1
"warning: may take up to an eternity to finish one match. 5 stars. would definitely reccomend.",1
"an amazing game with love hate and an awful lot of murder!",2
"great game, hours seem like seconds when you play. the first time i played, i started at about 8:00 pm, i said, ill play for a couple of hours and go to bed. after what i though was two hours, i look at the clock and it was 3:30. be careful while playing civ, you will lose track of time.",1
"great strategy game. you can get hundreds of hours out of it, whether it be single player or multiplayer (with friends or not). highly recommended. get it now.",2
"i love this game, but its so ing buggy and crahes a ton, as soon as i start it up, it gets to the first loading screen and stops working",3
"garbage. ... and dont believe the hype, brave new world has exactly the same fundamental flaws as the base game.",1
"get this, and you can build a huge country within 1000 years. and then kill off a billion barbarians. and then steal other peoples monuments by building them first. and have your little men build twisty roads. and then bomb another country who keeps warning you that youre getting to close to their borders. very fun :d",2
"if you like grand strategy type of games, this one is prolly for you. get the god and kings dlc, it makes this game sooo good.",4
"very deep turn-based strategy game. its a lot of fun, but you have to be careful because it will suck you in and youll lose hours upon hours.",1
"best game ever if you want a game to eat up large chunks of your life and make 6 hours seem like 5 minutes then this is the game for you,.",1
"best in the franchise, best in its genre. civilization v is one of my favourites games ever made. its biggest issue is how addictive it is. but hey, they say that time enjoyed is not time wasted, right? 10/10",2
"one of the best strategy games ive ever played 8.5/10",2
"one of the most enjoyable games you can play (and get sucked into)",1
"thursday 11 pm, work tomorrow, i decide to play for like an hour or two before going to bed at 8:30 am i finish a standard pace game with a cultural victory for greece, work at 10 am, i decide to get a short nap before i prepare to go out at 10:30 my boss calls, i answer something like i still have several turns of sleep left and pass out on monday im probably getting fired, 10/10 would get fired again",3
"one of the best strategic games of this era. best replacement for chess in decades :)",1
"wonderful game, better than civ 4 in all ways, great mechanics although you need to buy gold(deluxe eddition) for gods and kings (the expansion pack) other wise the game is a little buggy and bad, any way great game all round!",2
"i would write a total in-depth review, but i need to take 1 more turn. at least its only 8pm...",1
"one of the best strategy games of all time. a must have for an sid meiers fan.",1
"there is not enough words to describe how amazingly fun this game is and i have yet to meet someone who doesnt enjoy playing the game :) there are a variety of courses you can choose to go whether you choose to destroy everyone in your path or possibly be a diplomatic leader who strives in culture. the game is extremely fun when you play with your friends and like monopoly it seems to take forever to actually finish. you dont have to play with friends, but it certainly can bring a new edge to the game unlike playing against npcs. in conclusion, if you are looking for a long lasting enjoyable game that you can play by yourself or with friends, then look no further ^_^",1
"the giant of 4xy games returns, its just as fun as ever, and fixes a lot of the issues that civ iv had (no more stacksodoom anymore)",2
"a very good time spender. if bored, this will give you fun and absorb your time. very nice and well thought out.",3
"this game is great if you like strategy games, aswell as turn-based games and real-life scenarios. if you are a history geek like i am, you will absolutely love this game!",1
"amazing game, soooooooooo many hours lost to this puppy! get involved, try out all the different variations to victory! you just cant get bored!",2
"when i was younger i remember seeing my grandpas computer one day filled with little characters and hexes (pause/ standby screen); the game was civilization ii. i later learned how great the series was. cilization v is especially good. the updates they have made to the game help a great deal in adding some complexity that was missing when the game was first released. great multiplayer game for friends to just chill and play together.",2
"this game got me back to gaming. very addicting and re-playable. i got it on sale and worth every penny.",2
"civilization v is an amazing real time strategy that i personally recomend for all levels of gaming but i agree that this game is a good choice to play.",1
"if you wanted to know what it was like for montezuma to come back from the dead and send giant death robots after you, then this is the game for you.",1
"want a nice slow paced turn based game well look no further. this game is very nice with a nice little tech tree and getting samurais to slaughter you enemies who take your friken horses! to figure out that gandi is a  who only wants peace then backstabs you for some salt.",1
"built a massive military, simultaneously nuked every other country, and took over the world. 10/10.",1
"lots of land to explore, lots of different civilizations to play and ways to improve your growing kingdom. this game does take a bit of time to play, but it is rewarding for all the hours you put into it. this was the first civilization game i played and it taught me some things in history that i didnt know. with all the content put into this game (now including dlc brave new world and mods) this game should keep you busy for quite a while.",1
"awesome game! one of the few pc gems out there so dont miss out!",1
"by far one of the only civilizations that ive consistantly played since i bought it.",1
"awesome game! there must be a feture like an alarm o.o time passes by so quick *sigh",1
"i think civ 5 is the best game ive ever played. on any console. period. which is a big ask when youre going up against killer instinct from the original gameboy...i digress. civ 5 is simply amazing. replayability is endless. the mechanics are flawless (well, probably. i couldnt think of a single way to improve it). the combat is exciting and the strategies are many and varied. its hands down the best turn-based strategy game ever, and even in its 5th installment still has new innovations that just improve on what was already a great series. i have sunk so many hours into this game, the only drawback is that you will have many sleepless nights and bleary mornings if you install this game. but if there ever was a game that justified sleepless nights and bleary mornings, then this is it.",3
"ive managed to play 254 hours of it and im still not bored.",2
"so addictive! its so difficult to save and put this game down...",3
"no problems installing, and a fantastic gameplay experience. when is civ 6 coming out?",2
"super fun game, one of those games you spend all night playing :)",1
"civilization v is one of the best games to play with a good group of friends. during my playtime ive had tons of fun alone and with group. also it has many mods that will make the game diffrent and fun. everyone should definetly have try with this. plus its also playable with hangover!",1
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",2
"brilliant game. its an excellent time killer and its not hard to get a grasp of either. the diplomatic panel is smooth and pretty easy to use and the movement is basic but effective. 9.5/10",3
"i fought with the usa as rome. war came to an end with me gaining new york and boston. usa built the great wall of china. egypt attacked usa and took washington. ah civilization living up to its historical accuracy once again!",1
"good game for people who like controling world! :d",1
"very deep game with a ton of replayability. you are the ruler of a nation and you must build it up from the stone age to the space age and everything in between. absolutely recommended!",2
"when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold, dyes, and ivory, take my advice. ready all your tanks and nukes, arm them, and shoot them like your life depends on it. they are evil, traitorous demons. never trust them. however, genghis khan is my best friend. he came up to me and was all like, de full do bu la chi mendo. and i said, okay! lets be friends! i can never understand that guy, but something about our relationship just works. ghandi hating simulator 2014 11/10",1
"so addictive.. bought with all the dlc and it was worth it!",1
"keris warrior, most op unit. horrible ai that force you to kill them all because of they filthy mouth and annoying city spawn. you can invent internet before computer. why build swordsman (beside keris warrior) if you can straight to musketeer? done on researching ship of the line? time to conquer the world, noob. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- actually my playing time is more than 1000 hours on the dark side of the port.",1
"this game is awesome, buy it and i will give you a hug in the most least gay way possible :)",2
"hundreds of hours of fun. one of my all time favorite games. good control of your civilization, and great game mechanics makes creates a strong replayabilty value. the music creates a good atmosphere and the fact that it is turn based allows you to play the game at your own pace and start and stop at any time. i can not recall the amount of times i have woken up early in the morning, brewed a pot of coffee, casually start a marathon game, and end up looking at a clock only to fine that it is eight at night. tl;dr: absolutely phenominal game, amd the sale that is currently going on is way too good to pass up.",1
"this is a good game once you get the hang of it fun solo and multiplayer",2
"an awesome game with loads of possibilities. it also works excellent on my mbp mid 2012.",1
"i secound the people who say just one more turn... but be wary, it might not work 100% of the time (but it does work)",1
"great game, have lots of fun playing this especially with friends, very good for a multiplayer strategy game however the number of dlc for extra nations is abit annoying but there are many nations you can add from the steam workshop, worth the money.",1
"best game ever, just finnished my first game as the dutch and going back for a second!!!",1
"holy  is all i can say. this is an amazing civ game. i wont say its the most complex but it feels very fulfilling to play. absolutely love it.",1
"i grew up on civ and this is another great installment.",1
"this game is great. the multiplayer is really fun, strategy is really fun, this game is just really fun, it makes you think . it easy to get sucked into this game",1
"amazing game. very in-depth and great game style. 10/10",1
"after 4 years of game play; it still gives the first days enthusiasm.",2
"although this is one of my favorite games, if you dont currently own it, i would hold off. the one main reason is that the dlcs are moneygrabs (but dont get me wrong, they really change the gameplay of the game). if you love strategy games then this one would be perfect for you. in hindsight, i would have waited to but it (i bought the gold edition) simply because they continually release dlcs that arent the cheapest (for example: brave new world and gods and kings)",1
"this game is well worth a play for any sort of stratergy gamer at any level. weather you prefer war or peace this game is for you! the easy to play style with diferent ways to win means every game is different. with diferent faction units bulidings and effects you can enjoy playing diferent leaders (my faverouts are russia and japan). anyway i hope you buy this game and enjoy this. if you have this game feel free to add me for a multiplayer game.",1
"absolutely detestfull. , 2009 graphics and a boring slowpaced peice of ing  turn based gameplay system. this game is easily one of the biggest whates of money i have ever invested into.  civ5. as soon as you get into the game hardly anything is explained, and it is incredibly hard to work out what the actual objective ing is. total dog .",1
"i love the game ive playedb 140 hours of it in 1 month",3
"definatly worth a try. confusing at first, but when you know what to do, is incredibly addictive, and entertaining when playing with friends.",2
"great barbarian simulator. did you say you had to disconnect from the host for a second? good, because you needed a few more cities. -a.i. ghandi was very happy to eradicate me using his stockpile of nuclear weapons. moving around in this game is almost as exciting as walking in dayz. 10/10 would recommend to fellow walking simulator fans.",1
"a most excellent rts. my first civ game, most definetly not my last !!!",1
"gets rid of some of the annoyances of previous civilization games while maintaining a classic feel. i highly recommend this to any civ fan.",1
"awesome game, great turnbased combat. love the different victories and variety of civs and leaders you can play. great time sink, which is to say that this game will take hours to get through one playthrough. but you can save and whatnot so why not? yall just gotta go rambo style and play mongolia ya dig?",1
"its ok i only played like 5 minutes of it but its hard to keep track of the time while you play.",2
"great game. played from 5pm to 10pm when i first got it. its just that great.",1
"it is a very good game played them over the years the only one i never played was the spaceone i think.",1
"one of the most realistic empire builders ive ever played. in an attempting such realism, there are almost too many mechanics in play. it takes a considerable amount of time and effort to fully understand and, in my experience, truly appreciate, the complexity. while the increased graphics can often slow the game (especially towards the mid-end game), its beautifully designed, and gorgeous to observe. plus, theres an option to turn on/off quick movement and qiuck battle which will help the game run faster.",2
"best game ever. it made me forget i was married and a father :(",3
"up to 399 hours of gameplay. ill finish this game any day now...",3
"so addicting! as soon as you start.. you cant stop!",1
"if you have the time for this game its surpringly fun and replayable. matches can take a while but its definately worth picking up.",1
"its a cool game to play for like 10 hours and then lose.",1
"civilization v is a well-crafted game of domestic, international, and military balancing of power. you create an empire from the sands using your decisions on which race to how large you will grow, and where you will grow. your empire is shape by yourself and by your neighbors. the tech tree and military units allow you time to become use to every changing battlefield conditions which happen naturally over the course of time (using knight then cannons) as a caveat i will say playing this game you will lose hours of your time and not know where they went, but end that time feeling satisfied.",1
"much awesome so amazing such strategy very fun lots game wow",1
"y yu no make hotseat multiplayer, still a great game tho.....",1
"one of the best of the civ series so far. the game is beautiful. the gameplay suffers in a few areas but the game is very playable. if you play civ at all this is a must buy as well as the new expansion for it. it adds a lot of new things to make the core game much better.",1
"fun and involving game which you could lose several hours to easily if you dont keep attention on the clock.",2
"there comes a point in every mans life where he wants to start an empire from the ground up. for some reason this was never possible. but ill be damned if it isnt now. i have become addicted to this game. nice modding community. tons of replayability. 9.5/10",2
"i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes spending hours on a strategy game. it takes my friends and i aprox 2 days to finish a reasonably sized map with a reasonable ammount of players starting from the earliest era.",1
"absolutely the best strategy game ive ever played.",2
"great turn based game with great empires do get it",2
"an addicting, turn-based game that will make the time fly as you build you empire from the ancient age to post-information age! nearly infinite replayability as mods, random continents, and nearly 50 different nations ensure a different game every time its played will you build a space ship? or coquer the world? trade and commerce? or found a utopia!",1
"do you like playing the same game for 200 hours? well youll find yourself at home right here. this game is super addicting. i litarally have no idea where my life went after playing this.",1
"there is a bit of a learning curve but once you figure out the game you will find your selfspending more time playing this game than expected and the dlc makes the game that much better 9/10",1
"its a fun game. lead civ victory or death. 5 different victories. break laws of earth soch as aztecs rule world. no eygiptians only a few or many civs. be who inspires you. personilities based on how they were in real life. either you canquer the world make world peace or find a new palnet to live on.",1
"this is a fun entertaining game bilt for people that love civilization based games.",1
"good ole civilization. this is a classic strategic turn-based simulator, however, this one is a little different than the previous civilizations. for starters, you dont choose directly if you want to be a monarch or dictator, instead you adopt social policies that shape these different forms of government. secondly, there is no tile stacking... which kinda blows, but it does make for a more realisitic gameplay. other than that this game maintains its integrity and you will surely lose your soul if you are one of those people that easily get sucked into games like this!",1
"this game is amazing. it is the first civ game ive played, and now that ive played it i love civ so much more. if youre thinking about buying this game, get it.",1
"literally crack. dont expect to play this game for only 10 minutes. those 10 minutes will turn into 5 hours and after those 5 hours you will still want more. possibly the most addictive game ive ever played. 10/10 seriously.",1
"from my personal opinion this is one of the best games i have played in a while.",2
"make sure you do not buy the original game on its own. buy the game bundle with all the dlc. far more worth it and you save a lot of money in doing so. buy the original game and the dlc separately is a major rip off.",1
"hundred of hours of awesome world conquering game play lies before you.",1
"you know what? if youre bored and want to hold your  and balls for a while as you just click around and take over cities? then this is the game for you. i value the game at 19.99$",2
"if you have 8 hours to kill, this is the game for you. protip: never trust ghandi.",1
"if you like wasting hours of your life, and enjoying every moment of it.... buy this game. very fun long time startegy game.",3
"i found civ5 much like i did the others in the series: once i got the expansion packs, the experience became so much better. this game is nothing short of addictive.",2
"i didnt thought it would be possible to make civ v better, but bnw redefined what an expension should be. an exemple for a lot of games !",2
"league of legens - 30 ~40 mins dota 2 - 40~60 mins cs:go - 30 mins ~ 60 mins sc2 - 5mins~30mins payday 2 - 30 mins civ 5 - started ~ dont know how to end it",1
"look its the 5th installation of civ, you know if you like it. if you like it come, come and waste away countless hours to this time vampire. watch 1 more hour turn into oh crap im late for work.",1
"awesome game very addictive and easy to lose track of time for hours",1
"civilization v is one of the best turn-based strategy games out there. sid meiers epic game trilogy contines in this installment of civilization. with the new tile system and a newer type of strategy involved, it takes a true strategic master to complete games on some of the harder difficulties. this game is a must play for anyone who enjoys turn-based games of any kind.",3
"great game, very replayable. definitely worth it, and its on sale, so if youre thinking of buying it, dont think twice and get it!",1
"i havent played a civ game in years and this one makes it extremely easy to get back into the fold. it guides you along step by step to make it fun yet still challenging. replayability is obviously very high as the game is different with every playthrough.",1
"its the fifth game. i did manage to buy it for $20.00 at gamersgate, and hell its good. what more could you possibly want?",1
"opened game at 6 in the evening, looked at the clock when i finally took a break, 4 in the morning. 10/10 would lose social life again.",1
"sid meiers civilization, might be the best game currently available on steam! the a.i is wonderful, and the civs are great! 10/10 highly recommend.",2
"this game is great and mods make it better. get the complete eddition or most mods will not work. theres is a lot of good game here. dozens of civs make you change your play style each time and the music is great and fits the mood. i have never played any other civ game before but this is a great introduction. diplomacy is a bit strange and you may find your allies abandon you to ghandi but its still really fun. eventually you may get bored and thats were mods come in. the workshop is filled with tons of mods fixing minor problems or ones that add entire new maps and civs. a great game theres no better feeling than seeing the information circles side down your screen telling you the mordor has delcared war on skyrim",2
"okay im going bed after one more turn.. (three hours later)... im going bed after one more turn..",1
"in short amazing game i spent 6 hours playing first civ and im craving more.",1
"this is one of the worst games out there, and that is for several reasons including an error lately that says the app is already running, the game stuffs up on reasolutions above 1080p (that is 2560 * 1440, 2560 * 1600 and 3840 * 2160 which i have all tried) and this game ruined concepts from civilization iv such as civics, also sidmiers has discontinued colonisation.",2
"one of the best strategy games released in last years.",1
"easily recommend this game and a must for anyone who enjoys strategy games. not a steep learning curve, very easy to get into it and learn the game, but there is a lot of more in depth things which give a lot more control, like manual citizen management. love this game, definitely one of my favourites.",1
"it gets hetic and so much back stabbing u will wonder if ya own mother is trying 2 stab u. the mulitplayer is hella fun but can drag. the political and different methods of victory are pretty sweet.",1
"its an amazing game. the graphics are incredible. the actual running of the game is smooth, and it is a very strategic game. will you win by clture or domination? which civ will you play as? who will be your allies? my favourite steam game by a longshot",1
"solid strategy game, but make sure you have time on your hands if you want to jump into this game. although it is quite time consuming, the size of this game is just unbelievable. a whole variety of civilizations, maps, victory types and military units cause you to mix different strategies to best conform with the current world, which is pretty swell.",1
"although turn based strategy games are not everyones cup of tea, this critically aclaimed edition to the civilization franchise is a detailed and intracite game that once learned is extremely addicting. although it is pricey, once a steam sale rolls around it can be as much as 75% off. it is a must have for anyone looking for a new game to sink hundreds of hours into.",3
"have you ever conquored a nation? well, have you ever conquered a nation on weeeeeeeeeeed?",1
"love this game and the xpacs. im pushing 1000 played hours and still find ways to have fun with this game!",5
"i know a lot of long time civ fans are torn between loving and hating civ 5. personally, i think its the best civ game ever made, i think its amazing piece of art and ive enjoyed every turn. thats not to say i completely agree with every change theyve made since civ 4. for example; one of the big changes is that you can no longer stack military units on hexes. this works wonderful for small, tactical battles and definitely makes it more interesting than piles of doom clashing, but on a large scale it tends to be absolutely tedious to move your units to be in range to actually do something, and makes it hard to retreat because your own units are blocking the way out. so i would recommend to stick to small scale tactical battles and youll enjoy it so much.",2
"in what other game does your friend and ally throughout 3/4 of the game (ghandi of course, nobody else would ever do this) all of a sudden betray you, nuke your empire to the ground and send in giant death robots to mop up whatever units that your technologically inferior production starved half burning cities are able to produce. lesson learned, never trust ghandi. i 100% recommend to everybody.",4
"with the addition of brave new world, their is an added layer of complexity, but the overall rewarding gameplay is outstanding, ive sunk many a nights into this, both solo and with friends. i have run into some trouble playing over the internet and even local multiplayer, but this is most likely due to my various connections and not the game itself. one feature i would like to see implemented that doesnt exist is for the local multiplayer hot seat mode to also go online and allow multiple players locally as well as across a network.",1
"fantastic game. very addictive. decided to play a few turns then it had been 5 hours",2
"great fun if you take time to learn how everthing works.",1
"love this game! i probably go back to this more than any other.",5
"when people talk about the civilisation syndrome they are completely true. buy this game if you like having power and have at least 500 hrs free time",2
"best civilization game in years. excellent graphics. give it a try.",3
"killed a hell of a lot of time, had a great few laughs. learned that ghandi is a prick. 10/10 would recommend",1
"the most refined and elegant civilization yet. a must have!",1
"very addicting and interesting , if you want a casual gameplay play on prince difficulty , if you want an real strategic gmaeplay play on emperor :)",1
"awesome strategy game, as always from sid meier. highly recommend this for any strategy enthusists!!!",3
"a most excellent game, though you will find the path of evaluation slow. 2009 and just getting electricity, slow evaluation. other than that fact it is worth getting if on sale for 50% off or more.",1
"great game for any strategy fan, several difficulties make it easy to pick up, but can make it frustrating if you jump straight in at too high a level. no real complaints besides rather long loading times, but thats hardly a gme breaking issue.",1
"great game to play with friends. if you enjoy rts then this is a game for you. the only downside to the game is that the expantions make the game much more enjoyable and fun to play.",1
"amazingly detailed and superbly balanced rts game that sees you take one of the many historic civilizations of the worlds history to full dominence of the whole world, through all past present and future time periods.",1
"this game is extremely fun and easy to get into. from bows and arrows to nuclear war, dirt roads to railroads and catapults to tanks, its fun to watch your civilzation progress. you almost feel a sense of pride watching your glorious empire rise and your enemies fall before you. you feel defeated and terrible if your grand civilaztion crumbles. this is just a great game to make your own story and alternate history. i reccomend this to everyone who likes creating your own story. 5 stars.",3
"honestly this is one of the best strategy games out there, i love the style and their attention to details when it comes to the different playable factions. the music is absolutely fenomenal and the graphics are great, maybe not crysis, but its great for what kind of game this is. asbolutely recommended for anyone who loves strategy games which involve more than just warfare. an important thing to note is that if youre looking for an rts like c&c or starcraft 2, then go somewhere else, this is turn based, just like it should be.",1
"its mother flippin civilizationn v! whats not to love?",2
"you can kill gandhi 11/10 kony kush game of the year",1
"really fun and addicting played 12 hours and its so fun. i recommend this game to everybody who likes strategy games.",1
"one last turn! fans of the civlization franchise have been screaming since the series inception and civ v is no exception. with many mechanics being overhauled and refined, every bit of the game is even better than the predecessor. fan or not you must check out this game, for it will consume your life (in the best way possible of course).",1
"this is a great historical city builder that you half to get your hands on. the dlcs improve the game by so much, and the depth to this game is so great. this game is a must have!",1
"the first civ game i ever played, civilization v just completely impressed me in every way. the game has that just one more turn addictiveness and is very rich in gameplay. i highly recommed to those who like civ games.",2
"if youre a strategy fan, you can never go wrong with a civilization game. for more than a decade, this flagship turn-based strategy game has garnered acclaim from both players and game critics and with good reason: it is an addicting time-sucking game that makes you want to go just one...more...turn.",1
"i have seen a whole day dissovolve away into nothingness while this game is up. just one more turn... pets need feeding... i need feeding... help me...",4
"spent about 30 hours in a game and realized i should have won it multiple times... looked to see i only had domination on as a victory... 15/10 would play again",2
"only game where a peaceful man nukes you, and the vatican supplies tanks to your enemy, 10/10",1
"great game except for the fact that in brave new world you cant do ics because of the tech costs every time you expand. ha, gay!",5
"its good if you are up for a game that lasts for a while and constant initial lag when u rejoin later in the game.",1
"amazing strategy game once you figure out the basics of how the game is to be played. can be a bit confusing at first but is a great amount of fun once you play with a few friends. just make sure to set aside a few hours before playing as the games can take a good while to finish. i would rate this game a 8.5/10.",1
"the grandest strategy title ever made. from the production values to the strategy, every aspect has been gone over til it fits and is fun. however, the ai isnt perfect, and other things can annoy you, but only after youve eagerly put in 100 hours. if you like strategy, you should own this game.",2
"spend about 4 hours taking over the world. 4 city state bros the entire game. china salty at my world domination achieved with no war. build the un. buy chinas last city for all my gold, why, because they make nice silk clothing. day before un vote, china uses new goldpile to ally with my 90 year old city state bros. i lost the un election. one last turn? yes. nuke everyone. live in solitude on my radioactive globe of decay. 10/10",1
"very good. traditional civ game but it looks more polished and some of the menus are quite hard to navigate on a large screen. good overall.",1
"why havent you bought civilization v yet? you have? well, its time to kill that  ghandi once and for all! play for countless hours by yourself or with friends! you can even play senarios like the civil war. its too overwelming? get to know the game by playing the standard game without the dlc then once you get farmiliar with it, upgrade. 10/10, would civ v again.",1
"very fun addicting game. be prepared to spend countless hours of your life in this turn based game.",5
"civilization v is like if risk and a tycoon had a baby. no i have no idea what im talking about. just play it",1
"like a mixture of crack and heroin injected directly into your jugular.",2
"if you have never played a civ game, this one will do just fine. its easy to play and the adjustable difficulty settings make the replay value high. get a friend to play with and youll double your frustrati...er fun.",1
"an astounding game all by itself and with steam workshop support, possible playtime is basically infinite. buy this game.",2
"better than a bacon and sausage sandwich :) (probably)",3
"one of my favorite games of all time! i really feel as if you are weaving an epic tale of one civilizations struggles to reach the pinnacle of human achievement.",2
"have you ever wondered what it would be like if ghandi f***ing murdered england? how about if russia took of america? if youve ever wanted to control a country and change its history than civilization is the game for you! with amazing expansion packs and long matches this is a great game. id give this game a 9.5 out of 10 only because of some minor bugs in the game. if you have free time and love strategy games i encourage you to buy sid meiers civilization v.",1
"must-buy strategy game this game, when it has all the dlcs is way too addicting, and is a blast to play through your own alternate history. its way too easy to spent 8+ hours simply building up your own empire, and then several more in a devestating war for more land. only buy this game if it is with all the dlcs, particularly brave new world, because the dlcs add some great features that the base game missed. just buy the complete edition really. right now.",2
"great strategy game. everything in the game works so smoothly and each race has its ups and downs to make the game interesting.",1
"as good as the previous civilizations, with added tabletop like stradegy & format giving it a better feel, flow, playstyle and better graphics to boot.",3
"made a religion called atheism and the vatican was desperate to have me send a few missionaries. 9/10.",1
"nuked alexander because they didnt want to give me their horses. 10/10.",1
"while this game has been given high scores from professional game reviewers it has also been given bad marks by some longtime civilization players. i dont think these naysayers are necessarily in the majority though. personally the game is pretty good. it is not as good as civilization ivs beyond the sword expansion but i do like it a lot. 1upt (one unit per tile) is a refreshing change that will only get better with further expansions. build choices matter more than ever now because you have to balance happiness, culture, expansion, defense, & conquest all through gold or buildings. it is no longer as simple as adjusting a slider.",5
"its really fun if you like strategy games, war games or freeform games. i highly recommend this game.",1
"run the civilizations! its the best! especially if you like seeing ghandi beat george washington with a rock tied to a stick!",1
"amazing game. vastly interesting as it has countless scenarios (not to be confused with the game mode scenearios) in which you must strategically lift your civilization above all others. great strategy game, and in my opinion, doesnt get boring. even better with a friend or two.",3
"a nice game, but i prefer civ 4 for several reasons: - diplomacy in civ 5 uninteresting; its too simple and doesnt play an integral part of the game. - there is a lot of places where micromanagement is beneficial (probably more places then in civ 4), but it is often hidden and has a cumbersome interface. one example is the assignment of tiles that a city works. even the prioritize production etc. choices dont always choose the best placements (f.ex. when building a settler). - combat is obviously very different, but also an interesting change, however a small map can become too crowded making movement almost impossible.",3
"warning: more addictive than your favorite designer drug.",1
"one of my favorite games of all time. you can literally spend 6 hours straight playing this game. one more turn is what the game is all about. the dlc also makes the game a lot more fun, and there are a lot of cool mods out there if you find the game becomes a bit bland over time.",1
"this game is amazing, it really is, everything about this is, the combat, is fair and very nice to look at, the exploring is always different, you never have a dull experience, the economy is affected by almost everything you do, the other civilizations, incredibly detailed and immersive, theyre mere presence will give you shivers, you play this game, you feel like a ruler, but it is up to you what type of ruler you will be, in this game, you can create a civilization to stand the test of time.",1
"all is fair in love and.. not now you barbarian keds.",1
"truly a great game, i hope the dev team just irons out a couple more bugs in mp stability.",1
"would reccomend for new strategy game players, it has great tutorials and explenations. also, looks pretty and is very addictive.",1
"get this, and you can build a huge country within 1000 years. and then kill off a billion barbarians. and then steal other peoples monuments by building them first. and have your little men build twisty roads. and then bomb another country who keeps warning you that youre getting to close to their borders. very fun :d",2
"best. game. ever. this game is like crack for me. once i start it, i will spend countless hours playing and drinking beer. as the hours pass, my ability to strategize is completely gone as i am completely wasted and have to piss every few minutes. i have considered gettin a small refrigerator filled with beer to put next to my computer and also a bed pan to piss in so that i do not have to leave my beloved game. if the fridge empties or the bed pan fills, i will simply request of the wife to fill or empty the respective container. this is how much i love this game.",3
"love this game must get game or you will die a lonely life",1
"this is the first civilization game ive had a chance to play and it is fantastic! there are so many possible ways to play that make it very enjoyable.",1
"fun, but you need brave new world for it to be great.",1
"this the best way for killing time!! time flies away every time i play this game. the environment is detail and colorful. and one i like so much is we can achieve victory with multiple ways. whether is with war & domination, with culture expansion, or diplomatic approach. we can embargo one nation and see it crumbles by itself. or we can just send the atomic bomb right away in the enemys capital. with the lastest expansion, we can even spread our religion worldwide and gain influence in world council (uno-like). very recommended!!",1
"people want money and power. in the game, you can have both.",1
"its an amazing game, not that you needed to be convinced.",1
"100 hours played and made it to the end only 2 times...",1
"great game, the core experiance is fun but at the same time challenging. it also has many fun mods that can be added to increase the enjoyment of the game. with the endless amount of countries you can play in the game it is worth its price",1
"just add this game to your cart. then during checkout, choose a friend to receive your gift.... and they will both love you and hate you for the rest of their computer-chair bound life.",2
"the same civ you know and love, but more tactical thanks to the new no stack of doom combat system. make sure to pick up both gods & kings and brave new world for the full experience.",1
"if youre a fan of this genre of games, civ 5 is for you. this game really isnt advised for people who like fast paced games, as even on the quick mode, matches still tend to last hours. its still really fun though, going from a small city to a huge empire spanning the entire map. if you have friends to play this game with, you really should do that, as ive played games with a group of friends for hours and we have had a blast. 6/10 bretty good",2
"this is the best strategic game that i ever played :) . and be carefull u can forget how is outside youre house .",1
"this game is amazing! i love the strategy and the many different ways to play the game. you arent just limited to doing just a few things to win, there are so many! i would reccomend this game to anyone, even if they arent a fan of these types of games.",1
"this game is very addicting. i have played many times and i still feel that i have not done everything there is to do on this game. if you like to think and plan, this is the game for you.",1
"have you ever had a game take over your life? well once you start playing civilization v, you start to notice that you started at 1:00 pm, and now its 3:00 am. i find it to be really fun and enjoyable. it is alot better if you have friends that arent slow that play the game!",2
"pretty good. but games take days to complete and are repetitive.",1
"never have i played a game in which just one more move... means 3 hours worth of gameplay (and waking up horribly late for work the next day). its a good strategy game, just dont let gandhi get nukes....never let that skinny freak have nukes.... gandhi. buy this game and kill gandhi today :d",1
"most historically correct  ive ever played. 10/10 would get nuked by ghandi again.",3
"cant... stop... playing... dont judge it by vanilla - the expansions make the game. go for gold, at least. civ v with g&k and bnw offers a million different strategies to try. okay, maybe thats an exaggeration but no two games will be the same, and pretty much all playstyles are valid and do-able. combined with the workshop, you really can play just about any way you like. note: using mods disables achievements. not a big deal for me, but worth noting. with all the dlc, there are now over 40 civs to play as or against. just watch out for gandhi. seriously.",1
"an awesome game that has been loved for ages through all the games it has",1
"a worthy addition to this franchise. the new hex system gives players an incredible new way of thinking and plotting the demise of your fellow empires.",1
"it has a steampunk mode...i mean what else do you need?",1
"great game! everything is so balanced and stratigical. it also is great fun with friends to see who would win a war. ;) i really like the technoligy in this one. the best out of all of them in my opinion. i notice some ui bugs every now and then though. rating: 9",1
"exellent game for those who like strategy, its a very creative game, i recomnd it... get it if you can",1
"if you plan on playing this game on a mac, save yourself the trouble and find something else. there is a serious bug on mac which presents itself with all the symptoms of memory mismanagement (both the leak kind and attempting to access deallocated memory). do your due diligence and perform a few web searches to see for yourself the responsiveness of the game developers to the aforementioned issue. this is really unfortunate as ive played this game on a windows machine and it was a beautiful game.",1
"it is the best stragity game i have ever played, it looks so good, plays soooooo well, and the best part is that there is more that one way to win, makeing it mandatory to keep up the every thing(i have some problems with that). it is a must buy",1
"awesome game, although very slow at some stages. it does take a long time to research some techs and create some units, not recommended if you just want a quick game and not wait 3 days to nuke the bloody egyptians",1
"10/10 great gameplay, fun with friends and incredibly addicting.",1
"very fun, my only complaint that for an old game it is still very buggy.",1
"if you like strategy games and nation-building games, this ones for you. ive enjoyed this game a lot, and i recommend it to any strategy game fan!",1
"this game its a strategy and history one. it worth every dollar that you spend. i played this games serveral days trying all the civilizations and i didnt get bored , and thats strange because i always get bored of a game in 2-3 days , but there are some games that makes me to play them and this one is one of them so you should buy this game because , it worth .",1
"love the turn based strat of old with the new style of civ v. all i have to say is just one more turn",1
"if you are going to buy this game, you need the brave new world dlc. once you have that it will be great expirience. i recommend this game extensivly 9/10",3
"one of the most enjoyable pointless spergy things on the planet. i endorse and utterly dont endorse this.",1
"this is my new favorite game of all time. hands down. everyone on my friendslist needs to get it.",2
"its civ, with heagonal tiles and 1upt, a must buy! but, since day one, it still needs a large patch to fix its large number of bugs...",3
"brilliant game, a must play even if you dont like eagle eye strategy games! if youre bored just whack this one itll make 10 hours go by fast!",2
"all-time classic. each installation in the series has been a welcome change and re-balance to the consistently addictive gameplay.",1
"utterly broken and  game. bugs and glitches everywhere and 1 online game takes a whole lifetime to complete. it seems that the game was desingned for younger generations with nothing better to play. dont play it if you dont want cancer.",1
"its a fantastic game, only problem i see is with it not being multiplayer mod friendly.",2
"turns, spice trading, hexes, war elephants, evil gandhi . . . why havent you bought this already?",1
"civilization v is one of these games that can eat time like no others. i fell into civilization many years ago with the first game, and follow them without failing ever since, with never a bit of regret.",1
"best strategy game that is around now!!!! most definitely a keeper",2
"one of the best 4x series and the 5th installment does not disappoint.",1
"very immersing, detailed and challenging, some games can be a technology race and others a fight fall all!",4
"there is no better feeling than playing as gandhi and nuking your first city. i wish that everyone could feel what a rush it is to do such a thing. god bless america! 1776/2000",1
"the civilization series is a classic, civ v is no exception! it is incredibly addictive and because of its myriad of ways to play it is incredibly replayable. 10/10 would play again.",1
"ive been playing the civilization games since the first one and i think this is a great addition to the series. yes, there were some issues with the base game when it was first released, but these were fixed with patches and in the gods and kings expansion. i really liked the addition of city-states, the hex grid map, and the removal of the stack of doom. the combats more fun and strategic on this one and the game as a whole is easier to get into. i recommend playing this with the gods and kings expansion for the best experience. note: i havent played the brave new world expansion yet, but it seems to have improved the game even more.",1
"a great game. it does get a little repetitive but the workshop makes it alot more intresting.",1
"this game is amazing, but it will consume your life. its impossible to play without telling yourself just one more turn at least 200 times. the vanilla game is great, but you should add a few mods to enhance the gameplay a bit because its not perfect. i definitely recommend getting brave new world as well because it adds a lot of depth.",4
"sarcasm warning do you hate your friends? do you want to hate your friends, then buy civ v the greatest hate fuel of all. watch as you and your friends scramble to build the best cultural buildings in all of history only to be beaten out by the ai players. enjoy the rage between all of you as you try to move through borders and pledge war on eachother. witness the expanding nations slowly taking over the map as you are raided by raging barbarians. tl:dr 10/10 would ruin friendships",1
"fun game i recommend it to any one that once to destroy there frends with a huge army!",1
"gandhi once said: i object to violence gandhi lied.",1
"this is a game about time. not time travel, but time as a currency. because trust me, the money you spend on this game is not the full price. it is a down payment. the real price is the sheer amount of time you will spend playing it. a single game will take you all day. this game is a time vampire. play at your own risk. oh, and you build cities on landmasses and fight wars and stuff. or something.",1
"honestly one of the most addictive games ive ever playd, 10/10 :) with all the playable civs all i can ask for is more! :d",1
"some would argue that civ v dumbed things down from civ iv. i would argue the opposite - iv had overcomplicated the genre, and i think v has brought back the accessibility of the franchise, whilst stepping up the graphics and ai. one of my favourite games.",4
"a huge timesink! yes, enjoyable. wish i had the time for it; it usually takes about 8h to finish a short game. i generally find myself playing rush nations to make up for it~ probably wouldnt enjoy it as much if it werent for my addict brother.",1
"worth playing to introduce bollywood to the world.",1
"a must own for every pc gamer out there. genius strategey, entertaining game play, accurate historical info, just a almost perfect game. no cons, just things that could have been a little bit better.",1
"do not buy this if you still value your social life!!!",4
"a game youll probably keep coming back to. replayability over years in my experience.",1
"this game is good if you like turn based stradegy. i feel the game is to easy on the lower difficulties but i do like the wide variety.",1
"makes time disappear. unsure where time ends up. sorry for nuking your capital, attila.",2
"the only game where you can nuke your friends :)!.",1
"play as 3d adolf hitler and vanquish your enemies in this exciting new game.",2
"just doing this for the badge. im terrible at this game, but its pretty dope.",1
"a frustrating game entirely. i am first expected to choose a leader of a civilization where i dont get to really choose my ruler, i dont get to choose my colors, i dont get to choose my abilities or traits. then im thrown into a world where my diplomatic choices are almost non-existent, im forced to rush to special units which may be completely pointless in about 30 turns when suddenly we are in an entirely different age. i had hoped that alliances, trade, and the foundations for any real civilization would be present in the fifth version of this series, but no... you are expected just to spit out as many units as possible and vie for military domination-- which most other 4x games do much better. 4/10",1
"stab the people of russia then annex egypt. in one turn. 11/10",1
"hours and hours worth of gaming here. playing now for almost 4 years. its amazing how theyve been able to keep basically the same formula since the first civilization game in the early 90s and it has the same addictive feel now in civ v as it did then. there are many different scenarios to achieve victory in this game. it doesnt have to be about conquest. you can win this game diplomatically, scientifically, culturally or time (highest score at last turn). you dont even have to quit your current campaign when you run out of turns. scoring will stop but you can build your empire for as long as you like. if you are able to get the expansions with this game, i highly recommend doing so. they add so much to the vanilla game that i dont think i could ever go back to it. they just keep making it better.",2
"its a fun game for those of you who like strategic gameplay.",1
"its like the other civilization games only better.",2
"backstabbing political simulator a must buy. 10/10 would play again",1
"one of the best strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing, or simply losing a entire night of sleep to the replayable single player. this is one game that any strategy enthusiast, or casual player can enjoy!",1
"civilization v has transitioned from a lackluster sequel to my all-time favorite strategy game. with the gods and kings and brave new world dlcs, playing the game with difficult ais or against friends keeps me on the edge.",2
"amazing game, well made, my only problem is that it takes a while to learn.",1
"insanely fun game. its a bit slow at the beginning and its all turn-based gameplay, but once you get sucked into it, youre definitely going to be playing for many, many hours on end! the only other civilization game i played before this was civilization revolution and i dont think thats the same creators as this game cause theyre on two completely different levels. this game takes strategy to the next level across vast lands with many countries and continents to conquer! i highly, highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys strategy games.",1
"100 hours + and havent even finished one game yet, brilliant. 10/10",1
"this game is really fun and really historical. it was voted both the game of the year and strategy game of the year by gamespy in 2010. in a nutshell, this is the best strategy and historical game ever. i would recommend that you play this game.",1
"when i started playing this game, i was a lowly, inexperienced lord to the japanese empire. now, i rule all the land with my good friend, constantinfinity. we might have clashing playstyles, but it all works out because im always right... and not a communist. all in all, excellent game.",1
"love it, mainly for the strategy because strategy games are my favorite games",2
"very great strategic war game its almost like real life and there is lots of dlc for it.",1
"just love this game, especially with the a brave new world expansion pack. love the fact you can adapt to every situation differently and sometimes have to decide to slow down one progress to get a specific type of victory. spending hours on this game ^^",2
"three words: dont trust ghandi. he will nuke you when he gets urainium. probably the best strategy game i have ever played and that exists.",1
"i have endless amounts of fun playing this game, solo and with friends. a total must buy for any turn based strategy enthusiast",1
"this game made me believe in magic again. this game made my  grow three sizes in just three weeks! this game brought my granddad back to life. he played and had heart attack at the sheer thrill that he could manage citizens in the city. hes dead now, burried with a redeemable code to civ 5 in his grave. dem trade routes... dose quotes... dat alternate history? 10/10 would . and the mods! the mods actually make the game fundamentaly better. they are not just window dressing. they are a thing of beauty and the people who make them should be given the medal of honor. ive wasted so much time on this game that i could have been wasting on other things and i suggest you do the same.",2
"lol this is a big little kid game. all you do is click on these little toys and fluffly stuffed animals that look real and you make them do crap and the game does most of the work for you lol. it takes no skill and its worst than farmville. it proves that steam has a bunch of little kidz on it because thousands of kidz play it.",1
"great game. my favorite game i have ever purchased and played. amazing.",1
"one of my favorite games of all time. few games have provided the amount of single and multi player hours civ and its expansions have.",2
"one more turn well that turns into 4 more turns which turns into im really getting tired of you eyeballing me like that england.....the world descends into war, and if youve done it right, you rule the world. you never quite know what youre gonna get and early on you just might get quick attacked and well game over these dudes with junky swords and no armor just wrecked your only city and thats it, all that is left of you is what will be in the archaeological records. im a firm believer of spreading like the plague in this game, then once everyones mad about you grabbing up all the land, build an army and enact your own manifest destiny, the others will either fall in line or theyll talk smack about you and spy on you giving you an excuse to go after them....this game....just buy it!",2
"the best game ever created, hundreds of hours i will spend here with joy!",1
"mulitplayer broken in the last patch. nothing has been done about it for months!",2
"how many civilizations do you think sid meier has to make before hes happy",1
"hours apon hours of clicking and dicision making. will i ever have a computer that can load the map in under a min durring late game? i dont think so.",1
"i fought off barbarians like a herpes outbreak and bribed korea to attack my friends. 11/5",1
"i built the great wall of america so gandhi declared war on me after being passive-agressive since the year 1900 bc, so i took his land. 10/10 for realism.",1
"one of the most frustrating games i have ever played. but in a good way.",1
"it is one of my favorite games cant wait to get it.",1
"sid meier is to stategy games as george lucas is to star wars. the most comprehensive and easy to use turned based strategy game to date.",2
"do not buy this game unless you enjoy sleepless nights and getting nuked by ghandi.",1
"awesome game 8/10, but if u could jihad some american buildings would be 9/11.",1
"while the initial launch was rocky and multiplayer was a joke, they have since resolved most of my gripes with civ5. it is a fresh and streamlined approach to the old system, and while it is not necessarily better than civ4, it provides a much more interesting (imho) tactical experience while eliminating a lot of the micromanagement that tended to bog down previous titles in the series. worth getting on sale.",2
"this game is cool get it but get the complete edition",2
"pros - feels like a full game without the dlcs - linux support! - offers hours upon hours of fun - high replayability due to the many different ways to win, and the different paths to accomplish thos victory conditions - good community involvement, workshop offers many cool mods to keep the game interesting for a long time overall i highly recommend this game",1
"this game is definitely worth the buy. you will spend so much time in this game and you will love every second of it.",1
"dont be put off by turn-based strategy, it really is an egaging game",1
"it allows me to stab my friends in the back and crush their hopes and dreams, good game 10/10",1
"this game is a very fun, unpredictable, learning experience of a game. the graphics are great during leader scenes and are either rough or smooth during the main game depending on your graphics card. the game takes a while to learn the more complicated portion of the game. your civilization is completely based on what you make it whether you want a strong military or lots of farms. i myself have both. i hope this review has convinced you to buy sid meiers civilization 5!",1
"awesome game, very deep and satisfying! it was worth every penny! very fun to play with friends and alone, but kinda lacks the giant freaking huge maps that the previous games had, in my opinion. but that might just be my brain playing tricks on my! anyway, totally worth it! buy it!!",1
"very addicting and intellectual great for all ages!",1
"this game is great and its better than its predecessors if and only if you get both of the expansions. without the expansions the game is really dull and lacks depth in certain areas.",2
"its addicting. delete it from your computer before you flunk college.",1
"i will write this in a minute  just one more turn  if you know that feeling then this game is definitely for you :d",1
"ok im a bit biased, i love almost all sid meier games so this one is a cake walk. no campaign mode kind of takes away from it but with plenty to do its a fun game",1
"amazing game, really pulls you in once you get the basics. a lot of variation and endless fun with your friends. definitely a must have.",1
"this game is a looooooooooooooooooooot of fun. defs recommend.",1
"great game, but there are some features frome the last game i wish that they intergated into this one.",2
"dont buy it if you wanna keep your social life (pick up the gold pack by the way , totally worth it , gods and kings makes the game way better than base , and its not more expensive by much :d) joke aside very very good and satisfiying game , buy buy buy",1
"just one more turn - the biggest lie ive said since i bought this game.",1
"gets nuked by ghandi and acciddenlty sells cities to england . 100/10 would be nuked and sold again.",1
"this game is amazing and will slowly take away your soul by havind ghandi nuke you and get  by barbarians. 5/5",2
"highly addictive turn based game with countless strategies and ways to play. the series has become very refined over its course. steeped in history (obviously). has excellent narration by william morgan sheppard whose voice i am jealous of. will be playing for years.",1
"civilization v is a fantastic game! i normally dont get excited or too interested in strategy games such as this, however civilization v captured my interest from the first time i discovered another civilization. a fantastic game and one that should not be missed.",1
"i bought the gme yesterday and allready have got 12 hours of gameplay... and berlin is the holy city for judaism 10/10",1
"ive had this game for over a year and i still spend hours playing it. great buy.",4
"you ghandi you slimy stinking indian you dont deserve to have the native americans named after your god damned filthy race 10/10 would become racist towards indians again",4
"a game i could easly play for hours in multie player and single",2
"this game is amazing. i havent had this much fun playing a turn based strategy game in such a long time",1
"one of the best turn-based strategy games around sid meierss civilization is still going strong since 1990",1
"if youre a fan of age of empires or any strategy game like that, then this game is for you. i didnt know what to expect when i went into this game, and sort of got lost, but then my knowledge of age of empires kicked in and i knew how to win.",1
"when you can make the mayan race create the apollo program - you know its a good game",2
"so, so fun! great single player game. if you love stratergy, and you love games with a layed back casual, fun play stile. you will love it. i mainly play online games, but this swayed me away from online gaming for a long time! must buy... awsome.",1
"this is not so much a game as it is a kind of time machine. ill start playing a game in the morning and look from my screen to the window only to realize that the sun has gone down. i then tell myself, ill just finish up a few neighboring nations and by the time i am done with that the sun is up again.",1
"a well-known and well-respected strategy game, this civilization simulator really puts you in the mindset of the leader of a society, from its conception in the ancient era to the future and beyond. remarkable attention to detail coners this game, from authentic languages for every civ to accurate archetectural styles for every civ throughout the ages. a great game for strategy fans, history buffs, or anyone whos ever wanted to rule the world.",1
"the dull technology is anti-historical .every nation has similar tech .you are mongols of steppes -no problem . you can still build lighthouse of alexandria or collosus of rhodes -both monuments strictly made by very prosperous sea-faring nations. it is ridiculous . further more you can not set era when you want to halt the advancement. i dont feel playing modern era ,but i can not do nothing about it . even more the scenarios are awful . some of them as short as only 70 turns long. they simple threw some uncooked pseudo historic technology into the pot because it would take few dollars !!! to give every nation the tech it really could have access before the modern era. there are lot of people whoo does not care about anything for them this game is perfect . if you feel like doubtful about central american civilisations having cavalry or other nonsense then this game is not for you.",1
"not much else to say about this game that hasnt been said. great all a round game, one of my favorites of all time.",1
"love this game, but brave new world dlc is needed.",1
"civilization v....one of the only civ games ive really played quite a bit of, and for a reason! it plays well and is rather easy to get into for newcomers to the series! the dlcs add waaaaaay more complexity and way more units and stuff to do so if you are going to buy it, buy the complete version for the full experience",1
"they believe you are a warmongering menace to the world!",1
"the game is fantastic. i do wish that it were possible for steam workshop to work for people who have civ 5 on the mac. other than that, one of my all time favorite games.",2
"just look at the hours ive spent on this...... and im about to play again right now.",3
"this game is one of those gems you can go back to after years of not playing and ask yourself...why did i ever stop?? must buy.",1
"i came to civilization 5 very open minded, playing very few 4x or rts games previously. my only other experience of the civilization series was the civ 2, a much older square based game that i didnt understand but thoroughly enjoyed. this game has recreated the feelings of utter bliss as your time drains away into this world that is yours to shape but instead of being left feeling confused and underwhelemed, i feel in control of every aspect of my empire and if played right the entire game. well worth the money, especially with all the expansions. maybe try without first, since they just add layers of complexity to improve otherwise tedious sections of the game.",3
"go and buy civ 4 complete if you want to play a better game then this disaster. civ 4 wins in every aspect (besides the graphics)",1
"this game is somewhat enjoyable, but with its frequent crashes (just about every 5 minutes) and multitude of bugs, i would call it a waste of money. also, the steam forum for this game is full of people saying that they are experiencing these crashes. it may have something to do with windows 8.1.",1
"if you enjoy strategy, youll love civ v. also, its probably the best turn-based strategy game around.",1
"i may be slightly addicted. so much to do! love how in depth this game is. i am engrossed from the moment i load a game :)",1
"havent played civ since the original and i must say that playing civ v was a real pleasure. if you like the idea and good old civ youll like this. its neither frustrating nor complicated, its just fun.",1
"very entertaining turn based strategy game. good multiplayer and community mods just make the whole thing perfect.",2
"really good game but you should get the dlc because it makes the game a lot better.",1
"awesome game, would recommend to anyone who likes strategy games.",1
"ive been hooked on civilization since i played civ 2 on my aunts computer... waited hours to download freeciv in the 90s on dialup in the middle of the night, played that until civ iv came on sale in the 00s. played that until i got civ v as part of a bundle. i thought civ iv was better at first, but there is something to be said for the tactics of civ v that require you to carefully place your units around a city to take it. and think before overrunning too many cities and plunging your empire into revolt. i find myself winning diplomatically more often than conquest now because i enjoy manipulating the city-states with intrigue and finishing their quests, consequently getting all their votes when they start voting in the un. there is also something to be said for the some simplifications over civ iv. also, with brave new world its pretty solid!",2
"im normally not very big into rts and i normally find myself constantly trying to kill things in games even when i shouldnt yet civ 5 somehow has me hooked playing for hours while trying to avoid combat as much as possible (and combat is fun). its an rts that has 5 different ways to win a match, 4 of which can be done without fighting. its unlike anything ive played before. ive already played almost 30 hours in 2 weeks, and thats pretty much exclusively playing with just two of my buddies online when they can join me.",1
"game is awesome, well thoughtout, and plays so nicely. hats off to sid meiers.",3
"ive only started playing the civilization series with iv. that being said this game is by far the best in the series for me at least. no more stacks of doom where you drag around 30 units on a single tile. real strategy during combat takes place and using the terrain is essential to victory. my fav strategy game by far.",3
"if you like turn-based strategy as well as playing a historical figure in a unreasonable timeframe, this game is for you. but who am i to tell you this. you probably already have the game. its very good.",1
"the most addictive game on this side of alpha centauri! seriously, this game is great and you should get it.",2
"best strategy game ever made with historical background and epic music. i recommend it!",2
"i really recommend this game, its always fun to play a couple of hours, and rule the world",1
"as it turns out, im really good at getting achievments that nobody else has in this game, and all you have to do is be a . i dont know what that says about me as a person, but i had fun getting it.",1
"this game ate about a week as soon as i started playing it.",2
"gr8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8. in seriousness though game is alright. i still miss a lot of things from civ 4, but poland is in this game.",1
"best game. ive lost so many hours to this its crazy.",1
"just... cant... stop... playing... one... more... turn... then im going to bed/work/eat",1
"civ v is a must-have game for any strategy game lover. it has everything they could want in a game. economy, military units, diplomacy, multiple victory conditions, different civilizations, and so on. the only thing lack luster in this game is the diplomacy. civilization games just never have had a stellar diplomacy engine. the a.i. has always been a little derpy but nothing that can be frustraiting. just dont be expecting help from allies, or many allies for that matter.",1
"this game is the epitome of global conquest and strategy games. although it is turn based, it keeps you interested and intent on taking over the globe. the ai has improved tremendously, and can be extremely challenging. it features multiple difficulties, for beginners and experts, and every type of intermediate out there. this game even has a multiplayer, so buy and we can battle or work together to rule the world!",1
"this game allows the user to explore many different nations spnning thousands of years and mixes them all up in one era. the resulting fallout (literally) is simply amazing. pick this game up if your into this style of gaming.",2
"one of the best game out there, the soundtrack is second to none",1
"give at-least 6 hours of free time before attempting to play youve been warn. you will be glued to your screen.",1
"i highly recommend this game if you like turn-based strategy, but it is definitely worth it only if you get the expansions. tl;dr - wait for a sale if you want it.",1
"if you like geometry then this is the game for you!",1
"a true work of art, this installation of the iconic civilization series is the best yet, including better combat, a better culture system, and no more of those pesky holy wars. i highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games and/or development games. also, giant death robot.",3
"mediocre vanilla game, pretty good with gods & kings, fantastic with brave new world. not the deepest 4x out there, but probably one of the most charming.",1
"well worth the money, long gameplay and obviously great replayability",1
"almost back to teh civ2 roots.. pretty dam good game",2
"this game is magnificent. everytime i load it up i cant help but play all day. this game is one of the best strategy game so far ever created. civ vi anyone?",2
"this game destroyed my sleeping schedule....... but within the same day, it fixed my sleeping schedule. 24/10 would destroy and fix my sleeping schedule again!",1
"id write a better review, but my turn is coming up.",1
"great game for anyone looking for either a casual game to have fun in, or a bit of a slow paced, intense strategy game. able to play for countless hours in one session and it never gets boring. i would comepletely reccomend this game for anyone interested in this style of game.",1
"this is an amazing strategy for anyone that likes this genre of games. this game defines and sets the bar for all game like this. a masterpiece and delight the games features make you feel like you are creating that civilization. if you do not own this game than you are missing out on endless ways to rule the world. multiplayer can support up to 12 players (i think) which can make you turn on your friends or make new ones. this game has hours and hours of fun and i wont be able to stop playing for a while. 9.5/10 bad things are the cost and the dlc price $50 for bnw :(",1
"i created a new religion. i named it agnosticism and now it is spreading everywhere.",1
"very fun game. it mixes the fun of building a civilization and conquering the world together. it has different things you can do like go for the science victory. there are quite a few victorys and characters making the game interesting. it generates new maps so you will have a new experience every time. i would give this game a 9 out of 10. i highly recommend you buy this game.",2
"great game, played the original and now i even play beyond earth. civilization v is still my favorite.",1
"when you want a wasting time game, you need this. and be a gandhi for destroying a friendship.",1
"it is hard to walk away from this game. i am always paranoid that my civilisation will crumble when i go for a snack. even if its just for a second! i end up hoarding all of the resources necessary for my survival in my room before i build my empire, in which, as it happens, i do the same thing. that being said, it breaks immersion when there are no archers waiting to fend off invaders from my room.",1
"its a very cool and informative game you guys should check it out.",2
"nice idea, bad realization. if you click trading, youll see that computer can play well with huge debt and negative happiness. that makes all single gameplay useless. when im building second city im have (-) in gold and happiness, need to w8 a lot to build simple building, while he already has max number of units... and this happens even at simple difficulty level(",1
"the first second i got into this game i thought i turned into a racist.",1
"get this game, lose yo life, hide yo wife, and lol at venice now!",1
"amazing game, but be warned... this game is highly addicting",2
"civ 5. pretty fun. best strategy game yet. i love ancient greece, so i always am sure to build up athens, sparta, and many other cities using alexander the great!",1
"this is the ultimate turn based strategy game. i love building up each civilization watching the citys grow and the farms spread. the city states is an intresting new addition which spices up the maps and can be removed if you so wish. i have been playing over lan with my friend and i will say, even on a small map with the slightly faster settings, a game can still take hours! (hours well spent!) just dont expect a quick fix. really good feature is the ability to save multiplayer games and resume with all players. drens view: buy this game!",1
"uber highly addictive!! dominate cultures, win the hearts and minds of many, develope the shiniest cities in all the land; any sort of mood you are in will be accomodated by the vast options you are presented in this game. if your not civvin, your missin!",1
"400 hours and only 50% achievements... this game is nuts! still loving it.",3
"bi i was in playin civ right and ghandi was being a in prick so i nuked the  outta him poor  didnt have a chance anyway this game is in mint as  you should get er but a lot of the ai can be  at times so  them up with nukes so i rate this game 10/carrots",1
"give history the finger and conquer the world with ghandi, or get voted as worldleader while player as gengis khan. civ is the only place where ceasar, washington, ramessess and napoleon are bombing each other with nukes. warning: this game is really addicting.",2
"my friend and i bought the game, and started a multi-player game. we went to war over horses. 10/10 would start war over horses again.",1
"so far have about 40 hours on this game. not much to say other than it is a good time consumer and lazy-one-handed type game game. good to play when you just want to chill, get comfy if thats your thing, and attempt to take over the world. dont think about it that much, go with the flow and build/take paths in the game that interest you. also, this is a really fun mutliplayer game. get some friends on skype and play a game, it will be the most fun youve had with friends in a while, trust me. ive been a turn based fan forever and if your into fire emblem or advanced wars and your not palying this game then your doing something wrong. go get it and nuke some cities and",1
"really enjoying civ 5, after buying it for the summer sale. its quite different from previous games, but i still love it!",1
"i played this game for hours!!! one of the best 4k games i have ever played + it is one of the best strategy games! i recommend it to everyone",1
"great strategy game, looking forward to the next one in the series.",3
"conquered one city state, everyone denounces me. war mongering gandhi killed everyone in africa 10/10",1
"i used to think this would be to hard for me to play, but when i started its was easy and fun. i recommend this game.",1
"this game is perfect for anybody that is a fan of strategy games! :d",3
"fun, very fun. so buggy though. can we get a patch? nothing has changed these dumb network bugs have been here forever. only reason for negative review. fix it?",1
"great game. lots of content and endless replayability.",1
"this game will suck your life away. so many options for long term strategic play. many different playable civilizations with unique units, buildings and bonuses. one of the greatest games of all time.",2
"so far very in-depth content, playes for hours. better with friends, best with more friends.",1
"you play from the dawn of humanity (or something) as a god controlling people larger than the cities they live in. youll defeat civ after civ, untill ghandi gets nukes. then youll lose the game and realize your a giant nooblet playing on settler level and cry. 1654987988/10 best. game. ever.",1
"this game is amazing! there are so many possibilities in this game and i deffinatly reccomend you purchase this game",1
"civilization v is a great game if you have all the 2 major dlc which is gods & kings and brave new world. i love playing with my friends in this game and hour go by like minutes... tons of fun!!! 10/10",1
"perhaps my favourite game of all time. i would definitely reccommend this game to anyone who wants to get into rts",1
"gamers should marry gamers. and if that happens, playing hot seat civilization v with the wife counts a spending quality time together :)",4
"hours and hours of fun, totally addictive, love it.",1
"this game has wrecked my sleeping pattern on many occasions historically accurate to build stonehenge in babylon and a great wall around mongolia 10/10, would spend days dennouncing ghandi again",1
"best game ever! need i say more? buy it & play it!",2
"ill write this review any second now, just one more turn... and another... and another...",1
"great game,fun.addictive as hell and really puts your mind into it",1
"i dont have much to say about the game but what i can say may change the outcome of what happens. never deal with montezuma. 100/10 would play more",2
"the best civilization game yet! offers countless hours of gaming, because after you beat it you can still play an entirely new game with entirely new scenarios. definitely one of my favorites.",1
"just buy it so we can all nuke each other and have fun!!!!!!!!",1
"after bismarck, montezuma, catherine, and ramses ii all decide to annihilate you in 2001 ad, you will know the meaning of pain.",1
"do you have hours to waste? like looking at maps and thinking? well then this will be like porn",1
"ive put more time into this game than most so id say im qualified to write this. i really enjoy the gun attachments and the killstreaks. however, the nudity is very excessive and overblown. id rather jerk off my grandfather sometimes.",1
"great strategy game provides fun gameplay even for peolpe that dont play strategy games that much.",2
"game has had serious problems with freezing that have not been addressed in over 3 years. i do not recommend buying this game. if you dont believe me just google civ 5 freeze. using a computer with more than the recommended requirements, fully updated drivers, fully updated directx, etc. game always freezes during first turn of a new game.",1
"this is a very good strategic game. it is a lot of fun, very visually appealing, has a ton of options for how to build your civilizations, and is not too difficult to get the hang of. it does have some issues though. games take a long time. this can be mitigated somewhat by changing settings, but even so this is not a quick pick up and play game. sometimes that is what i like but not always. in addition although there exist ways to win the game without domination over the enemy civilizations, none of those options feel very interesting or satisfying. there are some other minor things here and there i dont like or feel i could like more, but generally this is a very solid game. 7/10",1
"a fantastic turn-based strategy. youll be stuck for hours. a must play for tbs fans",1
"this game is amazing! almost anyone will love it. buy it now",1
"if youre going to play civ v be sure to have gods and kings and brave new world expansion. it added alot of variety in the game and it mesh well with each other. also, be sure to have an alarm clock near you and set it with your desired play time or else you will spend your whole day playing this game!",1
"it is about people, and they are all enemies. kill them all xxx kill the jews xxx love, hitler",1
"i ruled the world as a fascist germany and steam rolled england, russia, and america with nukes and giant death robots. 8/10",1
"warning. this game is potentially dangerous and illegal. im not sure how sid meier was able to sell this pure cocaine. **** this game is legit, its a strategy game (+1) has many different ways to play and  but is so addicting. playing with friends for 4+ hours straight and only have to come off due to tiredness, not boredom. 10/10 would and should buy again.",1
"i know its been said before, but if you have anything important anytime soon, dont play this game! you will play until you should have left and not even realize it. its always just one more turn.",2
"very fun game with hours of gameplay to be had. very simple to learn and will be enjoyed by all rts fans",1
"i havent left my house in three days because of this game. 10/11 would strongly recommend",1
"this game stole my life from me and made me a hermit. then i bought the dlc. if you want to have your life stolen from you, click add to cart now. enjoy.",2
"washington is a f**king a** during every game. 10/10-would nuke",1
"the best entry in one of the greatest franchises of all time.",4
"very cool strategy. i advise everyone who likes to reflect and build your own empire",1
"an improved hexagonal movement/combat system as well vastly improved graphics, a new interface, and a diverse technology tree makes this a worthy entry in the civilization series. its not terribly different from previous titles, but the improvements made are welcome, and its just as addictive as ever.",1
"civ v is the latest edition in the classic family of civ games. this one is a fair bit different than civ iv in several areas. a good game just by itself.",5
"just got into the civ series with this game. as a new civ player, the single player content alone was worth buying the game. civ veterans seem to disagree on this based on other reviews i read. i let my brother try it and he got hooked. i woke up to him still playing the next morning, so i got it for him for and unlike others, we havent seen any multiplayer issues, yet (hopefully this continues). i think its important to note that i found this game looking for a new rts and it is filling the role quite nicely even though it is turn based and not filled with the fast paced battles i am used to. if anything, the slower pace and individuality of each unit makes it more fun than your everyday rts.",2
"probably just not for me, it is pretty annoing to wait constanty for my turn to move units around and do things. i will be much happier if there were and mode to just get rid of this tours.",1
"i recommend this game on its own merits, having not played much by way of the other civilization games. however, civ 5 works really well for me and i thoroughly enjoy it. good systems and mechanics for tile improvements, city building and improving them, etc. with each expansion it fleshes out more and adds new systems to enjoy and explore. basically, if you like strategy games, this one will give you a lot to see and do, and its pretty damn enjoyable while doing it.",3
"one more turn. thats what you will keep saying even when you know you have to stop. be it total world domination or establishing diplomatic alliances, civilization is the foundation of empire dynasty building throughout the ages. the feeling of going from a group of settlers with only sticks and stones to reaching for the stars in their rockets is still not lost in this 5th outing. with new crisp and easy to distinguish detailed graphics this game is nothing but superb.",1
"simply the best in long-term strategy, and highly addictive. it provides for endless replay value (currently approaching 600 hours). this game is less about quick multi-tasking and unit micro-management, and more about thinking, planning, patience, diplomacy, analysis, and focus. a steep learning curve to start with, it takes about 50 hours or over a dozen full games or so to fully apperciate the many layers to this game. a regular game can take any where from 4 to 8 hours, depending on the difficulty level, number of other players, the size of your army, and the amount of time spent thinking in between turns. theres also options for even longer games. it is an immensly engaging and rewarding game.",3
"when played with all the expansions and dlcs, quite simply the best pc game ever (at least in my opinion!)",1
"best game na 10/10 would play again and again, but not as good as league of legends so rip lol",1
"greatest stratagy game in existance, love the nukes!!!",1
"civ v is a really fun game because it is like alternate history and i like history. if you want to have a way more in depth experience of alternate history then check out one of paradoxs games. but if you want a simpler game, then civ v will be a fantastic game for you. :)",3
"there is a reason i have over 200 hours played on this",2
"its a very fun strategic game thats kinda like coh but has alot more things to choose from.",1
"it is as good as they say. my fav civ ii, actually. i am not entirely in love with how picking a government is set up (it is a bit too gamey, in a way, and you dont have the sense of being anything in particular) but the rest on the game is pure gold.",1
"epic and intense! i could put another 200 hours in that game ez.",2
"excellent graphics and smoothly transitions between turns. definitely stays tue to the civilization brand!",1
"game is very addictive, wish the game would let you control tax levels for your empire and control the amount of money you with to spend each turn on research.overall its a good game that i recommend.",1
"as a civ ii fan ,i got to say this is a massively beautiful game that brings out the true charm of the civ series and is yet simple enought to be play by a 13 year old ,if not even younger",1
"ruining history in new and interesting ways! and nukes!",2
"best round-based political strategy game. the dlcs are fine, but not mandatory, but you should have all addons, because they really improve the depth of the game",1
"the best strategy game around. great fun to spend an evening exploding paris and making berlin jewish.",1
"this game is, and will be, one of my favorite games if all time. its so much fun, and can have a nice mix of hard, and easy stuff, with a large variety of community created content in addition to the dlcs.",1
"hightly recommended after nearly logging 700 hours into civilization v & its add-ons, i say without a doubt that it is truly an amazing game. it is my most played game in my steam libery and i have loved every single second i have played it furthermore due to the very active modding community the re-play ability of this game is endless. i would recommend this game to any one even if turn-based strategy games are not your normal choice you will pickup this game and fall in love with it.",4
"10/10 great game, small bugs that can be worked around or removed with the expansion packs.",1
"buy this, quit drugs. most addictive game i have ever played. absoluetly the best strategy game out there. 10/10",2
"highly addictive and strategic gameplay. civ v will consume your soul if you are not careful. try not to think about invading persia for extra oil reserves while you are at your job.",2
"a turn based game where you build up an empire with armies, cities, and other factors. the game is played on a risk-style board, but is nothing compared to risk. this game is good, but can become tiresome after a few games, and seems to require a cooldown before you want to go back in. this game is good for people who like turn based strategy and nation building that can be totally different each time you play.",1
"it a giant waste of time, literally. before you know it, its 5 am in the morning and still you need to do just one more turn.",2
"very good game, highly recommend, but only if youre going to play in a group of 4+ people. single player gets very repetitive and boring, but in a group of friends, it can get competitive and will last for hours. graphics arent bad, and the view/ controls are simple but more than enough for what you need to do!",1
"look at the title. now back at my review, back at the title again. youve just bought civ 5.",1
"best rts ever made, and in my personal top 10 games of all time. in civ 5, you assume the role of a past great leader, like washington, ghandi, queen elizabeth and so on. you rule and control their respective countries build your own empire. you do so by raging war, or making peace with others. i highly recommend buying at least the two major expansions. (gods & kings, and brave new world). theyre huge really game changing expansions. like adding religion to the game, which could mean the difference between friendship or nuclear war. as far as time goes, you start in the year 4000 bc (by default). and progress your empire through the ages all the way into the future. even though beyond earth (next entry in civ) is already on the horizon, civ 5 is a true masterpiece. buy this game now.",1
"i keep coming back to it, and it always sucks me in for hours.",1
"this is a game you may not play too often, but when you start a game, be prepared for the next 5-50 hours to be solely focussed on wiping gandi off the face of the planet with nuclear weaponary. your visions of being a peaceful civilisation are shattered by your own self greed for world domination, your small tribe of simple warriors have evolved into super death machines that march from london to tokyo (perhaps because japan settled too close to you and the city is only 2 turns walk away). destroy, conquer and rebuild! *ahem* a few downsides to this game is that you may never return to an old campign, each session generally feels like its time to begin anew. also, no one watching over your shoulder will understand how fun/addictive this game is, you just need to play it to understand.",1
"civilization v is a beautiful game, capturing the struggles of a leader trying to create a dominant empire to rise above the others. somehow, it manages to be both simple and complex. it is mostly realistic and offers some humorous irony and increased difficulty in the form of ghandi. however, its dlc are way overpriced for the amount of content they actually offer and it gets boring after the first few playthroughs. overall, it is an amazing game that will keep you invested for hours on end, keeping you on your toes until the last turn. [9.5/10]",1
"cool game but enemy calculations take a little long thus it gets lenghy if u play with lot of ai ... the difficulty settings seem a bit easy",1
"a very good game if you have a lot of free time and want to play with friends",1
"fantastic game. been playing this series for many, many years and civ v is a great addition. the vanilla game is very good, but if you get the gods and kings along with brave new world dlcs it takes things to the next level.",1
"i gotta say if youre married this is a really good game to get your spouse into! great for couples!",1
"its been a while since i lost myself in a game, but i found myself enjoying this so much i ended up loosing half a day without realising it. its a super enjoyable game that id recommend to all, but do try the demo first if your unsure",1
"just omg i started playing this game because my friend was like really pumped about it and i was shocked at how amasing it is. especcialy with the brave new world pack.",2
"get your kids to play it once 7+ (ish). great tool for education as well as bringing me years of fun!",1
"this game has hooked me in for many long sessions of just one more turn. it helps that its very easy to play in windowed mode whilst skyping my girlfriend. a friend bought me this as a christmas gift. hes since had to issue an apology to my girlfriend. if it can damage my wonderful relationship, think of how much it could drain your life too!",1
"just started playing but i really dig it already. little slow paced at first but it picks up steam fast!",1
"u fukin wot gandhi???? just because my soldier was parked in your space doesnt mean you get to send your curry elephant rangers to slap his  with your 5 inch trunks. thats it, its war. gandhi?? more like... gone-di. and so, the entire indian empire was annexed by the mighty forces of korea. 17/10 better than your average history textbook",1
"warning: game is listed as an addictive substance. do not touch if you want to get anything done.",1
"rather honestly, this is my favorite game to play. both with and without online players, i love to play. the freedom to do what you wish and the repurcussions of those actions just make the game that much better. plus its not like the third game where you could practically pump out anything you needed, but the computers could always pump out more troops to you no matter what.",1
"its sooo fun! try it out and you wont be disappointed.",4
"i play this game a little bit. highly recommended.",4
"probably the best game ever (i mean the civ franchise) :) high replayability ratio.",3
"civilization v is an absolute delight. this game is so addicting, you keep telling yourself just one more turn and that though keeps you playing for hours on end. this game has deprived me of more sleep than any other game that i have ever played.",1
"you know you got a good game when its the only one ive played for like 2 days",1
"u sit down pick a civ and begin the journey to last the test of time and theres warlord ghandi 100/10",1
"never play this game before but thr first time i spend time more 10 hrs. !!",1
"i come from tons of hours on civilization iii and i was a little sospicious about this one... but i was wrong. this game balanced, tough and have a lot of new cool stuff. worth it.",1
"barbarians shot down my fighter jet with clubs. 420/10",1
"i like it, but put steam workshop for this on mac.",3
"never have i sunk more hours into a game. one memory, i decided to take over paris, next thing i knew bird were chirping outside my window and it was 7:ooam the next day",3
"an extremely addictive turn based strategy game that will keep you up all night for just one more turn. not for the average gamer however, as an average game takes around 6 hours :p",1
"this game is so addictive. whenever i think 1 hour has passed, i realise that its actually 3. pro: the tone of the game the atmosphere depending on your civilisation, the many cultural music that randomly play the interactions the units different animation depending on the order you gave them and more. this a wondeful game. con: more interaction choices with the different leaders would be nice. >>> i was friend with the russia leader catherine until i had to attack a citie she was friend with (they were in my way). since then i had no way whatsoever to be friend with her again and she kept on denouncing me and being aggressive.",2
"sid meiers civilization v is an excellent strategy game for gamers of all ages. it is well-made and entertaining. i would give this masterpiece five stars out of a maximum of five stars.",1
"a great turn-based strategy game with a huge replayability value. while most of the victory conditions are not perfect, the combat is excellent and makes going to war an interesting and fun experience where strategy is more important than force.",3
"ok, this game is basically- build a city, upgrade it, go crazy building units, and take over the world! (also some other small victories) in this game you want to build up your civ and to survive until you cant be beat. expert game in multiplayer, so i suggest giving it a try, and also to get this game!",1
"the civilization series is one of the best series ever. great diversity, great slighty changing ais, great gameplay all makes for hours and hours of re-playability. plus ghandi will try to nuke you!",2
"7/10 civ 5 is a fun game but there are some bugs that needed to be fixed for a while which hurt this game so much.",2
"a great strategy game that is easy to play singleplayer or with others, and very easy to pick up on.",1
"best one in series so far, even better then beyond earth. atleast more deep.",2
"for a four year old game, civ5 presents a fantastic experience on par with modern strategy games. with particular emphasis on individual turns, each game steadily develops into a robust (albeit historically inaccurate) simulation of competitive civilizations. though the learning curve might be somewhat steep, the in-game tips are helpful and generally non-intrusive. once you get the hang of the mechanics, youll be hooked. keep in mind that each game spans the history of the world and then some. so grab some friends and get comfy; this might take a while. absolutely recommend!",1
"a streamlined modernisation of the civilization formula made better by each subsequent expansion. by no means flawless but probably the best overall tbs out there.",2
"do not play this game if you dont want to waste hours at a time on a game. civ v is a fantastic and highly addictive game through and through. the gameplay is simple to understand but still challenging, and it is a lot of fun to play with a lot of friends. there is great mod content and plenty of dlc, all of which add on to the game really well. the only downside of this game is that it sucks away whole days of your life while you watch your empire be destroyed by ghandi. 10/10",1
"historically accurate representation of famous world leaders such as mahatma duke nukem ghandi 10/10, its alright. - ign",3
"this game will keep you up till 3am and make you do really bad on tests because you fall asleep during them. 10/10.",1
"great game that never gets boring, make sure you have a clock beside your monitor while you play.",1
"this game is by far my most favroit strat game ever! with great dlcs and game style i would reccomend this to anyone who like sick strats.",1
"oh i will only play it for an hour.....3 days later..i should probably stop",1
"this game is a 100% awesome. weather it be single player in a custom senario, or multiplayer with your friends. this game is fun and at times educational. i really like the fact that all the choices that you have to make and the repercussions and tensions of those choices in the ever growing world around you is like doing a action and getting a equal and oppisite reaction that is intreging to me, some things will be a postive gain some things a negitive, but you as a leader make the choices. shear might, science, mabye a diplomatic victory? you get to choose which road is best for your playstyle and culture and charater. i like to micro manage and control descissions and actions in games that i play, and this game pretty much gives you free reign on your own capitals, cites, and population. this game is 10/10 for me, i hope you enjoy:) cowboy",1
"you play as the undisputed dictator of your own nation in this fantastic national socialist germany simulator, you win can through other methods like diplomacy but thats no fun.",1
"this game is amazing. 9/10. would devote my life to this again.",1
"great game to play with friends. couldnt ask for a smarter time wasting game.",1
"a really pleasing and exciting strategy game that i highly reccommend. 9/10",2
"i swear time ceases to exist as i play this game. whether you are crushing sparta with the legions of rome, or using the advanced technological knowledge of babylon to send a rocket in to space, you will love the epic that is civilization v.",2
"dont worry baby is only smells. 9/10 would buy again",3
"when i play this game, i just cant stop. i always say, just one more turn, but then i look out the window and its six in the morning. 10/10 would reccomend",2
"friendly ai prepared to backstab you at every turn. 11/10 would get fukt again.",1
"great depth of play. i still dont know what im doing.",1
"i have lost entire weekends to this game, and im perfectly fine with that. 10/10 excellent game",2
"look, ive played this series since civilization ii back in the day of pixel sprites and beatles music. civ v, the latest installment is great. the base game is sort of lackluster compared to the complexities of civ iv, but gandk and bnw (the expansions) help to flesh out the gameplay and give it that true civ feel. do i recommend? yes, i do. a/5.",2
"love this game to bits, but.... alexander: you are settling near us, stop it! 2 turns later alexander of greece has founded corinth! *looks for corinth* corinth is right below kyoto",1
"in sid meiers civilization v, you can choose a ancient civilization and build their empire the way you want. each civilization has its own upsides and downsides. you get to choose a map type, game pace, and difficulty. you can also choose how many ai you want to play with/against you. there is multiplayer, so you can play with some friends, or some randoms. i also highly recommend buying all of the dlc when you get the chance. it just adds more to the already amazing game. oh mighty player, can you sit on your  all day and play this game? can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? 10/10",1
"civilisation is a fantastic strategy game that is easy to learn and really addicting.",1
"starting playing this game at 7:00 pm yesterday. played for what seemed like a few hours until i realized the sun was starting to come out. if you start playing, then i hope you have nothing else to do for the rest of, and the next, day. totally worth it. 10/10",1
"this game is honestly one of the best games i have played. 10/10 would play again!",1
"with all the expansions and dlc, this iteration is finally living up to the name civilization. although very different from earlier games in the series, it retains the depth, character, and addictiveness. my only disapointment is with the lack of completely game-changing mods that made civ iv into such a wide platform. overall, id recommend it with all expansions to any strategy gamer who hasnt already picked it up.",2
"i have spent the most hours on this game. a game that i  for. it is so lovely when you nuke the enemys capital, and when you go on super easy so you just dominate just for the hell of it. if you dont like this game, you havent played it or given it a real try.",3
"after many hours of playing this game is excellent when you just want to sit back and enjoy a even paced game. it can be a bit slow playing against other people, but then again i dont have the skillz to hold up against most people who play this online.",2
"really good game, i would recommend getting this. hours of fun and great multi-player",1
"very rarely does a turn-based strategy game appeal to me, but damn, i cant get enough of this game.",1
"the game is fun to play! i whas playing this game 9 houres straight! and i coud not stop! if you like strategy games like me or haven`t tried that type of game! its super fun and you shoud buy it! :)",1
"very addictive lost alot of time on this enjoy the early stages seaching the world and get new stuff can be annoying when u haveto get 25 citys to all bluid buildings",1
"everyone ive ever shown this game to, regardless of the kind of gamer they normally are, seem to become completely obsessed with it! its a lot of fun to play with others or on your own. highly recommended!",1
"i have owned civilization 4 and civilization 5 has expanded on every thing i liked about civilization 4. this game was worth every penny i spent on it. i highly recomend this game to everyone.",3
"some aspects are a bit dumbed down from civ iv, but the exansions will fix that and even exand on them. also combat is extremely improved, youll no longer lose attack helicopters to cavemen.",1
"amazing game, really want to try it with a load of friends",1
"this is a really good strategy game. i bet the expansion packs make it even more epic. somewhat challeging to learn, but there are advisors that help you along the way. also, there is a good multiplayer option. i would totaly recommend this if you like stragety games and even if you dont, i would still recommend it.",1
"actually a hard game at first. kind of confusing at the begining. im still in training with this game. but overall good game 7.5 out of 10",1
"one of the best games ive ever played, i should be past 300 hrs now and theres a good reason for that, if you can manage to get a friend to play with you it becomes 10x better, you can help each other and not to mention face each other to see who would run a country better, i cant wait till civililization: beyond earth comes out cuase im sure ill  aways the hours with that game to but overall amazing franchise with a newer version in the works so get started now if youre still contemplating wether to buy this game or not.",2
"okay, first you need to know that ive played everyone of the pc-based civilization games since sid meiers civilization first appeared back in 1991. with that said, ive enjoyed each installment in this genre and each has had its pros and cons. civ v is probably one of the strongest entries by a long shot even while it has a number of players of the series critical of several major changes that were made both in game play and with the units and combat. personally, while i was initially critical, too, of some of these changes, with time i have come to enjoy the current version better than most of the previous versions. the dlc/add-ons as well as the thriving gamer modding community for civ v ensure that it will last a good long while on many players systems.",2
"hope you like the opening cinematic cause its unskippable for the most part and you see it everytime you load the game",1
"very enjoyable game, i havnted played to much but i for sure will be putting many more hours into this game",1
"wow, i didnt think id like this so much, im glad i bought it. 10/10",1
"this is a great game. definitely the greatest single player turn based strategy game out there. everything is polished and the ai is memorable. brave new world is without comparison. every person who plays it loves it. non gamers can get into it, and realize how much fun it is. i recommend this to anyone. (with the brave new world expansion of course).",4
"totally worth buying. i never played any turn-based strategy games prior to this and i always assumed they were boring. this game changed that view. i just started playing this game and so far im still playing with the bots so diplomacy is rather boring (the trades with bots is absolutely cut-throat). other than that, this is a very solid game. balancing your resource to attain victory certainly isnt easy. for whats it worth, this game is an absolute steal!",1
"highly recommended for people who like to play complicated strategy games. people who dont want to stress their brains, dont bother with this game.",1
"the most popular 4x game in the world has finally come to linux.",1
"one of the best turn base strategy games ever created. if youre into stategy games than this is a must!",3
"this game is a masterpiece. i feel like napoleon (which you can be) commanding his armies (which you can do) to attack enemy nations (which is a thing) and make them part of glorious france (which i think is possible?)!",1
"awsome game highly recomend to anyone who likes strategy turn based games buy it and chalenge me!",1
"hours upon hours of fun! i love this game and cant wait for the next franchise!",1
"if youre a fan of age of empires or any strategy game like that, then this game is for you. i didnt know what to expect when i went into this game, and sort of got lost, but then my knowledge of age of empires kicked in and i knew how to win.",1
"i really have only had the chance to finish a few games, but seeing the other players hours logged and my own (and mind you i have only finished 2 games at 36 hours) so its full of basically never ending contect, must have game! 10/10 potatos",1
"feels like i used a time machine when i play.. that can only be good right ?",1
"this game pretty much takes your spare time and turns it into concerns for a nation on a screen that you control, the thing about this nation is that its sole goal is to become the best nation in the world. pretty much the world longest cold war... 10/10 if you want to make your friends hate you buy right now",1
"this is simple. if you like turn-based strategy games, this is the king, the must-have of these games. get it on sale off of steam if you must, but get it, you will not regret it.",3
"on no account get this game if you have incredibly important exams imminent. it will take over your life.",2
"amazing turn based strategy game. endless fun especially with a friend.",1
"to all who like turn-by-turns, or who like strategy, or who like empire-builders, or who like politics, or warfare, or russia, or america, or the pyramids of giza, or gold, or sheep..... to all the aforementioned (and many others), this is a great game.",1
"my first civ v playthrough: george washington built the pyramids and the leaning tower of pisa gengis khan got angry ghandi declared war on both nations george and gengis got nuked i stole land from denmark denmark nuked ghandi egypt created the religion of shrek 10/10 ign",1
"yeah get ready to say one more turn then relizing its now 6 am and you have school in 2 hours.",1
"i have owned this game for less than a year and have played it for almost 700 hours. i have literally given it an entire month of my life. every time i boot up civ, i briefly contemplate joining a support group. seriously though you should be able to relocate your capital. 10/10 would play for another month of my life.",5
"one of the best strategy games to play with you friends!! try to win trough military, science or diplomatic viktory and some outhers as well.",2
"a fantastic turn-based strategy game.the best representation of the series and certainly the most accessible for new and old players alike.",1
"when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold, dyes, and ivory, take my advice. ready all your tanks and nukes, arm them, and shoot them like your life depends on it. they are evil, traitorous demons. never trust them. however, genghis khan is my best friend. he came up to me and was all like, de full do bu la chi mendo. and i said, okay! lets be friends! i can never understand that guy, but something about our relationship just works. ghandi hating simulator 2014 11/10",1
"pretty addicting game but its definitely not optimized. it uses like a gig of ram just on the main menu and loading times are crazy even on decent computers. content-wise its really great though. beat deity mode in 2 minutes, could use some balance. culture mode = challenge mode. some civs are better than others. religion rush op. id say 8/10 actual gameplay, 7/10 overall because of experience in loading screen and ram issues",1
"good old civ, never gets boring ... if its not boring at the first place )",1
"this game- for little i have to say im terrible at it. but one thing this game did was impress me with its overwhelming amount of features, ive only scratched the surface! this game seeks to amaze me and delivers which is why it gets a seal of approval. i rate it around 5/5 (perfect score!)",1
"good base game although it is worth purchasing brave new world expansion pack as it adds very well on to the gameplay or as part of the complete edition which at 39.99 is the same as buying the base game and brave new world although it is a much better deal.",1
"civilization is a very entertaining startegy game thats light on the mind and heavy on the fun. the only thing that can take away from the fun however, is the annoying amount of repetition within the gameplay. while the repetition seems to dwindle when lpaying with friends, it is still there. an overall enjoyable expierience and unique game, civ v is a worthwhile buy. ill have to give it a 7.5/10",1
"this game is crack. do i even need to say how good this game is?",3
"i find it hard to believe anyone is really reading reviews for this, as this is one of those games that i feel you either are already intimately familiar with, or want nothing to do with. that being said, if you are into strategy games and have never played this, i would advise you to get this the next time steam throws it on sale. if strategy is not your thing...dont.",1
"sid meiers civilization v is such a great game for people who love history strategy games and well just fun with friends. this game you got to be ready from turn one and make every move perfect. this is probaly a bad review and im not describing it well and you need the dlc very badly it makes the game super fun so yea first review civ 5 great game",2
"sid mieirs civilizaton v is one of the best strategies, but you should buy gods & kings dlc ( i think that brave new world is too difficult for newbie )",1
"as washington, i amassed an army of such great magnitude that i decimated every other inferior countries except germany. i left bismarck with a tiny isolated island. then i nuked them later. best 10 hours ever.",1
"a lot of fun and a big time sink. it needs a clock in game so i stop playing until 6am.",1
"a long playing stratergy game in which you can lead your civilization to victory or be crushed by more powerful and vicious leaders along the way. learn how best to use your civ and keep your people from revolt. this is not a game to knock over in a lunch break, but one to languish on over a couple of days. great fun to play with some friends.",2
"with all the expansions, civ v is an extremely well executed strategic game true to its root. full of content and endlessly replayable with friends. had quite a few hiccups in multiplayer, but now they are largely fixed. steep price to get with all the dlc, but well worth it.",3
"this game is one of my favourites in my library. its a game for anyone that loves or likes geography, it teaches you about history and lets you mold history in your way. i recommend you play this game with friends, you can play online and solo, but its a little more fun with someone you know and like to play games with. i recommend this game! 9/10",1
"a deep and engageing stategy game with many ways to win, will keep you up long into the night for just one more turn. highly recommended especially now the expansions have really fleshed out all aspects of the game.",4
"this game has great variety when it comes to choices of strategies. i have spent a lot of time playing this game and its predecessors.",2
"ive been playing civilization games since the first one came out, thanks to my older brother being into such games when i was younger. this version is very good and enjoyable. unfortunately i dont play it as often as id like to because i get so sucked into it and need to finish and play it in a day or two. there are so many different countries that you can choose to play as. throughout the game you need to build up armies, cities, culture, and more throughout the game play. you need to make your citizens happy, gain money through production, and work on owning various wonders to complete the game or win it. you intereact with other cultures/countries in the process. it is fun. i will always recommend it to people to play. i think it is very educational too. i hope my sons can play it or at least future versions of it when they are older and can understand it better.",1
"amazing game with loads of community made mods. get it if you love messing with histoy",1
"bring peace to the world using nukes. while playing as ghandi. 11/10",2

"i could write an immense review of this game, stating why it has caused me more sleepless hours than anything in my library other than kerbal space program. but its pointless. if youre even looking at turn-based-strategy games, you probably already know exactly what to expect from civilization v. some hardcore strategy types might consider it lightweight...but ive been one of those people, and if you end up talking with a grognard type who says they think the civilization series, any of them, were bad games, theyre either a hipster of the worst sort or just plain lying. buy this game.",1
"*gods and kings and bnw version rewiew* well polished 4x that is easier for newcomers than older civs, but adds mechanics that make game well enjoyable even after hours, even for veterans. one more turn syndrom confirmed.",1
"great game, even as an fps/rpg fan, i still find this game extremely fun. well made, beautiful graphics, and plenty of play time.",1
"this game has sucked away more hours of my life than any other game. i find myself returning to play civ v often as it has incredible replay value. every game is different because of tweaks you can make before starting the game and because of the incredible amount of choices and actions you can take during the game. every expansion added new and interesting content, especially the brave new world expansion which added some of the most interesting civs and great balancing and improvements to many game mechanics.",2
"best game, must get all dlc to really enjoy the experience!!!",1
"there is not enough words to describe how amazingly fun this game is and i have yet to meet someone who doesnt enjoy playing the game :) there are a variety of courses you can choose to go whether you choose to destroy everyone in your path or possibly be a diplomatic leader who strives in culture. the game is extremely fun when you play with your friends and like monopoly it seems to take forever to actually finish. you dont have to play with friends, but it certainly can bring a new edge to the game unlike playing against npcs. in conclusion, if you are looking for a long lasting enjoyable game that you can play by yourself or with friends, then look no further ^_^",1
"ow, my what a anoying game! fun but anoying. dont play with friends for a excess of 2-3 hours!",2
"awesome game. it is definetly something you have to play as a gamer who loves strategy and economics.",1
"good game, definitely worth having if you have some friends to play with.",1
"i cannot stop playing this game! i had tried civilization: revolution on the xbox 360 before, and also seeing that i was raised in a household where my father played the older civilization games, i couldnt ignore this game. the experience was definitely enhanced by the graphics and the new hex grid. nearly all aspects of the game are amazing, whether it be the music or the assortment of civilizations. needless to say, this is one of the best games i have seen.",1
"once you figure out what you are doing, this game will eat your life. you will play until your eyes bleed and when you eventually fall asleep in your chair the dreams you have will be those of archers defending your lands, workers building farms, and tanks capturing cities.",2
"when i discovered the mods, since then i only play the msf-nation civ/civ would play another turn",1
"every new game is a whole new story. new strategies are needed for each new game and the game always has you planning out your next moves in advance. you can spend endless hours without knowing it and without getting bored.",2
"the game always seems to have some kind of an issue when playing online, but is a great game for anyone that likes stratagy games.",1
"an amazing game. i could just play this game all night, turn after turn. it is also very educational. i new 4 of the questions on my last history test because of this games civilizations and wonders. the strategy is flawless.",1
"buggy as hell. well over half the time doesnt start in steam. steam really sucks, and their online support is terrible.",5
"i wish i could put a nutural recomendation. its an entertaining game. i am a true die hard civ fan but i have to say i played civ 4 way more because i liked it more. i have played this game alot but i do not have the desire to play it endlessly as i did 4. perhaps the problem is that civ 4 was a masterpice and this is just ok. my recomendation is overall good but i would have to say its not the best civ has come out with either",2
"great game! very addicting, suggest spending allitlle extra to get gold addition!",1
"this is a very cmplex and deep game full of twists and turns, it takes you on a great journey that consists of death, joy and victory. i hated every moment.",2
"civ 5 is extremely fun, and even a little educational as it mirrors how real-life affiars in the world could go down.",1
"its civ, if you dont know about it youre doing something wrong",1
"always invites you to play just one more turn.. and another..",1
"i absouletly love this game. this is by far the best civ game in the franchaise. now that they added trade routes and all that good stuff, makes the game more realistic... i give this game 10 out of 10. i would recommend this game 100 times over.. it is kind of slow to start but it does pick up once you hit the medevil era.",1
"one of my all time fav games, this requires you to have a stong economy while ballencing other aspects of your empire on multuple fronts. not only is this game diplomaticaly focoused it also has extreme focous for combat and war situations aswell. for example your units gain a bonous for attacking from a hill and can often not attack with indirect fire... if i had to make one complant i would say that some of the civs need a little re-ballancing other then that if you are a stratigist then you need to pick this game up 9.5/10",2
"both really easy to get into, and very deep. while it can take a lot of your time, its worth it.",1
"this game strikes a cord in strategy gaming, great graphics, animations, combat and mechanincs. the only bad thing i can see with this game is the fact that it only ever feels complete when you have all the expansion packs, the base game feels rather barren.",2
"not exactly like the other civs, a feature for which it got some criticism, civ v expands on the series in such a way that pleased me both aesthetically and in gameplay. while it is certainly less complex than earlier installments in the series, civ v is far more intuitive and more fun to play, yet it still retains enough of the complexity to be an engaging turn based strategy game. its also great for multiplay.",2
"civilization v is in all honesty, the best game i have ever had the pleasure of playing. its not just how much time the developers have put into making this game as good as possible, its also how much the community has helped the game thrive and become more of a player friendly experience. although if you want to buy it, i strongly recommend getting bnw and gk (brave new world and gods and kings) as they improve the game mechanics greatly. the community as a whole makes this game worth while, mods improve the game greatly even in places where you thought there could be no improvement. 11/10 strongly recommend it.",2
"made giant death robots that cut through and city in its path. 10/10",1
"addiction. too much addiction. must click. must click once more. it is 3 am in the morning, one more click, one more turn. yup, that sums it up. this game is addiction.",1
"if you need a high quality time sink, this is a good game. the game isnt boring and is fairly easy to get the hang of. some turns require more thinking and some turns require less. when i first started playing, my ocd to be far more prevelent than in most game. some turns require more thinking and others require no thinking. this is something that is rough on simplier methods of managing ocd. i did manage in the long run. the linux port is top notch. full screen behaves way better than most games. graphics are nice but dont really matter much for this type of game.",1
"pretty solid game sucked me in games are extreamly long",1
"an amazing game. the expansions make this game greater but the base game works just fine. when getting this game realise games take a long time to complete. overall great way to waste time, 10/10",1
"this game is by far my favorite. if you dont know already, its a 4x where you control one of historys civilizations from the stone age all the way up to the near future. the main changes from 4 to 5 is the change of square spaces to hexagonal spaces for movement. also, this interation removes the stacking and limits you to one military unit and one civilian unit per hex, so no more stacks of doom. i dislike how in the base game they left out a lot of the features from previous games (such as espionage and religion); however, they add those features back in on the expansions. all in all, the game is addictive and hard to resist the just one more turn syndrome. i would give this a 9/10 with exapansions and a 7/10 with just the base game",3
"civilization v is horrifically addictive in the best way possible. its the kind of game where you can spend countless hours playing and not even notice the time passing, which can potentially be very dangerous. it may not be the best game in terms of graphics and gameplay but if you have the patience to master it, it can be very rewarding.",1
"not too deep, not too shallow. easy to learn and play but can be challenging. civ v is definitely one of the best 4x game. a must have. one more turn!",1
"this was once a really good game, but due to recent updates the multiplayer now sucks and it cant even go 5 minutes without having to reload (which itself takes 1-2 minutes). to summarize; its a good game... for single player... only!! (as of 11/15/14)",2
"awesome tbs game. great addition to sid meiers civ series.",4
"(-)ai is  (-)on some devices touch mode break game (-)game is borring without expansions... (+)...but with them, it is one of best game i have ever played (+)you will play again and again and again... (+)works even on weak pc (+)mods (+)music (+)game is cheap (+)every nation use native language (+)many many more",1
"this game is flipping amazing. nuff said. its awesome, its addicting, the graphics are amazing, ive played it for 39 hours, its really good, awesomest turn-based strategy ive ever played. go buy it now.",1
"check this out with the new expansion, it may have fixed the issues that you had with it at first. i loved it then and still love it.",1
"this game is absoulutely amazing. in singleplayer, the game is very immersive and you feel like a leader of your naton, eager to lead your civilization to glory. and in multiplayer, this game is full of diplomacy, betrayal, forged alliances and secret deals that make the game an absolute laugh. my only complaint is that even on quickest game speed, a full game with friends will take you several weeks to complete and unless you and all your friends are completely dedicated, you will likely get bored before game end. if you like these kind of turn based stratergy/nation builder kind of games and have a group of friends who do too, get this game for sure.",2
"ever wanted to build a massive empire from a small 5 man tent site to a sprawling nation ecompassing entire continents? too bad! youve got massive unhappiness from that many cities! ever wanted to field an army to rival that of rome in the second punic war against carthage? too bad! all that unit maintenance is leaving you in debt! civs an awesome game, but man can it be frustrating some times. ive never been more let down by being told i could do all these wonderful, massive things and then not being able to do them to my imagination... dont get me wrong, civs a great game, and i heartily recommend it to anybody who enjoys the idea of running a civilization, i just think it could be less restricting at times.",1
"namaste. my name is ghandi and i am a very peaceful man. lol jk  booom",1
"great game, addicting and fun. i fully recommend it",1
"civ 5 is extremely fun, and even a little educational as it mirrors how real-life affiars in the world could go down.",1
"highly addictive turn-based strategy game. if youre a history buff like me, youll enjoy it quite a bit.",1
"if ive wasted 400 hours of my life on this game, you know its good.",2
"amazing except the freezing when your using dlc and players leave the game. other than that fun.... still havent finished a game though",1
"this is a game you can easily lose a day too. 4x games always look incredibly boring too watch but once you start playing one you just cant stop. gods and kings and brave new world are pretty much required too get as the base game was a little too basic. the five different victroy types make finding new strategys all the more fun.",1
"probably one of my favorite games, tied with diablo 3, minecraft, the halo games, :d",1
"what an amazing game! one of my favorite games of all time. people think its really hard to get used to it and say its really complex, but if you give it a shot youll see its a ton of fun and very addictive. the expansion packs add a lot of content and are also worth buying. dont hesitate, just buy this game!",2
"so i started playing one day and then was never seen again.",1
"there is but one thing you need to know: befriend gandhi or perish",1
"probably the best strategy game ever made because it is very easy to comprehend for a novice and can be amazingly deep and rich for an expert player. every game is an entirely new experience! love it and you will too.",1
"the best of the five civ games ever to come out. those who prefer civ 4 like a totally different type of game. civ 5 is very much more like the original civ 1 and 2 - only much much better. 5 stars.",2
"5th iteration on the civilization series. increased tactical gameplay through a one unit per tile policy. major focus is still on civilization management, city development, and research vs income vs population happiness balancing. playstyle heavily influenced by social policy decisions. recommended for anyone that hasnt played the civilization series yet, recommended for on sale purchase for anyone else.",1
"awesome addicting turn based strategy game that everyone should play at least one time in there lifetime. highly recommended.",2
"this is an incredibly detailed strategy game with seemingly endless options available and a very broad scope. a single game can easily comprise 10 hours of gameplay and you can build a truly vast empire with an ever growing number of needs which need to be managed! its suprisingly easy to learn the basics of the game given its extreme complexity, but experienced players can become more effective as they learn the game in greater detail. unfortunately longer games can become a little stagnant at times but this might have something to do with my own attention span after playing the game for several hours! still, i would call this a must buy for any strategy fans and one of the better games to introduce new players to the genre; civilization has always been at the forefront of strategy gaming in my mind and this is no exception.",1
"great game and would reccommend to anyone who likes in-depth, well made strategy games. awesome gameplay and really smooth multiplayer if there is a good host.",1
"this game is amazing!!! never try to play this before you go to bed or need to do something.",1
"you play this game when you dont have internet access and/or you have about 20 hours to blow on 1 game. not recommended if you value sleep or food over world domination.",1
"civ 5 is complex with a healthy does of options however it remains balanced with very simple mechanics. easy to pick up and play with enough depth to keep you coming back. it may seem off putting if you have played civ in the past but this is a different beast, great with freinds or alone.",1
"this game is a game for a stragist - it is a adaptive game in which anything you do can change the out come of the game and in my oppinion has been well designed to challange the user",1
"awsome strategy game, for all sid meyers fans: this is one to pick up. bought at steam sale, well worth every cent.",1
"the game is well designed but with some minor problems for some peoples connection while in multiplayer single player is good",3
"i like game viciltaztion vee. good game of much fun happy lovemaking to skill country crafting epidemic story. where is brazil country? where is peru country? i jeeves aksed and he say in stouh aermica but i live where can no affrod map to see world. i too good at other games of psuhing twoers and kliling hereos so i awlays yell at team to be no bad at be good of happy skill. but no listen ears deaf? maybe so. fingernailed it. so i make big carzy jump over hot acid to tihs game. except for no brazil and peru best game of the year. i would tell you year i speak of but no calenders in very poor country of money burning factory evil.",1
"great game! so fun being able to win without firing a single shot but also to have the option to nuke cities if i want :)",1
"buy this! its the best! ever! buy this then buy brave new world!",2
"fun game, difficult to learn but once you do its alot of fun",1
"ive put as many hours into this as i have put into a lot of modern rpgs. that says something about how addictive this game is. i would even be willing to go so far as to say that this is the best game in the series. while some of the changes (such as removal of unit stacking) are annoying at first, everything leads to a sense of greater balance than ever before and the need to figure out new strategies. the graphics are fantastic, the tech tree is well-developed, and the civilizations all feel just different enough to make you come up with different play styles for each one. id definitely have to recommend this game to any fan of turn-based strategy games. whether you are new to the series or a long-time fan, civ v has a lot to offer you. definitely check it out.",2
"one of my all time fav games, played the first civilization to the present, just keeps getting better.",1
"i said i would only play it for a couple of hours to try it, now look at me",1
"my favorite game to just relax with. even at higher difficulties i never really stress out with civ i just sit back and try to execute my strategies to the best of my ability and hope i dont spawn in a desert. dlc is well worth it since it adds so many new layers to an already complex game. multiplayer is a blast as well. always a good time to beat a friend to a wonder and listen to them rage over skype.",1
"sid meiers civilization was one of the best game of this era and still might be if sid meiers civiliztion beyound earth is a flop which i highly disaprove (note this review was made before the release of sid meiers civilization beyound earh) i would giave this game a 9 3/4 out of 10",3
"damn, frikin shtty city-states are all like: oh! you better give us money or well end this friendship! dude, wtf you started the friendship jeeze but good game, just kill city-states as soon as you see them",1
"conquered the iroqois in the modern era while using infantry as carthage then got half of my cities nuked by gandhi and all the city-states declared war on me. 56/10",2
"im roughly 30 hours in and i have to say that this is now one of my favorite games of all time. its very time consuming but i absolutley love it.",1
"playing this game for about three months or so, i figured out the possiblities of discovering new worlds, fighting civilizations, and using extraordinary mods to play the game appeal to me. however, i find the game very time consuming, as one would have to move their units one by one and especially the processing time is long. overall, i find this game interesting, creative, and enjoyable. 4/5",2
"best pc exclusive out right now. i recommend this game for everyone, and anyone who gets it should definetly play multiplayer with me. just watch out for the wrath of khan.",1
"i have so much trouble getting this game to work. i have tried it on 3 different computers and it hasnt worked on any of them. i am so disappointed because i was a real civ fan. i am going to return it to the store and call it quits after a week of trying!",1
"a game you can play and literally lose days at a time, then after 20 or so hours of gameplay and lose so its all been for nothing! fantastic game, if i ever get bored or have spare time on my hands, throw it on and watch the day disappear. easy enough to pick up as well, cant wait for next expansion..",1
"this is by far my favorite game of all time, and with all the mods this game is endless. build your empire, build up your soldiers, take over other countries. this game has everything you need with turn base game. if you really like this game, make sure you spend some cash and get the add-ons, it makes the game even more intense.",1
"civilization is a classical series, but if, by any chance, you have never played it before, civilization v may prove to be an excellent introduction to the series. i really recommend it to people who enjoy turn-based strategy games and the history of the major nations.",1
"this game is just pure fun. i just picked it up during the steam summer sale and i think it was a great decision. fun to play, easy to learn, and unique as well. all you gotta do is add to cart and begin having a ton of fun!",1
"do not say i played strategy game without playing civ.",2
"i knew i was ment to rule the world. {evil laugh} this is a pretty laid back, turn based game. its fun :d",1
"you cant play online unless you buy all the dlc, bad game. that is all.",1
"definitely worth a purchase with the xpacs, cannot wait for civ in space!",1
"okay so where do i start? first week 25 hours in ok. i have owned this for about 7 months and have aprox, 140 hours. interduced me to the 4x games. easy to get into. i recomend getting brave new world too for the religion. also ghandi for lol has more nuke tendacies then nepolean?",1
"doc browns flux capacitor has got nothing on this game",1
"if you buy a game purely from how much hours you get from it, this game should be worth 100+. its  how much time i spent the first week i got this game. i spent the whole first week playing this game. wake up, play, eat, sleep. wake up, play, eat, sleep. for a week. for one game of civ. just buy it if you want to lose the rest of your days. it is now belong to sid meier.",1
"perfect installment of a great series. also like the amount of options and classic features they tried to maintain in all the elements of the game.",2
"ive played my fair share of stratagy games these past few years but no stratagy ive played gets as good as this (exept maybe starcraft) and when i mean good i mean good.",1
"been playing the civ series for more than 10 years and im still learning how to play.",1
"its the best strategy game on pc! after the first game you will not to be able to live with out it!!!",2
"my first game on steam, and by far, one of the best games i have played. when i first got this civ v i almost cried myself to sleep. i felt as if it was slow, a waste of money and at the time i was more intereted in rtss. after the rts craze ended, i stumbled across this game again. after 10 minutes of playing, i thought why did i ever say no. it is pretty obvious to see that this game was well planed out, nice animations and graphics, suits playing styles (diplomatic, economic, military, science and even cross styles have advantages.) and hud is very nice too. the menus are easy to navigate and ingame. multiplayer is its only downfall, tbs, what did i expect. enough said. this game is fun and a massive time consumer. if you have enough time on your hands, then this is deffinitly for you. 9/10",1
"love the game! but as of recently, the game will not load previous saves really disappointed...",1
"this game is ridiculously addiciting. start a casual game at 3 in the afternoon and end up playing til 4 in the morning. i love this game.",1
"started game as germany, russia became evil. teamed up with greak, japanese, and americans to take down russia and china soon after we won the war it was a 4 man free for all. 10/10 would demolish two great superpowers again and win a 4 man free for all.",1
"really fun game and the addons add interesting new stuff, so i recommend playing it with the addons.",1
"huge fan of all sid meiers games. played all of them and this one is the best, by far. anybody who loves turn-based strategy games, this is the greatest investment you could make. 6/5 stars.",1
"accidentally nuked my own capital when trying to move the nuke there. s good.",1
"the original civ v is alright, but it is a brilliant game with bnw expansion. the depth is extremely large. the only lacking part is the ai choices seem to be less smart and i dont like the difficulty penalties.",2
"i love civ. its a wonderful series. i do recomend it. but if i had bought civ 5 when it came out for full price and paid full price for the expansions i would have spent $120 on civ 5 and the game still would not be finished.civ has gone down the money grubbing dlc route with this. civ 5 was a dumbed down civ 4 with better mechanics. then the first expansion came out adding back all the great features that they removed from civ 4. then brave new world adding the rest and making a few more. it is an incomplete and thus i must vote it down.",2
"for those who like strategy games. offers singleplayer and multiplayer. turn based but can be simultaneous actions for each turn. highly recommended.",3
"i thnik this is one of the most addicting and fun games",1
"very good. recommend to buy all the expasion packs althought",1
"this game gets 0/10 budder blocks hail sky. its full of a bunch of squids who think they can run a country. they also dont let you mine budder and make shrines to lord sky. this needs a remake or a dlc to add budder and move it up to my standards hail sky",1
"i, ghandi, the mighty ruler of india, have crushed russia and america, and built an amazing space rocket, and utopia. in a day.",1
"like 4x games? dont know what they are? probably wont enjoy this. i like them though!",1
"well thought out and beautiful looking strategy game.",1
"great game, the lead designer was really into board games and the balance in movement is evident in this game. the hex moving system of panzar leader from the 1970s works perfectly like a complex and beautiful chess game.",2
"the game is addictive if not frustrating...especially those bloody babarians stealing my civilians...-_-",1
"i enjoy playing civ, and even though i enjoy it, matches can take a good while, even on quickpace turns. new tech would go down well along with a new range of different civs, and maps...even a sandbox map maker would do me too.",1
"holy shnaps!!! a masterpiece 11/10. babylon is a true badass",1
"you too can learn of the might and the fury of a gandhi enraged.",3
"this is a really good game for spending your time off... played hours and didnt even saw the time going on... approved!!!",1
"i can never ask for stuff, but my friends could do it. how long have i been in-game? i never knew germany built the great wall i never knew china built the pyramids i never knew gandhi loved nuking people my life is a lie 10/10",2
"if you own the expansions (g&k and bnw), then this is one of the best and most accessible 4x games ever created. its lacking a certain something by itself, but the expansions on top make this a fantastic purchase that just takes massive bites out of you free time. without expansions: this is a great game to buy while on sale. with expansions: worth all of your time and money.",1
"love this game! smeels like my cat died in my house somewhere but i domianted the world lol",2
"its a war strategy game that has a lot of customability. the game hardly decides anything for you and you control every factor. you dont even have to win by war you can win by culture, science, and even be elected world leader. watch a couple videos atleast. :)",3
"really fun tbs game. fan of all the civs and this one is great! i have the gold edition with the gods & kings pack. gives tons of playable characters!",1
"its got swag! oh, and its an amazing strategy game that involves a lot planning what you will do in the future of the game.",1
"best played with brave new world but still a good game without it.",1
"i absolutely recommend this game. its as hard as you want it to be, and always keeps you wanting more - what if youd done this, or changed your view on something? this game lets you be whatever and who you want to be.",1
"best way to sit around and waist time, but be carefull, you might get a little mssed up in the head if you play it to much.",1
"civilization v is a fun game to get lost in for an hour no better make that ten hours, i found myself consistently playing for long periods of time without even realising it. its not the most realistic out there, but its still something you should all check out.",1
"the gameplay stayed the same over the years but why change things if it works?. graphics got better, mechanics got finetuned, things added, things dropped. still a pleasant game for a lazy day at home. ...and no, i dont know either what happened to civ iv :p",1
"ghandi banned salt then nuked me. 10/10 will play again",2
"civilization v is a great game that you can play for over 250+ hours and still not know every tactic or strategy and youll never beat it. its a strategic game where not building that one military unit could be your downfall. overall a solid game. 8/10",1
"this game along with all of the dlc (the complete edition) is an astounding game, the game looks beautiful and is very enjoyable to sit playing for a few hours at a time. the game is at its best with a few friends with you in a few sittings. if you like turn-based strategy games and are willing to play through a few games not understanding what the difference is between left and right, then this game really is worth the money put into it. i plan to release gameplay of civilization v on my youtube channel, but have not yet done so d:",1
"great in game. doesnt support my resolution though, 1280x720.",1
"if by any chance you happend to see this on sale... simply buy. i find myself constantly be back in this game to the drawing board. even if i wont spend but a few hours at a time leading my civilization to glory or destruction, its always a joy non the less. :) 8/10",1
"if you havent played a civ game or only played civilization revolution on the consoles, its pretty complicated but its super fun even when youre -30 gold per turn and everything is terrible. its very satisfying to wipe a whole civilization off the map as they try to negotiate peace when theyre down to their last city. its marvelous.",1
"all i can say is - simply fantastic. i played its predecessor, revolution, and while that was rather fun, i would say that civ5 is an upgrade between two slices of bread and smothered in jam. a huge repetoire of units and buildings combined with a highly intelligent combat system enables fluid, fast-paced war directed your way, and detailed diplomacy enables you to create a cold war-scenario with your enemies. hell, with nuclear weapons in place, you could simply engulf anyone who spills your tea in an atomic cluster if you wanted to. overall, im going to slap a 10/10 label onto this. buy it. nao.",1
"definately worth the money when played with both the available addons.",2
"civilization v is one of the very best strategic games on the market in terms of military activity, politics, culture, science, and economy. once you get attached to this game, itll provide hours and hours of fun and strategy. i recommend this game to any gamer who wants to build a nation, create alternate history, or simply conquer the world.",1
"good game to play with a some freinds. better with the dlc",1
">plays as alexander the great >settles first city in what should be beijing >greek empire is now originated in asia >playing with 11 other civilizations on large map >kills off 6 of the 11 by modern era >becomes alexander the terrible >adopts autocracy >becomes the third reich >enslaves world >learns alexander the great wasnt so great 10/10 would bang",1
"its ok, i mean you know its not as bad as that other game that your frankly sick and tired of playing so yea.",1
"played as rome, found gandi, he nuked me, i lost looked at the clock saw it was 4 am 12/10 would bang again",1
"i sometimes like to eat soup. oh yeah, and this game is fun too.",1
"even if i am not a hard core strategy fan, this game had entertain me for over 4 years now and it is still very enjoyable. it have its shady sides (like diplomatics) but they are all forgivable. great and very entertaining game (even more with expansions). i love it!",1
"this game is an epic time sink. first day i got it one more turn quickly turned into watching the dawn rise. must get for strategy lovers.",2
"i would recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy games.",2
"an incredibly robust game with a lot of depth and fun. although it can get a bit samey through multiple plays there enough settings and styles to keep it interesting. worth a play for those looking for some long turn-based strategy.",1
"its hard to describe what is civilization to someone who never played it. well, its a simulator of building your own empire in a way that ou prefer - wars, economics, diplomacy, religion. if you are a big fan of strategy genre, you should definetely play this game, its great. its also turn-based. dont rush into multiplayer, try some single player scenarios first to feel game pace and choices that you must do in order to conquer the world. good luck!",1
"its like drugs in game form. superbly easy to get addicted to, insanely hard to quit and uncanningly easy to fall back into if you somehow managed to quit (its like gravity, all it takes is a push). on top of that, its extremely detrimental to your health and social life. 10/10, would give up life again.",2
"turn based strategy thats accessible to you, your mom, your dad, your sister, your friends, her friends, his friends... everyone, basically. 10/10. get the dlc, too. just brave new world if your trying to save cash-moolah. it really rounds out the game.",2
"an amazing turn based stratagy game with a huge amount of gamechanging decisions to make, expecially with all the dlc which i highly recomend. the only thing i dont like is how even now there is still a few bugs left in muliplayer including the trading bug which can completly wreak the game for you. but this only a small isue and means nothing if you are playing with trusted freinds. over all the game is great fun expecially with freinds and provides hours of fun. 10 out of 10",3

"i recommend this it is a very fun and exciting strategy game with lots to think about while in-game.",1
"one of the best turn-based strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing. whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer, or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player, this is one game that any strategy enthusiast, or, hell anyone strat-curious should check out.",1
"a really fun and reaxed or a heated and intense game depending on the pace and choices you make. 9/10",1
"what a great game. it enables you to play as civilizations from the past. as well as you can play it 100 times and each time will be different. the only thing that i would add is a canadian civilization.",3
"i spend my life in this game, because this game is beautiful and wonderful.",2
"its fun at first but once you get into it. not as fun as you think.",1
"its literally one of the best games on steam, and is by far probably the game that ive logged the most steam hours on.",3
"this game also doubles as a time machine 5 hours longer than you wanted to play in the future.",1
"great game, it looks like a real life ruiner and i couldnt be happier",1
"i sypothize with the people who dont have this game. i have played civ since civ 2 and i still love it every time i play a new one. you play as an empire crushing all in your path with whatever weapons you see fit :d. want to watch the world burn? let your plains rain nuclear warheads on the heads of our enemies. want to seek peace and prosperity? go diplomatic and give your resources to everyone you meet. want to achive a sience victory? be the first one to go to space. the possibilites are endless. i however prefer to see my enemies destroyed at my feet.",1
"addictive and can be as complex or simple as you want, with help from the plethora of mods out there.",2
"great game but i wouldnt suggest trying to play it and thinking oh, ill stop in 15 minutes.",2
"only in this game can you have the great wall of china, the pyramids, and the hanging gardens all in russia",1

"just buy civ 4 instead. they screwed up everything that was great about civ. civ 1 - 4 were my favortie games ever and this is just garbage. what happened in development?",1
"probably one of the most addicting games i have ever played. i dont know about the new beyond earth coming out here but i guarentee this is the best buy i had in the last 2 years",2
"you will need all the dlcs to realy enjoy this (not the maps silly, the game mechanic changeing ones) or it will only be 4/10. i am no fan of the new combat system so for me its an overall 8/10. no must havebut a lot of fun, 3 and 4 are still better imo.",2
"absolutely fantastic civ game. totally recommend if you are a fan of the series.",1
"i have played this game for 3 years, and keep playing. yes, you would get bored after games, but after a period of time, you would be dragged back and play one more game. so, one....more....round.....",2
"wonderful game. on linux (both arch and ubuntu, 64bit) works like a sharm! sometimes, i get the network disconnected when im launching this game and some progresses are not saved or steam cloud storage doesnt work, but the game is funny and requires attentions.",1
"if youre looking for an awesome time sink, look no further. 10/10 would recommend. simply: awesome.",1
"go for it, such a great game to play with friends. the game has a save function even for multiplayer, so dont worry about the fact that most games go for quite a long time, simply save, and return later with your friends. on top of that, the game can get a little weird and wonderful when you play a dead civilisation, and end up winning with it. does age of empires let you play future egyptians with death robots? i think not.",1
"really good strategy game! i recommend it to those of you who strategy games and who like ancient civ",2
"epic. not the same as previous civs but just as good.",1
"havent played it much, i need brac  dlc to play with nick and collins... what the  i buy the game 5 dollars 6 years ago dont know hwo to play why did i eeven install it? 14/14 - its alright",1

"dont play this game with antis507 he is a crazy paranoid warmonger if you see him in a multiplayer game: run for your life. anyway nice game 9,8/10",2
"very fun and tedious game. meth heads, and people with no concept of time will love this game. for all others its a great game, but if your going to play a large game dont make any plans for that day.",1
"good game, a little bit boring compared to total war games. its pretty much turn based and i found the xbox 360 version much more fun. wait for the specials to come out and buy it then. if i compared this to total war, i would chose total war. graphics are not that amazing but its believable. my score would be 7/10. total war score 9/10. sim city 9/10.",1
"very addictive, highly suggest people play this game. i also find it passes time, a lot of time, infact days! no really, it is addictive!:) 10/10",1
"though i do recommend buying this game, that doesnt change the fact the firaxis is full of greedy jews (please pardon my bigotry). wanting $30 each for thier dlc. however, after ive typed this out, ill probably cave-in and buy g&k. but guess what? thats exactly what they (firaxis) knew would happen!",1
"one of the best turn-based strategy games ive ever played a must have if you play pc games",1
"a very addicting game to say the least. if you need a time sink, look no further then civilization 5. if you are new, or a veteran to civ. civ 5 was created to draw new people into the franchise because it was stagnating. the game does just that. it has enough tactical depth to keep anyone entertained, and is simple enough to jump right into on the lower difficultys. i strongly reccomend this game if you want to loose and social life you may have. ;p",1
"the vanilla game is , the expansions make it semi-playable, the computer ai is a joke, and the only game worth murdering the developers more is the waste of money civ 6",2
"my all time favorite turn based strategy game that ive ever had the pleasure of playing.",1
"- revived montezuma - 3 turns later he declares war on me 10/9",2
"just one more turn. no, its never just one more turn. very addictive and fun. good for when you got a lot of time to spend.",1
"it can chew up alot of hours. i love this franchise, but its much better playing multi player (as usual).",1
"over the years (and the expansions/dlcs) this game has become better and better. the one-more-turn-feeling is hard to resist and this game is as deep as it gets. i highly recommend getting the addons, as they really add to the experience. also, civ is often on sale, so that shouldnt be a problem. this game offers hundres of hours of gameplay youll love, if you like turn-based strategy games. by the way, i think that its kind of odd that people who spent more than 500h with civ claim that they cannot recommend this game",2
"an amazing game if you like strategy games. has plenty of gameplay, can keep you hooked for literally hundreds of hours. and since the strategy is turn based, you have no rush to play moves off quickly, like an rts. but still, wished it ran a bit faster and the loading time is a bit long, but otherwise a great game. 10/10 would bang.... i mean buy.",2
"a fun turn-based strategy game where you can build your empire and conquer the globe. its very easy to use and will suck the hours away if you arent careful. be careful in the tutorial though, you cant save.",1
"one of my new favorite games, and that is saying alot about strategy games for me as someone who fell in love with games like aoe 2 and 3 for the longest of time.... not at all the same type of game, much more fun. do you find it to get boring from time to time? buy one of the two great expansions for the game it really ads alot to the experience! -have fun-",1
"i am a bit older and played civ 1,2, and 3. i had to buy this on the summer sale. it started off a bit hard for me as it has changed a lot. but i am already hooked again. cant reco enough.",1
"really fun once you get into it, if you like strategy games that take a while, and are full of a lot of freedom and choices, buy civ, you wont regret it.",1
"this is a turn-based settling/fighting game in which you are a random world leader from a random time period and you build an empire and then you kill each other. what more could you want from a game? computerboardgamewoohoo mine mine mine mine mine mine ~seagulls (finding nemo)",1
"on the one hand, this game is incredible. on the other, its near-impossible to stop. so.. maybe... dont buy it? it will eat your life.",1
"in all honesty, this game can best be described as one. more. turn. ive literally fired up civ v at 2 am because i couldnt sleep and accidentally played until 6 am before. thats how addicting it is. try it once, get addicted forever.",1
"just one more turn - dont like to put down any of the civilization games.",1
"playing with a good group of friends who wont troll will vastly improve ones experiance. playing with people you do not know is a crap shoot. single player feels like a waste of time.",2
"super sweet game, will play forever. or until civ:beyondearth comes out",1
"very very good, however i do have some crashes but overall this game is epic",1
"this game is addictive in singleplayer and delightful in multiplayer. 10 conquered civilizations out of 10, would buy again.",1
"quite addictive and a good bit of historical fun if you like turn-based games. they did a great job.",1
"civilization v is the latest installment in a long running franchise of popular 4x games. its a turn based strategy game that lets you build your empire however you see fit, whether thats becoming the most advanced people on the planet, or the only ones. you control the course of history and theres nothing more satisfying than leaving behind a legacy.",1
"only recommend if you get both expansions with it. the ai may be schizo (and cheat a lot) and the game may not have the depth of a grand strategy title, but its still a fun time sink. theres a lot of fun to be had with the civ+victory type combos. there are also a lot of great custom maps and mods for this game (though using mods prevents you from getting achievements if thats your thing).",2
"one more turn. just one more turn. just one more turn. just one more turn. just one more turn. just one more turn. just one more turn. just. one. more. turn. the suns coming up... it was 8pm 5 minutes ago.",5
"destroying the culture and history of another civilisation with an army worthy of mordor can be all the more fun with civilisation v.",1
"took one look at the artwork/graphics and said nah. and that was that for a long time. i eventually gave in to all the hype when it was on sale and omfg, its only like the best grand strategy ive ever played! entire days have been happily lost since.",1
"some people just want to watch the world burn. ghandi prefers a nuclear winter.",1
"civ is a really in depth awesome game that is so addictive that i can play it for hours and not realize it.",1
"this game is simply awesome, whole game is just one big high quality strategy fun fest.",1
"great game to play alone or with friends. steam workshop is always adding new things to the mix as well and the dlcs mix up the gameplay",1
"once, it was about 11 oclock on a saturday. i had just finshed downloading civ v the night before, so i decided i would play it. i just kept on playing and playing until i got tired. i thought wow, it feels like ive been playing for 4 hours! i should take a break. so i turned off the game and checked the time. it said 5:34 am. i had just played for 18 hours sraight without eating. 9/10",1
"this game is awesome! i sat there for 6 hours and it felt like 15 minutes. also im friends with the one more turn logic so i keep saying ill play one more turn, but that turns into 30 or 40 or 178... must buy this!!!!",1
"great game, effectively endless replay value. can choose so many paths for your civilization to follow. well worth getting",1
"a great game. civ 5 is the perfect way to spend countless hours if you are someone that likes strategy.",3
"civilization 5 and its expansions are the best game for strategist to date. there is tons of gameplay with the different ai levels. its easy to get into as a newbie and also alot of difficulty for the experinced. i played obver 800 hours of this game because its the perfect strategy game of 2013 (brave new world)",5
"fun for the whole family until ghandi points his nukes at you",1
"i recently got this game, i was expecting myself to never get the hang of it but holy jesus! i really cant stop playing its impossible to stop, i got the hang of it perfectly in at least 4 hours which is very good to understand every little thing thats in the game. its the first time ive ever played the franchise and its good i popped in at this stage in the franchise. might i add... the best part of the game is going past 2013 :d 10/10",1
"this is civilization at its best and over time it will ripen like a fine wine and become a masterpiece. 2k games have outdone themselves in making some massive changes without changing the core gameplay and alienating their fans.",1
"one of the best games i ever played, bring many hours of fun and despair.",1
"you wont be able to just have one more turn, you fool",1
"civilization v is an amazing game, i would totally think about getting it! gods and kings adds some more content but brave new world is a game changer! some of the negative traits are obviously the price of the game, its going to leave a hole in your pocket. 9/10",1
"this game is very fun and can be played in many different ways and almost everything is customasable, so it is a very good game too play with friends.",1
"been a fan of the civilization series since civ ii, and v doesnt disappoint. it has its issues, yes, but overall its a credit to the series.",1
"theres a playable world leader called kamehameha, nuff said nerds",1
"put lots of time into this game, every game is different and keeps me going back for more.",2
"great game, but you really need both expansions to get the real deal",1
"all the perks of running a tyrannical dictatorship without the inevitable assasinations and civil wars!",1
"challenging with the focus not necessarily on war which is a nice change for a strategy game. multiplayer can give you hours of fun.",2
"i want to play as hitler not bismark.  would go down so differently",1
"very well done game, everyone should be playing this!",1
"wow contol states such graphic so bnw such g&k wow",2
"catherine ed a horse. gets double quantity from horses. 10/10 realism. dont trust ghandi. doge. doge. doge. venice.",2
"if you hate seeing the outside of your room and want ghandi to ing kill your  with nukes and tanks this is the game for you",1
"for the people that think this game may not be for you i was the same way and when i first played it i thought it was a waste but as you progress through the game more and more it gets a lot more enjoyable and im hooked on this game now. worth your money !",1
"if you know how to play civ then this should be an easy game for you new mechanics if you played the older civs but this is a great game if you understand what your doing",1
"friends with nutella the hun. backstabbed from ghandi. gets  by spanish inquisidors. 10/10 would bang again.",2
"great game, always loved civ games. i was very glad to see civ5 beeing released on linux. it worked great for a few months, however recently the game started crashing while playing and that is a pitty. crashes are not very common maybe every 2 - 3 hours. neverless it would be great if it would not crash at all :)",2
"once you get used to the new way things work compared to civ 4 its a lot of fun!",1
"so freaking addictive! amazily fun game that anyone can get into.",1
"my high-end military rocket artillery unit just exploded because of an arrow that hit it. 10/10",1
"very good i like being nazis it takes me back ah ww2 what a fun time",2
"just one more turn, dont worry, then ill write this review",2
"very good bit of a time steeler tho look at clock it 8pm then look back wat feels like 10min its 2am lol",1
"i was led to believe that ghandi was a peaceful person in this game.... he invaded me and then destroyed my citys. 10/10 ghandi is evil......",1
"this will give you tons of fun. very addictive game, the single player is awesome and the multi player is even more awesome. i can promise buying this is not a mistake. # graphics :: 9/10 # sound effects and sound fitting :: 10/10 # story and lores :: 10/10 ### overall :: 9.5/10 - definitely will play again!",1
"i cant play the game. this is the only game i have yet to figure out how to run. it crashes 10 minutes into the game on a 9 month old system.",3
"great game, still needs community support in the form of multi player mods.",2
"this is one of the best startegy games ive ever played. if youre going to get one game, get this one.",2
"this is one of the most fun games i have ever played, but i can not reccomend it until 2k and the mac os porting team fix multiplayer and sudden crashing.",1
"really enjoy this game and if it could add a battle feature like total wars then i would say its perfect.",2
"in has minor flaws but its an otherwise perfect game",1
"i love this game a lot. it not only makes you think about your military but also your economy. i love playing as the japanese and russians.",1
"this game is great, i didnt play the game vanilla much, but with a few dlcs, the game was all i could ask for. single player would satisfy you forever, but multiplayer makes it that much better. fighting or teaming up with you friends can conquer the entire world.",1
"any game i can play for 200 hours without getting bored is worth any price and i got it on sale with all the add ons for total of $40. thats $0.20 an hour for an incredible time. the expansions just added even more incredible change and complexity to the gameplay. it really is an incredible game and everyone should invest, especially given how often this game goes on sale. easy to play, near impossible to master, but fun at any level. 9.5/10, the only reason theres that .5 off is because the mu;tiplayer can be a bit laggy. but with smaller maps this shouldnt be an issue.",1
"amazing game! highly recommend it if you like games where you actually have to think! 10/10",1
"so me and my friend have been playing this game for two days now and i have to say it is pretty sick! but watch out when you make trades online the person can steal all of your things if you are the one who started the trade! i was play playing as khan and he was china and i stole all of his citys and razed them all!!!!!",1
"the city of yer boi has been founded. yer boi has grown! yer boi desires gold! yer boi is starving! yer boi has completed great wall of china! yer boi has completed petra! yer boi is ready for a new construction project. yer boi has adopted a religion! the enemy is near yer boi! yer boi can fire upon an enemy! yer boi is under attack! yer boi has been captured! 10/10 would yer boi play again",1
"the game where you set up a big group game with your friends one night, and then the friends who start falling behind get bored or need to go to sleep, conveniently before their capital gets nuked. 5/5",1
"i dont know how anyone can recommend this game in the state its in right now. multiplayer is broken, completely unplayable. has been for over a month. still the skeleton of a fun game but the ai is very weak (once you get at all good the only way to have any kind of challenge is to play on levels that give it massive advantages over you) so being limited to playing against the computer is lame. save your money until they get it fixed.",3
"my favourite game just get it as soon as u can to start playing",3
"one of the biggest games i ever play, and if you like the strategy, you will enjoy every moment of the game",1
"who needds sleep? napoleon is talking junk, time to kick his derrire!",3
"very fun, very addicting. both dlc brings a lot new to the table i would reccomend getting both. the only problem i hav with the game is the multiplayer. the ai is so ing tame and most because everyone hates losing at basically really long version of monoply nobody ever likes to play. other than that this game is extremely fun, be ready to spend 6-10 hours straight at some point on this game.",2
"this game sucks the hours from my life, similar to that of the machine from the princess bride. anybody want a peanut?",1
"great game, lots of content and huge replayablitiy. some minor problems, not anything to worry about.",1
"i recomend this game if you own atleast one of the expansion if not its a pretty good one, but you get more conetent with the expansions. if you like world map strategy games its the series for you, this game has deep gameplay and mechanics and oh so good multiplayer if you are a strategy fan or civ fan your probably going to like it.",1
"fun, with a lot of gameplay, but you need patience.",2
"i love the civilization lineup and this makes a great addition. they changed the game around a lot from civ 4 but kept how it felt. i enjoy this game and definitely recommend it.",2
"this game is addictive as hell! if you will buy it you will spend the crazy amount of hours to play it. just alone or with friends. this is this type of game which you can play many many times and will be always different. i have played only very old civ 2 which was amazing game. but civ v is just must have for people who love the strategy games. just buy it. you wont regeret it.",2
"absolutely amazing. literally nothing bad i can say about it.",1
"im not even good at games like civ, but civ v has me coming back to it again and again because its just plain fun. ive lost hours upon hours building empires and theyve just flown by. one of the most engrossing games you can buy on steam, but you probably already knew that; it is civ, after all.",1
"one of the best game ever made you will never get bored of it becasue there are so many different things to do",2
"really nice strategy game where you have to think hard about your turns. i like the different ways of winning and the task to pay attention to all your opponents tactics and winning possibilities.",1
"so many hours wasted by just one more click. would recommend to anyone, anytime.",1
"great game. very accurate, lots of strategy, and long matches. turn based game that takes days to complete a match. great dlc and interesting combat. different units and diffeent time periods. on the bad side. opposing leaders dont have much common sense.",1
"this is one of my favourite games it just does everything right in a strategy game",3
"this game is really good. it puts you in place of a ruler and lets you build a civilisation from scratch. its a great experiece and can even be educational. 9/10 ps very addictive approach with caution",1
"i consider this game to be one of those game with extreme value for money its a game that i dont necessarily play every day, but once in awhile i will come back to it and play for a few hours, play something else for awhile, then come back to it its quite solid despite few mechanical issues (come on, no way to stop missionaries? ai hating you for no reasons?), but at the end of the day, very enjoyable, highly recommended for those who enjoyed civilization series",1
"really nice game if you have time to play it ... just one more turn... and more enjoyable with a group of friends",1
"civilization v is a perfect strategy game. if youre new to strategy games you will still love it and it offers you hundreds and hundreds of hours for gameplay. multiplyer is amazing too espically with friends. also try to buy the brave new world expansion pack. that will enhance the game and youll play it even more. even the angry army supports this game. (angry joe).",3
"great game, just be prepared to commit a lot of time.",1
"one.....more....turn. incredibly addictive, cant stop playing it.",1
"its a realy fun game if u have the time to play it",1
"gandhi needs more nukes | 9 broken promises out of 10",1
"if you have never played civilization, dont start unless you have a free weekend. before you know it, it will be sunday night and you will be wondering why ghandi hates me so much.",2
"i honest have to admit that once they added gods and kings this game becames one of the very best strategy games i have played. it ranks up there with master of orion 2....really it is that good (with gods and kings).",1
"this game is like heroin for empire builders. it will consume your life. playing multiplayer with friends is 10x more fun. always co-operate with your friend against everyone else, then you must stab him in the back!!!",1
"ever since alpha centuri ive been looking for a simalar game that is more updated and can actually play multiplayer. civ 5 comes close but alpha centuri still wins im afraid but dont think that this isnt an awesome game. it is still one of the best games in my inventory",2
"excellent game for those who want a game with good strategies and many options available. great soundtrack and user interface is very clean.",1
"i bought some games so far from the steam summer sale, but i cant stop playing this.",1
"a great addition to the series, with a lot of fun features and pretty visuals.",2
"not as good as 4 but still amazing. if your going to buy be sure to get the dlc",1
"wow! what can i say about this game? first its so addictive you lose track of time, i would advise getting the dlc gods & kings and brave new world because this is what makes the game and it has great replay value. 9/10",1
"guys dont get this game is you have a life because this game will ruin it.",1
"i cannot even begin to describe how good this game is. download the demo and see for yourself. i played the demo many times through before i bought the game.",1
"4 years later im still playing this and i own beyond earth.",1
"yes, to anyone remotely interested in history, politics and/or strategy games this is a superb game!!",1
"i have been playing this series since civ 1 back in on my amiga 5oo days in the early 90s and if you are into world/civ building strategy titles in any way, shape or form, games just wont come better than this masterpiece, it is immensely fun, totally addictive and returns great value for your money. worth noting is that i have exclusively played vanilla (with the exceptance of purchased official dlc) single player vs ai for civ 5 (i.e. no mp at all) , but judging by previous experiences from earlier titles in the series, i dare guess that mp is even more fun and challenging. add to this the plethora of user created mods via steamworks and you have an almost endless source of digitalized entertainment!! :-) this comes highly recommended as a game with the almost perfect mix of theme, ambience, game mechanics and outright addictive fun.",1
"this game is amazingly addictive... buy it! it has insane replayability, and you can download thousands of addons from the steam workshop to change the game for when (if) you actually do get bored of playing it.",2
"if youre a fan of previous civs or enjoy playing long multiplayer games, i highly recommend against buying this game. while very pretty, civ v is essentially a simplified version of civ iv and has much lower replay value. i can understand the design choices made with this game, in terms of attracting new players and maximizing profits, but it doesnt feel or play like an authentic civilization game; its more of a civ-themed reinterpretation of the genre, aimed at casual gamers. for the price, and having to pay extra for core game features carved into dlcs; this game was not worth my money, nor my time. back to a heavily modded civ iv i go...",1
"this fifth installment really brings my previous civ gaming experiences to the next level. :) as a history and a book lover, civilization 5 brings me to the days of old when nations are still small, wars are constant, where seeds technological development are still being planted and watered for growth, wonders are being constructed, etc. this game gives users the best perspective of seeing how the nations of the world evolve and continues to evolve until now. nice gameplay, superb detail and graphics, plus the accuracy of ai leader personalities (based on history) really gives you that great feeling leading your chosen civilization to glory. the different systems in the game, the religion and espionage (in gods and kings) adds depth to gameplay. it gives the player multiple ways to achieve victory for a civ. i just love this game so much.",3
"i love strategy games. civilization is the leader of the pack when it comes to turn based strategy games and civ v is a worthy successor to the series. the brave new world dlc is a must-have expansion - it feels like a new game, not just an expansion pack. enjoying the broad options with civilizations and their unique abilities allows for much replay. overall - the best turn based strategy game available.",1
"oh my god, how do i start. this game has been a great....how do i say it......game! everything about it, the figernail knawing battles, the amazingly annoying barbarians, the evil spies and their leaders and just ahhh, its such a fun game.i have spent quite a lot of my time fighting my brothers from room to room on this great strategy masterpiece. it puts all of the great game-loving ingrediants all into one big ball of mush, and makes it a great fiction journey, that deserves all of the love that it gets! 10/10 <3",1
"starting with a city and then building your empire. with way too many hours spent on this one later (over 550 hours..) i strongly recommend it to anyone who isnt afraid of a game filled with details!",3
"great game, lots of depth and trusted sid meyers quality. you are not disappointed if you like civ-games.",1
"damn this game is consuming, its like skyrim all over again! :d",3
"whilst this is simpler than civ 4 (especially with all the beyonf the sword expansion) it is more enjoyable to play and retains the depth",2
"awesome strategy game. reccomended to anyone who wants to create their own empire from nothing and then nuke the  out of ghandi.",1
"ever think of what would happen if ghanghi wanted to blow up the world? ever want to pit germany agains egypt? ever wanna make it so the azteks won the space race? well look no further, all this and more can be done in game, not to mention the mod community if massive, to the point of having msf and madoka duke it out over the worlds water. but i digress, this is a great game.",1
"great game whenever it doesnt crash, corrupt your save files, desync, lag etc. perfect if you want to screw over your friends, backstab them or kill their settlers on turn 20 with your scout wandering around. 10/10",1
"as we all know, in 1999, montezuma and george washington fought each other with nukes, both at the age of 3000.",1
"a streamlined civ4 minus the stack of doom. civ5 is the best of the old with the new. 10/10 especially if you have all of the dlc and expansions which balance the game mechanics.",2
"stop. seriously. stop. think about how much time youve got to play. if you have less than six hours, play something that isnt this game. for your own sake.",1
"one of my favorite games of all time. you can literally spend 6 hours straight playing this game. one more turn is what the game is all about. the dlc also makes the game a lot more fun, and there are a lot of cool mods out there if you find the game becomes a bit bland over time.",1
"you actually need to think to be successful. plus, where else can you nuke whomever you wish? 10/10 (and get bnw!)",2
"this game is one of - if not the- best strategy games on steam. its vibrant, exciting, and has near infinite replayability.",1
"this game is by far my favorite. if you dont know already, its a 4x where you control one of historys civilizations from the stone age all the way up to the near future. the main changes from 4 to 5 is the change of square spaces to hexagonal spaces for movement. also, this interation removes the stacking and limits you to one military unit and one civilian unit per hex, so no more stacks of doom. i dislike how in the base game they left out a lot of the features from previous games (such as espionage and religion); however, they add those features back in on the expansions. all in all, the game is addictive and hard to resist the just one more turn syndrome. i would give this a 9/10 with exapansions and a 7/10 with just the base game",3
"if youve ever wanted to see if madoka could take out ghandi and eggman in continental warfare within 8 hours, this is the game for you. the games awesome on its own, the expansions make it better, and the mods make it more enjoyable.",1
"endless hours...endless.. do not play on a work night.",1
"three words best game ever!! great game to kill time.",1
"this is definitely one of my go to games. its given me hours and hours of fun. there isnt as much depth as paradoxs games but there is something about it that keeps making me want to go back for more. the two expansions are definitely worth picking up, especially on sale, as they improve the game by a lot, and add tons of new features. also, screw you ghandi.",4
"when 7:30 in the morning rolled around and the sun told me to call in sick i realized this game is going to be good.",3
"30 mins will turn into 30 hours with this time machine, i promise!",2
"this game is hard strategy turn-based game if you dont patient enough, you cant win it but if you are a freakin mind reader or a master of mind i suggest this game would be nice playing with your friends !",1
"no game has given me more bang for my buck than this one here.",3
"this game is stupidly fun and addictive. on your first night you will be up till 4 in the morning.",1
"dont buy this game. it will eat your soul and take over your life. 0/10.... now if youll excuse me its my turn again",1
"great game with many different strategies and ways to play.",1
"good fun, but is significantly better with expansions, especially bnw. good variety of difficulties; from derpy for newcomers to complex for experts.",1
"this is a great game but steam causes problems with it. i bought this in store and cant play it through steam. i play a cracked copy because the steam version is broke.",1
"george washington built new jersy on top of my busiest road",1
"one of the best strategy, turn-based games ive ever played, but the thing about this game is that it becomes really interesting when you buy 2 dlcs, which are gods and kings and brave new world, without them game looks kinda unfinished. but overall: no dlcs - 7/10 with 2 dlcs - 10/10 would recommend!",1
"i have no doubts that this is the best tbs out there. very addictive, has plenty of replay ability, and gives you something fun to do on those boring, rainy days. and if your not a fan of buying dlcs, or just dont like the dlc for this game in general, you could always get community created in-game civilizations and mods for free. my only complaint is the bug which occurs sometimes when you get late into a game, that causes the whole thing to crash. as long as you save every 5-10 turns near the end of the game, you should be good :) 9/10",4
"honestly one of my favorite games i have played in a long time. my friends and i often play on a team and put the ai on deity, the best way to play.",2
"civilization v is a great game made for anyone who enjoys a good, fun, long term, turn based strategy game.",1
"there is nothing to say but omg this game is amazing, i love it!",1
"it is a amazing game that puts some history into a great stragey game. it adds all new fun to steam.",2
"this game is very fun and i love to play it with my friends",1
"ive been playing civ v for quite some time with friends, and while it has a few glaring problems like  ai that runs units to their death in your citys with no chance of taking it and gandhi and his opness. its otherwise a great time vampire more so with all the xpacks adding sorely needed features like religions in gods and kings and actual trade networks in brave new world. if you have tens of hours to drop into a game per setting this is the game for you as hours just disappear before you know it, you start playing at 3pm and in the blink of an eye its 1am.",1
"played as ghandi, nuked everyone, twice, 5 stars a+ 4 stars!",1
"this game is great for anyone looking to get the most play time and experience out of what theyre paying for.",1
"greece, they randomly produce a persian army in two damn seconds, then they surround the hell out of you by building cities all around you. then, to make it worse, they spam warriors from the ancient era to piss you off.  this game.",1
"the most amazing game yet from the sid meiers civ series! must buy for any gamer.",1
"great game, its something you can play over and over.",1
"very fun game, this game is perfect for you if you love strategic games!",1
"what i would call the best god game, ive played for days and weeks on the older civs and this one is just brilliant as well. 9/10",1
"this game is great. any game you can play just for a few minutes and have 16 hours pass without noticing is a great game.",3

"biggest waste of 50 bucks ever. i have spent hours trying to get this  game to work with no avail. i am getting an error like a million others and there is not fix for it. do not buy or use this service!!!! my first and last time.",1
"gorgeous graphics and deep combat make this a great place to start or renew your interest in global domination.",1
"this game is fun and is a time waster if your bored it will make you not bored so try this game out",1
"this might sound like apocrypha, but when combined with the expansions and dlc, civ v has become my favourite game in the series. the gameplay mechanics and additional civilizations added by the expansions and dlc make it a rich and rewarding experience. i have a particular soft spot for the aesthetic style of the game, which feels like a beautiful board game. ive spent many hours playing this installment and dont regret a second of it.",2
"at this point in time, this is my second favourite game, of all time. this game is nigh upon the perfection of turn-based strategy, beautifully constructed, this will completely envelop your time, should you enjoy the game, with i find highly likely. thus far ive been unable to amount many hours, but i can assure you, that will change. the expansion packs for the game add massive amounts of content, that only serve to make this already magnificent game better. recreating history reaches its pinnacle in this masterpiece. buy it. play it. live it.",1
"george washington offered one of persias captured cities and all of his goods before i nuked his major cities for the 15th time.",1
"this game is a huge time-sink, and for all the right reasons! each game you play, wether multiplayer or against the excellently done a.i will provide hours upon hours of strategic challenges and an excellent system of micromanagement. with the several different victory conditions and tons of different civilizations to play (each with their own unique bonuses, units and buildings) this game caters for every possible strategy. definitely a recommended game - civ 5 is a great play for veterans of the series and for newcomers.",2
"a pretty accessible grand strategy game. it has improved a lot over the years, and the a brave new world expansion, has made the game a lot more entertaining. be aware, however, that this game takes away a lot of your time!",1
"the game has its share of ups and downs, but with the addition of g&k and bnw, it really shines. i like the endless options that you can choose to play with, and the endless ways you can play each civ. overall, i would recommend this game to anyone with a lot of extra time on their hands. when its full screen, its easy to lose track of time!",1
"great strategy game, very fun to play with friends.",1
"if you like civilization this is a definite keeper!",1
"while not a grand strategy game on a par with paradoxs stuff, it will still scratch any itch you have for turn-based strategy. you will also sink more hours into it than youre proud of (you will be a little proud).",1
"you assume the role of one of many great european/asian leaders to your ultimate goal. there is one goal only and that is to eradicate minorities with different means of said eradicating. you may pursue four different paths. you can dominate the sandpeople with your highly advanced weapons. you mayshow them that european/asian culture is supreme. you can trick these fellows into letting you lead the world, trough diplomacy. or the most logical, trough science. they only live in huts, right? buy this game if you enjoy bashing minorites, making fun of religion (create your own by using existing religious symbols and then rename it, hilarity ensures) and use nukes. 11/10 like age of empires with guns",2
"an extremely good fifth version of this series. more leaders, more units and some fantastic scenarios.",2
"an amazing game, great graphics, and an easy to learn layout. its one of those easy to learn, hard to master games. if you are a fan of turn based strategy games, you must get this game. but the at the highest level you will lose if you have no idea what your doing. but still an amazing experiance! 9.7/10 : non-stop fun!",1
"tenouttaten highly recommend not a fan of strat games myself but this game is fun i played it for 2 days straight got one of the worst nose bleeds of my life passed out for 15 mins and woke up being weld to the ambulance turns out i was dehydrated but thats not important the point is this game is awesome itd make yo momma say dammit kyle youre going to kill yourself playing these video games nonstop you need to sleep! highly recommended",1
"the time flies when i play this ! super recomended!!!!",1
"if! you like long, in depth games, this is for you! if! you dont like long, in depth games, this is not for you! simple as that... im pretty neutral on this game honestly. it is a fun game. but it takes a long time to figure out how to do everything. i still dont know how to do everything in the game, and i dont even know what everything means (or does). it is incredibly in depth, which i typically enjoy. however; it is quite enjoyable...to a point... i was playing a solo campaign with 6 nations total (me, and 5 ais)... 14 hours later i won... this game takes forever to play through.",1
"got this from sid meier humble bundle. not a big fan of world builders, but unexpectedly had an extreme amount of fun playing it. you should get it if you get the chance because you will spend massive amounts of time playing it.",1
"found first oil as arabia, got attacked by america; they pilliged my oil and got out. 10,000/10 for realism",3
"great game,great strategy and very (extremely) addicive as history becomes your creation and you expand your little nation.",3
"with all the dlc and amazing care taken to make this game the masterpeice it currently is has paid off. this is a must play for any fan of strategy games.",3
"overall a very well made game, however the lack of ilunits unique to single civilization (more than 2) makes it so that it really doesnt matter what civ you choose. and therefor just makes it more about what colour you like your borders rather than strategic picking.",2
"civilization v is best enjoyed with the complete edition as it includes several new leaders / countries, religion, and balances to the game. this grand strategy has taken plenty of my hours away in both singleplayer and multiplayer; and is far better than beyond earth. this is easily the definitive civilization game if you want to get a group of friends together to conquer others.",1
"this is a very fun and entertaining game that i highly recommend. civ 5 has almost infinate replay value with a whole new experience every play through. i do admit though, the ai in the game can be a little wierd at times, but it is always amussing to see a leader like gahndi become a dictator and attempt to conquer the world. so in conclusion, i would hghly recommend this game for any person that finds turn-based strategy games interesting and fun.",2
"very good game, even though a bit difficult to understand for people new to the civ games.",1
"the huns are jerks, every game with random civs they are next to me and they have an uncanny talent of shoving battering rams up my behind.",2
"amazing graphics, great gameplay....what else can i say?",1
"must buy... i find myself playing for hours when i orginally planned to only play maybe an hour or so. the complete edition is worth the cost difference.",1
"best strategic sp game ive played in a long time. worst strategic mp game ive played in a long time.",2
"i played this game since the first release and im happy to say that the game is ing great :) hope for more expansions!!",2
"i dont have enough money for the expansions, but i play this game a lot. gift me if you love jesus, if notyou are an obvious satanist.",2
"i lost 4 hours in what seemed to be 15 minutes, what else can i say.",1
"although it may fail at simulating history, civilization v makes it up for being a deep and highly addictive turn based strategy game. if you only have the base game, the game will have some rough edges and frustrating features, but both gods & kings and brave new world improved the game so much that it made itself one of my favourite games of all time. the many options and resources this game has may overwhelm anyone who is new to the game or the genre, but all these options give an immense amount of fun and unique strategies that makes every game unique. together with an always randomly generated map and ai opponents with all different strategies, causes this game to never bore and wish you could play this game till deep in the night.",2
"none of my friends want to play this game with me anymore, which is a shame becauase this is a beast of a multiplayer, if your lucky enough to have cooperative friends, cherish every moment with them in this game...",1
"trust ghandi. as in trust that he will stab you in the back if you dont kill him first. warlord ghandi simulator v.",1
"another improvement on the classic civilaztion series. this version is better looking and more playable that the last few. the changes deemphasize massive stacking of armies making the conquest game much more strategic. im even looking forward to trying out a cultural victory.",1
">am washington >build monarchy >democratic england attacks >still win the battle for independence >all hail king washington",1
"this is an excellent game. buy it twice, just so you know whats what.",2
"strange to not recommend this, given the countless hours spent playing it, but it has many annoyances that sid meier (or whoever) needs to address. the military aspect of the game remains tedious, as it was in all the previous versions. few of the systems make much sense. why, if you spend lots of resources building big ben but someone pips you to building it first, does your big ben disappear? why can a great artist do a culture bomb? why bother turning your generals into citadels, when opposing armies can just walk round them and you can only stack one unit inside? i could go on. suffice to say, civ needs some more competition.",2
"sid meier does it again with civlization v, all of the realist styled game play you ever wanted to simulate during the cold war. this time with deeper running, espionage, tech tree, religion, and hex combat!",1
"my first game, i played the tutorial. met ghandi, lost the game when he rolled up with tanks. would reccomend.",1
"ill just play one more turn, i swear... well alexander declared war, i guess ill just nip this in the bud before i go to bed... i mean at this point i might as well go for the captial... ooooh the world congress is coming up in 30 turns... wait its 6am.",3
"this game is a big bag of fun. its basicly like a board game, like chess or some other kind of board game. civ 5 is a strategy game and one of the best in my opinion and is deffenetly worth a buy [ps sorry if i spelled something wrong :p]",2
"as a huge fan of games like age of empires, i figured that civ v wouldnt be much different. i hadnt played any of the other civ games when i jumped into civ v, and boy did i love it. the game play is lots of fun and there is good level of strategy involved, though the difficulty is easy to control when starting the game. there are so many options and variety that its almost impossibly for me to get bored. most fun is the ability to play with friends. nothing says friendship like attacking with the full force of your military! :d",1
"why be yourself when you can be ghandi, making india the global superpower, win",1
"game is a lot better than civ4 but its still not civ3. game lost half of its complexity and ai is just braindead. but game is really enjoyable nonetheless.",1
"10/10 civ 5 is an addictive game of strategy... psshhh i really dont know much about games. but this one is really fun. its challenging, and there are so many different ways to win (although nothing really beats just killing everyone else off). if you feel like dominating the world, this is the game for you :)",1
"a great play for those who are willing to stay on the same game for hours and hours. the game itself has tons of replayability, and has some great, well priced expansion packs that add even more stuff to the game.",1
"always a good time, i go back to it for a civ binge at least once or twice a year.",1
"warning: if you play this, you will never be seen again!",1
"1 of my new best games, its a must have game in my opinion!",1
"extremely addicting. i find myself saying one more turn and before i know it ive played 50 more turns. its better when you have brave new world, gods and kings, and all the dlcs. if you see a sale, jump on it quick. paying full price is worth it, but not recommended. just....one.....more...turn.",1
"until they fix this game i will not recommend this game! once their new games come out the seem to leave thier old games behind.",2
"fun stratergy game to play! would definetly recommend to a group of players :d",1
"just one more turn. oh, you thought you were gonna play for 15 minutes? nope, youre playing for 15 hours.",3
"this game is greatly time consuming which would be the only real flaw to the game if you were to ask me. overall the gameplay is smooth and is fun, really wish you could make the game a bit more fast pace and the fact there was no single player story line was kind of dissapointing. great time waster if you need that, is really fun in multiplayer and single player. great variety of playable historic people.",1
"how to play: 1. kill gandhi 2. kill gandhi 3. kill gandhi thats it. nothing else.",1
"hitler, stalin maybe mao. when you enter this game, basic history education will have tried to teach you that these people are naughty men. of course, you never could, because they were dead. i f you really want to hate historical figures this is the game for you. ujust remember... ramkhamhaeng is an !",5
"for strategy games, this one takes the cake, and eats it too. the modding community is strong with this one, every game is different, no two are alike. multiplayer is nice, and with final update smooth, enjoyable experience all around. if youre into building up a civilization from the ground up over the course of 6500 years, making diplomatic decisions with other empires, whilst protecting yourself from barbarians and finding ancient ruins all in the process, this game is for ye.",1
"this is an absolute must for any gamer who uses their computers with any kind of regularity. a lot of intricacies of previous games has been removed (unit stacking) with out diminishing its depth of detail. each expansion pack is worth every penny adding a whole new way to play the game from religion in gods and kings, to trade and tourism in brave new world. civilization v deserves a place among the worlds best regardless of genre.",2
"for those interested in history and strategy this is the the best turn based game on the market.",1
"one of the best civ games out there, i wont debate with you why i think its one of the best, but i will concede that its has to be at least in the top 3 sid meier games. i dont think i have to explain why i love civilization games, i mean civ 1 came out in 1991 and sid meier has been making games since 1982 (thanks wikipedia for having a sid meier page) overall civilization games have been one of my favorite strategy games out there and i hope that the upcoming civilization: beyond earth (can anyone say alpha centauri?) is also a smashing success!",1
"you may have heard jokes regarding this game and its ilk that go something along the lines of just one more turn oh hey its 6am. you are mistaken. those are not jokes.",1
"love this game, but brave new world dlc is needed.",1
"this game is a really enjoyable game for those people that have the time, it does take a while and has a deceent learning curve but it is extremely enjoyable and also a bit of a learning experience at the same time.",1
"what the hell! i have played civ iii for long time, i have not playde civ iv, so i dont know what thats like. first thing i see, is that starting a game is simplified a lot. then i start a game, what the f*ck, why is here this stupid guide telling me that i should build a city, why, no other civ game i have played had sh*t like that! i dont need no guide, and if you cant play without a guide, you should not play a complicated strategy game. then i tried to manage my city, but the managing thing was simplified too, i could not do anything else than choose what to build, also, i heard i have less than 2 citizens. do not buy this game unless you want another casual piece of garbage! [edit] that was my first reaction, this is actually really good game when you turn off guides and stuff.",1
"civ without dlc bad... civ with dlc? best game 434343443434344/1 buy now",1
"im not sure why civ v gets such a horrendous rep from the civ community. it took all the unncecesary elements from past civ games (like religion and stacked combat units for example) and either streamlined them or got rid of them altogether. that makes the game less of a slog as far as im concerned. civ v is still part of the civilization series no matter how much people want to complain about it, and it still plays like a civ game. in other words, civilization is still the watermark for turn-based strategy games, and no amount of tweaking or nerfing is going to change that.",1
"make me forgot to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner...",1
"it feels like i just lost 20 hours overnight, and i loved every second. ready for another go and its only been a few days. this is addiction.",1
"the latest entry to the best turn-based strategy game series of all time, civilization v delivers the goods and implements new gameplay while still remaining true to the series. great game: 4.5/5",1
"highly recommend this game. if you love strategy this is for you! you find yourself saying just one more turn. the game really needs both expansion packs to complete the game, it is pretty bare without them. good points nice graphics great fun lots of possiblities decent turotials lots of great mods bad points the mulitplayer is fun but badly coded it is very hard to fing the right difficulty some civs are imbalanced the community isnt great overall a really great game 8/10",1
"grand strategy of the finest ilk is reinvented once again. takes a bit of getting used to for veterans of the previous games, but once adjusted its just as deep and complex as the series name demands. two excellent expansions open up yet more options. **warning** - this game will eat your evenings & weekends with the series trademark one more turn compulsion",1
"so this game needs to be reviewed as it is one of the greatested experiences ive ever had in gaming. this game is smooth and true to the franchise in every way. the dlcs add and change so much they almost feel like a whole new game. civ 5 brings to the table a fantastic turnbased experience that i can sit down and play for hours. trial and error, new straegies, different paths you can take will completely changed how the game will turn out. smart ai adds to the games sense of running a real country in a real world. the single player on its own makes this game great but like many other games nothing beats playing it with a friend. if you have the money i reomend picking this game up with all its dlc its well worth a look.",1
"i get to play as the roman empire and go to war with 3 different germanies at once. 10/10",1
"its really good, despite it being a turn type of game, it is very fun and addicting to play <3 especially with friends",2
"have you ever wanted to nuke china for no reason at all? well now you can. -ign 10/10",1
"civ 5 is a brilliant game, it fun with friends and over all a really good game, but if your going to buy it i reccomend getting brave new world with it.",1
"if you have the patience to build an empire from the ground up, then you will enjoy this game. highly addictive with multiple intriguing ways to win. strategy is needed and having a few friends play with you is an absolute blast. however, the two main expansions (gods & kings / brave new world) are a must-have. the game would feel incomplete without them because they really do add a lot.",1
"this game takes hours before you can finish the whole thing as one person. there are more than one leader you can pick from. this game is fun overall!!!!",1
"as a mind games lover i highly reccomend this game even if you one of the people who dont love looking up for many tutorials and guides to play a game. this game briliant once you play it you cant get enought as some one who made more then 10 saves atleast and still every new game is more crazy then the other just the felling from making your first city with one population all the way to a huge empire with an advanced army. i highly reccomend this game to everyone no metter what types of game you love action,adventure or any other type this game is fun for everyone.",2
"one of the best turn based strategy games i have ever played, each game will be different and unique to its map and a.i. personalities.",1
"i told myself id get off after one more turn. ive been playing for 10 hours straight. 10/10",1
"played as george washington. built the great wall of china and stongehenge. wouldve built the terracotta army too if ghandi didnt get to it first. 10/10",1
"this game is great as it is fun and teaches you a bit about each civilization, it is also good because its not an easy game which makes it more fun as you have to overcome the difficulties.",1
"great addition to the civ franchise. brilliant strategy based game. :)",1
"this is an excellent investment, if you enjoy single player turn based strategy games. its better than any previous civilization game, and the only thing it is lacking is playable multiplayer. the mulitplayer just takes far too long to play a game. its meant to be a single player game. its a deep and complex strategy game with a fun atmosphere. i will be playing it from time to time until the next civ game comes out. the only alternative to this that i would recommend as far as turn based is civilization revolution for consoles. its not nearly as deep but if you like multiplayer more than single, then you can play a game of civ rev in a reasonable amount of time for mulitplayer. this game is one of my top 5 favorite games.",1
"what can i say about this game? if youve ever played previous iterations of this game (i started with civilization ii), then youre probably already addicted and own it. for newcomers, i think firaxis have done an amazing job simplifying the ui and providing useful prompts for new mechanics as they appear, so this is a great version to start with. even with the simplifications, all the depth youd expect from this game is still there and you can expose it easily (the city management screen for example). with the gods & kings and brave new world dlc, firaxis have made what i think is by far the most entertaining civilization yet! so, to summarise: buy this game if you have any love for strategy and a w streak. just be prepared to lose entire days to it.",3
"this is a great game, it has loads of replay-ability. the game never gets old, except for gandhi. gandhi is the worst.",1
"civilation 5 is a game that says what it dose multple ways to win all sorts of countries to play as trade routs with other city states/civilations and happynes",1
"this is my go to game when i am not directly playing anything else. plotting the downfall of my enemies is enjoyable if slightly worrying. its a bit slow for me, however, i am still pretty new to rts games.",1
"without side thoughts best turn based strategy game ever created, you nead to use your brain here.",1
"it is awesome. especially if you like strategy games and are a history nerd.",2
"a very,very fun strategy game. you can start out from the ancient era and gradually move up to the mysteries of the future era. this game will surely get you addicited, not to mention its multiplayer however one thing that puts me abit down on the multiplayer is the no animation effect and sometimes the netcode but its not unplayable. in terms of graphics, it has been extremly improved since civilization iv, id say a decent rig should be able to run this game maxed mid-range gpu to high-end.",1
"i have played civilization since it was first released, the latest version has got to be the ultimate in strategy gaming. it is easy to get lost in this game, where you control most every aspect of creating your own unique civilization from the ground up! definately a casual game, yet with complexities that can and will rob you of endless hours!",1
"civilization v is one of those few games that is enjoyable whether youre playing alone, with friends, with people you dont know or even passing it around with people at your house, its just a fun game. the amount of different scenarios that can happen is infinite, and as you progress you have this feeling of being a world leader, which is very satisfying and is something i have never seen delivered successfully in a game. you can be what you want, whether it be a nuclear war-lord, or a peace-seeking nation the game is always fun. you can choose to start at the beginning of civilization, and a huge selection of different iconic eras such as the medieval, renessance, ancient, etc. or you can even start in modern times, or in the future to come. every game you play lays down new options of how you want to go about doing things, keeping it fresh and fun. a great investment.",1
"i really enjoyed this game. cant wait for beyond earth.",1
"played civ 4 and revolation and by far civ 5 is the best one yet :)",1
"the phrase time flies when youre having fun, can never be fully understood until one plays this game. sit back, start a game, and watch two weeks fly by like nothing.",3
"nothing you can do will stop him, nothing!!! he will continue his advance into your sanctum. he will murder your children and  your woman. he will tear down your petty walls and leave you with nothing, but shame. all hail the eternal glow, for it is gandhi destroyer of worlds!!!",1
"there are times im existed and cant stop playing, then there are times when im bored out of my mind and still cant stop playing.",1
"convienient that the game worked on the free weekend, however when i buy it multiplayer is buggy and unplayable! great game when it works, however in its current unplayable state (multiplayer) the game isnt worth buying if you want to play with friends :( been this way for weeks and no patch! only rating negative, because imo the game just isnt worth buying at this stage.",1
"very addictive lost alot of time on this enjoy the early stages seaching the world and get new stuff can be annoying when u haveto get 25 citys to all bluid buildings",1
"really fun game for war strategy and on top of that it gives alot of interesting facts from that time",1
"one of the best games ever.. i recommend buying it only if you buy the complete version.. otherwise it might feel, unfinished.",2
"this is not a game for everyone, its not fast paced at all and it can take some time to learn. but if you can enjoy a slow paced strategy game then this is the game for you, there is a lot too it and if you and a group of friends decide to sit down and play this for a day then you will probably have a pretty good time. id rate this a acquired taste out of 10, its not for everyone but if you can enjoy it then you will really enjoy it.",2
"very fun, very addictive, though ive only played the game with the brave new world expansion pack added, which apparently makes it a whole lot better than vanilla, according to some friends. grabbing both together can set you back a pretty penny so if youre interested, id recommend picking this one up when its on sale. its a great blend of peaceful and tense that really keeps you in the game, be it leaning back in your chair or on the edge of it.",2
"this is where strategy, tactics and the power of your mind comes into actionm this breathtaking new addtion to the series is the best, most powerful and well done game to hit the pc yet, also reccomend the civ revoultion along with teh spectacular new dlc gods and kings which starts to bring a whole new aspect of endurance reations and quick thinking into your own world, your own hero, you are the leader of the revoultion of strategy gaming at its best...",1
"this strategy game stays the king in this genre for a reason. once you take some time to understand its simple core mechanics, it becomes oh so dangerously addicting. i could blame this game for numerous wasted weekends and some nights with no sleep, but i cant. i had too much fun running my own little civilization experiments at increasing difficulty levels, and having so much fun. one peace of advice: a good pc is recommended, because the wait times between turns can get annoying, especially at the late game.",2
"very enjoyable for hours of fun (literally). i only played this game yesterday and today, i already have 5 hours on it! i like strategy games, but this has to be my favorite yet. i have civilization iii (and enjoyed it), but this is even more fun with enhanced graphics and techniques. i havent tried online yet, but i am going to stick with single player for now.",1
"its a civilization by sid meier what can i say? best strategy game out there, very recomended for playing with friends. - buy multiple copies of civ v - start a lan party - buy lots of snacks - first few hours building and expanding - then all out war - game over ghandi massacres everyone - cry - go home and realize a day has passed - cry some more",1
"never thought any game could suck most of my life away more than tf2, boy was i wrong. 11/10 note: i recommend also getting gold and brave new world.",2
"got to play the game during steams free period. i was a long time player of civ iii. getting the chance to play civ v even without the dlc was a good thing. i spent 24 hours in a single game over the course of two days. always had to get that next turn in. the only negative i can think of is in the interaction with other countries. not really a negative but it is a different experience than civ iii and tooks some time to get use to. never did find a means to perform any spy tactics. overall i enjoyed it. i was set to win by score, culture or space. the space ship managed to be built first.",2
"very indepth and challenging lots of fun, a good way to pass the time.",1
"seriously amazing game; improves on the series in every way. one unit per turn is a hot topic, but imho makes the game less tedious. strategy must-have; this is the current 4x benchmark.",3
"i opened the game and didnt close it for the next 10 hrs... this game is awesome! i play alot with 2-3 friends and it is great to just chill with while building your empire and making your grand strategies to take down your enemies. civ 5 has so many different elements to it that it is hard to understand at first if you have not played a civ game before it but when you begin to understand the game you can scratch the surface of what the game has to offer. great game, would recommend playing with friends and getting the brave new world expansion at least.",1
"very good game once you learne the basics. will definately keep you up late its hard to stop pressing the next turn button.",1
"what can i say...ive played so much this, that i have the menu song stuck on my head.",1
"i am a bit older and played civ 1,2, and 3. i had to buy this on the summer sale. it started off a bit hard for me as it has changed a lot. but i am already hooked again. cant reco enough.",1
"played as hlaalu helseth and expanded the kingdom of morrowind. at least untill george jerkington came round....",1
"this is a fun strategic game that will give you hours of fun gameplay for you and your friends.",1
"great game. long hours of fun. easy to learn. pros: fun replayable different every game ai has relative smart thinking process long hours of gameplay con: long hours of gameplay (very hard to play less than 1-2 hours)",1
"okay, not completely sure what all this stuff about getting nuked by ghandi is, but this is a great game. please get it.",1
"if you dont have this game... just get it. it is one of the most entertaining games i have played in years, and i know its kinda pricey compared to alot of steam games but i am 25 hours in and have no intention of stopping",1
"if you are a fan of the civ series then you will probably like this game.",1
"10/10 played on hardest difficulty, with 5 gandhi ai. nuked 5 times on the same turn.",1
"ther r building n persons they kill enemy. much fun and friends",1
"this is one of my favorite games on pc, its for every gamer out there.",1
"ive wasted so much time on this game. which is totally a good thing",3
"a great addition to an already fantastic series. interesting new system based around hexagonal movement. interesting twist on an old favourite.",2
"this game may take a long time to complete once you start it, but i would go through with it. great game, lots of fun and strategic options.",1
"more casual than its predecessors, but also more fun and easier to get into. dont expect much in the way of online play as the servers are terrible, as a single player strategy game though its easy to lose days playing and not be bored. bretty gud.",1
"great strategy game that gets better with each release. my initial impression was that a lot of features were simplified, but after several playthoroughs the strategic heart of civilization proved itself alive and well. just one more turn, is alive and well here.",1
"this game is a turn based strategy title based on actual history. it makes learning history fun as you take control of countries as far back as the ancient era and rule them in your own way.",1
"countless hours spent re-assessing current versions of history. never new ghandi was such a war-mongering little  until i played this game. also  germany. 8/10 replayability.",1
"you play as the undisputed dictator of your own nation in this fantastic national socialist germany simulator, you win can through other methods like diplomacy but thats no fun.",1
"great game, one of the few games where the ai on emperor can beat me. lots of updates fixes and such. pvp is epic.",5
"everything in civ v is prettier than past versions. not saying that that is a good thing though. ive played well over 500 hours of civ iv. i cant really seeing myself play this that much. religion and espionage arent very intuitive nor is the defense of religion. the social policy trees are neat but feel almost too monty hall. in civ iv if you changed from one policy to another you lost its benefits. civ v you maintain all previously accomplished policies. moving a massive army across continents is slow and cumbersome and takes away from the game play. i still like the game, but this is not the civilization ive been playing since civ 2. update: january 5th, 2014. i havent played this game since i wrote this. i love this series, but this game just let me down so much.",1
"amazing game! can spend hours on it. strategy strategy strategy.",1
"great game but i got a new computer and dont no how to install it on there",2
"the game, without expansions, is fairly bare-bones, but it is well-designed and highly replayable for what it is.",1
"amazing game if you like turn-based strategic gameplay. gets way better with the expansions though, vanilla is fun but lacks a lot of gameplay elements that are added by g&k and bnw.",1
"really fun tbs game. fan of all the civs and this one is great! i have the gold edition with the gods & kings pack. gives tons of playable characters!",1
"first game played: ghandi became ally ghandi then declares war with everyone else on continent forced to fight in wars for ghandi my army decimates everyone, while ghandi doesnt use a single troop ghandi declares war on me when we are the last two left ghandi is an  in civ games... great game, ais have political intrigue, ive only played this and civ iii so i cant speak for the others",1
"great game, love it! best turn based empire building games i have ever playd.",2
"there hasnt been a civ game that i havent played. this is one of my most favorite strategy games of all time. countless hours have been played through the years on the series but civ v has promoted itself to a special place in my gaming library. i cannot recommend that game enough. in fact it would be a great game to begin learning on rather than going through each of the other games. there are a few issues with this game though. it is a huge resource hog and will tax your computers hardware. especially after long periods of gameplay. multiplayer sessions can become corrupt and it is recommended to save as often as possible. even with those issue you should get this game. and all the dlc.",2
"this game has stolen my soul. yet i cant seem to make myself mind.",1
"still flaming mad about spending 13 hours on a campaign just to have the huns convince everyone to attack me. it is a great (albeit time consuming) strategy game. im interested in trying the turn by turn play. 9/10",1
"said i was gunna play for 10 minutes,ended up playing for 10 hours",1
"this game is amazing. when i first bought it, i played for 12 hours straight, crushing all enemies in my path. it has fantastic multiplayer. my only negative is that the games expansion packs are more expensive than they should be.",1
"incredibly enjoyable strategy game with multiple ways to win and even an included multiplayer. downsides: multiplayer has a memory leak that took creative custom patching to fix (as i did not have the brave new world expansion) and play with friends. there is no real single player campaign mode.",1
"this game is great, just dont be dissapointed when it is impossible to win without a war as the ai seems to have either mood swings or multiple personality disorder. you can shower them with gifts or trade non-stop with them but as soon as your borders are visible from theirs or you have a weak military they will pounce on you without hesitation. they even say backstap in the dialogue box, this annoys me as i want to play the game nicely but very few of my friends have the game and random online matches often have dlc which i do not. im sorry about this mini rant, this game is fabulous and the repeatability amazing but seriously if you want to play vs ai peacefully get a mod.",1
"very good rts game, probably the best out there but coe needs to click the  next turn button first",2
"you will start playing this game at 4pm next thing youll know its 4am. this game is awesome and while its not fast paced its a great attention holder. just dont play it if you have importain things to do the next morning.",1
"alexander the great wont quit asking to put embassys in my city. -10/10",1
"very enjoyable and flawless game that is a perfect time sink. defo buy if you have the chance too.",1
"if you give somone 1000 gold they go to war against your country dont give strangers gold kids",1
"i havent been able to stop playing, even though its basically a game of who can be the biggest force of colonialism and imperialism. it has taken my soul.",1
"this game is amazing. when i first bought it, i played for 12 hours straight, crushing all enemies in my path. it has fantastic multiplayer. my only negative is that the games expansion packs are more expensive than they should be.",1
"just... cant... stop... playing... one... more... turn... then im going to bed/work/eat",1
"great game but it will be nice if you get a new leader with units and a bonus everytime your first one reaches its death",2
"i played the previously sid meiers civilization 3 as well as this one. i love this game obviously. it is like playing chess but with your civilization at stake. but it is not really realistic because the historicial figures are who they are, not who you are. like for example, some of the famous warlord like genghis khan achieved his empire by letting his mongel enemies join him or die, and the roman empire expanded not because of its army but because of the use of making roads that made it easier for the roman soliders to march on in caesars conquest. the game would be made more challenging if the world leaders were forced to follow their ways rather than change with the todays thoughts on the success of civilization building. if only if we could renact history and see if the gamers could create alternative historical worlds based on the strategies of famous or infamous historical figures.",1
"world domination simulator 2010 100 giant death robots out of 10 giant death robots",1
"ghandi has nukes napoleon a ing crackhead and will declare war on you if you so much fall over rome created the pyramids and america is made up of jews 100% accurate history 10/10",1
"first new release i bought on steam, well worth the money",1
"still incredibly addictive, pleading you to stay up just five minutes more, just to see what happens in the next turn. and the next turn. and the next.",1
"a grand strategy for people who dont have time for real grand strategies.",1
"this game will eat hours away out of your free time so be warned. it is incredibly addicting and has insane replay value especially to those who enjoy multiplayer. it does need to be noted that both expansions, gods & kings as well as brave new world, are extremely recommended. without expansions the game feels not much better than a 7.0/10 but with the expansions (and optional dlc if you wish) it easilly will bring it to a 9.0/10.",2
"simply stunning. not only is the gameplay fun (and quite addicting), this game offers something more than just mindless entertainment: it provides cultural awareness, not only to wonders of the world, but to people who have influenced this world. and the soundtrack is just beautiful. an excellent work of art.",4
"i love this game. except when my friend nukes me after an epic game when im about to win. if this were a review for my friends, itd say not recommended. but its for the game, and for that i easily say thumbs up.",2
"i really like the new civilization. some people were critical because they simplified parts of the game and didnt add anything revolutionary. i think they did a good job of streamlining it while keeping core gameplay elements the same.",1
"a good but stupidly expensive rts (unless you get it on sale) game that was a little over hyped but still very fun and enjoyable if you are a fan of age of mythology, age of empires series and rise of nations series. i like this game for what it is and find myself playing it every now and then. i think there is better rts games out there but this game also has modding support and steam workshop support and that puts it above other games in contrast to replay value and gameplay. also, i find the graphics to be fitting for the type of game and simple to elaborate the beautiful environment from the distictive units. the audio is functional and supportive of what occurs in the game and seems to create a mood well.",1
"the popularity and longetivity of the civilization series kinda speaks for itself, but civ v once again raises the bar for the 4x strategy games genre. the level of customization, of choices given for different kind of experiences makes it the one game i replayed the most. there are many difficulty levels which, at higher levels, give you very challenging game where you need to be a master at geopolitical control and making the best out of all little advantages you got while compensating for your disadvantages. there are many concepts, old and new, that can help you build your civilizations. religion, cultural policies, tourism, happiness, diplomatic relations, trade, sciences, ideologies ... the combinations are almost endless. once again, a civ game i have played (too?) much of !",2
"hello i am a fan of games such as civ games and age of empires etc etc... and i can say for sure this is a good game. i have played it for about 100+ hours, not much for some people but for me it is. at first i experienced some problems with the multiplayer but i think they fixed the problems that could ruin the experience. buy the vanilla civ v and then buy the brave new world if u dont mind not getting some civilizations but if u have the money just buy the gold edition. well thats it, thats one of my first reviews, plz dont kill me. and sorry if i misspelled something, i am portuguese... thank you.",1
"i started playing it was day time when i finished playing it was dark outside sun where did you go?",1
"played as gandhi, nuked england. 10/10 would nuke again.",1
"addictive and fun. its turn based, which allows for multitasking while playing, unless you want to immerse yourself. definitely buy the bigger dlcs as well if youre into strategy games, the smaller dlc packs dont do much.",1
"been a fan of the civilization series since civ ii, and v doesnt disappoint. it has its issues, yes, but overall its a credit to the series.",1
"i didnt think i would like this since it was turn based, but i was wrong. highly addictive game.",1
"stab the ottoman, stab the american, stab the chinese, man it dont matter. in this game you can stab anyone if you get your stabbing points researched enough. easily the best stabbing simulator of the decade.",1
"an amzing example of arguably the best 4x game. also in my opinion the best ever civ, and one of the best games ever made, beautifully done, in one of my favourite genres.",1
"great game with nearly all of the features you love thinking about the classic civilization and many improvements.",1
"easy to play, crushingly hard to master. there are so many ways to play civilization, but once you have mastered it, you can enjoy the delight as you slowly kill all your friends with arrows. in the game, of course. or you can kill them quickly. or with fire. or with nuclear weapons. countless hours of playtime, a great game in whole.",2
"i love this game best civ game out there updates just keep getting better (somehow).",1
"its so awesome. buy it especially if you enjoy strategy games like age of empires or stuff like that. ive played all the civilization games and this one really is amazing.",1
"if you love turn based strategy this is a must own game. the only issue is the game software does not efficiently use the hardware of your system so you need some powerful hardware to play this game on top settings on the largest maps, especially during the late game the lag can become nearly unbearable.",5
"totally not another ghandi nuked my  review. ...ghandi totally nuked my . (its ok, i brought him the freedom he wanted as ol georgie boy)",1
"welcome to time sink: the game. entire civilizations and eons will spawn and die. then suddenly you look up at the clock and realize youre late for your own funeral. theres a save button? no. there cant be. the only save is victory!",1
"this is the first version of civ ive played, and i know now why my husband loves the series so much. completely addictive.",3
"this is by far the best game i picked up during the summer sale. i didnt think i would enjoy it very much, but its been a blast. even though the majority of the gameplay is clicking text boxes and moving along a map--its strangely engrossing and extremely compelling. if you enjoy turn based games this game will likely entertain you for hundreds of hours. put history in a blender, hit puree, and see what comes out.",1
"anyone who likes turnbase action packed build like games you should get this one! i rate 9/10!!!",1
"i will admit this game tested all of my skills as an effective leader and the experience will be daunting for most new players but with some practice (maybe solo games at most) the basic concept and structre of the game will become apparent and easy to master creating an unmatched rts experience. this game recieves the generals recommendation",1
"its pretty good. i like to take it out on the boat with me, but there is no wi-fi out on the water. if youre looking for a boat i would highly reccomend the 430 sports coupe. it comes with the convenience of a walk-thru windshield and sunroof standard.",1
"one more turn and then im done...4 hours later...one more turn and then im done",1
"friends with nutella the hun. backstabbed from ghandi. gets  by spanish inquisidors. 10/10 would bang again.",2
"last time i decided to play a quick game, by the time i quit playing i realized my wife already left me 3 weeks before that!",2
"pretty good game if looking for a long casual game to play through",2
"now with gods and kings, the game has struck a great balance with level of complexity. why others miss the civ 4 stacks of doom is beyond me.",3
"is definitely an engaging game. somewhat hard to refrain from nuking everyone.",1
"this game is a really good strategy game i give it a 8/10.",1
"a wonderful game, but takes some time to play and is addicting.",2
"civilization v is a great game. it vaguley reminds me of a tycoon, but yet so much more! the standalone game is great, but if you get the dlc, you will be supprised how much better it is. overall, i give civ a 4/5. great job, devs!",1
"took a while to get used to as this game is quite different from its predecessor; however, i felt that this is one of the best ever in the series.",3
"just one more turn - dont like to put down any of the civilization games.",1
"fun. unless brazil/aztecs/spain/england/mongolia/etc. then .",2
"a great game that will have you playing for hours. really in depth gameplay will have you conquering worlds in no time. this mixed with all the bonus workshop items (including new civilisations) makes this game a must have.",1
"the pinnacle in round based empire building. spent far too many hours on this one :p",1
"this game is great if you need something to pass the time. i have spent hours splitting time playing the game and doing something else at the same time. at least on the easier levels, once you ramp of the difficulty you really have to think about what each action you do and its effects 20 turns in the future. i only wish that the game would work on directx 11 for me.",2
"great game, the only problem i have with it is that you need to pay for the game 3 times. once for the base game, once for gods and kings, and once for brave new world. it kinda pisses me off that they made us pay for basically updates that made the game complete you cant play the game without at least one of the major dlcs. if your going to release dlc that fix the game at least lower the price to like $10 or somthing not $30 the same price as the base game.",1
"just one more turn! youll repeat this infamous phrase quite often as 10pm turns into a 9am phonecall from your boss as to why you didnt show up at work.",1
"imo they have changed the game mechanics to much and at times (although a good game) it feels like it shouldnt even be called civilization, if you love the game mechanics that civilization has been famous for and grown on from the 1st game play civilization 4 not this one. civilization 5 is a good game but its not civilization as should be!",1
"this game has taken a lot of my time; probably not even close to as much as other people who play this. it is a very accessable game but also can be complexed. i recommend getting the expansions as the final expansion adds more importance to faith and culture. this game can be addictive though. i played 3 playthroughs; by the end of the 3rd night, i had 20+ hours into it.",1
"i have yet to be able to get into this game for real. every time i sit down to play it, im overcome with a wave of apathy towards it. even the gods and kings expansion doesnt save it. dont get me wrong, i like the hex tiles and i dont mind not being able to stack up units like crazy... i just think that as far as civ games go, this one is sub-par.",1
"its like sex. fun with other people but still fun when youre all alone.",1
"one of the best strategy games ever, really fun especially with friends get ready to give all your free time to this game because its really addicting",1
"f*ck this game is beautiful. sure it looks like another strat but the amount of detail brought into the games is mind blowing. the dlc is just as immense, it adds pure and fresh interesting maps for example the earth map that is geologically accurate to the one your standing on. new leaders that you can use to your advantage. plus ghandi (no joke) is your enemy from day one. he will be friendly as stated in real life but theres a bug in his programming that makes him the destroyer of worlds. be very careful with him. five turns at ghandis rate: 10/10",1
"this game is fun when playing against humans. its terrible playing against ai. the npcs are way too predictable and non-threatening. if you build up your military quickly, you can overrun them every time. graphics are better than previous civs, but still just ok. ui and tutorials are good.",1
"great game but only if ur into strategy based games",1
"its the quintessential strategy game. if you love strategizing, then this game is absolutely, 100% for you. if you dont love strategy games, then it is 100% not.",2
"great for someone who loves strategy game, civilization v is a recommended title for someone who loves hanging out with friends, and eventually, nuking the living crap out of them.",1
"if you liked civ 1 or 2 or 3. you likely wont like this game. its like civ 4, but slower and simplfied, and civ 4 is slow enough compared to 123.",1
"awesome multi-player game. lots of fun with friends.",1
"way better than risk. you need friends to play risk.",1
"this is more addicting than sleep! 10 more turns out of 10",1
"this is a turn-based game which you probably already know.it doesnt have the smartest ai.but it has a ton of replay value.tons of fun.if you do buy this game buy the complete edition.ive had the burden to buy most of the content that didnt come with the game.",1
"just one more turn will always last another 3 hours. great game.",1
"this game steals your life... best game... spending atleast 40 hours a week :l",1
"im currently caesar destroying ethiopia in battle. i also push my religion of three-legged man and my beautiful, massive, market onto every neighboring nation. its a good way to spend a week.",1
"i really like the game and think it is really good but my only problem is probably the trade routes. i do not feel like they are efficient enough nor are the roads at times.",5
"a must-have for every strategy fan. diplomacy system is a bit ... meh.",1
"how much more fun can a strategy game get? none! i say when playing this",1
"this game takes a verey long time, and unless you have friends in real lifee willing to play with you, cant be playeed miltiplayer! i recommend it to anyone in stratigy/economic games! its my favorite game on steeam by far, however the time it consumes is annoying at times. be warned a two hour game is short, most are about 5 to 6!",2
"one of the best turn base strategy game of all time!",1
"really enjoy playing this game with friends. only trouble is sometimes there is connection troubles with the civ servers.",1
"it is a ridiculously brilliant game ive played around 120 hours and would not have traded that for time in any other game",2
"fantastic war simulation game, if you do not have it get it, and some friends, and have a great time!",1
"justdownload the demo already. then you can see for yourself why i spent 19 hours on my first match in a single 36-hour period (id be more precise if i could remember; its kind of a blur).",2
"i had burned the cities of my enemies, explored the world, and finally gotten people to wear my blue jeans. until zulu denounced me to everyone because i bought some land on the same continent as him. this immediately threw my relationships with the rest of the world into termoil and turned my allies against me. my only friends to this day are the city-states that were unlucky enough to become caught inside of my great wall. the world burns and the nukes fall on all of their cities, but at least my people are happy because of zoos. 12/10 better than real history. without all the genecide... maybe some of the genecide... yeah, i lied... theres a lot of genecide.",1
"excellent strategy game that is almost impossible to stop playing",1
"i love this game,so many ways to win and lose,get nuked by the ing astecs this is a great game...",1
"this game is so fun! i recommend all of the dlc. they completely change the game by adding a ton of new stuff that will make your experience even better. there are many civilizations to choose from and they all have their unique perks. you can spend hours on this game without realizing it. 10/10 would play forever and ever.",1
"mmmazin, thats all there is to say. one of the best strategy games of all-time, and the only game i know of that is possible to start, and lose track of time completely. very well balanced.",1
"this is a good game for people able to sit down and play it but it takes a decent amount of time i think its a good game",3
"dangerously addictive game. this game makes you sit for hours and forget time. all hours that fly away with sitting on this game is 1337% wurf. could not wish for better strategy game. 133769% must play for people with a brain.",1
"careful with this one ladies and gents... it will consume large chunks of time indiscriminately. you have been warned. ;)",1
"want a game that will keep you busy for hours, maybe not fun but certainly keep you busy... buy this game. wont say its my fav. of the civ series, but its not bad. my issue is with the expansion packs; you pay a lot of money and it never feels like you get much overall for that money. this is one of those cases while the game id buy if want it, id hang about for a sale on the expansions, especially brave new world as thats often more expensive then the actual game. :-/",1
"playing peacefully the entire game. becoming a highly technological civilization. gets invaded by a foreign country. defends borders agaisnt the invaders. gets condemned by the world for being a warmongerer. world congress embargoes me. builds nukes. takes over the world. 11/10 would take over the world cause i was bullied again",2
"really good! hours of enjoyment warning: insanely addictive",1
"civ 5 speaks 4 languages: english, profanity, sarcasm, & real .",1
"a game that, in my opinion, could easily top some of the newer shooters. would reccomend to anyone who likes strategy games and has a sense of patience",1
"civilization is one of the best game that i have played and will ever play! it runs nicely on mac 10.7.5 and the game has so much to offer! i greatly recommend it to everyone! still a pity that the leader cutscenes are on minimum settings, which is unable to change on mac. still.. play this game, youll love it!",2
"this game is a really a good stratagey game and recommend to all",1
"time waster simulator 2010-2013: 150/10 (only if you buy the complete edition) also, if you play with friends who are veterans, and they tell you that venice is bad, go to their home, punch them directly in the face, go back home and play venice. you can also make enrico montoya jokes with you being enrico dondolo as venice venice 1500000000/10 way overpowered, come one blizzard it needs a nerf.",3
"not as great as civ iv but still has that quality feel of a civilization game.",2
"a fantastic game! probably one of the best games since....... sliced bread!",1
"might precipitate dvt, which later may lead to sudden pulmonary embolism and death. that one more turn might after all not worth it, so dont forget to take a 5 minute break every 1 or 2 hours. cheers.",1
"amazing game, just keep in mind everyone secretly hates you, including your irl friends, they will backstab you if given a chance!",3
"this game involves destruction and death! the graphics are amazing. i love this game and i recommend it to all of you hardcore (and patient) gamers! oh, and i think i forgot to mention that this game has destruction and death!!!!!!!!! lol xd",1
"this game is addictive. stupidly. many have complained that the game has had too much taken out to appeal to a wider market. ignore them. the changes are for the most part sensible, and improve the flow of the game. the gods & kings expansion tweaks things further and makes the whole package feel more complete. ok, so diplomatic relations still go south once you get to a certain size - and someone is bound to attack you if you dont so maintaining a strong army is essential and can make it harder to seek other victory types but it isnt a game breaker. im having ridiculous fun after 100 hours and ive barely scratched the surface.",1
"civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have ever played. ive spent hundreds of hours in all the scenarios and the game is enjoyable still.",1
"anyone who is any kind of strategy player this is a must have. with the seemingly limitless mods and ways to play you cant go wrong. very easy to sink hundereds of hours into this game without even realizing it. this game is a must have for everyone.",2
"outstanding graphics and gameplay along with the perfect civilizations this game is really worth the cash and will deliver you the time of your life!!!!!",1
"this is an amazing game. if you like strategy games buy this!",1
"a really nice stratergy game, and can keep you engaged for hours on end",1
"everything you love about civ in a bettter looking package. a few things have changed and at first that frustrated me but one week later i had put 20 hours into the game. just like the good oldays. ^_^ just as addicting as always.",2
"this game is simply amazing. its like playing a board game on your computer and its incredibly interactive with a great amount of detail. and the dlc only make it better and each one is well worth its price. 10/10 would play again.",2
"just like in real life, people in this game hate me for no disernable reason! 9th grade all over again! except throwing spears instead acusations and supicions about my sexual oriantation. 10/10 great low self esteem simulator",2
"amazing game that only gets beter with friends! nuf said.",5
"civ 5 is the best yet! i have logged more than 1000 hours playing this game. enough said.",5
"there are mods you can download for the game. there are lots of fun game enhancing dlcs . you can waste so much time on a single campaign or you can play the scenarios. this game makes you use your brain instead of just reacting quickly. this game can be quite challenging given you put it on one of the higher difficulties. and it is very addictive. probably an 8.510 and there is a new one coming this next year.",1
"like sometimes ytou have to  all over georgew washington but then aids appens and elizabth destroys u",1
"if you have to read a review for this game, its ok. just look at the play times we have. 100+ hours of addictive stuff. warning: not always historically accurate...",1
"a great gae of estrategy, kinda slow, but pretty good, if you like the strategy games of turns, and mltiplayer, then u should buy it, and if ur friends already have it, even better, as its a bit boring playing in solo if you play it online, play it without the animations of battle and movement, it will be a lot faster and less clumsy",1
"continues the civ tradition of being dangerously addictive. fantastic game.",1
"one of the best games i have ever played. ultimate replay value.",5
"premium title that is fun, civ is the standard for turn based strategy games.",5
"i was not expecting to really like this game when i first got it, but i ended up loving it! the turn flow has just enough hand holding to make it simple on casual players, but it appears as though there is also a lot of depth for more hardcore players.",2
"one of my favorite strategy games. worth every penny.",2
"is addicting and fuun... i would tickle sids  for a copy of this game. 11/10",1
"great game if you have 347032 hours to kill. i dont know how many weeks ive spent in real time playing this game but ive only finished 3 or 4 games and still ing love it.",5
"i get to kill any of my citizens that think its a good idea to rebel against me and i get to nuke cities without anybody questioning my decisions. i love dictatorship v, 10/10",1
"a great game for anyone that wants to burn a few hours. its a game of wits and brute strength, forging allies and waging war all to gain a foothold over your rivals. many or few, every game is different with a huge selection of map types and playable factions. i have played multiple runs of this game and still it is my favorite civ from sid so far. im sure ill have many more hours in this game as the acheivment list is 200+. multiplayer has a little to be desired as the matching can sometime take awhile and games tend to get overpowered one way or another rather early on. finding solid players that can last a match is uncommon. with all being said the game is definetly playing.",2
"if you could take your  and  any game... it would be this game.. trust me ive done it, real nice.",2
"its a very good game. very historical civs and technologys. i recommend because i love this game.",1
"a nice strategy game, easy to get into and a smooth learning curve. next to ck2 and eu4 my personal favourite, it is just a bit too simple for me, bu the dlcs can make up for it. each dlc expands the game more and more, making it a deeper experience by the hour, the two best features for the dlcs were religions and steam workshop compability, the creators had some nice thoughts about things they didnt liked and either just buffed or nerfed things.",2
"dont ever say meh! ill only play a few turns!... one does not simply play a few turns.",1
"awesome game, though lacks features that were in the previous games.",1
"amazing. everything! say goodbye to your life. say hello to your new one, in sid meiers civilization v!",1
"just... one... more... turn... actually turns into one... hundred... more... turns...",2
"for some reason no matter how many times i repeat this game, it never gets old. everyone i know who has played it, including me has loved it. just buy it when it goes on sale.",1
"needs more graphic like skyrim. 10/10 because a skyrim mod was make for!",1
"base game has large amount of content and is very good. brave new world dlc added new breath of life into a game that was staring to get a bit boring, would reccomend buying after getting a feel for the game.",1
"i avoided the civ series for years, only recently picking up civ v as part of a humble bundle. wow. what can i say about this game that hasnt been said countless times before? tons of fun and crazily addictive. i was right to fear it and, if you value your free time, you should too.",2
"dont play this game. recommended. 10 out of 0. p.s. beware of gandhi.",1
"an exellent game that takes the player through human history.",1
"people say this is great, and it really is. i just played it properly for the first time and it turned out that i cant stop playing even when i realised its 2 in the morning and i have school tomorrow. this game is additive. playing it is like selling your soul to a devil or something. i dont think i have a life anymore.",1
"if your game doesnt crash you are playing it wrong",1
"easily one of the best multiplayer games ive ever played. single player not rly my thing cuz it gets boring fast but the multiplay with friends is just pure awesomeness would recommend any time 10/10",1
"i started facism in america while germany was practicing democracy. 97% will approve.",1
"awesome game but sieging cities is now so much harder. lol, loved just cruising through like in civ iii but now i have to take siege units in to crack a size 2 city just cos its on a hill. artillery are so useful but b4 that cities kill half ur units every attack.",2
"one of the greatest turn based strategy games which is only made better by the dlc. i highly recommend the game and any dlc that peaks your interest at the very least buy the expansions if you really wanna up the gameplay features.",1
"this game is terrible. ive played civ 2, 3, 4 and 5. for 2, 3 and especially 4, ive played hundreds of hours, and likely a thousand hours for civ 4. civ 5 put me to sleep. i tried. i hated it. dont trust me though. go to amazon reviews, and compare civ 4 and civ 5. common thread for people who like civ 5.... i thought strategy games would be hard, but this was not ... this is the game that taught me to never preorder a game again.",1
"i have sunk so much time into this game since i bought it in the humble bundle. i would recommend it to anyone!",2
"love the game, the graphics, and gameplay. its easy to play and fun. i give it a 5 star rating and a 10/10. anyone who loves strategy games will love this.",1
"nothing like having the aztecs sink your roman aircraft carrier with a nuclear submarine in the year 2100.",2
"great game, even for people who dont usually like strategy games (i was one of them). lots of hours of play, so be ready to sink in some serious time if you decide to get this.",1
"ive played this game many times, and i think it is amazing! its an amazing rts game, and it is seriously worth it!",1
"maybe not as fleshed out as civ 4 with all expansions, but i enjoy the hex grid and the new costomizeablility of religion. you cant pass up the complete edition on sale if you enjoy turn based strategy, or even strategy in general. casual or hardcore.",2
"its definitely an enjoyable game and i would recommend it to people if they had the money to buy it/",1
"i would recommend if you have a friend to play it with. the single player is ok but the multiplayer is the best.",1
"i love this game. absolutely a great experience to play with friends throughout all hours of the night. theres nothing like going up against numerous bots on the highest diffuculty and winning through teamwork.",1
"i was playing this the night before an exam. at 11pm i thought just one more turn, cause that fer casmir betrayed me and sided with china. it seemed as if only an hour later i had taken over poland, china, indonesia and venice. it was 9am. 10/10 would fail an exam again.",2
"feel like experiencing time travel? load up this game. before you know it, weeks would have gone by.",1
"45 hours into this game and watched a 117 part playlist of it... this game is a must buy.",1
"sid meier is back with civ v. after a rocky start with the base game, the two expansions gods and kings and brave new world add the meat back to the civilization hot pocket. recommended with gods and kings minimum.",1
"honestly this game is just awesome. buy it and waste your life away on it. there are like a million different ways to play and customize the game. tons of mods. youll have fun. buy it.",1
"this game has eaten up my life. ive lost everyting my wife left me but in the end i still have civ the love of my life",2
"i played this game, 10 minutes later approx. 27 hours had passed 10/10",1
"when i got this game i downloaded it and thought nothing of it. played at noon and thought why do people get so addicted to this game? next thing i know it was 3 a.m.",1
"really good fun. as long as you have time. you might get sucked in for a few hours sometimes. itts worth playing",1
"once... it was just 5 more minutes and im waking up..... and now... it became the ultimate just 1 more turn im nuking up",1
"this game (as you can probably tell by how much ive played it) is quite addicting. its beginner friendly but still has advanced aspects for more experienced players. the major downside is that if you only buy the base game, its quite repetitive; i recommend to purchase the complete edition. the game also has a workshop, which adds more variety to the game. i once used a mod which spawned all the civilizations in true geographical areas which actually taught me some true locations of countries which i didnt previously know. overall, good game, 10/10, could ruin your life :)",1
"a cool game exept that the ai is  but otherwise this is an awesome game",2
"i got this game 4 days ago and i cant stop playing it! 10/10",2
"this is one of the most addicting games i have played in a long time. the dlc really changes up gameplay and isnt just new character/map content.",1
"not that good without the expansions but still a good way to spend time.",1
"200 hours in and i still keep coming back. the base game is decent, but the real fun is with the gods and kings and brave new world expansion packs.",2
"highly recommend this game to anyone who can get truly involved in a game for hours on end enjoys the historic theme.",1
"my nuclear powered robot was killed by rifleman. apparently it was chuck norris.",1
"i can see im going to have countless hours of enjoyment from this game.",1
"i normally dont ever play games like this. in fact this is the first 4x strategy game ive ever played. i am really enjoying it, this game is such a blast to play. this is definitely not a game for everyone but do give it a try. download the demo, if you like i say pick it up. i bought it on the summer sale and am loving it to death.",1
"challenging and engaging. civilization has never missed its mark.",1
"playing civilization v is basically selling your soul to the devil himself.",1
"i recommend it. this game rocks. wrecking enemy empires with nukes and deadly super advance robots!",1
"one of my favourite game series, civv actually acomplishes what most of the series put out in terms of building an empire. there are numerous ways to win, and a few ways to survive. one of my favourite is just winning from the science method, while trying to get all countries to be peaceful is a pain, at least you can always backup your defense with science.",1
"probably one of the best games around. it isnt like age of emires where the whole job is to kill everyone, thats comes late in the game. you work with real world leaders, make alliances, and get some really mad and if you do decide to go fight a war, then be prepared to fight. i decided to try to take down egypt and that war lasted over a 1000 years in the end i just gave up and went back home.",1
"awesome game ! true to the civilization series. a must buy!",2
"! warning ! highly addictive ! warning ! buy only if you have lots of spare time to sink into this wonderful game ! truly amazing, but get brave new world and gods & kings with it :)",1
"this game is really addicting and well worth the $13.74 cad, keeps you busy and has many options to chose from and more than one way on how to play the game. the complete edition is what i got and its very fun to play. the only annoying parts i see in the game is when you use any nuclear bombs near a mountain the fallout stays there and you cannot use any of the workers to clear it. perhaps theres a mod to get rid of it? i kinda only wished there was more civilizations to pick from when youre setting up the game because with only few to pick some even with the dlcs. it seems like theres a lot more missing that the game could had placed in. this game is one of my most favorite games on steam right now. im glad i got to purchase it when it was only 60-70% off.",1
"so awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"id appreciate it if you checked out my blog, where i do reviews, giveaways, and more:",1
"this is a great turn by turn strategy game. build your empire, by brute strength or push for diplomacy. with all the add ons and mods, there are hours upon hours that could be spent enjoying this game. my only issue, is with the constant crashing on apples os. otherwise, i would highly recoomend it.",1
"a deep, wonderfully complex (but not everly so) tbs. many different ways to play, many variations of civs. the dlcs add so much more to the game play, they are well worth it to get. if you have the time to get into this, i would recommend it.",1
"if your thinking about getting it, get it. i dont even like stratagey games and i love this...",1
"great game, but it tends to crash whenever i reach the victory conditions. usually have to restart my computer when this happens, cant even ctrl alt del out of it. still, game is very fun up until this point",1
"i have played as all the civilizations and i liked them all. this is one of my favorite games of all time.",4
"civ 5 has surpassed the other versions of civ by a mile!",1
"yet another fantastic game from firaxis. sids games all have this one more turn charm, which will eventually get you to play till 6 am in your underwear and desperatley needing sleep. every civ is unique and has its own playstyle, and the difficulty levels are balanced. this game is one of the games i love and will keep playing until i move out or have better things to do. 9/10 would kiss again",2
"sid meiers (why is his name all over this?) civilization v is honestly one of the most fun turn-based strategy games i have ever played. if you have any interest in ancient cultures, i would highly recommend picking the game up. although it may feel rather simple at first, the game has a surprising amount of depth to it, and the multidue of victory conditions make almost any playstyle viable, once they have been fine-tuned. civilization v is not fast-paced, wont get your blood racing, and likely wont satisfy the gamer looking for a hardcore experience. instead, civilization v serves as a nice relaxing game that gives you time to think, a relaxing escape to wind down after a long day of work. just dont start playing right before you have someplace to be, because you will get sucked in to playing just one more turn. before you know it, its 6 a.m. and you have to go back to work.",2
"a true game to test time and create a great nation",1
"this game has been hacked! it is been used by unkowns and saids i have been on when i have not.",3
"hugely addictive. seriously strategic. power-mongering. epic. gear up and put your big-boy pants on; this is the thinking mans (and womans) war game. beautifully rendered graphics, intelligent ai and well thought out civilizations. this game has so much depth and variety; every game is different. you can also adjust the difficulty of each game, great for beginners, which lets you work your way through the miriad of strategies available to each cvilization you take out to play with. warning: dont attempt to play this game before going to bed.",2
"its okay, but when the game wants to screw you over, it will, gladly...",1
"civ 5 is a long, drawn out, and more complex game of chess. where your knights can take pawns, and be upgraded into apache helicopters. if you want to play a game of civ, make sure you have asolutely nothing to do! it will consume your time, but its not like youre doing anything important right?",1
"the procrastinators guide to never getting any thing done. 10/10 would play a quick match again.",1
"from the first time my friend mentioned this game to me i thought it would be crap, so me and my friend did the steam sharing thingy and i tried it out and after half an our of gameplay i realized how fun the game was. some people might disaggre and think it is crap and i can accept that but for people who like strategy games (like me) i would highly recommend this game as it taked time to work out (as you see i have 26 hours of gametime). overall i have to reccomend this game because i think that it is definitely not a waste of 22.00.",1
"this game is very addictive and very fun. grab it when it goes on sale and say goodbye to your free time :d",1
"civilization 5 was the first sid meiers game i ever played, i dont know what to expect. i have loved every minute of civ5, its one of the the few games i can lose so very very badly and with a grin start again only to get nuked off the face of the planet by gandhi. i didnt see gandhi coming like at all. we were so cool with each other then boom nukes everywhere the horror. still have nightmares about it 20/10 everyone join the madness :d",2
