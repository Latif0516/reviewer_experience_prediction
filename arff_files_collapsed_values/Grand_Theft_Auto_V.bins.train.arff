"cannot get it to start up, social club has stopped working at any and every attempt,",1
"set graphix to high , went to a strip club. didnt see daylight up to now. 10/10 still no daylight up to now",5
"thanks rockstar for taking your time while developing this game, it runs incredibly smooth, and i cannot wait to spend another 100h in the game.",1
"ive purchased this game day one, twice in my life, sof ar. its that good",5
"i dont like it because it is too expensive for my country. our average salary is about 180 euro where some money are for food , clothes and bills. that means we cannot afford this even if we wait months . i hope that one day lord gabe newell will read this review.",1
"1.5 million for purchasing early is a lie..allow me to clarify: if you want the full amount.it is a lie..you cannot get 1 million of it unless you pvp!!!!!...pvers were only given 500k!!!!!....this is a total misrepresentation of what was to be when sold ...if developers/reps will lie this early then game isnt worth it",7
"service pack 1 update simulator. nvidia driver update simulator. gpu disabling/enabling simulator. 11/10 would lose my time trying to make this game work again.",4
"dont buy this, wait for the next few sales, it doesnt launch and it takes literal days to download.",1
"the quality is good, this was worth the wait. the only problem is that i have no idea what to do online",2
"so far great game! 10/10! at first i wasnt really into the whole 3 character story mode thing, but it eventually grew on me, and now i really like how the story is unveiled through different perspectives. it can also be a little confusing at first as to how to advance the story since theres sooo much to do in the game. driving is fun in this game too! each car handles a little differently and the first person mode makes it feel like another game in and of itself. online mode is also really fun. it goes without saying, but of course heists go much better when you have friends to coordinate with, instead of random people doing their own thing. not anyones nor the games fault, just something that is what it is, ya know de facto and all that jazz. so yeah, make your friends buy it too!!",5
"this game is graphically outstanding, gameplay wise is just fine. grand theft auto 5 runs very smoothly with my beastly computer and all i can say is that first person with the best graphics on, is like playing a game of life",3
"i had this game on the ps3 and ps4. i have to say i thought the ps4 was a huge change from the ps3 version. now i have the pc version and it looks absolutly beautiful. i really recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the gta series.",1
"this game is so good in graphics and gameplay that it can hardly (normal gameplay) or compleatly not (online) run on my computer on the lowest graphics 10/10 would watch my computer explode again",1
"ok, i edited my review because, after the new patch everything seems to work fine. it really sucks that when the launcher was crashing and i was unable to play, everybody just assumed that my system iwas  and i didnt know anything about computers when it was rockstars problem. steam support community doesnt exist. we should help each other, not critize everyone pcs, what a bunch of 10 years old, rockstar fanboys. saying that, the game is awesome and you should buy it right now. but you already knew that.",4
"took some time to make this review, had to push it 3 times... <3",1
"when i start the game launcher doesnt work just loading i have been wait 1.5 hours but game is not loading please help me",2
"solid optimization! the game runs and feels great. i havent played this since it originally came out.... i loved it then..... and now i love it even more now! good job rockstar 10/10 <3",4
"this game is for me, and a lot of other people, a broken and dissapointing experience that only brings frustration with customer support half- at best. sure rockstar, you got a few results for a few bugs, but allllll the other ones you are baltantly ignoring, thank you for that. wish steam would simply give me a refund for a game where i can only start up the social club before everything goes wrong, but alas, that is only a distant hope at best.",1
"so i have been playing for a couple of hours and i can only say this. the console versions was beta tests for the pc version. this game is gourgios works perfectly performance wise and only takes a few tweeks to make the fps view mode work perfectly! if you liked san andreas and have not played a gta game since then this should be your next gta game :)",4
"lester is the best written character in a video game ive ever seen.",7
"bought every version of this game for each platform from day one release dates, and i have to say it gets better each purchase :d",5
"thankfully, i was able to resolve the problem of being blocked. if any of you face the problem, reset your password on the social club website, and log into gta v. anyway, this game is a creative triumph. highly reccomended, and would download and unpack again... xd. finally, after 1 and a half years, my review is complete(also 3 delays). 11/10",3
"ey i got rekt in it when i punched a colored man in the face",3
"well worth the wait. everything on max settings and the game is 60fps. i 100% this game on 360. i will max this one too. just looking at all the eye candy put into this game. well done rockstar",3
"i have had the best exprince with the game launcher! its amazing how the game launcher have changed throught the years!! but ill review the game later on when the launcher lets me play it. thanks ea for another stable game. :) 11/10 best launcher i have seen",7
"i like this game... no i mean i really ing like this game! actually scratch that, i flippin love this game! this game was my personal best game of 2013, i put hundreds of hours into the 360 version and now that its on pc ill probably put another couple hundred and considering that at this time of writing this review the game has been out for only a week and i already have 60 hours scares me for whats to come. do i need to tell you whats in the game and whats the game is about? pff why would i? its flippin gta!! the game that made a billion dollars in a day! who doesnt know what this game is? honestly i would like to know 1 single person that isnt old or been living under a rock that hasnt heard of this game. anyway getting carried away, point is: this game is a really great game and i would recommend it to anyone that enjoys fun. my only complaint is that i wish there where more interiors (hospitals, police department, cluckin bell, night clubs and maybe more than 1 strip club) but thats about it.",7
"great game! even though rockstar pushed it back three times its worth it.",4
"i love the game i just love it but the only thing is the controles are a bit....clunky one time i was drivin and i was making a left turn i wanted to sto[p making a left turn and i sound stay thrat way and same with movment i was runnin and wanted to stop runnin and i just continune running when im not touching anytthing. just to give yall a heads up hope rockstar fixs it in a up date",3
"it took 2 years to add eyebrows to my online character. 10/10",5
"definetly the best gta!!!! it is like the enhanced and high definition version of san andreas. lots of things to do, excellent story mode, excellent characters.... awesome game!!!! a must have!!!!!",6
"this frickin game, i cant play it at all! whenever i try playing, itll take me to the rockstar social club launcher and it will say unable to access rockstar servers. activation of gta v requires an internet connection and click retry, or click cancel to quit. im connected to my internet and it doesnt work. buy this game when they have the bugs fixed because clearly they ed up somewhere.",1
"yes this game is the best ive got it on all my consoles xbox 360 xbox one ps3 ps4 and its a really great game! you should buy it if you have money and download it then play it!",2
"you know how they kept delaying the game to fix bugs? yeah, well, i havent seen a single bug in the game so far. wanna know why? i havent even been in the game yet!",4
"this masterpiece is worth every minute of wait and every penny spent. it feels like i do not need any other game. also, it runs flawlessly. 10/10",2
"joined an online session and got run over by a tank. respawned and tried to rob a store and the shop keep shot me in the face as i left the store. listening to people rob stores and sing in the shower over mic at the same time is one of the weirdest things i have ever heard. game of the year.",7
"2.6 hrs on record, seems nice, right? this is exactly how long the time i wasted on trying to enter this freaking game. rockstar, dafuq?",1
"jesus. i have been waiting forever and my dreams have finally come true. 1000000/10",3
"this is the most fun ive had in a game in years. the character dialogue and art direction is better than every holywood film ive seen in the last ten years. the city more is alive and responsive than the one i live in. every mission is a joy to play and replay.",2
"gamesharing is enabled in steam but blocked by the rockstar drm. if your friends want to demo it they will have a gigantic download followed by the total inability to play the game. wtf rockstar?",1
"dont know whats all the hate about. the game is extremely well-optimized having no trouble playing it at a steady framerate. pc master race!!!",8
"a really great game. runs smoothly 60fps, thats if you have a good enough computer. overall, a really good game and im really excited for the modding.",4
"if youve played grand theft auto v on consoles, then you wont be disappointed. if you havent, youre in luck because this is indeed the definitive version. in my opinion, rockstar have done a wonderful job developing the game for pc. it was well worth the wait. the amount of graphical options means you can tweak the game to how you like it, especially if youre limited by hardware. the addition of the rockstar editor is just he icing on the cake. you may not be pleased with the price point due to when the game was released, but think of it as a brand new game being released in 2015 (because its that good).",4
"it is fun to play it but after weeks it gets too boring... still agood game to play with friends and kill time",1
"game launched 4 days ago and still unable to play. launcher crashes before game even starts, and game support consists of faulty report forms where you cant make tickets within the pc category, and making tickets with blank category takes 2 days to get an unhelpful answer saying the latest patch shouldve fixed it, if not, uninstall latest patch and reapply it only it hasnt fixed my issue, and noone knows how to uninstall a patch on steam and reapply, unless you want to re-download 60gb of game content.. do not buy this game yet. wait for rockstar games to iron out the bugs that seem to infest all new releases these days",1
"i have like 6 years old pc and im running it on 1920x1080 res on 30fps. this game is really good optimized and i love it. one of the best games i ever played :d",3
"if your pc can handle the fps issues then yes i would recommend it but as for me, the fps drops and the constant lock up of my pc, i would rather wait till they sort it all out before trying this game again",2
"4k resolution is awesome in 60fps - i can only recomended this game ;)",2
"ok, is anyone one else having a problem were every time you open the game, the thing says grand theft auto v has stopped working after about 5 seconds, if anyone knows how to fix please tell me, and untill this is fixed i vote this game down. by the way i have a windows 8.",1
"bought it downloaded 50% realised i have a laptop regrets everything downloads 100% plays chanes graphics to 768p goes complete  changes to 1080p runs smooth af 100% worth it",5
"just awesome. that year waiting was totally worth it! if you consider buying it, do it right now! you wont regret! firt day 10 hours of gaming in a row...",6
"warning! do not buy this game at the moment! wait for patches! not worth getting a ing broken piece of  right now. now that ive vented ill be more detailed. this game is amazing truly is. some of the best graphics i have seen since alien isolation. the damn thunderstorms in this game alone make me cream my pants. however im getting crashes every god damn 15-20 minutes of play time. i can not see how after multiple delays this game is still not release ready. i trust rockstar that they will fix these issues in a good amount of time. but once again this game proves that 1 you should never pre-order a damn game and 2 that the launch of games nowadays means at least 1 month of patching will most likely fix things. buy the game a month from now when its actually finished. it sucks a lot because i really want to play the story which is the main reason i bought the game i love the storylines in all of the gta games and this one seems like the best so far. ill just have to wait a bit longer than i hoped to enjoy this game. release rating: ing poor as . expectation rating: classic...when its fixed.",2
"drank 12 shots of whiskey and passed out. then i played gta",6
"amazing game, amazing graphics. but your going to need a pretty good pc to run the game on any setting. reccomend an intel proccesor and a geforce 900 series graphics card.",5
"i am slightly embarrassed to admit that this was the first gta game i had ever played... but im certainly not embarrassed to admit that i bought this one, and consider it worth every penny spent. the dictionary definition of open world ought to have this game high on its list - just amazing how you can do whatever you want, go wherever you want, generally mess around and have one heck of a lot of fun doing it... and then the missions and story - i expected as a first time player that i would be struggling, but nope, they seem to be set at some ideal dificulty level where its completely possible to succeed even without being an expert - gets a big thumbs up from me. and then the fantastic ability of this game to run smoothly on even my three year old laptop, with the sort of graphic settings that make other games freeze up and sulk. i could say lots, but i wont, just go and buy it - even at the full price its so worth it. more hours of entertainment than you can shake a violent stick at.",3
"this comes with a whole package full of tv thats still better to watch and cheaper than your monthly cable/satellite bill. oh and game runs great!",3
"met a little kid running from the cops, convinced him to get in my car and get away from them. drove it into a gas station and jumped out then thrusted over his body",4
"beastly optimization, a brand new experience compared to console!",3
"i have a beast of a pc. 10k score on 3d mark. this game is unplayable even in the lowest graphics settings. something is just wrong with it, even after the recent patches.",2
"servers are still horrendous. every gets kicked off of servers constantly, in the middle of jobs or just cruising. loading screens take forever all the time. i have 300/300 internet and these issues happen to many other people as well. until they fix their servers i would not recommend wasting your money on this game.",4
"everyone already knows its brilliant. and its very well optimised. just get it",5
"best game ever !!! dont even think ... just buy that game already!!!",3
"paid a hooker, killed her, adn got my money back. 10/10 would bang again",1
"arguably the best pc port rockstar has done. it runs surprisingly well.. and im on a laptop. occasional frame drops during cut scenes, but other than that, mostly smooth frame rate. driving with a mouse and keyboard feels fine and somewhat weighted, minus sports cars. gamepad recommended for aircraft. the fov for fps mode requires a gander at, but i wouldnt recommend it if you are susceptible to nausea or motion sickness. overall, a solid port, minus low res textures during fps mode. this is arguably the best in the franchise.",3
"id reccomend this game because well, it is a fantastic game but right now the game runs awful after around 20-30 minutes and even faster than that if you are driving. edit: now i cant even load into the game, it just has an infinite loading screen..",4
"this would be great, i only i could launch the ing game.",1
"best port ever, works so well. is bloody beautiful. tons of gameplay to be had in singleplayer or gta online. gta online has plenty of fun game modes, shooting is awesome with no  auto aim from consoles. its all manual aim here! insane game.",6
"thousands of accounts have been stolen due to improper security on rockstars end, mine included. until its fixed, theres no guarantee you wont lose a 60.00usd investment. their support is horribly slow in responding to it. if rockstar remedies the situation, ill be happy to change this review, but their response to such an event is just not sufficient. source:",2
"literally better than you could ever imagine! a way better than how i expected it to be. im proud of you rockstar!",7
"trying to download gta v was like looking at the cisco logo for 10 hours but besides that, the game is ing grand theft auto v, what else is there to say?",3
"grat game. i already own it on ps3 but the pc version is qay better. online version still is a little buggy",1
"i cant really write a pc review, considering i only have this game in my library because of family share, but heads up, family share will not work with games that use third party sources! or keys! good game on xbox, i just hate controllers to no end. frustraiting aim.",1
"** warning: review based solely upon story-mode performance ** ive been waiting for pc release since it launched on consoles sans the first-person view/mod. i can say with 100% confidence after only playing the story for about 10 hours that it was worth every ing bit of waiting those two years for this to release on pc - in every single regard. buttery smooth 60fps @ 1080p with everything cranked sky high except aa (fxaa enabled; msaa & txaa disabled.) even when i start blowing  up the fps doesnt drop below 45-50. this is, hands down, rockstars masterpiece. gta v runs better on my pc than any other gta before it. ive waited so long for this.. and ive yet to be disappointed! still cant believe it. 10/10 my pc specs: amd 8350 @ 4.5ghz 16gb 2133mhz ram 480gb intel ssd evga 780ti sc",4
"the first thing i thought when i first spawned into the virtual city of los santos? well, i didnt really think anything! this game is so advanced, so detailed, and just so fun that it can last your for months, maybe even years! its basically a life simulator. want to arm wrestle? play tennis? race? rob a store? go mountain biking? i think you get the point. there are so many things about this game- it deserves to be the third most sold game in history! what are you waiting for? get it!",6
"hey guys guess what! over 1000 people bought a game that wont even work for f****** 49,99! great jobb rockstar...",6
"hey rockstar, thank you for all the hard work. im actually having fun playing a pc game again. woooo! seriously tho, great game, runs smooth. only had a couple of crashes, otherwise great.",3
"it is completely absurd that rockstar still requires you to sign into social club to use their games. absolutely ridiculous. i dont know my password. you know why? because social club is completely useless, and i only ever think of it when i have to look up my password every single god damn time i start a rockstar game. so i tried the passwords i thought of, and now im locked out.  off with this , rockstar. i dont want to use your ing garbage social service to play your game. i already own it on the ps4, and i guess ill keep playing it there since im already logged in.  you.",2
"fantastic game! endless fun. 3 days in and i have almost 24 hours of gameplay. still not bored of it. when i do get bored, i just go on a killing rampage to see how long i can survive against the police.",7
"easily the best version of grand theft auto that has ever been made yet! pc master race!!!",3
"you need about 5 years of downloading this game. but the first time running over a hooker in your undies while playing trevor. priceless. 10/10 would run over again",6
"ran over civies in a truck in first-person while listening to backstreet boys on the radio. 11/10 would want it that way",5
"speaking entirely about the online, it is like some ed up cross between dark souls and hotline miami it is like darksould in that you have no idea what the  you are doing or are supposed to be doing. it is like hotline miami in that the entire time you thing you are going insane while murdering endless amounts of people who quesionably deserve it. oh yeah and the drm is a .",1
"now with most the bugs fixed, this game is superb. the game drops down to 20 fps time to time but other than that, the performance is great.",7
"i first played the xbox 360 version. this edition blows the old-gen one out of the water. you need a fairly beefy pc to run textures on highest setting but aside from texture quality, i can turn everything else to almost the highest setting.",3
"this game is truly a masterpiece, one of my most favourite games of all time. buy it. now.",6
"fantastic port, best ive ever played - runs on max settings stable at 60fps no drops (vsync enabled)",6
"great game but the damage model for vehicles is a huge step back. compared to gta iv every car is a tank now as it can take so much damage. further more it is now impossible to deform a cars roof or its doors. this is a huge malus for me as i loved finding creative ways to demolish my car in gta iv.",5
"one of the best games i have ever played. im in love with the gta. im in love with the gta. no recoil aks i got no recoil aks.",6
"a large selection of fedoras at my disposal. 10/10",3
"huge improvement in graphical prowess..... loading time still too long fun factor is a 10/10 story constantly getting pushed aside to murder hookers/thugs. basic mayhem is guarenteed!",3
"574 days since the initial release on old consoles... but it was totally worth the wait!",4
"its worse than gta iv. horrible game. if you dont play it exactly the way they want you to then you get a mission failed and have to start over. they dont even frelling tell you what you can and cannot do!! this has got to get a worst game of the year award for being so horrible.",1
"runs smooth on my amd phenom x2 and geforce gtx 560. storyline is great and online has no lag.",2
"doesnt work for me, wont launch wont do anything, ive spent the past 2days researching and trying to find out why the  it wont launch and ive tried every single work around possible. some of them are just bloody ridiculous especially rockstars one of forbidon characters in accound user names. serious displeased ive payed 40 and rockstar have had 2years to try and sort this out for pc release and they have failed completely. they failed with the console launch and they have failed with the pc launch.... its a shame because its a fantastic game but ive lost all faith in rockstar after this.",3
"good port, but why are people from consoles allowed to port? my first couple hours were getting camped by snipers and getting my cars blown up from rocket launchers.",10
"best open world game, so far. the world feels alive and legit. story is great and the characters are awesome. to complete the packege comes the online, which is a whole other game in itself. cant stop playing, havent bought another game since 2013. bought the ps3 version on september 2013 pre-sale. bought the ps4 version ins 2014 and transfered my online character. now i bought the pc version in 2015 and imported also my progress from ps4. will still be playing the ps4 though. got some friends that have only the console version, and many others who only have the pc... is it that good, to make me buy the same game 3 times??? yes, it is. it is constantly evolving and changing for the better. getting together with some friends and pulling up heists is so much rewarding that you forget what time it is....oops, another all-nighter just flew by...",1
"my favorite part of the game is when i spend the whole time trying to get the social club launcher to let me play the game. 9/10 would not drm again. please. no more drm. for. the. love. of. god.",2
"game doesnt work.forever stuck in social club loadout.waste of 40$",1
"ive played it on both consoles, and now on pc. to me, this game just keeps on being fun and the graphical improvements on pc are pretty stunning! if you havent played this on consoles, this is definitely a must-have and totally worth the money.",3
"great graphics, awesome gameplay but the fact that rockstar overlooked something so obvious is just sickening. how could they not test this on mobile pcs? the only fix currently is to disable your nvidia card and re-enable it before the game launches. i cant in good faith recommend this until the major issues are resolved.",7
"cant start this social club at all. over a week already and no reply. please do not buy this game.",1
"michaels eyebrows makes her *cough* excuse me him look like a pretty princess fabulous/10",2
"so everything is better then the console versions of this from xbox 360 to ps4 this is a great game even if your not interested in the online but cmon we all know thats why you want it. only downside is when alt tabbed the game decides it doesnt want to reopen when using programs like ts, skype and ventrilo but thats not that bad.",6
"10/10 peformance is surprisingly good and it looks great. i have looked forward to this since the first trailer for gta 5 was released.",3
"works fine for me. on lowest settings to maintain decent fps for my toaster, still looking pretty good.",5
"so far so good, after taking awhile to unpack anyway (to be expected). 1440p max everything including all options under advanced settings and im getting between 45 and 60 fps at all times in the city (havent been to the desert just yet) on a gtx 980 with a light oc and i7-2600k with 8gb memory. no aa though, frames drop to mid 40s with 2x. the game is gorgeous, those saying its not are either butthurt about a technical issue or seriously need their eyes checked. its absolutely night and day from both console versions (i played both ps ones). everything from improved lighting, tessellation, ao, vastly improved shadows and shaders, the works, is inlcuded, and all very customizable. give it a go!",4
"gtav is a fantastic game on pc, really well optimized, but, does have its issues(which ive listen below) which i hope rockstar will fix in the future. issues: texture/model pop-in (there is a workaround by setting the gtav.exe process in task manager to high priority) shadow draw distance issues (only renders high quality shadows at a very low distance.) some stuttering issues (workaround as well, at least for nvidia[dont know about amd] by setting the max pre-rendered frames to 1 in the nvidia control panel or nvidia inspector) timing out from gta online session when alt-tabbed or have the steam overlay up. other than the stated issues above, gtav its amazingly well done, highly recommend! specs: i5 2500k @ 3.7ghz evga gtx 680 2gb 32gb ddr3 ram",2
"buyer beware: if you are an average gamer that does not have more than or eaqual to 3gb graphics card the game will look horrible, you must havea graphics card to play but it must be a spendy one because the xbox 360 verson of this game looks better then the pc version for me, im so sad i wasted $60 on this hopeing for better graphics but am now out $60 and very dissapointed.",3
"best game ever 10/10 stuck in loading screen for 3 straight hours (still hasnt opened) if youre interested if it will ever load add me .",8
"quite possibly the single worst purchase i have ever made.",1
"this review took me almost 2 years to write and was delayed 3 times.",4
"60 fps on a gtx 760 on veryhigh-ultra. this game deserves full price if you havent played it yet.",6
"im running this game on an asus g751 laptop with a 970m with a mix of very high/high settings and it looks and runs great! for me, at the time of this review, windows borderless does seem to cause jitter so keep that in mind if you want to use that setting.",4
"rockstar please do something,,,the game wont launch with amd dedicated graphics card but with intel hd graphics run but in 10 fps on 800x600...please rockstar, i want to play this game faster.",2
"(((( (v) )))) dont mind me im just freaking high (((( (v) ))))",6
"simply the best gta v you can get. well worth spending hours roaming the world to see what trouble you can create or find! +good story +interesting characters +trever +great music +custom radio station +large map -likeability of the main characters -too much to do i highly recommend getting this game!",3
"the best gta of any platform. anyone who tells you different is dreaming or living in the past. great graphics. great sound. runnss smooth as a snoop dog track. video editor included. best gta of all time,  loads to do. 10/10",3

"my quest has been simple. to gain every strippers mobile number. would question life decisions leading to these moments again. 11/10.",5
"the map keeps dissapearing from underneath me and im driving into darkness, why is this?",4
"great game! difficult to drive the cars, and the online tutorial is way too long, but still a great game.",2
"this game is great. the lunch went out pretty good and the port is great. worth every dollar and the online is even greater. 10/10!",3
"started the game, instantly went to the strip club. 10/10 would buy again.",6
"game runs great. its worth the $60. also if you ever have performance issues turn grass and particle effects down.",4
"great game, but its it the same as console, except wider player base and more things to do with more flexibillity. its not different than console, but somehow better.",4
"i bought this game believing i can play it offline, the fact that i need to be connected 24/7 in order to play single-player is outrageous, we wait a year and a half and this is what we get?!?!",3
"i dont know why i am surprised that this game doesnt work. if we have gotten to a point where you are considered an idiot for buying a game on launch day because horror stories about crashes and poor optimization are more common than grains of sand on the beach, then something is very wrong. i strongly suggest that nobody purchase this game, even if it is eventually fixed for the majority of users. it is honestly ridiculous. rockstar had literally billions of dollars to develop this game, pushed the release date back multiple times, and still launched a broken game for about 1/4 of the people who bought it. this needs to stop, and all i can say is that rockstar will never get another cent of my money.",2
"really big improvements over the console version i love it the ultimate gta game!!!",3
"who releases a game three times and smashes records doing it? rockstar. simply put, gta v is the kind of game you will always leave installed and play a few hours a week. remember tony hawks games? i always left it in my playstation just because i knew when i wanted to play games, thats the first one id start with. thats exactly that kind of game. i bought it two times, and never looked back on any seconds of it. more than 300 hours on playstation, and im starting it all over again just because of how amazing this game is. get it now! whoever doesnt take the time to enjoy this masterpiece dont deserve to be a gamer.",5
"my pc met all requirements the only question mark was gpu which is integrated, it will still run and smoothe though rockstar really did a good job with this. i can tell they made full use of the delay times they had, with my integrated graphics card i shouldnt be able to run it but i can. however that will be upgraded today. was well worth the wait rockstar great job on making the pc version. ps. which is not a port it was developed with the main game side by side",9
"this game is better on pc than it is on xbox. thank god i swithced",2
"this game needs no introduction as i believe it is known worldwide. high anticipated and game of the year. everything you need is there, ranging from graphics, sceneries, storyline, multiplayer, gameplay, driving and most of all it is worth everything it cost.",2
"delays, delays, delays. does delaying a much anticipated game like gta v to polish it for pc, worth all the trouble to wait for? the answer? yes. it is.",4
"they fixed the problem is record timing, stay classy rockstar~",9
"i played this game for 100s of hours on the xbox 360, and let me say this is the ultimate version. the game added tons of new content (songs, cars, clothing, weapons, im pretty sure even new dialouge), it looks great, and it is a really good port (i know some people are having problems getting it working but once you do it runs well) which is even more impressive considering its a rockstar game, who isnt a company known for great ports.",2
"this error stuff is really making mme angry refund",1
"behold gta v on pc. all hail gaben. all hail the pc master race. jokes aside, plays at a beastly 60 fps on 4k resolution with 2 overclocked gtx 980s so im glad that it is optimised well for how nice the game looks. (just turn off aa, at that resolution you dont need it at all :3). as for online capabilities, much better than the torm that was launch on the peasantstation 3 and xbox #360noscope since you can actually play gta online without disconnecting 24/7 (all hail pc master race). *good on rockstar for not pulling another gta iv on pc",3
"great games. nice graphics, awesome gameplay. online play is really fun. the game has something for everyone no matter what type of gameplay you enjoy.",4
"love the game, looks awesome, runs stable, no crashes, no online connection problems. 10/10",4
"with just a single gtx 980 and i5-4690k im able to run this on highest settings with 5860x1080 resolution and am pulling a steady 55fps. best port of 2015",3
"besides wonky driving (think need for speed ii (1997)), its an engrossing experience. runs smoothly on an aging alienware.",3
"man, first person takes this game to another level. at first i thought it was poorly optimized, and have the rig to run it great. i soon learned all you have to do if you get stuttering, is alt+tab out and click icon back in. this has fixed all stuttering without lowering graphics options at all. gta v is a lot of fun, and was well worth the wait. 3 characters to control is a nice switch-up. good variation of missions. this game on pc looks way better, and runs smoother than the consoles. i would recommend this game to anyone who wants to take a hiatus from life for a bit heh heh. recommended!!",7
"amazing port! amazing game! edit - also ive seen a lot of people moaning about rockstar support and quite frankly theyre really not that bad. they got back to me within hours when my game started crashing and the things they surgested gave me a 20-40fps boost! also contacted them about an online issue which, admittdly, took about a week for them to respond but they still helped.",5
"its really good but sometimes there are texture problems in online and lags when i play with my friends i see all the players on the online with black stripes on them",3

"worst game ever played. skipped class, slept late. why? gta v.",6
"looks way better than console version and 60fps makes buying this game again worth it.",5
"seriously one of the best games ever made. we waited too long for a pc version and the result is very, very good.",3
"great game over all. has minor bugs online but i think its about the server.",3
"you must buy this game.very optimized,lots of fun,great time waster.",6
"awesomely fun really well done port, getting 60fps at veryhigh - maxed on a gtx 760 and i5 4690 rockstar have finally managed to make a game worthy of pc.",7

"i would like to thank the console peasants for beta testing this game for us! :)",5
"this game 10/10 is better then the console version. the aiming, the community, the experience, just about everything. definately recommend this game to everyone/anyone wanting a fun online and first person shooter experience.",3
"when you first come into the story line, you will meet a little kitty in the street corner. i tried to hold that cat and pressed some keys, instead touching the kitty the character i controlled kicked the kitty. and its dead. definitely the worst gaming experience in my human life. yes i am a kitty lover. highly not recommended.",3
"my friend gifted it to me . and im so thankful to him and rockstar for making this dream come true. been waiting for this game since 2011. been through all the delays patiently. but after finally getting this game, id say 10/10 would wait again for a game like this pros: -hours of fun -range of graphical options/settings -amazing optimization -lots of fun activities (golf, swimming, tennis, strip clubs) -great story missions & characters in story mode. -really fun to hang out or play with friends in gta online. cons: -r.i.p social life.",7
"i first play grand theft auto 5 on playstation 3, then playstation 4 and now i get to play it on the best place ever! i can not wait to drive around and take lots of screenshot! as far as the story goes, i think it is okay. honestly i never beat the story mode on console but i will this time on pc. i spent majority of the time in <u> gta online </u>. i am hype!! get it!!! did i mention you can transfer your char. from console to pc?",2
"everyone was excited for this game on pc. its better than those console peasant versions. this version is ................ amazing. amazing doesnt even describe it enough. pros: - enjoyable gameplay, many things to do online as well as in single player. - online is really well done, except for the disconnect bug still around. gang attacks, jobs everywhere, robbing stores, blowing vehicles up like a boss. - team play is very beneficial, allows you to fight stronger, play quicker, and enjoy the game even more. also encouraged really well. - graphics are amazing, fantastic quality all over the game. cons: - desync bug online, shows everyone leaving the game all at once. really really irritating. - needs an above average computer to run. - you can get banned for blowing peoples vehicles up to often, and yet there is passive mode that makes it so you cant be killed by players. not to mention there are vehicles almost impossible to kill people in, how are you suppose to defend yourself?",9
"what can i say , its gta v, we have been waiting longer than 4 ppl i know have been alive for it to come to your much loved pcs, granted they are very young but none the less it is hands down the best gta so far becuse it is the newest (rule of thumb new is better than older) but for realz played in the last 2 days and 2 h , i have played 16h and worked 18h >.< . online is so much fun , jump in random one with random ppl ( thats why i called it a random one it has random ppl in it ) and just romp around killing every one you can find , or jump in one by your self or with your crew ( if you poses the abilty to make friends irl ) and can mess with cops or start working on the how many missions there are or just .........f&@k it off to play again . in short get it ......so i can shoot more ppl mmmuuuhahahahahahaha!!!!1!",7

"11/10 beautiful graphics, gameplay is amazing. new destinations and driving paths everytime, always a surprise.",8
"was worth the wait. game looks amazing on very high settings and will make completing the story again a whole lot different from the xbox 360 version. sucks that the pre-order bonus money was not spread out across all characters in story mode.",3

"the game is great lots of fun and so much to do but who ever made controls for pc i hope to god they are found dead in a ditch covered in cigarette burns next to who ever made the pc ui this game could have been much better if you gave away free controller with evey pc copy well lets face it the game is very good but massively over priced",1
"we all know how great gtav is. the little details rockstar added really make this game for me. also my pc was slightly better then the min specs(my graphics card being the min spec, gtx660) and with a little messing around im basically running it on max, i droped shadow quality to normal and it works fine for me. there are a few frame drops evry now and then, but over all it works fine. great game and it looks beautiful. 10/10 would bang.",4
"this game is cool. but rockstar still hasnt fixed the problem of intel/amd laptop start issue for almost a week and give no offical reply on rockstar forum.",1
"pros: overall a great game for the pc. if you are used to how this game looks on the console, you will be blown away by the graphical improvements and the gta experience at over 30 frames per second. there are a rediculous amount of settings so you can customize the game to your liking. the controller support is also amazing since gta v provides a seemless transition from keyboard to controller. i personally use a controller for flying and keyboard and mouse for everything else. the game as a whole seems so smooth, driving especially. cons: you have to start nitpicking in order to find something about this game that isnt up to par. the obvious for me was the excessive time spent on loading screens. finding a gta online game is a pain since loading screens can sometimes take up a substancial chunk of time. joining jobs and heists also have the loading screens. in the end, i couldnt recommend this game enough. the game itself is among the funnest ive ever played with the graphical improvements over the console version making it even better! buy this game and you wont be sorry!",4
"daddys back es! well, no actually, colour is back. and fun. thats back too. 10/10",6
"the game is not starting at all, i followed every solution given to fix the problem, i even created two new accounts; one a local admin account, and second a windows admin account. but still no luck. i dont know if this problem is with steam, or rockstar, because i had the same problem with max payne 3 before, and it took a month before i got a reply from customer support. if possible i would like to avoid waitting a month for a fix, there is no point releasing a game early, then players having to wait a month to play what theyve paid for, with the hope of enjoying the game right away. i skipped class today to come home early, to check on my game out, so dissapointed :-(. p.s its a stupid way of conducting business, we should play what we pay for, and have. not waitting for a fix in a week or month upon release date to play what we already own now! :-(.",7

"met a guy online. trusted him, became best friends later new that he was double crossing me so i sent a mugger after him, failed. sent mercenaries to kill him, failed so i took my jet and gave it to him after i put bombs inside secretly. 10/10 would kill again",6
"the definitive version of an already critically-acclaimed game. this game deserves every bit of praise it got in the past and now all that praise can also be applied to a wonderful pc version that plays well on a wide variety of different systems. a must have game if you like rockstars open world formula and above average storytelling/character development.",3
"if you can not log into the social club account that is linked to steam you can not activate this game. rockstar support wont help you. if you have this issue and buy this game, you wont be able to play.",1
"aside from the 10 hour 60gb download, the game is giving alot of people problems and rockstar is sitting on their asses counting money. i have put in a support ticket and followed up 6 times and no one has responded. the online freezes and crashes, a problem that many other people are having. on others forum posts, rockstar also has failed to reply. it seems as though they have absolutely no clue as to what is causing this problem prohibiting online and story play. totally unacceptable for it to be out this long and no patch for an issue making the game unplayable for some customers.",6
"great launch to be honest super smooth compared to what i thought it would be runs like a charm on high. (cant write a bad review on a game because you had to download it for a long time or it doesnt launch when its on yourre end)",6
"i really hope they fix it,and i cant wait to upgrade my pc and play it",1

"this game is pretty good its beautiful and the graphics but there was a error that i came across gta 5 luancher has stopped working i havent fixed it",6
"if youre on the fence about paying full price for this, let me give you some advice: do it! i dont have much money to spend on games, but this has got the be the least amount of regret ive ever felt after dropping $60 on a game. gta v for pc is amazing. honestly, its the best game ive played in years. if youve got the hardware for it, this is the game for pc in 2015. im looking forward to playing this for years online and seeing what the modders come up with in the future.",3
"this game was really fun on xbox and im sure its even more fun on pc and id live to play if it wasnt for the fact that i cant stay in game for more then 15 minutes. they game crashes way too much for what it is, its benn delayed and has a large team that should know what they are doing. ive looked everywhere and i cant find one solution that works or anything from rockstar saying they are working on it or even that they know that the game is crashing for so many people. i payed for a game this big it shouldnt be crashing this much. ive seen early access games made by a single person that crash less then this.",7
"best grand theft auto game ever! 10/10 100% recommend",9
"runs great, fun game, but the only two problems are the control scheme is a little weird and there is slight lag in menus and in windowed mode it tends to open the menu randomly but other than those this game is one of the most fun games ive ever played",6
"ive already played gtav twice before, but not like this. gtav for pc is a good port, if you where wondering. theres a few rendering glitches as of this review but rockstar is good about fixing this game. basically its gta4 but not  and has non-modded first-person mode, which works extreamly well. pick this game up, now.",4
"its gta, the latest version, ported beautifully to pc with its full glory. no more words are needed.",4
"updated as of patch 1.01 cant reccomend a game i cant play. forced to click the steam play button more than i have any other game (ive watched the intro/loading screens more than i ever had to on the 360 (note: im level 144)) cant pause the game without freezing cant play online without freezing cant play single player for more than 40 minutes without freezing cant load the game without freezing cant buy the next r* game without freezing smh, until a patch comes out that resolves this issue, this review will remain. here is a screenshot of the error",6
"two years still wasnt enough to prepare me for 60fps",6
"characters lacking charisma, repetitive missions and some repulsive scenes. ive played gta since the third one, never found myself getting bored until gta v. 3/4 of the game is trevor whining about what michael did, getting ready for a heist or solving the dumb troubles your family gets into. except for a couple of missions there was no adrenaline; there are some scenes where i feel rockstar crossed a line as well. there was gore when it clearly could have been avoided, gta doesnt need that. i insist, you guys crossed a line with this game, an akward one.",3
"worst launch ive seen yet, i cant even play the game i ve payed $60 for yet. i have to wait for rockstar to fix it. such a dumb error. i wonder what they are going to do to make up for all of us who cant even get passed the launcher. 1. it took 30 minutes to link social club to steam, because of a login error on their end. 2. finally got past that, now i cant get past the launcher, it crashes every time. 3. now we have to wait for who knows how long for a fix. this sucks rockstar!",1
"i never feel so dramatic after finishing a download + installing for a game before, to many journey i through it. worth your time, money, just trust me it isnt bad at all like negative reviewers out there 9/10",5

"i7 4790k gtx 970 8 gigs of ram game runs at like 15 fps, even at lowest settings.",1
"ehh, its ok... the work theyve done is great and is easily worth the game cost alone. however, craftsmanship aside, this is a bit better than gta4 technically speaking, but not better than gta3: san andreas immersion/story-wise. - its a bit of a cheap gimic for game makers to let users create their own content (movie mode). that was a novel idea back when minecraft came out... now its just lazy. - the missions feel cobbled together and the character switching requirement/feature causes immersion loss. - main characters are as deep as a kiddy pool, and supporting characters are mostly just annoying and not lovable. + trevor, however, was really well done! + graphics, controls, cars, city, diversity, engine, optimization are all cinima grade awesome. all in all, its fun to screw around gta2 style, but at $260-ish million development budget... they could have done considerably better. rockstar, if youre listening and think i should shut up or put up... deal... ill help you build gta6 :)",7
"i was just really blown away from this game it says i spent 1200 hours on the xbox360 version so i know how the game compares i have never played the xbox one nor the ps4 versions except at my friends. the pc port isnt really a port at all the game has the same type of feel as max payne 3 so i think they built a lot onto the game the first person is really nice. the only thing i can say bad about this game is the fact i coulnt get it to run untill 3 days after the release but i dont care if i had to wait a week after the release to play but how i fixed it was i had something idk what on my windows that prevented the game from launching so i just reinstalled windows and it worked completely fine after that and i am curenty really enjoying the game. i think its worth the money if you never played it at all or had it for the 360 if i had it for the ps4 or xbox one i dont think i would of been to driven ro buy it then.",6
"good but where the hell is my money that i was supposed to get i only see 500k for frank and 100k for trevor",4
"runs very good on gtx 660 / fx 6300 at high / very high settings never had problem with starting the game / activating it on rockstar social club, dunno why some people seem to have problems... anyway i r8 8/8 m8. see you in gta 8",6
"dont buy it yet. too many bugs: crashes infinite loading screen etc. wait till its on sale and has been patched properly.",6
"the game is giant, full of content, innovation, the storyline is interesting, every mission is interesting, nothing you do feels repetitive, the game easily immerses you into its world, having 3 characters, to me, feels like rockstar covered every single point of view that you usually get from gta protagonists, franklin for the times of gta: sa, michael for every other protagonist, and trevor for those crazy rampages you used to go on for no reason, just because its fun to kill people. currently, gta: online is full of annoying bugs and is barely playable, the servers put you in with people all across the world, chinese, australian, which makes playing with them impossible due to lag, and ruins the overall experience, rockstar has a lot to fix before online becomes fun, but you can still go ahead and give it a try.",6
"to keep it really short and simple, it was definitely worth the wait for the pc version of gta v. it runs like a dream and looks just as nice as ir runs. pcmr ftw!",2
"honestly the most difficult game i have ever had to deal with, and sadly i have even avoided most of the major issues. it loads about one fourth of the time and the other 75% it provides the annoyances and frustrations that i can only imagine be rivaled by a barbedwire laced power drill rapeing my nostrils. seriously considering a refund.",3
"press play, spinning circle, it says im in game, net moment, im not. cant get it to work. wow rockstar, all those delays for polishing sure were worth it. go  yourselves",1
"waited two years for crashing simulator.  off rockstar. pc main platform.",9
"the single player is very robust and runs as smooth as silk without a hiccup. the game is a breath of fresh air compared to how grand theft auto iv ran on pc. no more gfwl and optimisation issues. the rockstar editor is also a very agreeable addition. however, the online from my experience is somewhat negligent. i have experienced 2 game breaking bugs: for the first one; the entire screen freezes except for the mini-map, for the second; the game sometimes gets stuck in an infinite loading sequence. in both of these scenarios, i ultimately have to shut the game down via the task manager. overall i am quite impressed, but also completely confounded by how unstable the online can be at times; especially considering the copious amounts of time rockstar had to perfect this game on pc. i will rate this game as an 8.5 for now. my opinion will very likely increase if rockstar remedies the online issues and as more enjoyable mods arrive.",6

"- preload failed causing a redownload. - framerate drops - stuttering - needs an update to fix major issues. - social club is a disaster for the game  the issues metioned above such as framerate drops and stuttering that i was having was fixed. i played around with the nvidia control panel in order to maximise the power use of the gpu and ingame settings i turned off vsync.  in terms of the preload it kept showing me errors through the unpacking phase causing me to miss the first day of play.  my fps stayed at a consistant 60 but sometimes saw huge drops reaching as low as 20 for a second.  i highly dont reccommned the game if you have a pc below the recommended requirements.",5
"60 fps or higher does a brutal difference, now it has exclusive pc content such as rockstar editor and a great community overlay. you can also notice a huge difference between ps4 or xbox one on graphics, rockstar did a great job. if youre thinking about owning this game, you should do it right now! as our friend, gaben, would say; - worth the wait. good job rockstar, im 100% amused. filthy , aka carlos",4

"coming from the ps3 to the master race, this is a huge upgrade. this game is a must buy and youll never regret your choice. this is by far my favorite gta ever since san andreas and vice city!! pros: -graphic updates -all past dlc included even the collectors edition exclusive vehicles. -emmersive story -great characters -first person mode works great. -smooth 60 fps!! -huge selection of vehicles. land and air!! -never gets boring -great online that has you playing countless missions to level up and get money. -gta online transfer system works great for all returning players from consoles -online heists!!!! cons: -in gta online, it can be hard to get money for everything you want unless you play heists. -more freaks and geeks can be added, the ones already in the game are great!",5

"was playing fine at launch with no issues until i tried to go online. i had my steam and xbox accounts linked to my social club and going online i imported my character. as soon as i did this i could not play. my social club email address and username then changed, and now i cannot even play single player. ive contacted rockstar support multiple times, most of which i get hung up on as soon as i give ticket number. worse support ive ever received. i sent them all the required info, key, username, purchase info, etc and no response. support says they cant help me and someone will contact me with no eta (they cant tell me if it will be days or years).",1
"if youre a gta fan this is the version of gta 5 you want. as someone that has hundreds of hours logged in the ps3 version of this game im literally stunned by how much better and more immersive the pc version is. 5 out of 5 stars to r* for doing a pc port the right way!",9
"trolls everywhere. cant do anything in peace cause someone just has to ram your car or shoot you. oh and the random screaming and the cries for shut up. match making sucks for new people, cause host will kick new guys out the party.",3
"first act was killing a cat on accident. it was fascinating. 10/10 would kill again. found new calling as psychopath.",7
"its not a trainwreck, this time rs learned their lesson. they have been the butt of many jokes since they released gta4 on pc. then it happened all over again when they launched gta online. i played about 1 hour of story mode and 3 of gtao on launch day and had no issues whatsoever. if youre holding out to see whether or not this is playable, theres no need. they worked out the bugs on the consoles and brought the polished version to pc.",5

"best pc game available 10/10 would wait 6 years again",3
"first day had a few hickups as you would expect. but really came together and is rockin. love this game",5
"after getting this game to finally work properly on my pc i enjoy it a lot. gta online still has a few issues but its still a lot of fun. single player is much more immersive compared to the previous games.",3
"just another open world rpg. only 3 classes that are almost the same and also have predefined races that cant be changed. skills level up by doing stuff like running. there is a main story line and a couple of side quests. but no boss fights, only trash mobs the whole game. you can buy a lot of items, but they dont have stats. weapons are mostly ranged and you will get in trouble using melee only. theres only one kind of armor that isnt even visible on the character. good thing so far, there are a lot of different mounts to ride. some of them can also fly but are destroyed quickly if you collide with the level geometry. setting could be interesting if youre bored with fantasy.",2
"excellent game for pc playing on my new republic of gamers laptop i bought just for the game. glad they added vehicles and new weapons previously for online only to single player that was an issue with the ps3. enjoying the better graphics and first person mode as well as the blimp definetly worth it.",7
"this game is soo perfect :d. seriously its rare to see so polished games. totally fun, totally amazing !!",3

"cant even start the game. social club launcher keeps crashing",1
"ok so you were polishing it and what did you do nothing because this game is infected with bugs all over the place!!!!!!! whats with disapearing textures online? the garages not loading? getting stuck on a heist setup when entering a garage with another person (bank robbery heist) could not connect to rockstar servers randomly poping up? so polished eh??????? please fix this it is just distrupting the gameplay!!!!!",5

"i walked 2 minutes in the rain.. and i actually get wet.. 10/10",7
"rating 10/10 a little bit buggy, crashes most of the time to desktop. but still recommend it, its fun, at least the 5 minutes that the game actually works update: apparently the game works 100% fine with a fresh windows installation.",5

"excellent game. when it works. pc version crashes alot. sometimes when im just standing still in my apartment doing nothing. suddenly windows stops working. game play is amazing when i can play it. i am patient enough to wait for them to fix it. excellent game if you can handle the errors till they resolve them.",3
"short and sweet review. answers to questions you may have: -yes, you can transfer a character from another console onto gta v pc. you will even have the option to change the characters appearance with a slightly more in-depth creator -the graphics are stellar and there are a ton of options you can tinker with -gamepads are fully supported -loading times are drastically shorter compared to consoles -gta online achievements and progression carries over with your character as well, but not campaign progression unbelievably, contrary to most games that are newly released, there were no issues with online multiplayer that i found. played with my friend, it was smooth as silk. the game runs like a dream, and i havent hit any major glitches or bugs that broke the game. this is an excellent port of an excellent game. well worth the wait",8
"best game ive ever played so far. the performance and optimization are great! highly recommend.",4
"for the way pc gamers had to wait, a launch any less than perfect would be critized. i cant even get past the launcher.",1
"just when i was about to refund it, they took that option away pretty nice computer stress test",3
"the game itself is great the gameplay is good, graphics are great. the myriad of disconnects, freezes, crashes and the fact that in 2015 a massively multiplayer open world game runs on p2p rather than dedicated servers means taht this is firmly a waste $70 cad for me. ill come back if or when the bugs are fixed. if you dont own this yet, wait 6 months i would say. there is a tremendous amount of bugs that simply should not be there in a game that was delayed 3+ times. i could understand server stability issues - but oh wait, you connect to whoever hosts not a server, could be anyone with any kind of connection and pc. some matches are like slideshows.",2
"this is an excellent game. the driving is fluid, gunplay is smooth, and graphics are beautiful. ive been playing on my gtx 970, and for people who have this card, i can tell you that there is a solid 60 fps.",3
"this is a great game! i have had the 360 version and the ps4 version now i got this one and this version is the best so far!",1
"at first i didnt get the hype of grand theft auto online. then i headshotted some dude on his way to a heist with his crew, and i heard over voice chat that b*tch killed *blankblank*! kill that motherf*cker!! then i led them on a street chase through the city, and i remembered the 5 ds of dodgeball: dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge. then i went off of a ramp and landed in a river. shortly afterwards, they shot me dead as i tried to escape. i get gta online now.",1
"looks amazing, 60 fps really shines, and super fun to play.",3
"i thought the cat was dead. i stepped on him.... now hes dead. dead cat / dead cat",2
"good game hands down good time online with friends",3
"toatally worth the price. dont touch the game rockstar it works.",4

"this review took me almost 2 years to write and was delayed 3 times. 10/10",4
"been waiting for this game for over a year now... and yes this game was worth the wait gianny!",8
"currently at 40% and enjoying every minute of it !!! just cant stop playing it, los angeles ( los santos ) feels so alive ! fantastic job rockstar !!! the games is well optimized of pc.",10
"uterly amazing well worth the wait. looks awesome and runs great !!!!",6
"really nice done graphics and details. the gameplay feels awesome. youre gonna learn fluent american dialect with all the profanity in the english. 11/10 would steal a random car form the road and break it again!",5
"one of the best launches i have experienced. the game is very well optimized, and runs extremely well. once you get past the social club stuff, its incredible.",4
"go to the highest mountain! look at the view! jump from there and then land facing down! best game ever! especially with friends 10/10",1
"best go to game when you have nothing else to play. 10/10",5
"day one issues happen with almost every game. i didnt experience any though. pc gaming takes patience guys. this is the most emersive game in the series by far. there is a lot of world building decent story and fairly exellent gameplay.",3
"so far so good, currently enjoying the high definition asses thats currently haunting me. will return with better review.",5
"way better then ps3 or xbox. and uninstall watch dogs and get gta 5. getting 60 fps on2560x1600",2
"*edit* turns out installing service pack 1 for windows 7 fixes the issue. (admittedly the system requirements do state that). as far as the pc port goes, this is very good. it runs better than gta iv does on my system and looks utterly georgeous. im running at 1080p 60fps on a mixture of high and medium with a gtx 760, which is very impressive.",5
"if you put higher settings, you get less lag? 10/10",9
"this might be the best game this year. its much better than the console versions, and a much better port than gta iv was. great job r* this time around. took you a year and a half but it was worth the wait.",3
"-waited (2 years) -preloaded -waited (2 weeks) -updated (2 minutes) -unpacked (2 hours) worth the wait! 10/10",4
"r* did amazing job with the pc version. it actually runs better than gta iv! the game looks and plays great. i only wish they would patch first person walking with a keyboard and made fov slider go a little wider. other than that, goty for sure!",4
"by far the best $60 youll spend for quite some time. once you start playing you wont be able to stop. the multiplayer is terrific and the singlepalyer is both fun and hilarious. 10/10 would buy again !",8
"solid performace, great stuff. the graphics options were limiting me short of my computers capabilities, once i disabled the limiter, i was able to set everything on ultra and ran the game perfectly fine.",8
"no crash issues here. intel i-7 2600k 3.7ghz oc, gtx 770, 8gb corsair vengence. seems like the game takes up about 1.5gb of vram for me, so i still have 0.5 worth of change left. i bought this game the first time around for the xbox 360 and stopped halfway because of all the loading and waste of a good thumb stick... and wonky 3rd person controls. none of those issues on the pc version, and 1st person driving is surprising easier than in 3rd person. traffic collisions down by 90%.",4
"game is amazing. graphics are insane. im running a amd fx-8320 (8core), 8gb ram, gts 450 sc, with a 36in 1080p monitor and i play in very high and i still get around 65fps. theres still many bugs but its playable and the bugs do not affect you there just funny bugs. (people belly flop when u shoot them in water) <--theres a bug.",8
"i had this on xbox 360, and have just been waiting for the past 2 or so years for it to arrive on pc, and it was worth the wait! the graphics surpass the ps4 and xbo easily. they even designed it for weakerish rigs to be able to run it decently. i have several hours on it so far and just love what they have been doing. gets a little getting used to once youve played with a controller for quite a time! 10/10 love the game.",5
"the best game rockstar has ever released, if not - the best game among all games. the amount of detail gta v has is beyond words, from graphics to audio to environment words alone cannot explain, you have to experience it to believe it. 10/10 from me, ill also bow down and take my hat off to rockstar.",10
"well..well..well....nothing much to say! rockstar did a great job best optimization and stunning graphics! runs silky smooth on my system able to get 70fps avg. on high settings!(for system specs. check my profile). pros: +world is beautiful. +60+fps makes it awesome. +2015 game of the year for pc. -no cons yet! best gta ever! <3 love it <3",3
"coming back to los santos for the third time and im still loving it. the pc version is the definite version, with its supreme graphic options, better performance and easier matchmaking. the controls work well for keyboard and mouse, but i can switch to my controller instantly if i feel like it. im loving it. had a couple of errors on launch day, but now its working fine for me.",5
"crash simulator 2015. 10/10 never pre order again.",5
"ps4 version looks and runs better. it can feel nice for a bit at 60fps but frequent frame drops destroy the experience. there is also a very restrictive graphics options menu, as in you can change the options but the game will not let you play the game if it thinks you are out of memory. this can happen often as the game does not pick up on multiple graphics cards and large amounts of ram. a better port than gtaiv but its still not a high enough quality to warrant purchasing this version. only buy if you have a rig way above the reccomended settings and can afford a new hard drive because this is a resource hog and a disgusting large game to install. all in all the order for gta v goes ps4/xbone > pc >360/ ps3.",1
"i hated it initially. i thought it was poorly optimized trash. then i installed 15.4 catalyst beta released specifically for gtav for amd cards and it made all the difference. im playing the game 5760x1080 triple monitors eyefinity crossfire 2x 7950s with a i7-4770k and 16gb or ram on an ssd. its now a dream.....like butter. the 15.4 beta driver made all the difference.",3
"great game, worth the wait. very well optimised in comparison to the previous releases.",7
"worst game ever better to buy it on xbox one or xbox 360 , very bad console port.,",2
"hold on, before you buy, if you have a dual core processor, you might not want to buy. i have a pentium g3258 and it slowly renders building, people, even roads. but when it does render, its amazing. even with the a dual core i reccomend, but if you do have dual core you must know what you are going in.",2
"couldnt get my account back from console just bcuz the first letter in my pw was in capitals(fk u r*), bye best everything and lvl 80 character :( but anyways the game is great, if u havent played the console version this is a must-get. game runs perfect max settings 1920x1080 on a i5 4690k,gtx 970 and 8gb ram the game floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee, runs so fast even console peasants can`t see.",6
"10/10 would click close program on the textbox saying the launcher has crashed again.",2
"they forced us to wait long for what? still buggy as hell, missions disapeared, cant play online so what was the point to buy this game?",7
"absolutely 0 issues with the game. no crashing, no lag, no stuttering, solid performance and so on. its an awesome game.",6
"been waiting a long time for this .looks and plays awesome and it truly challanges my rig.",8
"gta v has finally made to pc. its fantastic and obviously the definitive version. but i wouldnt know that because the games launcher doesnt even start. also rockstar has mentioned any problems even though it has been 3 days. 10/10 great port- ign",1
"as of now, have fun playing this on a laptop. some people crash on the social club screen when they launch the game. if youre lucky to get past that, your dedicated graphics card wont start the game up, but your intel graphics will. and that runs at less than 20 fps (surprisingly)",1
"this game does nothing new. at all. everything it does, someone else did, in some cases better. but in most, not. from the joke ads onthe radio through the wide range of vehicles to the story and multiplayer, everything is very well done. the game is optimized really nicely as well. there really is no reason not to like this game. everyone should have it.",8
"grand theft auto v is a good game, but i cant really enjoy it all that much until the stuttering issues are fixed. memory leaks and all that.",4
"i cant even start the game. it just black screens. not even a loading screen. is this a normal thing? my pc can handle this game btw, making the minimum reqs but barely making the recommended.",1
"its finally here, and its even more glorious than we could have expected! rockstar, we forgive you for the wait. 1000000/10",5
"great game just great, i find pleasure in killing as many players as i can in the free roam lobby.",6
"excellent game. excellent gta, maybe the best one.",2
"very good game online works great the grafics are real good iam running 4k noprobs at all.",2
"good game. but i really hate these very long loading... and these sessions. and sometimes a huge lags... singleplayer is perfect.",5
"2 years, 3 delays, one day downloading, 1 hour decripting.. but you know that was all worth it when you steal your first car in only 5 minutes. 10/10 gotygoty inbound. would scream to the world gta v console peasants again.",2
"its grand theft auto 5, my favorite gta game... on pc! this game already kicks  on consoles, but this is by far the best version of grand theft auto 5! i have played the ps3, xbox 360, and ps4 versions and the pc version tops them all. better frame rate, better graphics (supporting resolutions above 1080p, directx 11 features, and higher resolution textures), and (by opinion) better controls (mouse & keyboard). if you have not purchased this game yet, what the hell are you waiting for? go and hit that add to cart button and buy this game already! i will see you online!",7
"its really a game worth buying. still has some issues like problem with textures when v-sync is off but they are most likely going to get patched. it was really worth the wait and i am glad that rockstar moved the release. 9.9/10 imo",7
"this game is amazing! im not going to go into the gameplay or story because you already know how good that is but the first person camera does have an advantage of the last gen consoles. q)how does the game run? a)the game runs very well even considering my specs arent up to snuff. q)what are your specs? a)currently i have a core 2 quad q9650 3.0ghz stock speed, 8 gigs of ddr2 800mhz g.skill memory, a gigabyte g1 gaming gtx970 and my game is running off of kingstons hyperx fury 240gb hdd q)what kind of framrate do you get? a)on high settings at a resolution somewhere between 1080p and 4k i get anywhere from 40 to 70 frames per second q)would you say gta5 is optimized better then gta4? a)yes i would, this game runs with better framerates while also looking drastically better then gta4 thank you for your time! buy this game without hesitation if your pc is similar or better then mine and you will have no issues!!!!",5
"already creamed my jenes, not even 5% in 10/10 hookers shanked",3
"hit a cat in the road and it launched my car 100 feet into the air - dont know how or why, but i will forever remember this game by that moment.",6
"the game that every pc gamer has being waiting for patiently delivers.",3
"its good but if it would let me link my xbox acount to get exclusive content it would be great",6
"do not buy. does not work. no help from steam or r*. id wait for a few days. not to blow my own trumpet but my rig is sweet, 1000 sweet. there is no way in hell that the game wont load due to my rig. all parties involved have gone quiet. do not buy! do not buy! do not buy! do not buy! do not buy! do not buy! do not buy! do not buy!",10
"maybe the best gta game to date. great port from console, awesome graphics and great fun. runs a lot smoother than gta iv on pc.",2
"loading simulator 2015 and when in you get bugs for days.",4
"my game keeps crashing when i try to play online, it keeps telling me that the game has closed unexpectly. always happens when im starting a mission or going in my apt. plz fix it or i want a refund",2
"rockstar managed to make this a great port, so its a no-brainer whether to get it or nah. 11/10",7
"if you can not log into the social club account that is linked to steam you can not activate this game. rockstar support wont help you. if you have this issue and buy this game, you wont be able to play.",1
"i cant seen to get my social club account to log in i have the correct user name and password",2
"riding a bicycle, forgot to speed up. yo ridin like my momma! using smartphone on sideroad, dead... 10/10 love the ol community!",5
"bought this game to play online with my friends, and do missions etc. but online doesnt even work. you can have an online character and you can start missions but if you have anyone in your friends list you cannot play with them or get in the same game. rockstar has even patched it already and you still cannot connect to friends or crew members. you will join and there will be 4 people in your lobby max but they will soon leave your game for one reason or another. basically because you are losing conenction to them.",2
"the game is great! both the campaign and online are good.",3
"i have waited a long time for this, and it couldnt be better.",4
"need to fix the servers hard to play with a group when you cant join them",10
"suprisingly its not that bad except the gta online china men community",2
"oh a dont hate me cuz im beautiful a, maybe if you got rid of that old yee-hee  haircut you got youd get some es on yo . oh better yet maybe taneesha would call your dog  if she ever stop ing with that brain surgeon or lawyer she be ing with....niiiggaahhh - what? 13/10.",3
"i bought this game for the online mainly.ive never been able to get into a game and its annoying.i demand a refund!",1
"1) its gta. 2) its incredibly well optimised. 3) graphics are immense. 4) lots of options to customise graphics settings. 5) in addition to single player, gta online is pretty damn fun. 6) it runs at 60 fps, like they said. 7) i want to kick the  out of a 90 year old granny sometimes, this game allows me to do just that.",4
"runs as smooth as butter on my gtx 570, even on high graphics. still looks better than ps4 even though my machine is not a beast.",2
"review for gta v online from programmer and game designer perspective. - gta v online feels just as crappy as a singleplayer with simple networking slapped on top of it. nothing technically amazing with a sloppy game design. - loading screen and lobby waiting problems are much worse than in left4dead2. - your are forced to connect to open world and spawn in it every time you want to join a lobby, what takes a lot of time. - there is no open world, but only separate world instances with only up to 32 players. - bad community. everybody loves steamrolling noobs who dont know about enter passive mode button. why it isnt enabled by default for new players ? - learning curve, you will need somebody to hold your hand when you just start playing. - barely achieves high fps and playable game smoothness on notebooks with gt 750m videocard. verdict: kinda nice game to play when youve got nothing else to do. but i do not recommend playing it online alone without friends. if you are buying it just for online features - its not worth the money.",1
"alot games dont really excite me these days - getting tired of poor physics and graphics. but gta v has been one of the most enjoyable games ive played in a while. personally tho, there is one con, theres no ads sensitivity setting. any game trying to pull off fps gameplay needs to know that fps players need the ads setting!",8
"absolutly ing amazing! running this with a gtx 780 and it couldnt be more beautiful!",3
"godlike game just best game ever guys, who cant enter it, sorry for you. but you can fix it by your own probably. gta v - awesomeeeee",2
"*spends $75 on game* *waits 6 hours for download* *caps internet after downloading 56gbs* *finally presses play* *gtav launcher has stopped working*..... fml all this because my microsoft username has a space inbetween my first and last name.....and still the official fixes dont work! good one rockstar.",4
"when i was playing max payne 3 i was running the game on normal graphics it was still amazing and the framerate was perfect and smooth so i decided to get gta v so heres the good . 1.its on pc 2.it has gamepad support 3.achivement the bad thing about this game is that the map texture is messed up the game has framerate drops and glitches easily when playing gta online they dont have the assist aim which sucks also the keyboard controll sucks they need to update game to make run on low graphic easy and fix the framerate",1
"absolutely amazing. nothing bad to say about the game itself, other than the fact that when i first started playing it driving around in the cars started to drop my framerate horribly from straight up 60, down to 5 or lower which really made me mad, but a couple of restarts of the game later bam its fine. 11/9",5
"this is simply a amazing game, there are a couple of bugs that really do have to fixed asap, but thats really to be expected with a pc port, the main problem i had, i managed to fix and you can find out how to fix it here",3
"social club failed to load due to an incomplete installation (code 4) methods given didnt work. 40 people found these methods helpful and 1000 didnt.. thats saying something. been a whole week now and still not one word about fixing these problems. the customer support is so poor, its hard to believe im experience this from a company that made 1 billon+ off this game.",1
"i crashed a plane into a building while listening to britney spears in first person. 12/10",2

"im gonna spew sheit here homies. game is fun. driving is ehh compared to how it was on console, dont know how u could fix that.. multiplayer is 10/10 on pc singleplayer is singleplayer flying is like... ew. my card is op so no peformance issues from me.. uhh good game gj rockstar",2
"probably the best game ive ever played in my life.",6
"stealing cars in gta: *steals a expensive car* yess this is so epic! *sees 1 scratch on the car* god dammit gaben!",4
"game is extremely buggy. audio gets choppy randomly, visual glitches on certain weather effects and time of day, camera randomly gets stuck on last team standing, game crashes after a while on a certain pilot school mission. i highly suggest waiting to purchase until they start patching.",7
"the king of open world ( for now) with the modding community making stuff and more content coming there is always some thing to do online single player is awesome online is way better comparaed to consoles 4k support / 60fps support / dx12 when out as always its best on pc ... steam even better ^_^ this game will proform as good as your pc will let it",5

"worse game ever!!!! cant  open this sh it. fix it rockstar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",8
"ill make this quick, played gta since the very first top down one on pc. i played them all and loved them all like we all have. so when the time gta5 came out i was waiting to maybe get it on a next gen console, so i waited and didnt play it even though it was killing me. fast forward, i never bought a ps4 or xbox one because im pretty much 100% pc at this point. so i had to wait and wait, and then it gets delayed and delayed. so yesterday i finally got to play this on pc in all its glory and wow, runs amazing looks great and is the same great gta type of game i expected. if anyone is on the fence about this because it may not run well, i wouldnt worry about it rockstar nailed it on the optimization for pc. im completely happy with it and cant wait to spend 100+ hours running over pedestrians.",4
"people say the online part of the game is boring considering the story mode. let me say you this, after completing the prologue, i thought i wanted to check the online mode a bit and maybe create a charater just for fun. now i cant leave online mode! its great. even the worse part of the game is incredibly fun and addictive. man, this is going to be a long ride... regarding to the performance; i know that the game kind of buggy on some systems but i have faith in rockstar that they will fix it eventually (maybe not in a fast way, though). its running on my system beautifully. even i dont have a high-end rig and playing with ok graphic settings, its a nice game to look at. i can probably continue this for pages so im just gonna leave it like this...you get the idea anyways...",6
"i bought gta v for my 360 when it first came out and played it often. the disc hardly left the drive as i continued to enjoy the game all the way up to the pc release. i can honestly say its a whole new game on pc. the graphics are stunning! there are lots of new things and im still getting used to the first person view, which im starting to prefer on foot. now mods are starting to come out and im really going to enjoy breaking outside of the barriers imposed of what rockstar intended in this game. my advice for anyone looking at this and thinking i already played it on my console, is to try it on pc. its not what you played before, and you wont look back. sure the story is much the same, but the mechanics and sheer beauty of gta v pc raises the bar to a whole new, very high level for the gaming industry.",3
"watch esl one katowice 2015 on twitch and get a cobblestone package. i sold it bought gta v. ing worth it. 10/10 would watch cs:go tournaments.",1
"wish there was a way to report hackers in gta online...",4
"edit: this isnt fun. i cant make it through the first heist with out the game crashing. at this point, ive probably made 10 or so attempts, just playing this heist over and over and over, the game crashing before i can finish it, and having to restart yet again. come the  on r*, fix your damn game. ----------------- running on a samsung 840 pro, two sli 780s, and an ocd i7-4930k. always over 60fps if im on high settings 1080p. not nearly as fast as i think i should be getting, though. as of the time of writing this review, ive played 3 hours worth and the game has crashed multiple times, which is kind of annoying. first person fov is . these things should be fixed with pathces and mods in time, though. hopefully.",2
"paying $80 just for seeing the game crashes all the time",1
"ok heres my story... it all began on my xbox 360 i was rank 15 on gta online and i was good at bounty hunting and then it all went down my xbox 360 decided it didnt want to ever connect to any wi-fi and then i didnt give it away i was only disconnected from xbox live so i could still play but after that i waited and waited for gta v to show up on steam and finally it happened it was glory to me and then i finally had joy it took 2 years for it it still crashes for so many people on pc and me but its so worth it",6
"its freaking awesome!!!! <3 <3 <3 beautifug graphics,amazing gameplay!!big difference from the ps3/xbox360 versions!!!",6
"best game ever 11/10 ! amazing story , amazing graphics!",5
"have some problem with social club, have to disable graphics card in device manager to get the game work. but beside that the game itself is very good port. run very smooth, high setting 1080p. this is gta v for pc you watting for. 9/10 recommended.",7
"its pretty good. all it needs now is the princess elsa stripper mod from gta iv and itll be a solid 10/10",2
"this is seriously the best gta i have ever played. this is the true gta v experience and this is how the developers wanted the game to be. i really really love this game! 10/10",5
"while the graphics still need to be optimized and there are plenty of things that could be fixed at the moment, the pc release blew me out of the water. the graphics in this game are astounding, and everything is much better than on the consoles. the heists are great and really tie the game together. i honestly feel as if i have been playing a beta on the consoles, and this is the final release of the game. like i said though, there are many things that could be fixed. (*points* talking to you rockster!) with some minor tweaks, this game could be epic. i look forward to the expansion of the gta v mod community, because ever since gta iv, they have been waiting to mod a game of this magnitude. things that would make this game perfect! *manual transmission option *fuel system *working mirrors on cars (rearview and sidemirrors)",6
"no longer have to put up with brucie calling me bro. 10/10 would buy again.",5
"windos 7 professional 64 bit, geforce gtx 970 4gb ftw, amd fx(tm)-8320 eight core processor, 2x8 = 16gb ram gta 5 runs really smooth with nearly maxed out video settings. i noticed some of the same bugs that the ps3 and ps4 have on the pc version. i had trouble downloading gta 5 for my pc since i kept getting a error disk space. i had over 120gb free even though it only recommends having 65gb. while the game was downloading & updating it was using over 100gb space on installing. once it installed and updated, i still had over 50gb. i recommend this game for any one with high specs & enough memory drive ;d",2
"for once, this is the first pc port i have ever bought for $60 to say that it was well worth the full price. game runs smoothly and i havent run into any major glitches so far on launch day. however, if you have a crappy pc, dont expect it to run well whatsoever. ive noticed this with some reviewers complaining that the game had limited video settings and bad lag just because their video card didnt have enough vram or their processor wasnt good enough to handle the load. aside from the windows user account name bug, the game is great. tl;dr: game is shiny and smooth, 5/5 would delay again.",4
"can i run this game on ; 4g ram ddr2 + amd phenom 965 + geforce gtx 630 ? yes you can! fps type of missions run smoothly however driving type of missions may choke a little but the game in general runs fine.",7
"dont buy this game is ing full of bugs nothing else i bought it and play a heist i made it 90 procent and was on the plane to the laning zone and i would make it with my friend then it ing crashed in the end i just say u have ing delay this 2-4 times and u cant ing fix a crash bug on like 9 months, im ing dissapointed. just wish i could get my money back",3
"no. i meet all of the requirements for this game, and when i try to play it takes forever to load, it lags extremely at the absolute lowest settings, giving me about 2-5 fps, and when you try to drive it just lags. my friend gets the same problems. you could also look at other reviews if you dont believe me. i wouldnt recommend getting this game until rockstar makes it more playable.",1
"i would like to tell you all my experience of gta v so far. had to delete half my steam games to fit it/uncompress it. when you open it with dxtory (one of the most popular recording softwares) it crashes every single time - so i have no idea of my framerate in game. i just got stuck in a glitch, the game was running a benchmark, and then the first mission started, forcing me to constantly fail the first mission as it glitched across the map to run the benchmark. 10/10 would buy again. i expected more from you rockstar",7
"yeah dont bother atm if youre planning on just playing gta online, it keeps crashing every 5 minutes. edit. game keeps crashing even on single player mode wait for a patch",2
"eyeballs burned from texture resolutions and 144 fps. great job rockstar 10/10 would burn retinas again.",1
"this would be a good game if it wasnt so buggy. online is almost impossible when theres bugs going on all the time. game crashes randomly. ive looked up specs and my machine exceeds requirements. character will stop right when opening door to get into car as if hes frozen in time, wont get in car. they made heists online so you have to have 4 people for most of them, most of the time you have an impossible time getting enough people to join your heist or even stay long enough to get it going, you need to have 3 people you know and are friends with on rockstar online to get a game going well. game crashes randomly and theres bugs. oh did i mention bugs? quit putting out games when you havent ironed all bugs out. patch this pos plz, and soon!",4
"a game about banging hookers and driving over civilians, and you cant even swear online. 10/10",6
"good port, once the random crashed and fps drops are fixed this is goty",4
"i cant even start playing the because of steam account linking issue, i contacted rockstar support but they are not answering our tickets since 3 days...",7
"ok, i edited my review because, after the new patch everything seems to work fine. it really sucks that when the launcher was crashing and i was unable to play, everybody just assumed that my system iwas  and i didnt know anything about computers when it was rockstars problem. steam support community doesnt exist. we should help each other, not critize everyone pcs, what a bunch of 10 years old, rockstar fanboys. saying that, the game is awesome and you should buy it right now. but you already knew that.",4
"aside from the mouse sensitivity being tied to the framerate (makes the 1st person view seem awkward and unnatural), which i assume will eventually be patched, it is a really solid port. i experienced no issues whatsoever getting the game to launch or run, and despite my low playing time as of this writing (~5 hours), no crashes. i7-4790k @ 4 ghz/gtx 970 on very high settings / high shadows / no msaa gets me ~70-90 fps @ 1080p with occasional dips into the 50s during high intensity action. online character transfer from ps3 worked on launch day except i had to go to the barber and change my eyebrows and remove lipstick; and i retained my vehicles as well. the bad: 100% sp progress did not transfer :-/",2
"well i have a gaming laptop and sadly to say this game doesnt work. i am of the many users who has an intel/amd gpu. ive tried the temp fixes listed on the several websites including rockstar still no good. i hope they fix nad make a patch soon. for now since i can even play it; its a no.",1
"best game so far ive played in my life, fancy graphics and an awesome storymode.",4
"11/10 would redelete  from my pc to download this 150gb game and spend 10 hours installing it",4
"all good..but in few minute i play keep getting this error (err_gfx_d3d_init)",4
"not much to say about gta v. port is great, scales very well. - best looking pc game? no - is it pretty? yes - is the story good? yeah, i love to be able to play for 3 different characters - hows the gameplay? well thats the only thing i hate about gta v. driving is fine, flying is fine, but shooting mechanics are just very poor, first person seems a bit unfinished and cops .. geez... they are ridiculous they just spawn anywhere at anytime, can see and shoot through anything - ahh i almost forgot no bloody money, money in gta v is so scarce that it is not even funny, the only way to really get money is to finish the game but leave assassination missions after (i did not know that) resolution superb game overall. complete and uttter must have. still some room to improve in gta 6",6
"its wonderful, it looks so good, even better than on ps3 and xbox. ive been enjoying this game alot. and i will for a very long time. this is so worth it. if your pc can handle it of course. you can even transfer your character from your ps/xbox to pc, so no worries.",7
"bought this game three times. 4k, 60fps, gta online.... what else needs to be said.",4
"no cousin roman 11/10 would not go bowling with that @#%%&$^*$^*#$^@#!#$!!! cousin again",9

"started the game and i didnt have a weapon. i stole a bus and got away from the cops. now i have a weapon.",1
"just another player that cant play due to bugs and crashing. waited 2 years for this garbage and cant even get past first mission without a crash. running i7 4930k, 16gb ddr3 2400 and 2 gtx 660ti in sli using recommended settings. ill change this when i can actually play the game, but right now im not a happy camper. update: it seems the refresh rate setting in game was causing the initial crashes. since i have a 120 hz monitor i set it to that in game. when i tried leaving it at 60hz the inital crashing stopped. now ive played for few hours and did a few missions, but im getting random err_gfx_d3d_init crashes to desktop telling me to reboot or reinstall the game. also im seeing a lot of screen tearing with or without v-sync, no difference. ill change this to positive once the crashes stop and they fix the graphics.",1
"this is like the console game, except better #pcmr",4
"my account was hacked along with many other peoples accounts and i have no been able to play since i can no longer log into social club (someone changed my email and password) and rockstar has been pretty mute about the whole subject up to this point. so far i had around 3 days to play and the person who stole my account has had about a week to play... i pretty much just paid steam and rockstar $60 to make my hard drive 60-70gb smaller...",2
"ok, the single playercampaing is really nice, cool characters, involving story etc. multiplayer, on the other hand is bad. matchmaking only works in this game if you have frineds, in this case you wouldnt spend hours in empty ques. because of the ques, there is literally nothing to do, yeah the races, store burglaries, stealing cars and deathmatches are all there, but guess what, you in a 2 hour gameplay you will spend 1 hour 45 minutes trying to find somebody to play with. and the loading times in multiplayer is insane. all this fuzz about heists, great times etc - i cant see, because frankly i dont have the patience for waiting instead of playing.",4
"totally worth the wait and the 60 euros. thank you rockstar <3.",6
"5 days from launch and still i cant play almost 50% cant play and rockstart is not showing any message of them knowing of the problem or if they are trying to fix it at this point i would not recommend the game cus you have a 50% chance of not being able to play for now i would say i dont recommend it but if they fix all those launch problems so everybody can play i am probably changing my opinion and if the game runs smoothly and they all those who still cant play (including me) lets just hope for a fix soon",2
"jesus christ.... i loved it on xbox and i love it even more on pc. great communtity and amazing graphics. 10/10 would be  to get this game.... again.",3
"never have to hear hey niko! its your cousin roman, lets go bowl - 11/10 ign",5

"went to the gas station, bought all their beer, got drunk and stole a car. after joyriding for a bit i ran over a bunch of nudists and ended up dying in pool. 10/10 would make my way downtown again",4
"one of the best launches i have experienced. the game is very well optimized, and runs extremely well. once you get past the social club stuff, its incredible.",4
"its like the console versions, except looks better and things load faster. would recommend",2
"dont buy! its bugged and doesnt start. stuck att loading... for ages! a big waste of money!!!",2
"game is good. i was very intersted in the rockstar editor but now not so much. made a video. spent 4 hrs. on it and the damn thing wont upload to youtube or the social club. idk if i will ever make another due to the issues.",4
"this is a great game that i would strongly recomend to anyone who loves just cause, other gta instalments or even open world adventure/action games. it has a vast array of activities or missions from killing cops to doing yoga (as featured in one of the many trailers). although it may be fun, the many activities are kind of a selling point for the game and generally they give way to the imfamous ultra-violence typical to gta. basically, some of the games are used only to boast of the games size and people maily will ignore them. i strongly recomend that you read and compare the system requirements due to the fact that it is a very demanding game and that playing gta 5 in 600x800 with half a second delay is, while semi-playable, extremly disapointing and worth nowhere near the cost of the game. i would deffinetly recomend the game to any casual or extreme gamer as it is an all-round fun time (+ we pc gamers get to laugh at the console players trying to aim on controller!!!).",1
"its like playing r21 the sims, theres nothing not to love about gta 5.",10
"definetly much better then watch_dogs. this atmosphere of 90-s aka max payne with snow and old police cars in the pro-logue made me to decide that this game is going to be exciting. already recommending as its a very interesting title",1
"great game, despite some issues that im having while playing, like lagging. otherwise its really good.",4
"i am sorry i must change my review because i downloaded a patch from nivdia and it worked. this game was good on filthy consel but now at 4k it is amazing and i would say to any one with at least a nivdia gtx 860 and 1080p display to buy this game if not go to the discrace of gaming and play it on consel. 9.5/10",2
"since im not an idiot, im not going to give this a bad review just because i had trouble playing it as soon as it launched. the actual game itself is great. it looks nice, sounds nice, and plays well. definitely worth the wait. i definitely like the extra customization options for gta online characters. p.s. dont trust negative reviews that complain about it not working the second it was released. babies shouldnt even be allowed to right reviews.",2
"all i want to say is: the glorious pc master race 60 fps 4k 3d lord gaben",3
"lot lot of problems...i m tryint to solve one of the problems and cant do anything....its just a p!ece of sh!t",1
"great improvements over the console version and a solid port. has a lot of crashing issues that will hopefully be patched in the coming weeks. crashing however leads to you getting black marks if you leave during a gta online job. if youre crashing a lot it would be wise to stay away from the match maker until the game is more stable so you dont get put in games with s all the time.",2
"lester is the best written character in a video game ive ever seen.",7
"its a good game. pc controls are surprisingly not . good old hooker killing fun. 10/10",1
"love this game,seriously its great...if it works. how hard is it to get a game right on launch after its been delayed for what,3 months now? seriously dissappointed. cannot even launch it without crashing.",2
"third time ive bought it. xbox 360- xbox one- pc. you dont shell out $180 for a game unless its as good as gta 5. also its the most fun benchmarking software on the market. already melted a friends gpu on day one. edit- gta v can be played on 8g of memory. if youre ram crashing on memory like i was its probably virtual memory. youtube how to add virtual memory, super easy. but this still uses about 6 gigs of physical for me. so maybe 4 gigs if you had nothing else open. -my original stupidity post- (((this game cant be played with 8 gigs of ram. if it can, im doing something incredibly wrong. 1920x1080 and 720p with everything as low as it will go and ram crashes on the second mission.))))",5
"i cant play my key says already in use and now my account is locked. edit 1: at the beginning i couldnt play by two days. but rockstar support fix my bug thanks you ale s. rockstar supporter.",10
"it still has some technical issues, nonetheless the game itself is perfect! it runs smooth generally but there are occasional crashes and glitches.",9
">buy game >friends have already been playing for a few days now >they want me to do a mission with them >start mission and get to the very end >friend hits a rock at 140mph and flies into the air >kills us both 11/10 would redo the mission again.",5
"all i can say is thank you rockstar! hands down the best gta of the series! and definetly the best pc version of the gta series yet! this game is highly optimized on my rig, and you can tell that rockstar put a lot of effort into making it so! well worth the wait!",5
"love this game <3 optimization 11/10 just perfect! game atmosphere 11/10, general rating 11/10 more than perfect",6
"the best gta ever better than any other gta great graphic and great story mode cant find some bugs",2
"dose any one know how to get the adivition code or can you not play the game with fam share?",3
"i keep reading about people having issues with this game, i feel really lucky i did not have any issues....at least not on my laptop. my rog laptop is a mid-range pc with win 8.1, i7-4700hq, gtx-850m, 8gb ram and a 1tb 850 evo ssd, the game looks good and is buttery smooth with zero lag. i was afraid of shuddering like in watch_dogs but there is none. i only played an hour, but so far its a fun game.",3
"at the point of this writing, i have put over 32 hours into this game so far, i have only completed about 30-32% of the single player and i havent touched the multi player as of yet. the game is so much fun its insane. the music and talk programs grab my attention so much that all i do is ride around on motorcycles and listen to them. they are a few minor issues like random frame drops, but they are more annoying than game breaking. this is a great port; i highly recommend buying this game. 8/10. p.s: give my bro trevor some love too, just like franklin",4
"there are few things that pisses me off in gta v but the most annoying is time after death! yes, when you die your screen gets gray and with big wasted leathers ower it and it lasts 3 seconds.... i am playing this game only to enjoy in good ragdolls after death but here i cant even enjoy in that 3 sec. thats big minus to this game in my opinion. other negative stuff from game: - cops insta kill you usually, 1 shot from 10+ m and your gone from full hp - some bushes are indestructible and can stop every vehicle from full speed (it will stop airplane in place...) - in gta5 online many parts of game are missing, like animals, taxi... - in gta5 online all players are shown in map so you cant sneak up on someone or play without stalkers",4
"this game is an absolute gem! you need to add this masterpiece to your library.",5
"it didnt work and i had to disable my graphics card and reenable for it to launch, but i could care less because this is one of the best games ive ever played. best in class at everything. smooth as butter, runs better than gta iv on my computer. single player is worth it alone. gta online is worth it alone.",3
"crashes evertime u finish the first hesit setup after droping lecster off at your crip sort it out steam or give me a full refund its not working same old story with steam crash blank screen crash my pc should easily handle this game",5
"game crashes at start and does not work. would not buy.",1
"best version of gta5 out there. played xbox 360 version, but the pc version 1ups the xbox360 in so many ways. worth it.",4
"this is an awesome game! ive already used 25+ hours on gta online. 9.5/10 game buy it!",9
"havnet played too much but oh man is it just as fun as i remembered. game runs really well and it looks gorgeous. if you havent played it before youre really missing out on an awesome story and an awesome world na thats not even taking into account the online mode which adds so much more.",3
"i dont think anyone needs any introduction to this game so i will just comment on the port. the game runs perfectly at 60+ fps with all high settings with my gtx 970 sli. the new feature of having your own custom radio station that plays your music is a really great feature, just put your music files or shortcuts (both work) in the user music folder found usually at c:usersyour usernamedocumentsrockstar gamesgta vuser music. after putting the files just perform a quick scan in the in-game audio options and you are ready. my only gripe with this game is that it will be tied to your social club account and in case you lose the account then you wont be able to play the game anymore.",3
"excellent port, runs very smooth on my pc (except for the odd graphics driver crash which i expect will be fixed soon). i get around 55fps @ 1440p on my gtx 970 & i7 (4ghz no oc).",6
"for a game that has been delay 5 months, and released 18 months from the initial release, having any bugs is utterly unaceptable. upon launching my game the social club launcher crashes with no error codes. ive tried every fix that rockstar and fans have put out, but all to no avail. when this game did initially work for 3 hours, i must admit that it was a fantastic port.",5
"tried to take a selfie, got flattened by a sports car going 100mph 11/10",5
"as of now rockstar has kept there promise of great version for pc and even though its insallation process takes a while, its all worth it once you get into this game.. people cant get mad over a install process its just going to take longer as we get into the future (for any game)..",3
"this is a in joke , kept retrying over and over again but it just wont work , we have been waiting for 2 years to get this . gg rockstar thanks alot.",4
"4/10 too many frames per second, needs a better cinematic experience. said no one ever.",7
"i love this game too much ,this is my favorite gameplay ever :)",7
"hands down one of the best games i have ever played.",10
"sadly did not pass the loadingscreen as of now. infinite loading. will update if the game will start.",1
"its working fine now but i had to deinstall the antivirus program (bullguard)",4
"its here on pc now, is it worth it? yes! rockstar did a great job with the graphics and the game looks great with lots of attention paid to details and evnironments. they also did a great job with bringing life into the characters. the game runs completely maxed 1920x1080 on my system with full antialiasing (i7 4930k @ 4.5ghz and a gtx 980 4gb with 32gb of memory) and i get 50-60 fps constantly. its really fun, a big improvement from gta iv. driving is a little tough at first, but once you get the hang of it, its much better than in gta iv.",5
"i got it working now it was worth the cancerous wait and launcher price, i wouldnt pay for it again, but it is worth considering",1
"one of the best ports ive ever played. i owned every version of the game (ps3, ps4 and now pc) and this version is by far the best. not just because of the fact that it looks and runs amazing, but also it just feels right on pc. playing in first person really feels like youre playing a completely different game! all in all, buy it, play it, and love it.",2

"i just flew a plane into a building. 9/11 would play again",8
"this game is just perfect. the graphics are amazing, and with astounding performance. my pc shouldnt be able to run max settings under and circumstances yet somehow i can and keep a very stable 60+ framerate. this game is detailed beyond belief, the developers put in every single detail, no matter how small they are and it adds the nicest touch to the game, making it that much better. the first person mode was done brilliantly. they went to the largest extent possible, adding in great animations and a variety of options. the options for first person go beyond the extent of some other fps games, adding in things like head bob control, and an fov slider, which many of the modern military shooters today simply dont have. get this game, its worth well above $60. the build quality on everything in this game is just amazing. the developers obviously put a lot of hard work into the game, and you should support them.",4
"dont buy this game. it doesent work for at least half the people who have. its not worth the gamble.",2

"bought this game and cant play it. very very bad! it think the game itself is great, but for that day-1 desaster rockstar deserves some bad reviews.",6
"it was really really good and then it got revoked from my account because the guy i bought it from did a chargeback on his credit card. ive sent a steam ticket to try and get it back but they probably wont respond for a while and even if they do i dont know if ill even get the game or my 22 keys back. 10/10 the worst thing is its all my fault",2

"10/10/10/10! what an amazing game. it was amazing on the ps4 when i played it, and im so glad i bought it for the pc as well. i bought a new computer rig for it, and i play at 1080p nearly max settings all and get a smooth 60 fps! what an improvement from gta 4! i really do hope they release some fun dlcs, but i am also excited about seeing mods in the game! do you like cars, planes, helicopters, pure.. mayhem? gta 5 is for you! it is the ultimate amalgamation of fun! anything can happen in this game.. anything.. dont miss out!!",9
"day 1)online broke , to many  trying to get on the servers.",5
"game is fun as a sandbox game and a singleplayer game, the rest is tedious as hell. not worth the high price",5
"ive played gta v on the xbox and was blown away. once i got it here, however, i will never think about going back to the console for this masterpiece of a game. it runs fantastic; looks amazing; and the 1st pov makes it feel like a completely new game. this is how you port a game. this is how you make a game! it has everything you could possibly want. no point in reviewing the game itself. if you dont know what it is by now, then it obvisouly is not something youd enjoy. suffice it to say, this version is the version to own. it runs on a wide variety of pcs - up and down the spectrum. if you can run it with the settings turned up, wow. you are in for a treat. shut up and give them your money. you wont regret it.",3
"rockstar seems to be taking a page from nintendo with this port. the idea that you should only play an hour or so (with breaks inbetween) is strictly enforced by rockstar, as the game will forcibly shut itself down at regular intervals. thank you for looking out for the health of your consumers, rockstar. <3",7
"load times are insane, lobbies are never full and when they are you arent able to actually get in the game. in the time ive played the game crashed my brand new gtx970s drivers twice. i should not have pre-ordered this.",4
"ok, first, i have to say: why dont you already have this game? and secondly, if you do own the game and are just reading the reviews for chuckles, hello! the silly review (since this game deserves it): upon playing the first time, i was pulled over by a police officer in the small truck-stop town of paleto bay, while driving a rusty tractor down the interstate. probably for going too slow on my journey back to los santos and holding many a semi truck back. then, while waiting for the officer to come around to me, i see his car and him scooting by, being rammed by a small pickup. the pickup was then blown up by a sniper team in a helicopter, for assaulting an officer. continued to los santos on my tractor without further interruption. the serious review: uhhh... later. ive, uhm, still gotta finish the game. pc forever!",7
"this is an edited review. after a not so great launch it seems as though impleting some fixes has now made my game stabe. this is what i have seen so far from the single player the best gta there has ever been, the story is amazing. i am running it on a medium tier pc, an i5 2500k overclocked to 4.0ghz and a gtx660 gpu and 8gig of ram, i am able to get a constant 60fps with high to normal settings with aa and vsync on and i can only imagine after patches i will be able to push it a little further but i am quite happy with how it looks and runs on my hardware. this game is a must buy especially if you have been waiting for the pc release and have not played it on console. i have not played much online as yet but i have watched plenty of livestreams of online play and the scope of it just seems amazing with more than enough to do, it will be a game i will be playing every moment i have free time this year for sure. nothing short of an amazing game!",5
"completed this game on ps3 in 2013 and just got done with the story on pc and i still recommend this game to the fullest. i love it.",9
"was looking forward to it, but stuck being unable to play it due to rockstar station issues!",8
"the best game of this year just wanna say thanks for rockstar make a loot pc gamers hope happen now and yea keep playing this game for while :d",6
"a must have game! aside from all the bugs, making it feel like early access, its super awesome.",7
"if you can get it to work, its really freaking a whole lot of fun, this game has redeemed itself, it gets a thumbs up from me. if your fps are really low, make the second slider in advanced graphic turn off",3
"although it is an amazing game, it requires the worlds beefiest computer. it has no graphics setting for adjustment and is un-playable in current state. would not reccomend to a friend 4 doritos out of 8 mountain dews",1
"only in this country do they let blind people drive! 10/10",10
"stunning visuals, flawless performance, and some of the most immersive animations ive seen in a game. highly recommended.",5
"rockstar worse than ea. 10/10 would not waste 59.99 and 3 months of excitement again.",1
"this is better than some league of legends or cs go ! must buy this game. multiplayer is the best ! 10/10 btw got this game because i selled cs go knife :p",7
"radeon hd 7850 i5 3570k windows 7u works perfectly, the best game ever.",5
"5 days from launch and still i cant play almost 50% cant play and rockstart is not showing any message of them knowing of the problem or if they are trying to fix it at this point i would not recommend the game cus you have a 50% chance of not being able to play for now i would say i dont recommend it but if they fix all those launch problems so everybody can play i am probably changing my opinion and if the game runs smoothly and they all those who still cant play (including me) lets just hope for a fix soon",2
"bought every version of this game for each platform from day one release dates, and i have to say it gets better each purchase :d",5
"so i just installed gta 5 to my laptop (ihave nvidia 870m), after i opened up the game the right bottom bubble said gta5.exe has been blocked from graphic hardware and the game stopped working. i opened geforce experience to look for an update or something, but the app said the driver was unknown, it couldnt find the driver. after i restarted my computer it gave a blue screen report that says video_tdr_failure (nvlddmkm.sys) and when i opened up geforce experience again it couldnt not find any hardware. i tried to install the driver again but the installation program couldnt find the hardware either. i believe the problem is the new release of gta 5. also my gpu tweak program says the laptop is currently using intel graphics. after all these happened i contacted you and you told me that you should contact with the manufacturer. and i did that too and got my geforce experience fixed. this time when i open up the game my laptop shutted itself down 3 times. then i optimized the game from geforce experience. then it gave the blue screen again and there is no hardware detected again. i can fix it again but i dont think i can play the game again to not get the same crash.",2
"does not work after the 1.01 patch. the game hangs every time i try to go beyond the main menu.",3
"pc> console, is all i can say. after almost 2 years we can say it was worth the wait.",5
"game is great. to quote some of the worlds top-men, so much to do, so much to see, so whats wrong with taking the backstreets? but if you have a laptop like me, you can screw off. because just like dying light, this game just takes a huge dump on mobile graphics cards. gl hf",3
"on my chest and call me nancy this game runs in fine!",3
"played alot of this on ps4... even better on pc. great optimization. that was pretty much the only worry on pc. millions of reviews have been out... the port is solid. able to remain above 40 fps always at 1440p maxed out with just a single 290. much better than anticipated. even shows you how much vram is going to be used as you adjust settings. great looking game.",2
"godly graphics even with my not so top notch pc. really rate this game. 21/10 xd",4
"this piece of garbage keeps crashing. totally unplayable - crashes as soon as i drive off with lamar on the very first mission. ive had to trouble shoot and research countless message boards with friends who are pc experts themselves and we cannot find a solution - countless hours wasted. the game is playable for them with minor crashes from time to time however. if you do not have time to f**k around like myself,l maybe a wait a while before purchasing this game as it is not 100% complete. there are multitudes of threads online regarding crashes and issues such as: gta 5 pc mega crash thread. utterly dissappointed with this multi million dollar company who could have invested a little more in ensuring a much more successful launch for all. great game? yes it was on the ps3 despite many bugs and issues but it was still playable. but on pc? perhaps wait for rockstar to iorn out the s**t they should have done int he first place and purchase this game when the prices come down.",3
"game is awesome!!! lots of glitching due to the fact its only been out a week but , 9/10 , someone should really make a zombie apocalypse mod",6
"oh boy,gta v on the pc the textures,the fps everything so perfect but the best thing about this game is that its actually fun driving around los santos mountains with your friends on an pick up truck driving around the city while your friends shoot out of the windows killing some noobs flying a plane across the map with your crew and jumping out to skydive robbing a bank to get some money to spend on hookers the list goes on and on baby",5
"i was so excited to finally be able to play gta v (as i have no console that can play it). i run a mediumish machine (skyrim medium-low settings, league of legends medium-high settings, minecraft maximum settings) so i figured i would be able to run this game at medium-low settings and achieve 25-30 fps. this did not happen. i was running minimum settings, everything was popping in and out with extreme pixelization on everything not 5 feet from my character, 15 fps, and a 1-2 second input delay - all of this occuring even during cutscenes. i am extremely dissapointed with how incredibly unoptimized this game is. also the lack of steam workshop support is incredibly dissapointing. if i could play this game i would definitely want to mod it.",1
"very well optimized. i cant believe my hd 5770 can handle 60 fps.",5
"gta, no more words needed, everyone knows its awesome :)",3
"i pre-ordered 2 months ago, installed game on the release date, started game, game asked for cd key i used it and it said its already used. im not the only one who has this problem, i see loads of people complaining about this on twitter and rockstar doesnt care.. 10/10 wouldnt waste money again..",2
"r   dual graphics notebook simply can not enter the game. tune into the only significant in game error stop work, integrated graphics direct black. r if you had any conscience would immediately push updates. otherwise, you have so many players?!!!!",3
"love the game so far! i havent noticed any problems yet.it just took some time @ the launch of the game. im running it with msi gtx970 and a i7-4790 with 16gb ram. really amazing graphics and game! i recommend it :) 10/10",3
"this is the third time ive bought this damn game and i am still in love with it, the 60fps alone makes this worth buying, then when you think about the mods that are coming you would be a fool not to buy this game. as for any problems with the game, ive only encountered a few bugs but no crashes or issues with rockstar service, gta online logs in faster then on the consoles from my experience.",2
"man this awesome. i already had excepted that i had to play this game on low-medium settings on my gaming laptop. but this game runs smooth as f!#$ on pretty much high settings. just once in a while, while driving it gets stuttery, because of loading i guess and probably my rigs fault. this is surely the best gta version out there. seems like i will have to call in sick for the next few months :d",3
"pros- no roman bellic. looks great. skills/rpg system. low system requirements so i can run the game on pretty high graphics. edit: my online charaters no longer look like zebras. cons- no roman bellic. poor optimisation at lower graphics qualities. 1/5 of people who bought it cant play the game. edit: takes a ing year to load anything edit: sound sometimes ceases completely. edit: its impossible to stop single player from automatically loading if you leave the title screen for more than ten seconds. i leave the worst to last. no bowling with your fat, annoying eastern-european cousin. or a jamaican bloke. or a woman who inevitably betrays you. 2/10 will give better rating if roman bellic added",5
"while at the time of writing this there is an error which makes it difficult to launch this game with an nvidia graphics cards, i still wholeheartedly recommend it. los santos could not be more beautiful and ornate and, speaking from the experience of having playing the ps4 version extensively, the smooth 60 fps is a magnificent change, and the optimization is perfect(almost worth the 500 day wait.) load times are much better too(although i shouldnt raelly compare a port this great to its console counterparts.) my only gripe about the game itself is a. that they didnt port saved outfits(minor, but noticeable) and b. that the camera in the map creator could use a little work. otherwise, wondeful job, well worth the money.",6
"shot up a strip club with a friend in glorious 1080p @ 60fps this is what ive been waiting for",2
"a very good game the best i played ever fun interesting looks great .",4
"my pc was fully updated before installing the game i started the game and it worked perfectly as i was not expecting it to run smoothly the game it self is fun to play there is no good tooltip and hints to help you during ur game play and this is theonly bad thing so far!! what i recommand everyone iis that they turn on the in game subtitle as the dailogs are extreamly good and perfectly made that is the most thing i loved",8
"there are a few problems to be ironed out. id prefer to be able to save at any point in the game but waddya gonna do? graphics are better than just acceptable, they are excellent! im getting 60fps using both of my gtx650ti sli. it sees all 4096mb of vram and the game is using about 3gb total. the cards are running about 80-85c and both fans are howling. i just realize ive been playing this game for about 9 hours today. not sorry i spent the money!",4
"cannot play this game in true offline mode. yes the game will start if steam is offline but the game still wants the rockstar-social-club to be online. is rockstar going to fix this? until they do this is a risky buy at 40 when the person cannot start the game unless there is a internet connection. i do 100% recommend the game but i would like an option to play in true offline.",1
"love it !! its just awesome the online with couple of friends and just own the city :) 11/10",7
"10/10 i love this game! fun to play with my friends :d ps need donation on cs:go skins now that i have none.",6
"yes, i would recommend this game. a couple things first. (i can only vouch for amd) the game is not optimized for pc yet. it crashes randomly, i get ballz fps drop when driving, flying, ect (i have an amd 6970 in crossfire. thats 4gb video memory) around 30-45 fps, and the graphics option and advanced graphics options dont really give that much. it needs more options and locations on how to change this. i cant even edit it manualy through the file browser in windows where its installed. i love the cut scenes and story mode but if the game isnt optimized i cant even play it! rockstar please fix this. i know its all softwear sided. many pc gamers have been waiting forever, including me, for this game to come out and the least you could do is make it run smooth.",7
"thanks console peasents for beta testing this for 2 years so we could get a better game than you.....and the best part is no gfwl. pc master race ftw",9
"um i have... problem, can anyone else transfer their ps/xbox character? i cant...",3
"some people are having empty lobby issues or not being able to launch or install, but for me i run perfectly fine, no lag, no empty glitched lobbies, no crashes. (gtx 760 and i7 here) blew my 1 mil online bonus on muggers and mercenaries and strippers. 11/10 would preorder 5 months in advance again",7
"bare boobs at strip club 15/10 would kill strippers again.",6
"the game is great except for one thing. i really hate how im crashing multiple times in row for me and then being fine for maybe an hours. i feel like paying this much for the game and it being capatable for me i shouldnt have to deal with these kind of problems.",2
"no gfwl, great pc remake/port (w/e you want to call it). can only complain about some stutter experienced at some points and hopefully itll get patched (no i dont run gta v on a potatoe). happy heisting!",5
"how the  do i mute people online 0/10 scottish kids are annoying.",3
"love this game. graphics looks amazing. have great fun with friends. and the best thing have no issues since release no errors no game crashes. thx rockstar.",8
"best login screen slimulator, cant even go online. pc master race 10/10",1
"day 10 of playing and found 2 or 3 nmissions crash on completion everytime its most annoying ,un able to continue game , ive found the only thing to do is delibrately die during mission and then retry, do this 3 times then have option to skip mission then you able to continue with game , a few camera angle issues that will get on ya nerves too , apart from that usual gta fun ,will not recommend due to annoying game crashes ( wish there was a neutral on the fence button )",4
"its a great game if you have a spare pc you dont need for anything else, after install my pc went from 4 seconds upstart to 5 min, impossible to use coz harddisk is in 100% use (and yes i know how swap works and checked it). also my browser is 100 times slower to use and i need to restart firewall to control it now. my new pc is now acting like a 2001 pc. this game works like a virus, but its a great game dont get me wrong.",5
"so far it seems perfect for me at least ,game is at max settings everything looks amazing and is runing smooth super happy im not sleeping tonight i havent wanted to play a game the way i want to play this one in a while it feels good hope everyone is enjoying it .",9
"pre ordered gta 5 at the second it came out.finaly launch the game i say  single player go into online have half a million spend it in 5 min ya!!!tryed to buy shark cards my socila club store is not working i find a website rockstar warehouse going to buy my slef 16 mill. idk what to spend it on and i finished the first heist and now i cant do another one because no 1 wants to join. the best game ever results u can spend any amout of in game cash in 5 mins to 10 max sing in the shower and every one can hear u ur charecter never uses a toilet and every one calls u italina or mexica love this game !!!!",5
"my review is as simple as this..... i would probably love the game if i was actually able to play it. i get owned when clicking play and nothing happens.... 0/10 - for the time being.",2
"pro: good so far, pretty much what i expected. con: really lacking joystick and wheel support for flying/driving. this is pc, why cant i use any other input device than xbox/mouse & keyboard?",2
"this game needs no introduction as i believe it is known worldwide. high anticipated and game of the year. everything you need is there, ranging from graphics, sceneries, storyline, multiplayer, gameplay, driving and most of all it is worth everything it cost.",2
"so good that i forgot to wank. so i went to the strip club...",7
"spine stomped a body builder to death and the rest fled like french people good game",5
"game wont even run, going to get a refund and buy it on xbox one. if they could atleast put out some info on when we could expect a patch or something but absolutely left in the dark which makes it seem as if they arent even working on anything otherwise they would mention it somewhere. save your money until you are 100% sure itll work.",1
"pretty well optimized update to gta: san andreas, i rate it v/v.",2
"it doesnt work. dont waste your time. dont waste your money.",3
"much better than grand theft auto 4. one of the best games of 2015. buy it and you wont regret it.",3
"rockstar support is amazing, they supported me all my items back and made me feel like a loyal client, thank you rockstar and the great lady who supported me keosha_m is the best!",5
"! a week has passed the game still does not work on many laptops amd. these  probably never correct their mistakes",5
"went to a strip club, got drunk, got into an abandoned helicopter, flew it into the ocean, got out, punched a hooker, got killed by the cops 10/10 would recommend.",3
"fps rate is really well, even much more smooth than old gta4. rockstar did a good job !",6
"20/10 why gta 5 is the best 1 the graphics 2 the map 3 multiplayer 4 invest money in storymode 5 do activites :d",4
"graphic is 10/10 getting 60 rate. took half my hard drive space and well worth it 60.6 or more gigs for the game.",3
"brilliant, brilliant! this game perfomance fantastic even on low end hardware thank you rockstars for porting the game from the get go. graphically this game surpases any next gen console, only if watch dogs had looked like this and perfomed this well.",4
"overall the game is good but there are a lot of crashes, i hope to fix it recommend buying",3
"10/10 a console pleb in my skype call got angry at me for having 60+ fps would wait 2 years again",5
"already played on ps3. appart some minor launch bugs everything is nice and looking good. i cant say really good untill i get a new pc ^^ cant say much about multiplayer. if it becomes like on consoles you wont have much fun outside friend sessions. 90% griefing. so what else could i say? its gta! and now get the  off and play the damn game already!",4
"+ the graphics are amazing + the game runs well on most of the systems and it is well optimized + the controls are comfortable + easy to switch from single player to multi-player + the rockstar editor + no problem with shooting or driving while using a keyboard and a mouse + the cops are ing dangerous - first-person fov needs to be bigger - long loading times in gta online - sometimes gta online crashes - sometimes all players randomly disconnect in gta online - really annoying when people randomly start talking through microphones in gta online and you cant mute them is this game worth 60 euro? in my opinion yes, after all the delays it runs well, but some bugs need to be fixed and the performence, in general, in grand theft auto v online needs to be improved. hopefully a patch in a week or so will fix the problems. i will update later on.",5
"the best just got better! one of the most iconic games to ever exist.",6
"i realy wont to play it but it dont work;( its sayes gta v stoped working somone help me please",7
"basically a definitive version of console gta with new stuff",9
"hadnt played this game on console at all due to wanting to wait for the pc version and it was definitely worth it! this game has been loads of fun. all the aspects of it, from single player to the multiplayer (which in my opinion is the piniacle of this gta experience) is spot on! so many different things to do to keep you and your friends busy for hours on end! and the heists are just great fun! i recommend this to everyone out there if youve liked any of the gta games of the past.",5
"the game is extremely optimized for pc. i can say that it runs smoother compared to gta iv, which was a terrible port ;(",6
"in thai :  dependency mfreadwrite.dll is missing . please reinstall the game.   in english: i try to play grand theft auto v after downloading it through steam, have the key code and it said: dependency mfreadwrite.dll is missing. please reinstall the game. and i did not know where to reinstall it at with steam and they directed me here. please let me know what to do",1

"it does have the same good features of the console version but youd need a very solid pc to run it efficiently. i particularly had problems with playing gta online. shame really as thats what i was looking forward to. my pc was made with gaming in mind but it struggles with this game. only purchase if you have the hardware to go for it. the recommended specifications are where your pc specs should be minimally. you have been warned!",1
"payed a hooker to blow me, killed the hooker afterwards. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$",6

"game of the year !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",9
"thanks rockstar, i paid 40 for a game that wont even give me an error message. this is the kind release from ea.",4

"awesome owned it on ps3 and bought it again on pc. i have a radeon 7870 and can run on max settings. a side note if you experience lag after 20-30 minutes disable fxaa and msaa and that completely removed the lag for me.",4

"i cant play gta ol... it is always loading ol mode, why?",5
"aah so many lags its good but a patch should be released coz while driving a car it hangs alot though i have good specs !!! worth buying but after the patch",4
"the game is not even working for me. the almost-3-hours-of-gameplay-on-record are just trying to launch the game. still waiting for a fix. until then, im downvoting. --edit:-- rockstar fixed the problem in the recent patch (17/4/15). singleplayer: pros: -its gta damnit. cons: -you wont play it because you have gta online. multiplayer: pros: -its like gta iv online, but much better. cons: -a few annoying bugs, for example: unable to drive when entering a car, camera does not follow the player. -long loading time. tldr: best game 11/10 would throw my money at rockstar again.",4
"if you buy this game quit your day job.if you dont want to quit you should probably file a claim for maternity leave to your boss. 11/10",7
"grand theft auto 5 is an amaz- oh hold on someone left the heist lobby.",7
"ok if you have the gta launcher issue go on device managers, display adapters and disable your video card then it should run then enable the next time you start the game. now for the review its worth every penny. the gameplay is smooth, the game is great looking, havent tried online but ive heard very positive stuff about it and the game is just simply very very fun. if your pc can run this is a must buy",9
"damn after all this waiting, now im finally able to play gta 5 with mouse and keyboard!!",6
"perfect just... wow. perfect the grafics the everything this is one hell of a game <3 <3",2
"now i can play without that black annoying rasta from gta 4,good job rockstar games gta 5 ruleees.",6
"everything that is fun from previous games, plus a bunch of new fun stuff too. and none of that relationship garbage.",1
"this game is superbly ported. if you havent played it on pc, then youve never truly played the game the way its meant to be played. i am surprised of how this game run incredibly smooth and it just look amazing!",9
"love it. fun to play with freinds and just do what ever you want",5
"i cant get enough of this game. i originally bought it on ps3 and didnt hesitate to buy it for pc. do yourself a favor and get it! the singleplayer and the online modes are both unique and truly great experiences. prepare to be immersed in the most feature rich and detailed gta world ever created. everything from the characters, to the setting, and the atmosphere is absolutely breathtaking. 9/10 definitely buy.",6
"finally, rockstar made something that the pc masterrace can be proud of.",2
"headache of a game to get working, my pc is not a toaster, the launcher still dont work tried everything, even cutting off my scrotum for sacrifice",4
"amazing but why canr i aim right like its no aiming",6

"well, it seems rockstar did a good port this time, unlike they did with gta iv. i`m having no issues so far. the game runs great on my mid-range pc, and it looks way better than it did on my ps3.",2
"ive put in over 200+ hours in this game on the 360, and got this version. i have had no issues while playing for the hour or two i have, and from what i can tell its a good port, i have a gtx 765m card and can run this about medium settings at 60 with few drops. this game is definietly worth 59.99. the story is great, loved every bit of it. 3 characters and interchanging them in different missions was very creative and made the missions feel more dynamic. the gameplay is great, with the pc version comes first person and at first it sounded like a gimmick but it really is useful, aiming is great while in first person and when getting in a firefight i love to use first person to aim. driving is very fluid and you can do some great tricks. so far the pc release has been finnicky for starting it up, but if it works its great! if it doesnt from what i heard sucks, but i believe that within the week rockstar will fix the issues. overall rating: 8.5/10",5
"grand theft auto, crash edition. i have a descent computer, but this game has crashed 5 times in two hours. ive adjusted the video settings to stupid low levels, and the problem still persists. until the game is stable,its no fun and nearly unplayable(thanks to no saves mid mission). stick to the console version, unless you enjoy playing the opening scene mulitple times ina row.",5
"ended the single player story without any crash. extremely smooth performance and great optimization. i average around 80+ fps at 1080p with everything on ultra (gtx 970 sli). looks great too. 10/10. no complaints here",10
"great optimisation (if you have the latest drivers from amd and nvidia), great graphics, great storyline, followed up with an excellent online. hopefully gta v should recieve some mods down the road from now, but until then im sure this game will give me 100s of hours of fun. well worth the asking price.",3

"by far the best version to have. i own the console version as well and the pc version has blown it away so far! graphics are amazing and the extra features are awesome!",2
"beautiful graphics, great optimization. havent stopped having fun. worth the money.",6
"aside from the bug issues with account linking with steam and rockstars social club, it really is the ultimate version of the game. 9/10.",2
"runs flawless having zero issues maxing it out with my 290x 4gb great port rockstar you guys & gals did a great job",6
"beautiful, excellently optnimized, seamless online and offline experience. great job, r*!",3
"hey rockstar, thank you for all the hard work. im actually having fun playing a pc game again. woooo! seriously tho, great game, runs smooth. only had a couple of crashes, otherwise great.",3
"this is an edited review. after a not so great launch it seems as though impleting some fixes has now made my game stabe. this is what i have seen so far from the single player the best gta there has ever been, the story is amazing. i am running it on a medium tier pc, an i5 2500k overclocked to 4.0ghz and a gtx660 gpu and 8gig of ram, i am able to get a constant 60fps with high to normal settings with aa and vsync on and i can only imagine after patches i will be able to push it a little further but i am quite happy with how it looks and runs on my hardware. this game is a must buy especially if you have been waiting for the pc release and have not played it on console. i have not played much online as yet but i have watched plenty of livestreams of online play and the scope of it just seems amazing with more than enough to do, it will be a game i will be playing every moment i have free time this year for sure. nothing short of an amazing game!",5
"i dont have a lot of things to say but i love this game ,i didnt play it on console at all to me its a new game and no lost money ! gta v = no more social life, be careful lol",9
"because rockstar is so concerned about pirates playing their game its made it so that even though ive bought the game i cant play it. their support is very very limited and staff members dont get back to you. if theyre going to have online authentication there should be 24/7 chat support to help with any issue. edit - just found out that a bunch of their accounts got hacked. yay for leaked passwords and emails. now my account is locked out. yay i just paid $60 for a game i cant play.",1
"best game ever, i have 50 or something games but this takes the cake !",2
"just wanted to say thank you console peasents for testing this game while it was in beta.",7
"first day back in los santos: smoked weed and shot aliens with a minigun. 11/10",6
"robbed a grocery store with my dad and some good friends.",6
"after playing gta 5 on ps3 and ps4 the pc version is probably the best one out of three.",1
"saw a tranny pissing on a trash can...no this was in real life i just wanted to share. great game! 10/10",1
"would probably be positive is the game would even start......",2
"very good game, came with all the  that they realeased on 360 and other consoles and made just for pc. we know its a port, but it doesnt feel like a port, over all not a bad job.",3
"defines epic! first game my dog is addicted to (sits in my lap while i play) he attacked my monitor because chomp look so real! i have this game for ps3, ps4, and pc this is by far the best version if your system can handle it dont waste anymore time buy this now! beware: so real you may actually get an std from the protitutes... #morerealthanreal #killeverything #wrapitbeforeyoutapit 4790k gtx 970 mostly very high 30-45 fps plenty for this game.",5
"highly optimized this game, runs so smoth at 60fps maxed out, good job rockstar games",4
"really great game, my pc cant handle it too well, but it will be fixed probably. i rate it a 9/10 - wolf gaming reviewers",1
"lov this game. worht the year wait lol installed right away played right away. so far its an amazing game with no bugs. how often does a pc game come out thats actually optimized for pc these days. never. but his one is. only con is its 60gb lol but not really a con just took forever to download.",4
"if youve played grand theft auto v on consoles, then you wont be disappointed. if you havent, youre in luck because this is indeed the definitive version. in my opinion, rockstar have done a wonderful job developing the game for pc. it was well worth the wait. the amount of graphical options means you can tweak the game to how you like it, especially if youre limited by hardware. the addition of the rockstar editor is just he icing on the cake. you may not be pleased with the price point due to when the game was released, but think of it as a brand new game being released in 2015 (because its that good).",4
"well, it seems rockstar did a good port this time, unlike they did with gta iv. i`m having no issues so far. the game runs great on my mid-range pc, and it looks way better than it did on my ps3.",2
"idm buying this game twice it was worth it then and now beautiful game a ing plus",3
"waited this game for years! it hasnt failed me yet and it was worthwhile. highly recommended to purchase.",3
"edit: i can open it now. cant even open it. 11/10",3
"cant play the game. i have to download windows media player but i seem to be unable of doing so. i have a very good computer.",3
"game will not launch neithier of the work arounds work!!",5
"i just want to thank the console peasants for ironing out the wrinkles; job well done! p.s. man its good to be on pc.",6
"pretty good, but it feels like an unfinished port. i recommend buying on a later date.",4
"with many good and bad reviews, i though id give my two cents. the game itself preforms very well. the game is nicely optimized for good and bad computers. my computer is not very good, and i can still have just as much fun as anyone else. ive had so much fun in my little playtime, that i know that ill have much more. when people say that the game is not optimized very well, its because they have a  computer. i was suprised by how nicely the game preforms compared to the quality. 10/10",4
"best 60 spent on a game. played it for 13 hours straight. 10/10 would rate addictive.",7
"yes,is cool but it has bugs now and it can be optimized better for laptops at least!!!",2
"this review might change later, but for the time being... i cant recommend this game. i bought it after debating for a bit, but decided to jump in and enjoy it. it crashed a few times and was offered the self-refund option. i tried it again and i was able to bind and play a bit of the game.... then it crashed again... i wish i had taken the inital self-refund. if you read this, my recommendation is to wait, i bought it to enjoy it, and now i just feel like im stuck with it as opposed to enjoy it.",4
"its amazing. 10x better than being played on the console.",6
"havent done jack  in this game... even though it says ive played it for .3 hours... why? because i dont know how rockstars account linking or password reset works... getting really damn irritated i honestly dont know if id reccomend this game.",8
"finally game works. some patches were made and now my game runs perfectly. i own a gaming laptop: msi dominator gt70, 8gb ram, intel i7 4810qm 2.8ghz, nvidia geforce 870m 3 gb vram great game. good response from rockstar. for other rigs configurations, i dunno.",3
"bought it for 60 dollars and it wont even work. tried asking for help and all the reccomended fixes and no responses and nothing works. edit: yayyy rockstar released an update that fixed the issue. now that i can play it it is very fun, 10/10",9
"absolutely fantastic work by rockstar. completely justifies the 2 year wait for pc. optimization is amazingly well done (fps doesnt ever drop under 50 on high/very high set up + aa 16+msa etc on a i5 2nd gen & gtx 760 2gb ram). port is also very smooth, aiming is great and fluid and so is driving. do i need to say more?",6
"it has alot of lag spikes, even on the lowest settings even though my pc is kinda nice, getting a constant 80 fps, though when im around people who are shooting me it spikes for some reason. plz fix!",6
"it is the masterpiece everyone said it was. rockstar does it again. unmissable.",9
"great game does need some more work on fps atm. i notice you can get 59 fps here and then drop down turn when around to 20 fps in alot areas ! missions are alot fun they added some new ones and the combate is better then console also ! i still cant wait for mods in this game to come out ! the online is just like a mmo also 10/10",3
"no more delays or any stupid bs, just endless hours of picking up hookers and playing golf. gta v is filled with things to do that will keep you entertained for well over 1000+ hours and is without a doubt worth the 39.99. as long as you like open world, multi and single player, first/third person shooter games that involves driving, flying and shooting then this is the game for you!",4
"first i thought, 60 euros for a 60 fps capped game and its 60 gb game in your storage, then i saw the light of a non-limited miracle. infinite. im immersed and impressed",2
"i am not happy with the bug .. still can not solve it ... like purchasing a crashing game",3
"i went into slow mo as a fat dude belly slided across my car windscreen. 11/10 also fo realz i hadz no launch issuez 60+ fps on near ultra settingz yo. no crashez or any shiz like that.",4
"grand theft auto v has never looked better ! now its even working in oculus rift dk 2 !!!!!!!!!",2
"glitchy, unpolished and buggy as . if you enjoy loading screens, gunplay that can be achieved i ms excel and networking capabilities of a game belonging to the early 1980s this is a game for you! adding on top of that the slow download rates giving your 100mb fiber a download time of 69 months. 13/10 - best part was waiting to the slow download. if youre a console fanboy with no demands for quality - enjoy. if not youre better of to just burn the silly ammount of money this game will set you back.",2
"rockstar did a great job for the pc version !! the wait was long but worth it !!",7
"great game, saw 2 dogs having intercourse. online experience is great, i never played it on playstation nor xbox, so i cant really say anything about that. the game, for me, started great after installation, no problems there, except i had to use an old account ( that i thought i never had to use again) named juicychristian, the name speaks for itself. but i got a namechange so no biggie. the only problem ive really encountered, is abit of online lag, players sometime freezes and teleporting. anyhow, great game, lots of fun to do, and also lots of transsexual-looking strippers ;s 11/10 would play again.",6
"so far everything is maxed out at 1080p on my r9 295x2 and still havent maxed out all 8gb of vram. plays so much smoother than watch dogs. thumbs up for rockstar!",5
"i have a laptop with intel + amd video cards. i am unable to get the game to work as it should after trying all available fixes that i could find via forums and support pages. at this point i would like to pursue a refund.",5
"gave me an insight into the life of black teenagers.",4
"words fail me when i try to give you a concise and specific discription about this game .i was not sure at first if my pc could run it at an acceptable digree,but the appearence is amazing!! the effort rockstar made is very much appreciated. still i want to say ,the game is attractive. but never throw the real life away.",7
"all i can suggest is do not buy this game now wait 6 months the game us currently unplayable for a lot of people there is an issue that comes up for most people where after playing a few minutes the game will have a dramatic frame rate drop and then eventually become unplyable all together no matter what settings rockstar knows this is happening but they are simply refusing to patch it yet they are focusing on the stupid windows installer thing when this issue is bigger in my opinon",5
"cant say much till now....after 3 days me and some other milion peeps still cant play that  game :|",1
"no more need for friends, family, or pets. my virtual life has finally gone sentient. farewell outernet, you sucked anyway.",7
"gta v is dope. the day it was release i could played because there was a message saying that there is a error. it tried a couple of time until april 17, i was so pissed off, i preordered this game since january 25. i was about to write a negative review on the game even though it was a terrific game. but since april 17, i didnt encounter any problem about playing gta v.",3
"sometimes physics might be silly, mior bugs, first person mode is quite disappointing, default controls for keyboard and mouse are not very good, annoying camera, silly crowd shoutouts. surprisingly decent optimizations and nice graphics, gameplay-wise has gta flavour. next step after gta 4 - certainly. nextget ? if you say so.",8
"starts online mode. get hit by truck that was chased. 11/10 would waste again.",2
"this game is a legend, and with modding we the master race will make it even better. buy it.",7
"dont waste your money (yet). dont get me wrong... im glad you finally released the game after ensuring there wont be any bugs.... but i cant even get passed the social club screen. you would think that is something you would get fixed before releasing. ive tried the fixes supplied online and still nothing. ill edit this review when i can (at the very least) load into the game.",1
"i have been waiting for 2 years and it was really worth it. the graphics are amazing, the game is amazingly optimized for amd and nvidia gpus after the update. my favorite game, love it!",4
"just about ing amazing. perfectly optimized. runs great.",8
"im taking a vacation for next week, buying a lot of food and let myself completely pull in the game!",3
"whell i just finnished the singple player campaig (mostly the main story missions) witch took me around 40 hours to complete, i found the story compelling and intresting.",5
"why the hell do you have to have social club when its so bad? i cant even start the game because it keeps crashing on startup because this social club crap just wont work! what were you guys doing in that one year delay? i thought you were fixing it, polishing it up. this is just terrible!",4
"i love this game. it runs brilliantly on my system.",6
"look it looks good runs decent and well little bugs but the hiest and online still are just ugggg alot and i feel they shoulda added more to pc users or ect",4
"my first playing gta v on the first task. i accidentally killed guard -> mission failed i tried killing/running enemies -> dead driving by car -> got stuck racing the car -> lost on the last place running againts girl -> lost swiming -> drowned flying by plane -> damaged yoging -> hurting helicopter landing on the ground -> damaged oh man, i love this game.",3
"looks good. i dont thinck their is anything wrong,",3
"my favorite part about the pc release of the game is that they make it crash every 30 minutes.",2
"24 hours of messing wih this game and i am still unable to play. seeing gtav has exited unexpectedly is driving me up a wall. for those questioning the issue - 416 comments on their support thread with no resolution or input from rockstar:",2
"gta san andreea+need for speed+gta iv = gta v very smooth game. no bugs, no crashes. online is a beast the masterpiece has come to us finaly i would rate this 12/10 monkeyz",5
"like crack , on toast , smothered in honey. omgbbq@wtf .... but yes this game is beautiful for the master race",4
"day 2: still no fix in sight. game will still not launch and rockstar  all over me once again. none of the fixes work plz healp ;( updated: finally after day 3 it will launch and it is amazing :d",2
"launched game, went into graphics settings, set everything on max. started benchmark. loads for 3 minutes or so. benchmark starts playing, hang on, thats not a benchmark, thats the start of the story mode. one second later, camera switches to benchmark scene. a few seconds later, camera switches back to story mode (can hear lady screaming for her life), few seconds later, it switches back to benchmark (where the jet is flying). few seconds later, booooom, slow motion, mission failed message pops up. i click on retry, story mode restarts. i play story mode. right after the part where i loot the vault and shoot the cop in the head, the game blacks out. tried to run benchmark, launched both story mode and benchmark simultaneously. 10/10",7
"absolutely love it. got my bike impounded, stole another to get to the impoud place, jumped the fence and stole my bike bike back. only in gta. yes there is an issue with gpus where some people have to disable one card start the game and enable it again. but it works and it is work every penny.",4
"doesnt matter what i say, the second i hit the dislike button this review will only be hated. gta online still needs more content, i dont find any enjoyment after the first 2 playthroughs of the single player and 1 hours of online gameplay which would have been way worse without playing with friends, all in all i feel like the online jobs need more variety and less loading times.",1
"easily a 10/10. the attention to detail in the game is staggering. plus, the custom radio station can play .flac files.",5
"every ing time i play this game it just ing crashes. i live in new zealand and i had to pay 90 ing dollars for a game that crashes every 5 minutes. how do you even progess?",2
"wait years for this to come out on pc. spend $70 pre-ordering, spend hours preloading. all for what? jack f**king sh*t. once you click play, the social club launcher or whatever the f it is pops up and says loading (good so far amirite?) 5 seconds into loading, it stops working and closes. there and probably thousands, if not more with this problem and the only thing rockstar comes up with is telling people (myself included) that our pc account names will prevent us from playing. well ive always had an a-z account name. so it sure as sh*t isnt that. i would recommend this game if you could still get your pre order money back. sadly, you cant. hype simulator 2015",6
"you will loose your social life, your girlfriend, jobs and whatever else you had. you will not touch any other game. itll be only you and v. v and you. no game should be this good. next time i hope rockstar makes a worse game than this so i dont loose my life.",6
"this game is a piece of , freezes all the time and literally never opens in fullscreen even though i change my mothering settings for this piece of  every god damn time i start it. also the loading screens take longer than on the xbox 360, get with it rockstar learn to make games.",7
"i will not be reviewing the content, because i guess everybody knows what to expect (i have never played and seen almost no footage of console gamplay so im having a blast on story mode) performance wise my specs are i7 2600k 4.5ghz - gtx970 - 32gb ram purchase went smooth as it gets, buy, download, register for the first time to rsc, launch and play, just like that. game runs really fine for me almost maxed except aa (just fxaa), grass on very high (there is ultra) and shadows on high. almost 100fps, using vsync anyway to avoid screen tearing. i havent jump into online yet and it seems a lot of people are having troubles for now. for my personal experience i would recommend it 100%",7
"its . wont even go past the social club menu. keeps crashing.",1
"who would say this is a bad game? sure, launch was messed up, but that happens. and yeah, there is a problem that kinda stops people from being able to play, but its extremely easy to fix. 10/10 game, would play all the time if i could.",6
"10/10 graphics 8/10 gameplay - (you should switch between keyboard and controller while driving e.t.c) 9/10 story 9/10 muliplayer mixes combat with racing with all the other stuff that make gta a genre of its own. best game i have in my library. optimized as , online is fast and reliable. 10/10 would bang again",4
"ignore the dayone issues, rockstar are the best but are human! issues be issues ( what game doesnt have these? error 37? ;) ) buy it, play it, enjoy it! developers, designers and all the team at rockstar should be bowed upon for their effort to support the pc market with their latest and greatest. show your support, give the hard working team the respect they deserve. ps. goodbye weekend! :)",2
"the best version of gta optimized for the most versatile platform; the pc. if you have the hardware, it runs beautifully with so many configurable graphics settings. (for those who are stuck on how to link your steam account to social club, hit shift and tab together when the little steam message pops up after logging into social club. youll see the ok button afterwards.)",4
"great game last copy i had of this was on xbox 360 and i sold it for cod ghosts worst decision of my life :d",5
"so far really dissapointed, lots of lag and freezing,without these lags and freezes game runs like a charm so they did something good there but still for me its unplayable due to these freezes and lags , i even tried it on low settings but same issue( my rig is above recommended ) and ofcourse the cloud servers have issues saving progress once in a while ( before fanbois cry this has nothing to do with my rig ;) ). and today for some reason my garage got bugged and i lost 2 of my expensive cars which were fully upgraded ( i am a returning player from xbox 360 ) and now each time i put a car there it gets duplicated but the duplicated one does nto really exist but still takes up the garage slot to park a car. if you want to play the game without issues and problems, stay away from it for 1 month and then try, hopefully rockstar has solved these issues.",10
"dont remember last time i had so much fun playing a game.",5
"game does start you just need to disable the video card to be able to launch social club good game but too laggy",5
"the game is well optimised..even my low end pc *underlocked* can handle it :) i really want to upload my custom clan emblem..but its been patched :(",6
"my mom told me to get a life while i was playing gtaiv... i cried so hard and whacked my xbox apart--my little brother thought the whole building was coming down... but, hold on, finally, after 765 days wating... im able to get a life. gta is love, gta is life. 10/10",7
"i was going to write a bad review because the game kept crashing and my online character had zebra stripes. but then i noticed i had to update my nividia drivers. now the game runs perfectly and hasnt crashed yet! 97/100",8
"took 3 years to unpack... worth every missed birthday 11/10",7
"a masterpiece on last gen, a masterpiece on this gen, and a godlike masterpiece on pc. one of the best games ive ever played. its grand theft auto, what do you expect? oh, custom radio station with your own music. that feature alone makes it worth the rebuy. 10/10 100/100 1000/1000. now go get rid of that yee yee  haircut!",3
"quite possibly the best pc game i have ever played. worth every ing penny.",1
"huh,grand theft auto v on pc. in all seriousness,i always expected this would happen,but for it to be this good? nah. i wanted to write a joke review,i really did want to,but this game deserves more. having never played the console version,this was a real novelty for me,but no one can hold it against it for that because of some new things. those new things are: 60 frames-per-second 4k resolution and the rockstar editor. in 60fps this game feels really fluid,much more than in any of the consoles,but you already couldve guessed that from the trailers r* posted. i dont have a 4k rig,but i visited a friend that has one and it looks apsolutely stunning.no joke,even though its all caps ;). and i havent got around to playing with the editoer,but when the right time comes,ill do that. all in all,some will prefer to buy this on sale,but in my honest opinion anyone who can afford this game at $60 it is a very good investment.",6
"youre bored? play gta online you want to play nfs+bf+cs:go+sims at the same time? play gta online you like chickens? play gta online you like chicks? play gta online (go to strip club, make her like you, get her number, invite to your apartment) and tons of other things you can do :) 10/10 - this rating isnt just throw up, ill edit this review for details later, its just best game, also comes with free recording software where after stunts that you do you can go back and recap it :).",9
"a lot of bug herecant connect with windows live when i sign in, cant play online offlane bothcostumor service so bad",2
"i love gta but i cant get the game to begin cuz i get a story mode loading and that is nothing happens",6
"ps3 & xbox360 thanks for alpha testing. xbox one & ps4 thanks for beta testing.",3
"love the game, i like the first person mode. the one thing is that it freezes at times but im giving it a chance to get the bugs out. keep up with the fun game rockstar love them to death.",2
"its probababli the best game i have ever played but i cant play over than one hour without having a error message and whos making the game crash. (please fix!)",4
"one of, if not the, best grand theft auto games to date. massive open world that is beautiful and an exciting multiplayer. was thrilled to play this on consoles and am even more thrilled to play on pc!",2
"grand theft auto v -perfect fps -cool and simple missions (online) -love the heists -great story (offline) - 10+ a stripper called fufu 21/10 (went to her house......) -robbed a gus station and the owner had a gun and killed me (i cry everytime)",4
"very laggy even on low settings, if that was fixed it would be great",4
"i can not do a review of a game that still could not play for errors of the game but just ask pirates players who played before me, and i buy it in january",3
"i went into slow mo as a fat dude belly slided across my car windscreen. 11/10 also fo realz i hadz no launch issuez 60+ fps on near ultra settingz yo. no crashez or any shiz like that.",4
"nice ing game! ve been waiting for so long! but great!",3
"after 2 years of porting to pc, hopefuly its worth the wait.",2
"bought the game hoping to play the pc version like everybody else. every 10 mins into the game and it crashes and this has been occuring over a few hours straight. waited months for this pc version of the game to be released and all they can give is something that crashes every 10 minutes. gta v is a great game but what is the use if you cant play it properly? royal disaster. thanks for giving such a great gaming experience for our money.",2
"the best gta game yet! may even make up for the crap that was gta iv...",2
"this is a much better port than gta iv, it even plays better than gtaiv on my gtx970, 60 fps with most settings on very-high in 1080p, this looks very good and is a blast to play after oly a few minutes, it felt like a great gta!",4
"i cant even sign in. it keeps telling me that i have to sign in with an account that i have already used on my machine, but since this is the first time im playing on pc i cant do that. i was really looking forward to this game since i love the console version, but once again rockstar has lost all hope with me by ing up the release for me.",5
"extremely enjoyable game, well balanced and performs very nicely on most hardware it seems!",3
"by all accounts a good, well optimized game. the ui, controls are fantastic. the graphic options and graphical quality is exceptional, especially for the performance i get on low-end hardware. they really put a lot of work into optimizing this and tweaking the engine to perfection. far more than any company has anything else released in years. that is, if it runs at all. theyre dragging their feet about fixing the myriad of issues which plague many players. at this time i do not recommend buying it with a 50% chance that itll just crash repeatedly, either during the intial launch of the launcher itself, or during gameplay.",6
"wtf ???? why social club ? whyy ??? i cant even sign in in this fkcn program. even games for windows life was better. i spent like 1 hour to register in social club.",6
"i had sex with a hooker in my stolen car, then i killed her and left the car on some tracks to get hit by a train. after that i went home and played grand theft auto 5 which i thoroughly enjoyed.",1
"finally it has arrived! took me almost 2 years of waiting but worth the wait. played this in ps4 and again on pc coz i cant get enough of trevor phillips!",5
"slightly stupidly good with hints of exceptional, if this was an ice cream flavour it would be kardashian pussey. dont wait any longer just buy it, and buy a better graphics card too, just so you can turn up everything to get the full pussey flavour !",4
"oh my god im so glad its finally available. with every new release it gets better. last gen to current gen consoles and now pc. i wish i had a 4k screen to really test my graphics card. 1080p is still pretty too. keyboard controls take some getting used to. a few commands are slightly out of reach but you dont need them often enough to be a problem. supports 360/one controller out of the box and it feels just like the console control. ill probably use both to be honest. mouse/keyboard for running/shooting and controller for driving/flying. analog steering for the win. the load times are near instant for single player and the online is significantly improved compared to the console. first time i joined online, i tried to get the high priority export car only to be met with explosions and fire. 10/10 will explode again.",2
"minecraft is my favourite game ever. i dont know what else to say but, gta 5 pc is also my favourite game ever.",5
"i can finally be gangsta!! *launches game* *follows all the rules and treats women with respect*",3
"greatest game ever made. this is my 3rd time purchasing it and its been worth every penny.",4
"it was a tad buggy at release, but theyve since patched that. connection issues? a vpn can clear those right up. gta5 is one of my top games of all time, but running this on pc full 1080p 60+ fps makes it a truly remarkable experience worth the wait (and loading times). i couldnt recommend this game more for someone who enjoys racers, shooters, massive online rpgs, or any combination. a++ rockstar youve done it again.",5
"ive waited 4 yrs 4k pc 60fps worth it online is amazing just most perfect game wish i could win the pc their giving away help me a lot.",1
"nothing less than 10/10 they have done it again. everybody knows this game would be awesome because of how its been released on other platforms. but rockstar has outdone themselves with this pc version, really really good.",2
"im having no issues whatsoever, and thus am posting this as a throwaway review just to give it a thumbs-up, like the idiots who are trying to give it a negative review because they cant get it to work. very good and very expansive open-world game. looks great, sounds great, runs great (for comparison, im using a 3-year-old laptop and maintaining high frames at 1080p)",2
"rockstar did an absolute amazing job porting, and optimizing this game for pc. the graphics are amazing, and ive had zero issues, even since the release date. i strongly recommend this game for any gta fan out there on the pc!",6
"had this game for ps3 and now on pc. its just plain fun!",4

"my pc should be able to run it fine, when i get to play it is very fun and i do love the game but i dont get to play often because it just randomely crashes windows and ive done everything i know to fix it and im just done with it. i recommend it because it is a great game. when it works.",3
"couldnt get my account back from console just bcuz the first letter in my pw was in capitals(fk u r*), bye best everything and lvl 80 character :( but anyways the game is great, if u havent played the console version this is a must-get. game runs perfect max settings 1920x1080 on a i5 4690k,gtx 970 and 8gb ram the game floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee, runs so fast even console peasants can`t see.",6

"======= opinion======= the game is probably my favorite gta so far. the 3 characters come together to make this unlike any other experience in the past. nice to get back to ol san andreas. any fan would love this game. honestly havent done anything else for 4 days. id keep this one away from the kids if i were a parent though. its full of filthy adult entertainment as should be expected. ======= hardware ======= in 29 hours of gameplay it glitched twice but i think it was installing an update. running this game on my amd 6800k with 8 gb ram, and radeon hd 7870 ghz. the specs are flexible. any decent system that was built in the past few years should be able to play it.",6
"wow. just wow. playing on a gaming laptop with 8 gigs of ram, 980m card and i7 processer. this game runs smooth as butter. maxed everything with 45-60 fps. my hats off to rock star. this goes to show that delays are a good things. it clearly shows with gtav. this isnt a port, this is a master piece. if youve never played gtav then this is a perfect time to do so, if you have and youre on the fence because of worries about performace issues and such, then let me be the one to calm your beating heart. if you have the rig to play other high profile games then this one will not dissapoint.",2
"such a great game, except for glitch when want to quicm replay in a heist while in first person, you get stuck looking at your face, but that could be fixed with a simple patch.",4

"i pre-ordered it 2 month ago, w8ed this far, and now it just wont run with my nvidia gpu, just the built-in one and believe me it sucks to play on intel gpu. 1/10 until fixed fixed*** 1010 worth it, great game but still alot of bugs to fix",3
"dear steam users, when i first downloaded gta v, i was not able to launch the game. when i tried to launch it, my steam said i was playing but only for a few seconds. then nothing happened. confused was i so i decided to do some research. there seemed to be a glitch among portable graphics cards that would not allow the game to launch (i use my trusty asus g750 notebook with an 860m gpu). i tried multiple times, but nothing woud work. after countless attempts, i left for class furiously. i ressolved to give the game a nasty review, but then it happened. just as i sat down to write my strongly worded review, i tried to start my game up one more time. behold, it launched! from that point forward, i have been robbing banks, winning races, and claiming glorious victory! the gameplay was smooth and very nice. after that first hicup, i experienced no other problems with gta 5. for this reason, i recomend this game, and i hope you enjoy it just as i have. p.s. i do not have the slightest idea what i did to fix it.... sorrrrrrrr. sincerely, king vulture",3
"i ask that anyone interested in buying this game steer clear of it, at least for the moment anyway, the bugs and glitches make playing this admittedly incredible game an experience that has to be soldiered through and not an experience to be enjoyed. in the time i have spent playing this game it has crashed for no reason around ten times now, and the in-game world has continuous dissapearing textures and buildings. at least for the moment stay away from this buggy mess. game score: 10/10 ability to play the game score: -10000/10 please rockstar fix this game, or steam give me a refund.",1
"as a massive fan of gta4, i have to rate this game 3/10, theres too much to do, i personally prefer games which have no content in them but still get 10/10 on sites like ign, this game confuses me as i have options on what to do, this is almost as bad as san andreas.",8
"honestly, even considering the fact that i like many other games far more than the gta series... gta 5 pc is probably in the top 5 of best video games ever made. this is a monument to gaming.",5
"having put ~150 hours into the 360 version of this game, i can say this is a vast improvement. not only visually, but in the playstyle as well. i see that a lot of people are having issues with the game, and all i can say is that i havent had any issues, and im running on 8 gb of ram and a 750 ti 2gb sc. getting a solid 60 frames on some mid range settings. the technical issues are a big problem, but will surely be fixed within a week of release. rockstar isnt known for their stelar releases, but they usually fix them pretty quick. to those coming from console versions, you will notice better graphics, provided you have a capable pc. to those who have never played the game, oh boy are you in for a treat with this one. this is simply a game you must own, regardless on what platform you play it on. the constant online updates that the devs give adds a nice flare to an already mouthwatering and addictive multiplayer. i give this a 9/10, only off by 1 point because of current technical issues.",6

"awsome game if you dont have it yet what are you waiting for?",6
"its okay. i expected much more. if you havent played it on any console before, buy it. if you have, i recommend you to not buy it. i played this on ps3 and ps4 as well, so i have some experience and knew how the game would be like. however, running at recommended specs (760 & fx-6630), i didnt find it to look any better than the ps4 version, other than the addition of 60 fps. and actually, some of the textures look worse than the ps4 version (this is at normal texture settings). definetely need a good desktop to run this at high settings, 1080p, 60 fps, and to make sure it looks better than the consoles. hopefully its just a bug on rockstars end, and might send out a patch to fix the graphics, but right now im not impressed.",2

"one of best free roam games to date. awesome performance and tons of option makes this one of best experiences ever. also 60fps and above on a lot of configs <3 both singelplayer and multiplayer provides tons of fun and sillines! for most of enjoyment highly recommend playing gta:o with friends! highly recommended!",6

"this game is the best pc game ive played by far its got everything guns hookers cars planes trains bikes the lot i cant put it down ive played all the gta games even played the 2 d one years ago the gta games have come so far im getting a solid 60 fps 1080p on very high settings initially i couldnt get the game up and runing im playing on my msi gt60 dominator core i7 4810mq haswell 12 gig of ram paired with a gtx 870m the 3 gig variant fhd matie screen 60 herz linked up to a ben q monitor 1080p so who ever has this gaming lappy and cant get gta 5 up and runing the fix i used was to open up device manager go to display adapters disible the gtx nvidia card the run gta from steam directly as soon as the game starts to open give about 3 seconds before turning the nvidia card back on you have to be quick but not to quick or it wont work it worked for me its a fix in the meantime hopefully rock star north should get a patch out for this problem i tried for ages to get working the launcher kept crashing but as i said the workaround i found is a short term saloution so hope this helps . if any one has a question on this send me a message .",2
"plays amazingly best port ever! cant even call it a port. rockstar!!! thank you for taking your time with optimization and giving us pc gamers a great release. sure there are some people unable to play but this has been a much better release than final fantasy realm reborn, or say any ubisoft title. i appreciate all of your hard work this last year and some. it really shows in this pc version of the game.",3
"cant play the game for more than ten minutes due to crashing -0/10",2
"this is a performance review! i barely meet the minimum specs and it runs great! never had it crash and it stays around 40 fps, though the textures on everything but faces and cars look awful. in online it still runs good even when a bunch of idiots with grenade launchers blow everything up. pretty much what i mean is i havent had a single problem, but remember to update your graphics drivers! it makes a big difference!",4
"hands down, the best game ever created. 11/10 welldone rockstar.",6
"its an ok game nothing special and overated when compared to gta 4. it is worth the current price.",4
"buy this game. the console version was the prototype for sure as this is the definitive version. if your pc can support it, buy it now.",3
"this game is incredibly realistic. i banged five hookers in one night without condoms and got seven stds and two of them are now pregnant. 10/10 will bang again.",3
"this game is good graphically, very good visuals even for an older pc like my own. for that reason i will give it a thumbs up. the story is very diversified, lots of different situations arise with generally unique results. however, this series suffers from one drawback, considering i tend to enjoy having choices now; there is a distinct lack of choice in how the story goes. this, in my opinion, lowers the re-playability value of the game. while being a great game visually, not having the amount of room that one had back in gtasa is disappointing, not to mention missing some sort of choice making. but i will admit, thats another publishers tendency and not r*s.",1
"in its current state, graphical cliches create lag within your machine.",2
"no issues whatsoever. framrate is decent. could be optimized better i feel, but definitely miles above gta4. if youre not convinced, wait for a sale. definitely worth it.",5
"1/10. flip flops dont flop in gta :o. rockstar plz. in all seriousness this is the best version of gta yet, less than 10 seconds to load into gta o or gta sp from either or, and only about 15seconds to load into the game on first launch. 9/10 loading screens. graphic settings is amazing, you can control pretty much everything about this game. only drawback is no matter how high it is reflects still look like  in cars. textures and grass/water looks amazing 8/10 graphics. combat is so much smoother than peasent boxes, way easier to aim while driving, or just aiming in general is a hell of a lot easier 10/10. keybindings can be a bit weird but nothing too off. being able to do anything you want without having to move your hand off of wasd is pretty nice. all in all i give this version of gta v 9/10 . way way way better than peasent box versions.",7
"horrible, horrible port. i meet recommended requirements (except the 8gb ram part - i have 4gb), and the game is barely playable. scratch that, after the prologue its unplayable, with all its stutters and graphical glitches, even on minimum settings. i cant recommend the game as it is (day one), and its beyond me how rockstar managed to release such a crappy product, even after all the delays.",1
"great game. great port. looks nice. vram usage chart in graphics menu goes above and beyond what id expect from most modern games. benchmark kinda breaks the game if you try and use it outside of normal free roam, and there are a few occasional glitches here and there, but overall this was very much worth the wait.",5
"rockstar came into my room and touched my no no square. 10/10 would get molested by rockstar again. p.s. thanks for taking forever to remake a game and stealing our money.",4
"i drove my ducati into an suv in first person and got ptsd from the crash. 10/10 would play again.",4
"rockstar did a really good job on this. the delays seem to have paid off. the game runs completely maxed out (ultra settings @ 1920x1080) on my laptop (gtx 780m 4gb sli) and i get 40-60 fps. oh and the game is really fun too, a huge improvement from gta iv. i dont think i need to talk much about the game because everyone on earth knows its great already + huge improvement over grand theft auto iv + runs smooothly on mid range pcs + first person mode is amazing + entertaining characters and story + no glitches at all yet = co-op in the story mode would have been cool - first person mode doesnt work good for most missions",3
"big thumbs down, 97/100 on metacritic? i dont understand how, game currently has significant stability issues and appears to be nothing more than a poor console clone.",3
"cannot start the game - and no help can be found. i just want my money back.",2
"if youre a gta fan this is the version of gta 5 you want. as someone that has hundreds of hours logged in the ps3 version of this game im literally stunned by how much better and more immersive the pc version is. 5 out of 5 stars to r* for doing a pc port the right way!",9
"smoothest game launch in a very long time. other than a few glitches here-and-there in the online mode, its amazingly fun.",8
"rockstar told us the pc-version would be the ultimate version and they were right. i just love this game, the heists, the missions.. everything! 10/10 and its running smooth. :) pros: beautiful graphics and city 3 character switch smooth gameplay hours of fun gta online. cons: rockstar social club integration itself. taking a long time to load sometimes.",3
"finished downloading after 3 days straight of not sleeping wasted 10/10 would download again",2
"fantastic port. also i think the fact that the online servers were working perfectly on day one is also a phenomenal job on rockstars part. anything else you need to know about the game, you can read anywhere else. all i know is that youll be playing the definitive version of this game if you play it on here.",3
"good : - enyojment - almost everything in this game is awesome bad : - aiming is a joke ( even if i have 155 lvl and maximum stats its not that easy to aim) - skin bug in multiplayer",7
"leave it to rockstar to charge $60 for a 60gb game that crashes 60 seconds into the story mode every time! well done!",1
"awsome story mode. online is endless hours of fun and there is a mass amount of content when it comes to online missions, races ect....it will keep me a happy games for a long time! i pre ordered for the 360 and was really pleased with the game. however the pc version seems a lot smoother and the graphics are brilliant on my msi 7970 frozr. i did run across a glitch that game me achievements for reaching level 25 / 50 / 100 in online play & im only level 18! im not sure how i would report this to rockstar if anyone knows give me a message. a solid cash investment, endless fun to be had on this game. nothing quite like running over pedestrians then going to pick up a hooker, get drunk smoke weed get chased by the police and see how long you can survive!",4
"everything about it is superior to the console version, the graphics are just amazing.. online community is still mostly s who want to just run around killing you repeatedly and troll eachother over the mics. the only problem is ive never had a game take up my cpu cores like this game.. it runs at 100% almost all the time (i5 4690) and stutters",4
"for those who wonder...the feeling is here. i never liked consoles and i ve been waiting for the game 2 years now. totally worth it... best gta game since san andreas era. the absolute digital playground!!!! 10/10.",3
"reality, home, at least it was before gta v ed everything up.",4
"2013. collectors edition on ps3. 2014. a fu**ing ps4 and gta 5 again. 2015. end of story bought the game again, finally on the right platform! i have used so much money on this game (around $700-800) but tbh it was all worth it! great/the best sandbox game, you can play for hours and hours and still find more stuff to do. fantastic soundtrack and story, online works really well and the pc-port is well optimised. a game you should have in you library and for sure test out, if you havent already (:",2
"absolutely incredible game with amazing car customization and multiplayer options. the only thing that annoys me is the multiplayer servers, and how clunky and annoying they are to move from one to another to be with a friend.",5
"i want to give thanks to the console peasants who alpha tested the game on the ps3 and 360 as well as the rest of the peasants who beta tested the game on the ps4 and xbone. seriously, thanks to your long testing we on the pc were able to get the best version of the game. thanks :d",5
"4-5 ra szvs utn sem indul a laptopomon. laptoposoknak nem ajnlom egyelre a javts megrkezsig! luncher.exe does not work! i do not recommend this game until service patch released.",2
"had it on xbox 360 and now on pc. huge upgrade, improved graphics and pretty much everything else make this worth playing again and again.",3
"to be completely honest, i had it on 360. never seen its full potential till now. the graphics and framerate are a giant improvement and im running it at ultra. get this game, even if purely its for the online element, thats all ive done thus far.",2
"when u guys dicide to fix a game that people bout the day it came out and still cant play i think its a waste of time and money cause still no fix should of stayed on ps3 hacking it cause clearly u dont give a to fix it",2
"games good, but after 30 minutes or so i get crazy stuttering/lurching/hitching/frame drops/whatever you want to call it. the game runs at a stable, silky 60fps for a half hour or so, and then itll start lurching down to 30-40fps at random intervals every few seconds until i restart the game. usually itll start after ive driven somewhere fast, but once it starts i can be sitting stationary in a safehouse and itll still continue unabated. i run a 660ti and i7 3770 with 8gb of ddr3 for anyone who cares, but its not a hardware issue: ive been reading around forums with people with identical issues who run the whole gamut of available hardware configurations, from amd to intel and nvidia, from high-end to low-end. just be aware that until they fix this, buying this game is a roulette of performance irrespective of the power of your setup: maybe youll get lucky and be in the majority who find it smooth, or maybe youll be condemned to frame stutter hell like me and a bunch of other people. ill edit this review to recommend this game when they fix the problem.",7
"heard this was a good game, so i bought it three times. its good, would buy another three times, 10/10",2
"ran well on my pc (25 fps) with a low end graphics card. it still looked good. i cant wait to pick up my higher end card and see how awesome it is. need to go to work and had to fight calling in sick today.",4
"if totalbiscuit says this is good, it must be good right? forget what any of your friends say about this game",7
"people say the online part of the game is boring considering the story mode. let me say you this, after completing the prologue, i thought i wanted to check the online mode a bit and maybe create a charater just for fun. now i cant leave online mode! its great. even the worse part of the game is incredibly fun and addictive. man, this is going to be a long ride... regarding to the performance; i know that the game kind of buggy on some systems but i have faith in rockstar that they will fix it eventually (maybe not in a fast way, though). its running on my system beautifully. even i dont have a high-end rig and playing with ok graphic settings, its a nice game to look at. i can probably continue this for pages so im just gonna leave it like this...you get the idea anyways...",6
"hi i dont get the game start it rashes when the luncher are done loading. i have red that you can chage the name but i dnr udertand the name i am supos to change is it microsoft or social club i am really angry ofr this sh*t i pisses me really of wht can i do to get this sh*t to work",3
"this game looks amazing, it feels amazing,it has just so many pros. i played gta 5 on the xbox 360, then i transfered to pc (because pc is life) and when i saw gta was coming out for pc i didnt actually intend on buying it. but then they did the smartest thing ever by implementing character transfer. they made a troal of 400$ from me and my frined because we all bought it twice lol. good job rockstar ;)",4

"just simply amazing, i do not care how long it took them to bring this out for pc its just so good, it runs smooth on my pc and its a mid range gaming pc, it plays well, and all the in game options like menues and game play is smooth as foooook gun fights are fun so much to do, its gta!!! again really good game, should pick it up!",3
"horrible launch. with millions in sales and prelaunch revenue this game should be polished and glitch free. i will never pre order a rockstar game ever again. game constantly crashes during game play at random intervals. gta v is not responding to gta v has stopped responding my specs: amd 8350 crosshair v formula z crossfirex 2x280x 16gb corsair platinum",4
"im running the game with a gtx970, amd fx-8350 eight-core processor with 8 gigs of ram.. and this game crashes out after a couple minutes of playing even if i set it to the games safe mode which puts the graphics as low as they can go, or at least looks that way, looked like i was playing a playstation 1 game and im still crashing because im running low on memory. everytime i get hyped about this game i get kicked down.",7

"amazing amazing amazing, running at high settings on a ing 2g 750ti and it looks so amazing, lap dances in 1st person is really nice, i really feel like this game was worth the wait and im so excited for university to end so ill never have to look at a real human beeing again",6
"story isnt great, neither the characters. the supposed irony and social comentary isnt there, dont believe people who says that. its a silly story, with lame supporting cast and bland main cast - excluding trevor, he grows on you. so far, the worst gta story and characters wise. but the best gta technically. its a beautiful game in every aspect and an exemplary port. rockstar did its homework this time: the game is an extraordinary port, really well optimized and ridiculously pretty graphics. even the physics improved in the porting process. gta v on pc is the ultimate experience for this game, believe me. san andreas state is the strongest character youll ever need for this game, followed by the beautifully accomplished vehicles of all sorts and amazing weather effects. oh, and theres the somewhat smooth online experience. if your pc falls between the minimum and recommended specs, just buy it. you wont regret.",5
"awesome, this game is awesome. the graphics, everything!",1
"best pc gta ever! but really, this game looks absolute stunning and runs well even on non top end hardware. im running a gtx770 and even with the game telling me that its using 2500 out of my 2048mb vram it runs fantastically smooth. gameplay with mouse and keyboard is working flawlessly aswell. story is very well done and the singleplayer has a high replay value. online is just a joy to play. ( when the servers work(but i only had 1 disconnect so far)) id advise everyone that likes action games to buy this amazing piece of software. 10/10 recommended",6
"really good experiance. runs good with a gtx760 using the geforce experiance settings and adaptive vsync. dont use the ingame vsync ever",4

"this is a great game,and it feels like the first game rockstar really tried to finish (on pc) those who say random crash and more probably fixed their issue but didnt changed their reviews. but be aware this game could crash on launching then what? you still can get a refund of some sort! the game was broken at the launch (but benchmarks and multiplayer) but thats normal for multi. the first big path is already out,with oculust rift support! why do i even write thise review, ima play gta now",5

"gta v is a huge production with lots of things to do in a big detailed world so dont get me wrong but the game braking bugs(not related to my system) with a lot of fiddeling to get through, the things the game pushes you through without you wanting to, boring minigames, clumsy characters, clumsy menus, characters choosing their own clothes, cars playing random radio channels and no way to trade cash between the characters its better to wait for a sale. im just forcing my way through this now for some value from my cash..",2

"tried all fixes; the game does not start. hardware is over the recommended specifications. the most expensive desktop icon ive ever bought, but at least it comes with a free 61gb of useless data, just in case youre not enticed by the desktop icon alone. edit: completely uninstalling firewall fixed the issue. changed the recommendation to yes, even though this fix shouldnt be necessary to play the game. game itself is 10/10",8

"im on a desktop with a gtx 980, i have updated all my drivers, i dont have any anti-virus program installed, my username consists of characters that theyve said are supported ( i even tried making a new one ), ive tried so many things to get it working, ive contacted rockstar support with no response in the past 48 hours, and i still cant get the games launcher to run. ive never had problems like this with any other game on my desktop.",3
"i downloaded 60 gigs of ing garbage, i start the game and it says failed to initialize directx 9 cant even play the game after paying $60!!! (fixed) well, now that i got through that the game wont even get past the gaming club saying there is an error",2
"ok this is gonna stay positive, but currently, i am being put into empty gta online servers or i get into a full lobby and then everyone leaves the game, everyone in the lobby leaves at the same time in a matter of seconds of me joining, or it say connection timed out returning to grand theft auto v please try again later, and i do its always one of the 3 things i have mentiond, but the funny thing is, gta online was working fine, but this review is positive because i like playing story mode and director mode, along with rockstar editor, but please, please for the love of all mankind, please fix this stupid gta online error original review: notice: not. a. single. bowling alley...finally",6

"one of best free roam games to date. awesome performance and tons of option makes this one of best experiences ever. also 60fps and above on a lot of configs <3 both singelplayer and multiplayer provides tons of fun and sillines! for most of enjoyment highly recommend playing gta:o with friends! highly recommended!",6
"great game and worth every penny. some people are having trouble running it but i think most of that is their rig so ignore those bad reviews. ignore the haters! you will not get a better aaa title for the money. dlc? this game does not have dlc hooray!",6
"this is a really good game. ive not experience any bugs whatsoever.",8
"tl/dr : perfect, stable, extrem fun and awesome optimized. now a little bit more detail... +great singleplayer storyline +many activities like playing tennis (just as good as playing a standalone tennis simulation!), doing yoga (if thats your thing), stealing cars, robbing stores, participate in races on the street or on dirt, doing heists with a group of friends (in mp) or with your ki-controlled team (no stupid ki), getting drunk doing yoga after a set of tennis and much, much more. +all vehicles are feeling nice to use with a nice way to control via mouse+keyboard (wasd + num-pad). +many guns/weapons in gerneral (all of them can be modified) even thou the gunplay isnt that good. +multi-charakter story with each being completly different + special abilities. +cops are (finaly) a threat! onto the technical point, i am using a gaminglaptop with the following stats : geforce gtx 880m i7-4810mq @ 2.80ghz 16 gb ram game is installed on a ssd. i am able to play @ 60 fps/1080p with highest settings (msaa @ 2x). so this game is very well optimized. in about 24h gameplay i didnt face any crash or gamebreaking bug.",7
"can no longer say 10/10 id call it more 6/10 due to the huge amount of time spent in loadscreens. massive leap forward compared to what gta iv was. this game looks amazing on max settings if your pc can take it. its all been very well polished. not sure it was worth the 2 year wait. thats still b*lls**t. online mode and heists are alot of fun. if youve been a fan of the gta series you wont be dissapointed getting this. edit: found 1 giant con finally. the game is so poorly optimized in how you join other games, matches or instances. you are constantly flung into loadscreen hell. they are incredibly long and often will begin loading into one lobby only after a minute or two it says its full so you enter a new load screen to go back to where you were. then before you can act enter another loadscreen to try and find another instance etc etc etc. loadscreeen hell. it happens often that you will spend an average of 2 or 3 minutes suffering through loadscreens. sometimes longer.",10
"always good as it is for gta franchise, even though still found some glitch <gta online>, stuting and lagging <both gta v and gta online>. hopefully rockstar will look at it soon. still good for me.",4
"this is another great game! i would recommend if you like 3rd person shooters (1st person isnt the greatest) and you like to cause chaos.",9
"bought to play gta online as i already finished story on ps3 a year ago. well. may be i didnt get smth, but. to much boring grinding. i heard that there were challenges as a good income source, but they were removed and now you doomed to do dozens of boring missions for $20k max while your friends desperately trying to connect to your game session so you can go and finish second heist already. yeap. constant problems with social club. get your  together rockstar.",9

"social club is the biggest crap i have ever seen. im sorry rockstar but if your going to put a game on steam, dont force us to use something that no one wants. however if you must oppress us in this way, please use something that works.... it let me play once and gta v is a beautiful game yet the next time i had to sign in again, it refused. claiming that either my steam was linked to a different account or locking me out due to too many unsuccessful (heavy sarcasm) log in attempts. i have tried numerous times to log in, change passwords, switch accounts, anything to just play your game, unfortunatly to no avail. i have realized that at this rate it will never work, so thank you for nothing. gta v is a great game but social club ruins it entirely.",4

"played roughly 200 hours when it launched on the xbox 360, loved it, and now its finally back in its definitive edition and all them console peasants be like ay bruh thas some nice graphics u got ther and we be like well you know, just some normal pc master race thing, nothing special. but yeah honestly, its impressive, and having a good pc like i do makes it even better, it runs great with everything maxed out *cough*unlike gta iv*cough* and the time we waited to have it on pc was definitely worth it. some people are having some hardware issues, but you know, its pretty normal with games on day one nowadays. im currently experiencing some horrible mouse acceleration and fps drops in the menu, but this will get fixed eventually. bottom line : if you havent played it on console yet, buy it, if you played it on the xbox 360, buy it, if you have xbone/ps4... well, theres no real reason to buy except for the slightly better graphics so unless you have a potato, go for it if you have the money and the power to run it at 60fps high/ultra.",8
"- newbie to the gta series - the only gta game i ever played was the very first one that came out in 1997 on pc. i decided to buy this one due to all the hype and the much talked about graphics improvements. i have never been this satisfied paying $59.99 for a game ive barely knew anything about - much less played. the level of detail put in this game is amazing. everything from the graphics to the story line, truly impressive. this is the type of game that you dont have to worry about completing in a day. i am looking forward to playing this game for many months. there are small issues here and there that i noticed as far as bugs in the game but i anticipate they will be fixed in the near future. if you are on the fence about this game, i definitely recommend it. as a newbie to the series, i am glad i pulled the trigger on this one. funny acting, great story line, impressive graphics, tons of missions, awesome online multiplayer and it will push your high end card(s) to the limit. 9/10",7

"very impressed. while i was not able to run the game at max settings, i was able to maximize the graphics to a point where they still exceed the graphics seen in the current generation consoles like the ps4. i am running an aging amd phenom ii x6 1100t (turbo core/coolnquiet disabled), 16gb of ddr3, and 2 asus gtx 760s in sli (4gb vram total)with the latest nvidia gta v approved drivers what i was impressed with the most is that the fact that this runs better than gtaiv... on the same hardware! rockstar did not screw this up, and has redeemed itself from that awful port that was gta iv. while it is disappointing to hear that many people with odd windows account names were unable to install and run the game, i feel as though a bug as that should not eclipse what a great game this turned out to be. graphics aside (but seriously... wow!) the game itself has not lost any of its luster gameplay-wise in the 2 years its been out. gta games just never get old. the game will have you hooked, its got me hooked on my third playthrough, and with mod support, expect the game to be even better than the console experience.",1

"looks amazing when i finally managed to stop it from crashing every 5 minutes. didnt seem to have any problems from r* social club either. like i said it looks incredible, i can nearly max it out with an amd r9 270x (make sure you download the updated drivers). pushing the textures detail up too high seems to make it a bit twitchy but still looks lovely. 10/10 would develop another stomach ulcer due to stress from figuring out why it kept crashing and thinking id just wasted 39.99 on an unplayable 60gb parasite again.",2
"the game is great and lots of fun! however, you all should know that it freezes and crashes in online multiplayer alot. expect to look and feel like a total scrub because you will crash at the worst possible time when doing heists with a group and let everyone down, and then itll rinse and repeat and everyone will hate you and unfriend you because of it. so much fun and so much to do, but eventually youll get enraged because of all the crashes. good luck, have fun ;)",6

"so im walking through a parking garage and an npc drives their car in and parks it. i glance over as they hop out and as i start walking away i hear this quiet off-beat ticking noise. what is that noise, i think its coming from the car? i walk over, puzzled, and i have one of those euphoric holy crap moments when my brain finally comprehends that it is the car cooling off... the heatshields and everything cooling off on the car are popping and ticking, just like a real car. that little detail is an example of what i love about games. if you love the wide open freedom and ridiculous sarcasm/satire of the gta series, this is a must play. it seems like they worked to distill all their previous gta games into this one gem.",3
"well. i might would reccomend it... if i could open it. i have double-no triple checked for my windows account not being affected by the glitch making sure with extra windows-profiles. when i try to enter it simply doesnt open. it says im playing for like 10 seconds then stops. i have all drivers, requirements, etc. i wouldnt reccomend it until a later developement stage.",1
"as i am writing this, some people are reporting issues with launching the game due to an issue with windows user names. unfortunately, i cannot speak for them. my experience, however, has been perfect. this game runs silky smooth on my computer, which has a i7 4770k and a gtx 980. i am running at 1080p, 60 fps and maxed out settings. i do not have a 4k monitor, so i dont know how well it runs in 4k. there is no doubt in my mind that this is the definitive version of the game. after 1 1/2 years, we finally get to see los santos the way it was meant to be seen. and thats just the graphics. my favorite thing about this port is that it doesnt even feel like a port to me. it runs like it was meant to be played on pc. the addition of the clip editor and director mode adds a whole new level of depth to the gameplay. the director mode allows you to use characters from the game. many are already unlocked, but some have to be earned through gameplay. that already sounds like so much fun, and thats before mods. which will make this game perfect.",6
"this game looks amazing and runs smooth on max settings at 3440x1440 with a 780ti.",8
"after the planned release date was put back another 3 months due to game optimizations when the game was realeased all we got was a game that was buggy. this game takes forever just to get into a game, sometimes not even loading at all. fix your god damn game rockstar",3
"im very pleased with the port of this game, it runs well even on my -tier cpu. (fx-4100) the textures look great compared to the previous version i played on the last-generation consoles, even on the normal setting. the game has a very useful video memory gauge like the other rockstar ports which makes tweaking the options a cinch. i had no trouble transferring over my gta online character from the ps3 version, and the online so far hasnt given me any trouble in terms of connectivity. i did have some trouble with what seemed like mouse acceleration, and i was unable to find an option to disable it. but after changing from raw input to directinput it seems to be much better. all in all, id say it was worth the wait.",5
"gran theft auto v is an amazing game. id have to say the optimization for pc is among the best out there and this is only a week after launch. i can consistently maintain 60 fps on max settings with a rig that i have had for 2 years (specs at bottom). i cant even recall having this game crash on me yet. the story for this game is set to be a classic as expected from rockstar. you can see characters develop through the game which is something you would only come to expect from good movies. the controls take some getting used to but overall seem efficient. i am rating this game as v/v. the only time i am not having fun in this game is during loading screens. specs: intel core i5 3570k @ 3.8 ghz, evga gtx 780, 16gb ram, 500 gb 7200 rpm hdd.",1
"spent 10 days installing 2 days trying to launch but nothing other than a crash. im sick of it and will be waiting one more month before requesting a refund. i get a crash saing social club ui has stopped working. if you can help i will return the favour",4
"the game for the most part runs perfectly fine on medium to high graphics, my issue is that after about 60-90 min of playing i get this wierd stutter occuring, i have an amd r9 270x and an i7 4770k and did not expect this kind of issue, anyone else having this problem please let me know. edit: dld amds most recent beta drivers (15.4) works perfectly now.",3
"i wont go into to much detail, other than to say rockstar is forgiven for the delays and for the terrible gta 4 port. gta v is one of the best pc games ever made not only in optimizations and graphics fidelity but the story and gameplay is top notch. rockstar out did themselves, anyone who pirates this game should be shot. rockstar put heart and soul into graphics optimizations. this game can run on a potatoe, while at the same time there are so many advanced graphics effects available for people with bleeding edge hardware to take full advantage of the cutting edge! well done rockstar!",7
"bought gta 5 for the 3rd time, totally worth every penny. using 4k dsr+ultra settings on gtx 970 is so awesome, definitely 10/10 <3",8
"everything i have done in my life up to this point has been to prepare my body for this lovely moment. took 1 hour to get into the game after release but it was worth every single second! 10/10",6
"had no idea how much left-wing garbage was in this game. i tolerate a hell of a lot, but i watched about 5 minutes of a fake tv show in this game and perused a couple of fake websites in the game, and the entire thing is absolute left-wing satirical trashing of the right. stephen colbert may have well been the games starring character. i cant believe i gave these ers money. aside from the leftist garbage, the game requires 125+ gigabytes of free space to complete the installation process. that is outrageous.",1
"a good game if you are trying to kill some time. or lose track of time. or forget real life exists. be careful. you have been warned!",5
"i just started the game after doing the bank heist mission. i hear a cat, look down then curb stomp the cat. its not in anymore pain. 10/10 would stomp again",6
"seriously cant even play the game i mean my launcher works and everything but once i got in all i see is black screen and then it said gta 5 not responding rockstar pls fix this fricking problem",1
"even better thug life simulator than gta iv! 11/10 would play again!",2
"good game but i just lost my adder!!! on gta 5 online. dont steal a car and park it in your garage if you have a car allready out and about it will delete your car. since i am pissed the  off about this issue i will be down voting untill this is fixed",7
"rockstar fix your game now, tried every fix for being stuck on the social club loading screen, nothing worked. thanks for the refund, its in my steam wallet and when you fix this pos maybe i will buy it again.",1
"fourth time buying this game, and i still dont regret it.",7
"the best roleplaying experience ive ever had. would recommend to all roleplayers. :candyman: :dfapple:",6
"i bought this to play gta online on pc. well constant server problems due to rockstar made that impossible. the issue is not on my end and there is several thousands reporting the same issue. so to warn you all if you are buying this with the expectations to play online forget about it. rockstar will never fix the network issue which have been around on ps3/4 and xbox since launch (almost 2 years) for the people who did the same mistake as me and bought it, you actually have a option to ask for a full refund from steam regardless how many days ago you bought it. grab the opportunity while you still have it!",5
"hours upon hours of fun if you have some irl friends to play with, totally worth buying ;)",3
"it is buggy as hell wait a month to buy it when the bugs are fixed but still a nice game",2
"nothing to complain about. other than the delays. happy with the outcome.",3
"this game looks so much better on the pc then on the xbox 360 i played on while i was waiting for pc release. its all the little things that make this game amazing and the time and effort they spent on the story making the characters so great together and online isnt bad either. in my opinion its one of the best games ever made. i just wish there were more games like this one",6
"im only gonna giving this 11/10 because of all the fun ive had.",7
"forever waiting for players to join my heist lobby to have them leave after 30 seconds. 11/10, would wait 2 years for pc release again.",9
"this game looked so good i had to change my underwear",3
"no words can describe the beauty of this game, worth the wait for pc gamers. game runs very smoothly :) first person mode looks amazing. car controls are bit weird but you get used to it. 9.9/10",6
"got it working by uninstalling fraps and d3d gear beautiful graphics, running it close to maximum sooooo smooth! character transfer was  easy great game, buy it.",4
"the tennis mini-game is better than actual tennis simulation games... 10/10 two games in one!",4
"although this came out after nerly two years after the orignal release, this is hands down the best version of the game i have played. the settings are top notch, it has sli and crossfire support day one and is the best optimised game rockstar has ever relased. they say you can run this game 4k@30 fps with a 760. i play at 3440x1440 with a pair of 780ti in sli and this game runs at round 75+fps on ultra settings. only thing i have to turn down is aa. i highly reccomend this game to anyone who has played the earlier version and to those who havnt yet. 10/10",5
"i love the game as a whole, especially gta online. i know about all the issues people have been reporting about the game, but the simple fact is that i have had none of those issues, here are my specs.: 16gb ddr3 corsair 1600mhz ram amd fx-8320 @ 3.50 ghz asus direct ocii gtx 760 w/ 2gb gddr5 vram installed on a 3tb 7200rpm seagate barracuda which is a seperate drive from the os. os: windows 8.1 so, since the gameplay was good and the port worked wonderfully for me (also worth nothing that i made sure everything was up-to-date before i got into the game), im going to have to reccomend this game, its about time we finally got the pc port.",1
"still a little buggy around places, some missions  up. sometimes my screen just goes black and i have to restart. but, it just got released, so i cant blame it..",3
"would give 10 franklins out of 10 franklins. great game, great graphics, great everything. i suggest buying this game to anyone who wants to have a good time.",7

"grand theft auto v: a game even better on pc. i have fun playing this game, loads of content, graphics are good altho it doesnt really run stable with my gpu (6950 2gb oc). the game tends to crash and freeze a load which will hopefully get patched later. overall, this is a damn good game with some minor issues.",7
"awesome game, awesome graphics, yay. tha crashes will be fixed dontcha worry. i didnt have a problem anyway. so thats cool. buy it plz. for meh. tank u.",4
"does not function - does not function - i repeat! does not function thats right - you waited about two years for gta 5 - the game that sold more copys then the titanic - does that mean rockstar (after several delays mind you) the game does not launch, and there are hundreds of thousands of people who cant play due to several different errors. yup rockstar likes your money, not you.",3
"finally! i got it working but i dont know the problem. i literally did nothing and it started working again.",3
"best thing that ever happened in this year :( except the part that im using amd graphich so no graphic driver support like nvidia graphic cards",10
"runs great on my computer (was built to game, but is getting older (i have a 7880 2gb, just above the recommended)), but i could get better preformance in this game. i have to play around with the graphics settings just a bit, but its fine for now. plays well with no crashes, even testing with a 360 controller (yeah, i played it on console, now cant use kb&m for this game because it doesnt feel right). the first person is pretty good, the extra music and car customization is pretty cool, and thank jeezooz there is an option for custom music again! so far, ive only played 1.1 hours, but i plan to find my graphics settings that i need and port over my old characters. and also play online. waaaaaaayyy too much online.",3
"gta5 from childhood has been accompanied me! this is a great game.",10
"unplayable for me on pc, but was great game on console. might just be my pc.",3
"way better on the pc than ps4 and xbox! graphics are 10x times better, make sure you do the driver update today for this game! nothing better then blowing crap up with your friends on the master pc race! tanks, helicopters and big explosions!",1
"all around its about the same as if you played it on xbox. although they need to fix the crashes. i crash about 2 times and hour basically making missions unplayable. 3 years and multiple delays youd thought this  would be fixed",3

"awesome though i cant figure a way to reduce my sensitivity since its ridiculously high.",8
"had it on my xbone and bought it for pc. was worth the waiting. they really made a great port, the game works smoothly in 60 fps with best graphics on my not so great graphic card. the new features are nice and now that it got released on pc i can finally play with my friends (they dont have xbone).",5
"the game itself is great. i expected to be able to at least run it on minimum settings and for the most part its reasonable. still looks better than console with shadows being the only issue. the glitches and speed of launch/ loading will probably be fixed soon. it does freeze up a bit luanching the game but i just get a snack and its loaded when i come back, probably 2 minutes at most. gameplay is fantastic, i love the story (never bothered getting it for console) and there are so many interesting things to do in the game world. if you are very impatient and expect a lot from your setup, maybe wait a few weeks for the glitches to pass. but if you can handle a bit of lag, a few glitches, and dont care too much about flawless performance, definitely buy this ultimate edition of gta 5",7
"still cannot play becouse of the amd/intel laptop combo problem r* is disapointing atm i dont recommend the game for those who have this combo ill change my opinion once i can play",1
"after playing the console version this really enforces that pc is superior. the graphics are amazing and its just so much better with higher framerates. 10/10 i skipped homework to play. now... time to start that powerpoint",2
"i have never played a more rounded game in my life. pin sharp graphics, cutting humour, brutal violence. shooting, driving, running, cycling, flying, diving, gold, tennis, darts, stocks and shares. its really all here! this is like the definative version of all the gtas to date. absolutely stunning, and im glad i waited for the pc version. keyboard and mouse is the way this game was meant to be played!",1
"best game of tennis ive played in a while 10/10 would spend 60 again",2
"crashes at startup... and while i am sure this is going to be an awesome game, it sucks to be part of the beta+ rollout while paying the full retail price. till a patch is issued, i will live vicariously through the many others on here who are in gta v heaven :)",2

"goodbye, roman! no more bowling for you! im crying of joy",5
"truly amazing. excellent port, i can almost max it out( in 1080). graphics are solid, and gameplay is amazing. controls are top notch, havent had any issues. the game is obviously the same, but pc has better damage, and a first person mode, among the much better graphics. the first person is a huge part of the game. every car interior is different, the lights on the dash function, small dings when you open the door, everything is detailed. the guns you hold in your hand have been redone, looking amazing from a first person perspective. definetely worth the buy, a pc game done right. #pcmasterrace",4
"ing amazing game, the only ing issue is that it just stops working for no apparent reason",6

"i would wait the two years again to just feel this moment again, the game runs like a charm. so far experinced very little and the scenery is stunning. the city feels livley and real right down to the nail of hitting someone with the car and watchin them fly over the windshield. this is a highly polished product that deserves your money. will update if any issues occur but for now 10/10",4
"best game ever in my 30 years of gaming experiences.",6
"i love the game but the freezes my computer after about an hour. really frustrating, i have gtx 780. its not my computer. its all over the internet, mainly with 980s. really hope they fix/respond to my ticket and fix the issue.",5
"as for the main game, not much to say other than its pretty damn good. personally, on online, id say its more of a meh, implying you dont have alarge group of friends willing to play with you whenever, however i do enjoy seeing other peoples reactions to the spazzing garage door on the fleeca hiest.also when it comes to upgrading your personal vehicles, i dont enjoy the fact that you *have* to win x amount of races in first place to unlock anything that actually upgrades the car and itsnt purely cosmetic, not so great if youre like me and not good at racing against other people, to put it more simply, i have my money, let me use it. 8/10",9

"wait years for this to come out on pc. spend $70 pre-ordering, spend hours preloading. all for what? jack f**king sh*t. once you click play, the social club launcher or whatever the f it is pops up and says loading (good so far amirite?) 5 seconds into loading, it stops working and closes. there and probably thousands, if not more with this problem and the only thing rockstar comes up with is telling people (myself included) that our pc account names will prevent us from playing. well ive always had an a-z account name. so it sure as sh*t isnt that. i would recommend this game if you could still get your pre order money back. sadly, you cant. hype simulator 2015",6

"playing with a gtx 660ti with a little overclocking and 8 core cpu at ~3.8ghz game runs smooth as silk, defaulting to near max settings and havent had any frame drops or crashes so far. rockstar certainly put in the effort to optimize the game, i suspect those with problems will either be able to work around it with some yet to be discovered trick, or will be patched up later on by rockstar.",6

"i have a decently good pc with a gtx 780, 3.4 ghz, and 8 gigs of ram. im driving along hapily with 150 fps and before i know it i have 2 fps. im using the nvidia optimized settings. someone please help. i tried everything.",2
"gta as normal, just better. not tons of miles better but good enough to be better than iv. massive open-world, tons of missions, lots of side-bits you can do, the little unofficial personal rampages you can do in this series that make it worth the fun. its hard to escape police unless youre low-level, which is how it needs to be. online play is dependent on players but plays well enough. most shocking is just how damn fast it runs on the same hardware as i played gta iv on. i was expecting massive drop in speed - its parallel or even slightly faster, despite being prettier. i have an old mobile nvidia card, so i wasnt expecting that, but i dont think you could get away with a run-of-the-mill business pc with any nvidia card - the first of the 64-bit-only games ive seen and for a reason. but with quad-cores and 8gb ram and a half-decent directx-10/11 card its more than playable at full res but its just a question of what options you have turned on. havent seen any popping-in issues but my hard drive is constantly streaming data when im playing. great game, looks great, plays great, tons of freedom, huge world and more vehicles and missions than you can shake a stick at.",4

"rockstar can suck my , absolutely no support for those who cannot play the game because of their  perma link to steam accounts... so if you bought the game on a different account not activated to steam rockstar will take outs its big willy and shuv it down your throat and make you wait 1 month to answer a ticket that will probably not help. because giving the power of unlinking your steam account to the customer is too much to handle and would give them a god complex.  you, ruined my day/week.",4

"plenty of hours on console and even more hours on pc all thanks to first person mode... *day dreams about virtual reality*",6
"the magnitude of the map and just how open the world is for exploration and causing chaos makes the game extremely fun even with no goal or mission at all. the port is very well done and plays well. controls with kb/m are clunky the first hour or two but you get used to them fast. no regrets for full price on this one, the hype was real.",2
"right so this wont be a review of the content of the game but whether or not to buy it in its current state since we all know the game  rainbows anyway. i am not reccomending this game on the pc for the sole purpose of it having optimization issues i call it the stutter essentially whenever i run the game it could run fine for 30-mins or 1 minutes or for an hour its completly random but then the game has these stuttering fits almost like trying to start up a brocken down car and it works for 10 minutes at a time. just for anybody who is looking at this and about to type well maybe its your computer specs these are my specs- gtx660ti 8gb ram i5-2310 and 5981mb left for page file use. my setup is almost identical to that of the reccomended specs on the front page of the game if that doesnt give you warning whistles you might want to consolt your local cautious pharmasist. the stutter problem gets worse the more you play i have also searched it up online and it seems alot of players are having the same issue dont buy this game right now use your head like i didnt and wait until the game is more polished i say 5 or six patches have a good day everyone.",5

"all i can say is this game is 50x better than it was on the xbox 360. the nightlife in the game looks amazing with all the reflections etc....the detailing now is alot better aswell ! i reccomend this game to anyone looking to have a chilled time with friends driving and runnning around causing havok in the city of los santos :)",4

"i could have played this game when it first released in 2013, but i stuck it out and waited for it to come to pc. two years later and a few delays, but all worth it entirely. the game looks amazing and plays really well. i guess its kinda good that all the bugs were really worked out by the console players so that we could have a bug free experience. im running the game on high settings with a 4790k and a 760 with about 50-60fps. anyway, this is the first game i have ever pre-ordered in my life and i love that i did. also its the first steam game that ive paid full price for and it was definitely worth it. right now i have about 30 hours in and i still havent run out of things to do!",7

"i cant even play the game. actually that is a lie. i can play it, for about literally 2 minutes and it crashes. yipee...sooooo fun. update #1: so i was getting the imfamous err_gfx_d3d_init error and it said if it persists to reinstall the game....yeah...the 59 gb game. that will only take me half a week to do and half my data cap for the month, so yaaaay, i am on the right track. update#2: reinstalled and i will admit it is playing better. however i did getting the error once and it is still crashing way too much. although i can now get around 2 hours in it if im lucky i just cant recommend a game i cant even play. sure i hear other people are not having any problems and trust me i wish that was the case for me, but it isnt. look i played it quite a bit on the 360 and i know it is a top knotch game, but if i pay 60 bucks for this and i cant play we have a problem. if this is fixed in the future i will update this to recommend it but as of now i would have to say stay away from it. to be honest to have this many crashes in a game they repeatedly needed to push back is unacceptable regardless if they fix it or not.",2
"i literally cannot even play the game. i meet the system requirements, i preloaded and went through the preallocation, download, and unpacking of the additional day 1 stuff. i made a new administative user using the rockstar approved characters. i updated my nvidia graphics card to the new gta v recommended driver. i installed the latest rockstar social club version. i verfied the game cashe. i run steam as an administator, and every damn time when i click play or play online my little blue icon turns green for about 45 seconds- posts that i am in game and then turns blue again. i would love to give the game a good rating but its kinda hard when i cannot even play the game after spending 3 hours after launch trying to get it to even run.",4

"ill leave this negative until i get a fix. doesnt start my game, just keep pressing retry button and nothing happens.",5
"played alot of this on ps4... even better on pc. great optimization. that was pretty much the only worry on pc. millions of reviews have been out... the port is solid. able to remain above 40 fps always at 1440p maxed out with just a single 290. much better than anticipated. even shows you how much vram is going to be used as you adjust settings. great looking game.",2
"as others have stated, this game is not ready for launch. had to go through the fail launch sequence about 10 times just to write this ing review. i waited two years and payed 60 dollars for a game that doesnt launch. you are ing me here rockstar. i took off work for this . i didnt eat last week to pay for this . i stopped playing league to download this . im a ing bronzie now. lube me up before you  me goddammit. honestly, i would refund this, but i do want to play. i do want to hang with my friends. i do want to kill some s. i want it all. but i cant. i just cant. this is a great game, but bad rats is more appealing because it ing launches ffs. wait for the patch. until then... fml",1

"this game is awesome, nice graphic. totally recommend it especially the online mode",4
"gta online comes bundled in, of course, bringing rockstars online multiplayer crime sim to the pc for the first time. its due a reappraisal now that the new heist missions have been dropped in, but its still a slightly odd combination of open-world exploration and ad-hoc pvp larceny and murder (all good) and more straightforward shooter and racer events, which dont really play to gtas strengths. its fun, but not battlefield: hardline.",5
"now from what i have played these are the issues: recommended settings gtx 660 2gb, i have a 770 2gb and i have to put the textures on normal because it physically wont let you run it when it requires more than 2gb, i wouldnt mind a bit of lag but it makes sure you cant do that. also plane controls, what the crap are they thinking making us use number keys, have you heard of wasd rockstar. a fair chunk of screen tear. the one hour unpacking after the ready to play install other than these things it is a great game 7/10",2

"a new and fresh experience with gta v with update graphics and all the other content arrived in one big bundle. no need to wait for gta online, no need to wait for hesists, all the things that were on the console is on pc as well. sure, it took a couple years for it to be released, but hey, at least they released it. optimization is pretty good from the system requirements, but with my 970 graphics card, everything on max still had some jumps on the fps. nothing too major, and nothing a couple of patches cant fix. overall, this game looks amazing, and if anybody has played on last generation console like me, you would appreciate the mesmerizing graphics.",3
"this game is fantastic, killed a hooker then stole her money. 10/10",2
"you must install correct drivers in order to even start. the game already has glitches, you cannot push esc or it will auto close down and try to reboot in safe mode. secondly when you go to take covor the game will freeze and you cant move to covor, the bots will just stand there doing nuthing. i bought this game to add to my collection soon to be all gtas...i do not reccomend buying this outrageous expensive game, sold my gut knife on csgo for this....",1

"leave it to rockstar to make a great pc port.ubisoft should take some notes!",5

"alright, im sure a lot of you have already played gta v on a console at this point, so ill spare you most of what makes this game so great. controls are nice with a kb+m and switching between that and a controller is seamless (sometimes driving is easier with the controller, but thats just me). ive notices the occasional graphical issue, but at this point im sure its just my card acting up (msi gtx 970). otherwise its the same gta we all know and love, and its finally found its perfect home on pc. praise gaben.",5

"gta v is a great game, it has a fantasic campaign and pretty good online as well, rockstar is always adding content and with the new rocktar editor along with the imporved graphics the pc version is great. i cannot give this game a possitve reveiw however because many people are plauged with problems such as not being able to play to stuttering and crashes. personally i have issues runnning in sli and the game maxes out my vram usage in gpu-z on sli gtx980s even though on a single card at the same settings it runs perfectly fine. i hope that this game can be fixed for those with issues sooner rather and later.",7
"very disappointing. having not played this on another platform previously, it was entirely new to me. the plot is very very poorly written, haphazard, vague, and short. if i hadnt messed about doing unnecessary things it could easily be completed in 10 hours. compared with gta 4, the story is severely lacking. the graphics engine and port to pc however, very well done. after the debacle with the gta 4 port i was worried. but this was ported very well and even on an old machine runs well on mid graphics. the online experience isnt particularly inspiring however. feels like they tried to include a lot, and in doing so made it quite unenjoyable. i wish i could recommend this, the engine and potential are great. but the story and characters are just pathetically scripted. their actions in the parts you cannot control make no sense at all (including the npcs), and if there is a plot that youre supposed to be able to follow, it seems huge parts of it are never spoken, and just assumed happened. wait until its on offer, was not worth preordering.",6
"gta 5 cannot be matched by any other $60 game on the market today, you have a solid +60hours of quality content, i cannot think of how they can top themselves after this. but somehow they always manage to deliver. if there is a game company today that deserves your money, this company rockstar.",6
"third time purchasing gta v. youre lucky we love you, rockstar.",3
"edit 2~ installed amd beta drivers and they helped majorly. if anyone has any problems on a good rig, download the amd or nvidia drivers. they help a ton. game runs great now although i cant tell any differences in graphical quality between this one and current gen consoles (running on high+ goodies). gta online is as you expect, a bunch of s with sticky bombs blowing everything up and ive encountered quite a few children already. story is great though. hell i bet you already had it and beat it. well, buy it and beat it on pc because why the  not?",3

"i enjoy this game and do recommend it to others who like the genre. it is an allround great game by my taste. i have had no issues in installing the game, the rockstad platform is not slowing me down, and i would say i am relatively really fast in game after starting it.",4
"i never expected to enjoy gta v after how dispointing it was in 2013 when it released on xbox 360 and ps3. the biggest problems with those versions was the abysmal framerate and that the game took away actual gameplay with auto-aim. im very pleased by the above average pc port that rockstar gave to this title. this game is far more comparable to the ps4 / xbone versions as the graphics have been increased, with the addition of first person mode. the better graphics and framerate really show that this is the definitive edition of the game that for some reason took way longer than it should have.",3
"17 h the day after its out pretty cool. even loading screen are fast as hell. #pcmasterrace. as for the pure perfomance of the game ive got a 60 fps constant with a gtx 760 gb from nvidia not the best card thought. also the heist are amazing when you are with poeple you know and like because they will help you out not drag your out to restart an heist on the bank for expample ive wiped 60 time on an heist before we quit it because two of the poeple of the heist were not as performant as a japanese friend that was level 100+ i was only level 15 at the time. as for the solo its amazing but everybody knew it already. and try to get into heist very quickly and add perfomant poeple to your friend on the social rocktars stuff! my best luck to you in this amazing game. best regards,",9
"great performance and great gameplay. couldnt have wished for more.",4
"so yeah i cant write a review becouse for some reason this game is crashing for me in mid gameplay or wen the game is lainching and it gets stuck on the loading screen i wish i can have fun on pc online but with this crashes i just cant write something possitive about the game and im not the only one with this issue others are having the same problem as me and my pc is for gaming im this is what im runing with nvidia geforce gtx 760 install physical memory ram 8.00gb processor intel core i5-4670k and evrything windows graphys crad is all up to date but idont know why is crashing all the time i order another stick of 8.00gb to make it up to 16gb to see if it improves if it does ill write a possitive review and i have ask rockstar for help with this issue and nothing no respond back and they have come up with the stupidest updates that dont solve the problem for people that have the same issue as me.",2
"played on both xbox 360 and xbone, but it didnt last half as long as this. 60fps really makes a difference. everything runs smoothly and i see no significant bugs or anything worth noting, aside from connection problems once in a while, dropping me into empty lobbies, but perhaps thats on my side. rockstar did a really great job on this one!",3
"grand theft autos next installment of the series, or atleast the port for it, is superb. i was one of the people who could not for the life of me wait for this game, yet would be unsure if it would be a good port. after playing 6 hours straight i have to say, even after beating the game twice, it feels like a whole new game. this is the ultimate version, i highly reccomend it, it runs great and looks amazing. 10/10 would wait again (pls no dont let me wait) ps: totally worth the having all the dlcs at launch, we aint gotta wait for hiest #pc masterace",3

"ive always been a big fan of rockstar. they are my favorite developer. that being said i have bought this game 3 times, and it is well worth it in my opinion. i bought this on ps3, xbox one, and now pc. ive been waiting for a pc release since the game was announced in the beginning. this has to be one of the best games i have ever bought because even after around 100 hours on the ps3 version, 40 hours on the xbox one version, and with the above amount on the pc version i still find that this game does and will have a bunch of replayability for years to come. and for the sake of the race: 4k 60fps or die",3

"worth the 60.00 dont see why theres so many neg reviews.....alot seem to be not updated systems... either way great game. worth the money and alot of fun to be had online",8
"wait till all the issues are resolved. pro: - amazing graphics -fun!!!!!!!!!!!!! -online gameplay -cars,bikes,helicopters,planes,boats -mansions,appartments cons: - tons of issues and glearing buggs (as to be expected) - stuttering - connectivity issues , crashes - hours of hair pulling",3
"this is awesome!!! games run properly, very well optimized, port done right, and do you know? i love this gameeeee it has small bug, stuttering, but it doesnt make sense, i hope rockstar will be fix this as fast as they can, i love you rockstar :d 100/10",4
"game of the year simulator. if youre thinking about buying a game and you dont have gta5 you basically need this game. beware you need a pretty fast computer to keep up, the game is cheap in comparison to what you might need to spend to get it running but i can play it on a radeon hd 5870 1gb without much fuss so the fact that it can run on 2009 hardware is pretty impressive. no complaints in the optimization department. i must say, the pc options are fantastic. there is a lot of tweaking to do, especially in regards to the controller and keyboard settings in addition to the expansive performance tweaks. my favorite part is having a keyboard and mouse and gamepad in front of me and when the game gets to an intense shooting part i can put down my controller and use the keyboard/mouse and start shooting without having to go to a settings menu and change anything. it just works. its perfect. the gameplay itself needs no introduction. you can do pretty much anything. even online play is pretty good, first time i played two guys were in an airplane and nosedived right into me while on foot and everyone died. 10/10",3

"this is by far the best game realeased to date in any genre imo it out classes everthing out there period. this is the bench mark in pc gaming for sure. what a joy to play. i wish and hope all other game devs watch and take note of what is expected these days. rockstar will get my money all day long when they produce qaulity. ps those of you ing with negative reviews beacause they cant run the game need to get a life or a better pc.",7
"love the game so far but my only issue is that my i5 4690k cant handle the game :( might have to upgrade to the i7 4790k... not looking forward to that. but oh well, this game is amazing on pc :d edit: cpu heavy game: please advise",3

"right so this wont be a review of the content of the game but whether or not to buy it in its current state since we all know the game  rainbows anyway. i am not reccomending this game on the pc for the sole purpose of it having optimization issues i call it the stutter essentially whenever i run the game it could run fine for 30-mins or 1 minutes or for an hour its completly random but then the game has these stuttering fits almost like trying to start up a brocken down car and it works for 10 minutes at a time. just for anybody who is looking at this and about to type well maybe its your computer specs these are my specs- gtx660ti 8gb ram i5-2310 and 5981mb left for page file use. my setup is almost identical to that of the reccomended specs on the front page of the game if that doesnt give you warning whistles you might want to consolt your local cautious pharmasist. the stutter problem gets worse the more you play i have also searched it up online and it seems alot of players are having the same issue dont buy this game right now use your head like i didnt and wait until the game is more polished i say 5 or six patches have a good day everyone.",5

"amazing, they finally got gta right ... the high res textures and smooth gameplay is pretty impressive. as some gamers as mentioning, every now and then a frame stutter will happen for about 1 second when im driving really fast (not sure if thats a hd seek issue or something that just needs to be patched). my rating is 98/100 !!",7

"lives up to the hype, and runs on a system under the minimum specs. solid 30fps on an i3 4130 dual core, 8 gigs of ram, and my dated gforce gtx 550 ti (on low/normal settings).",5
"first of all, let me start off by saying they never should have released a game as broken as this. i cant run it for 20 minutes without blue screening, but that doesnt change my opinion of this game. it is still one of the greatest games in the franchise, and of all time in my opinion. (vice city will always beat out the others for me). for the small time i could play it, the controls were incredibly fine tuned and responsive, and the controller support is phenomenal. the game is very well optimized, especially if you have the newly released amd/nvidia drivers. the level of detail is wonderful to have, and was nice to see coming from the ps3 version. even though its currently a broken piece of , i will still reccomend it.",2
"this game is awesome!! 10/10 masterpiece +graphics +port from console +gameplay +sound +music in game +have fun glitch lol",10
"this game is extremely well optimized and is just gorgeous. i run at 60 fps i started as a newbie and worked my way up to rank 12 in one day (yea sure im a noob but who cares?) i enjoyed every bit of it. a new update was released from rockstar giving amd graphics card users the ability to play which got me extremely excited to get the game going i started it up and was just like i expected it to be, just better. my experience today: -great details -reflections -shadows -ranking system -online tutorial -full controller support and more but cba to list it here for now. im recommending it because it is a very great game and you should buy it, the 60$ i paid was imo worth it.",4
"what is with it always entering windowed mode and going to the lowest resolution.....",4
"one does not know true pain until theyve downloaded gta v at 600kb/s. 10/10 would download ag... nvm i wouldnt",7
"runs really smooth and graphics look very nice! (running on a gtx970) if youve been waiting for the pc release its definitely worth it. if you played it for the console, graphics will be night and day :). graphics: 9/10 compatibility: 9/10 multiplayer: 9/10 editor: 10/10 (make your own movies!) chop: 10/10 (chop does what chop does best :) ) other notes: you can max out most of settings then lower down the shadows and still maintain about 60-70fps which is pretty good :)",2
"most optimized game ive ever played. it feels like im playing video games for the first time again. literally walking around staring at textures because it looks that great.",3
"already played the ps3 version. the pc version has a lot more potential and additional features. the graphics are phenomenal! cant wait to finish the story once again and see what the online mode brings :)",4

"i will not be reviewing the content, because i guess everybody knows what to expect (i have never played and seen almost no footage of console gamplay so im having a blast on story mode) performance wise my specs are i7 2600k 4.5ghz - gtx970 - 32gb ram purchase went smooth as it gets, buy, download, register for the first time to rsc, launch and play, just like that. game runs really fine for me almost maxed except aa (just fxaa), grass on very high (there is ultra) and shadows on high. almost 100fps, using vsync anyway to avoid screen tearing. i havent jump into online yet and it seems a lot of people are having troubles for now. for my personal experience i would recommend it 100%",7
"no doubt this is the best version of gta v, just a shame it took this long to get here. optimization is pretty good but definitely could be better, the graphics looks stunning along with the improved pedestrian and traffic density. the settings is also pretty good with a lot of options. overall id say it was worth the wait, but next time dont make us pc gamers wait this long and release it alongside the console version.",5

"warning: for those with motion sickness issues. the game looks great! wish i could play it. seems like fun. i bought it .. played it for 30 mins or so.. got back motion sickness when when driving around. the way they did the camera work didnt agree with me. i turned off head-bopping in the menu, tried a bunch of other stuff. but it was still bad. i was able to get my purchase refunded from my account settings.",1

"pay 60 euros get a good game yes, beautiful graphics. but u cant just crouch, or prone.... this is so bad. then some people cannot even download it , some other people cant play with friends and get various errors! well all this, after payying 60 euros + waiting a ton of time.  diz gaem! fix your  rocketgames!",5

"wait till they fix the game before you buy.even alot topend pc having problems.but will buy as soon as it is fixed.got my refund!",1
"i love the detail put into the game, from the characters, to the missions, and even the little things like stockmarket changes due to the missions you complete in-game. i would recommended it for what i mentioned above, but i still have big problems like everyone else. when i started the benchmark, it loaded the very first mission and the benchmark scene at the same time randomly switching between the two. i get massive fps drops randomly (down to 9fps typically), from walking down the street, to driving a car at moderate speed. ive even gotten some graphical glitches from time to time, for example a rectangular line of light appearing around my character, and it even not loading an entire area it spawns my character in making them fall through the ground. as well as other things. so like others i wont be currently recommended it. edit: also i thought i should mention that the money promised in-game for people who pre-ordered is only given to franklin.",5

"good game. some people had trouble with the launcher. i had to turn off my firewall for the launcher to work. hope that helps.",4
"if the workshop is available for mods that will be more awesome!!",5
"this game not only runs way better than gta 4 but, it is also really fun and imersive i fully recomend buy it!",4
"this game looks so much better on the pc then on the xbox 360 i played on while i was waiting for pc release. its all the little things that make this game amazing and the time and effort they spent on the story making the characters so great together and online isnt bad either. in my opinion its one of the best games ever made. i just wish there were more games like this one",6

"so basically i paid 60 euro for an error msg. or i am in a paralell universe where this is an ubisoft game...",1
"this port is complete  atm when it comes to online, i looked it up and it isnt just me, a lot of people keep ending up in sessions by themselves and when they get into a game full of people it only last like 10 mins before it says everyone has left even though it was really you who got disconnected, most of the time it just says stuff before im done joining like lost connection to the session and then it returns me to single player where i have to load everything all over again and try again, ive looked at rockstar reports on this and they keep saying the same damn thing about doing stuff with your ports, but everyone in the comments says it doesnt help, they are being useless right now and we really need a fix. and the  rockstar says to do to fix it, we shouldnt have to do that at all, it should be there job. im pretty dispointed since this is gamebreaking for me and a lot of other people, if this problem was fixed i would rate this 10/10, but since i can only connect and play 15% of the time i give it 2/10 i would be really greatfull if someone could help me with this issue.",4
"best game of its time. its that game everyone can enjoy, loads of high quality content. online is fantastic! even if youre playing without friends, the community is alright. its the game that pushed ahead of its time. there is no game that comes close to it. its a must buy for any gamer doesnt matter if you havent played the previous ones. this one is just a must buy.",8
"fun with friends, shooting random people and taking their car what more could i say about grand theft auto? other than its awesome",7
"not bad but for my laptop why is not working :( theres never show up for rockstar games launcher on my laptop",3
"i couldnt enjoy this game on a console, but maybe its even better because i was familiarized for the first time with gta v on pc. the game is well optimized and polished, didnt notice many bugs yet, the graphics are stunning, even at medium settings. the gameplay is way more developed in comparison to gta iv and the story is promising to be very interesting. i dont regret any cent i spent for this game. totally worth it.",3
"really rockstar? 2 years and 3 delays seemed to have added up to nothing. the game is unplayable for me as as the launcher crashes and i get a message saying gta v launcher has stopped working. it then checks for a solutio to the problem and closes. and it also seems about 25% of all people who bought gta v are experiencing game destroying problems. i have tried reinstalling both the game and social club, verifying my cache files, restarting steam and my computer, and fidddling with my gpu. nothing worked even the slightest. rockstar - fix. this. now.",6
"all i want to say is: the glorious pc master race 60 fps 4k 3d lord gaben",3
"the game run smoothly, but i dont know why i cant create a heist job even though im at rank 22",9
"i keep it short, i will list the good and bad things about this game; good: + open world with a lot of stuff to do. + first person view. + many options for video and controls etc. + wide variety of vehicles. bad: - too many things force you into cutscenes or scripted events. - no full customization in single player mode. - long loading times during activities in online mode. - no fluent transition between sandbox play and doing activities, everything will force you into menus and loading screens. - main story characters switch to their default clothes every time you switch character. - unreliable system to store vehicles, vehicles might disappear and its impossible to buy bicycles even when having an empty garage. - forced to play with story characters you might not like and having to sit trough every degenerate thing they say and do is painful. it could learn a thing or two from the saints row games when it comes to customization and fluent game play, but its still a decent game overall, i would rate it a 7/10.",3
"playing this rendition in 4k and all settings maxed. r*, you have outdone yourselves on this release. hats off to everyone involved! you guys rock!!!",3
"runs great, looks great, plays great. whats not to love about it?",6
"this is a beautiful pc port. if only they hadnt delayed it so much.",6
"first: its a great game, the time waiting for the pc version was absolutly worth it!",4
"first of i do like to game, i really do, but i cant recommend it at all due to the uterly bad engine/servers. well i couldnt play the game at first, because i had an invalid username, searched for an fix and found the workaround to make a new windows account and play it on there, worked perfectly fine. then came the patch for fixing the usernameissue, it did fix the usernames... but i lost all my story progress. ok fine, it were only a few hours, nothing i couldnt play again. but today i wanted to play with some friends, we randomly disconnected and then every time i tried to join one of my friends my game froze and crashed. thats what i call a aaa title aka. the ultimate edition we waited so long for. the long loading times and bad performance just add up to this pile of  that they call optimised",4
"this game is better on pc than it is on xbox. thank god i swithced",2
"rockstar games the company that will never disappoint me ;) keep doing great job :d",2
"i cant play my gta v because i linked the wrong social club account to my steam account seems like a prob that could easily be fixed but nooooooooo rockstar made the link permanent i just blew 60$ because im stupid but i know i cant be the only one who has done this",1
"its fun if you got friends, if you dont then you can at least try to have fun.",5
"i walked around pushing people over and shouting at them for an hour 10/10",4
"is running like butter at 60 fps on my gtx 770, at very high settings. i think rockstar has finally done it with gta pc ports. though it took 2 years, i am glad they made us wait rather than push out a pos. get it and experience all gta v has to offer!",5
"just play on 1st person jesus im a insane pizzaboy delivering murderers on the blocks",5

"best game ever! been hype for months for this game and its better then i thought it would be!",7
"without a doubt a great and fun game, but the problem is that online the servers are so bad have fun driving or shooting any other player. its complete desync 90% of the time, and before you comment, maybe your internet is just , its not because i know the difference between ping lag and actual poor servers that arent keeping up with the load on them. my point is that the game is fun and the online would be playable for 100s of hours if you could actually kill things in less than 200 bullets due to desync.",8
"i do not think i can say much about this game that hasnt already been said. its brilliant. the exploration, the size, the look, this is the definitive version of this game. and as more and more mods are made, there is going to even more more amazing and fun things to do in the game. the story i find to be not as good as rockstars other works (this is a far cry from red dead redemption) but is story really the main reason we play gta? and gta online adds an amazing amount of replayability and fun.",2
"i have played over 700 hours on the playstation 3, and since it is has been graced upon pc community, ill get to have another 700+ hours of great enjoyment. with the new features, optimizations, and beautiful graphics/effects; this has to be the definitive version of grand theft auto v that rockstar was hoping to achieve.",9

"everything about it is superior to the console version, the graphics are just amazing.. online community is still mostly s who want to just run around killing you repeatedly and troll eachother over the mics. the only problem is ive never had a game take up my cpu cores like this game.. it runs at 100% almost all the time (i5 4690) and stutters",4

"cant say how disappointed i am right now , seeing the game downloaded for 3 hour and unboxed for 1 hour , i still cant play the game. rockstar such a big company release a game than hasnt been full made and it has a big name gtav , i mean not what im excepting , i hope they can work on that asap .",3

"had to format c: for the game to function properly! not due to the user name, but for every other reason this game had a problem with my pc. havent had a single error since, though! game is gorgeous and runs really smooth, even when settings are set to above my gpu memory limit. if you havent played the story yet, yourre in for a real treat. else theres gta online. prepare to get shot alot in freemode, but it is also your right to pass on the tradition as soon as you hit the higher levels. just watch your back as you become a red player (also a sao reference).",5

"i have an athlon 2 x3 460 cpu, a pallit 450 gts graphics card and 6gb ram. i am running the game with no problems at all, although i would love to play on max settings. to be honest i expected disappointment cos of all the hype, i mean how could any game live up to that? it does!!!! the definative version of gta!!! 10/10",4
"no. i meet all of the requirements for this game, and when i try to play it takes forever to load, it lags extremely at the absolute lowest settings, giving me about 2-5 fps, and when you try to drive it just lags. my friend gets the same problems. you could also look at other reviews if you dont believe me. i wouldnt recommend getting this game until rockstar makes it more playable.",1
"will probably change when ever game starts working. launch was terrible, rockstar support is nonexistant and only seem to be helping with mismatched keys/social club. im one day from refunding this bs..",5
"servers are still horrendous. every gets kicked off of servers constantly, in the middle of jobs or just cruising. loading screens take forever all the time. i have 300/300 internet and these issues happen to many other people as well. until they fix their servers i would not recommend wasting your money on this game.",4

"there are a  ton of bugs (gta online), but the game looks beautiful and the story mode is great.",5
"im very positive about this game, we all know whats good about it. still some points that need attention: - combat is quite bad (especially if you played a lot of shooters) it feels clunky, slow, weird hit registration, annoying movement. - first person mode is a bit of a flop. it could have been made a lot better. - interface and keymapping is bad, just like any console port. having to press enter or moving your mouse to a small corner to confirm something doesnt work smooth. it just feels slow like on a console. (played gta5 on xbox360 for about 200 hours) combat was actually better on the 360, felt way more fluent.",3
"i have been waiting 2 years for the game to come on pc, during that time i have been playing on the xbox 360 and i was impressed still. hopefully they will release gta 6 straight away for the pc in the future",4

"it is pretty fun, but after a while, the game begins to stutter and even crash. overall i would say that the graphics enhancements were well done, but it is not really as well optimized as other games ive seen. the story is great and the world of los santos is truly immersive.",5
"as of writing have only played a few hours of online but i am already very impressed. playing with friends is a blast. i anticipate many good times to be had with this game, glad it finally came to pc with the improvements from xb1/ps4. controlling vehicles with keys took getting used to for me but keybinding and/or a gamepad can fix that. other than that, no gripes. exemplary port.",1

"as soon as i got in game i set everything to lowest details to simulate the feeling of going from ps3 to pc when i changed the graphics to high. to my dismay the game looked better on all low graphics than the ps3 and i was robbed of my experience. worse than that i was given 1.5 million dollars and my old character from the console version and the ability to earn and claw my way to the top was brutally stripped from me. the first person mode is so emersive that flying makes me sick, the ability to record is taking up space on my hard drive, and dont even get me started on my infuriating and uncanny ability to aim with precision now that i can use mouse and keyboard. its made the game far to convenient. 10/10 would waste 2 years of my life and drain my daughters college fund again.",7

"my eyes... simply stunning to behold, movie quality viewing and gameplay; the cost is hard drive space (60 gb), real money (40), and needing a beast pc to run it well. ive not noticed any major league bugs since playing, and as yet have just been playing through the story mode so havent seen the online content (i will update my review once ive had a chance to check it out). if youve played gta iv (which is good), then you will love gta v (which is better!).",2

"thank you to the xbox and playstation gamers for beta testing gta v. after 2 years of the beta the full game has been realesed",4
"yes, this is the game i was waiting for, but there is a single and huge issue for me which i hope will be fixed: the car driving physics and crash physics are very simplified. for everyone who liked gta iv (the physics there is much better) this is a huge disappointment... i really, really hope that rockstar will fix this or at least add some setting to control the level of arcade mode and crash damage. if not rockstart then god bless mod makers. for now for any serious gamer the game is unplayeble.",2
"damn good. just needs a patch/nvidia drivers to sand down the performance a little. the performance is not necessarily horrible but it aint perfect/very good either. decent. the modern age classic game... this game is hude. huge map, environment. beautiful stellar graphics. best performance on the pc. so much to do and you can sink hours into the game!! ive only scraped the surface with 5-6 hours of playtime.",3
"does not function - does not function - i repeat! does not function thats right - you waited about two years for gta 5 - the game that sold more copys then the titanic - does that mean rockstar (after several delays mind you) the game does not launch, and there are hundreds of thousands of people who cant play due to several different errors. yup rockstar likes your money, not you.",3
"well after 14hours of problems regarding social club,errors etc. after launch i was pissed off. toke a while to fix everything on my end, if you buy it make sure if you have windows 7 service pack 1 update, if you have pirated win7 get the sp1 update from their site or 3rd party site. once everything was done, game runs smothly, online doesnt crash, truly experience worth the money!!! i give this 9.7/10",3
"i have changed my non-recommendation to a recommendation after rockstar released a patch to fix the issues in their optimized game. everything seems to be working fine now, so it appears ill be able to rate the games content in the future (if i remember) rather than the crashing i was experiencing.",3
"i will not be reviewing the content, because i guess everybody knows what to expect (i have never played and seen almost no footage of console gamplay so im having a blast on story mode) performance wise my specs are i7 2600k 4.5ghz - gtx970 - 32gb ram purchase went smooth as it gets, buy, download, register for the first time to rsc, launch and play, just like that. game runs really fine for me almost maxed except aa (just fxaa), grass on very high (there is ultra) and shadows on high. almost 100fps, using vsync anyway to avoid screen tearing. i havent jump into online yet and it seems a lot of people are having troubles for now. for my personal experience i would recommend it 100%",7

"it forcess you to have rockstar account. it automatically assigns the rockstar account with the steam account. it cannot run without internet. if you ever used some dummy rockstar account with your steam account you will not be able to run the game as you can not use different account and can not access the dummy account. in other words i can no longer play rockstar games on my steam account, and all the ones i bought are unaccessible.",1
"going to start with negatives: - no more street food vendors. wtf r*? - cars either refuse to react because you are slow or overreact if are going fast. - killed a streetwalker and medics didnt show up - after watchdogs and being able to creep on streetwalkers, gtav streetwalkers are kinda dull and lifeless. wish they had more ai to them. - car handling and damage model is . pros: - the world itself is well done and decently sized. - for a game with the open world scope it looks good. - seems well optimnised and runs great. - its gta. will update after i play some more.",4

"i have been waiting for this for forever. now that its out im having mixed feelings. its extremely fun and i love buying new clothes for my character. my biggest issue however is that the lowest graphic setting is 853 mb and my computer only has around 500 mb. they really need to release an update b/c i dont wanna see nothing but pixel splotches and i cant get my money back.",1
"gta v? great- a blast to play, pretty, versatile. only complaint is the time it takes to initially load the game. gta online? more bug-ridden than simcopter, but at least simcopter was fun for it. had to reinitialise social club twice, got stuck on a prompt at the end of a tutorial race, tutorial mode refuses to shut off & i subsequently cant join friends in-game, ive had glitches where my character gets stuck moving forward+left (as if id started the game with a joystick nudged to the side), ive been stuck in shopping screens because escape does nothing, typing in chat also triggers any hotkeys in shopping screens, and ive had to alt-f4 a half-dozen times in 2 hrs of gameplay because esc did nothing.",4

"i have played the game on both ps3 and ps4 and so far steam experience is the most adorable. game runs extremely smooth on my rig and the visuals are totally worth the delays game had during the development journey. if you are a fan of the serie or havent heard of grand theft auto ever, this is game you should buy if you are capable of running it. one of the best steam releases during 2015.",4

"it runs really smooth for about 5 minutes after that i get weird stutters every few seconds. might just be me , or maybe a bug... will keep it possitive for now in the hope it gets fixed.",3
"i love this game, the graphics omg the best i came from ps3 to pc and i am loving it i recommend people to buy such a fun game to play you wont regret it. :d",5
"very good game. also i recommend it for player who have bought this game on x360 or ps3",4
"absolutely fantastic game, horrible optimization for online, game lags on even the most high end computers for a large portion of the gta community. just play the single player for now, do not even bother online with all the errors like having to do a tutorial that never ends and it dissalows you to buy homes in game and other features. hopefully these errors get fixed soon.",5
"this game is amazing. this game should to be the game of the year. and should to be best game ever !!! i recommend this game for you!!!! best game ever 10/10",9
"alright this game is so cash money. worth the asking price on anyday. especially if this is the first time you play this game, as it was for me. i managed to avoid spoiling everything about this game. its gorgeous, and the campaign is pretty fantastic. i wasnt expecting interesting protagonist with great personalities in a believable world. i wasnt expecting missions and tasks to be interesting or fun either. but i am sitting here very plesantly suprised and having a great tine. if you have the rig to run this game at its highest settings at 1080 or higher, youre guranteed a good time in a vast world. a game that deserved and lived up to the hype almost 2 years ago still delivers today.",5
"maybe if you enjoy the story, but online is terrible. clunky movement system, instant kill headshots (regardless of armor bonuses), broken cars given freely to griefers, and probably hacks all over the place with no anti-cheating resource available.",6
"one of the most detailed game ive ever seen. worth its money and time spent in waiting. the true successor of grand theft auto series, now with even more detailed story. storytelling, graphics, activities, everything is perfect here. but grand theft auto: online is still crap, sorry. no heists can make me stay in 30-player world where other 29 are barely intelligent kids. and missions/races are boring as hell too.",8
"lgbtaq individuals of canis lupus familiaris are under-represented in video games. this game fixes that. 69/70",4
"so far, yes its worth the money. solid port, my logitech orion spark keyboard even lights up based on which character i use as well as wanted level. nice touch! gamepad works nicely and comes in handy if you like it, my only complaint is losing cars after i mod them, and thats really my own fault. 2 thumbs up. p.s. zero time played in multi-player.",5
"about the most fun you can get from a game and its superb really, graphics and music keep you going all the way through and the epic missions that are by far the best.",6
"now that finally my game started working (after spending a few hours). i can say that this game is worth every single euro/buck. the graphics are absolutly amazing and a game very well optimized. the story is interesting, more detailed than the story mode on ps3/4 or xbox. the mode online is interesting and fun, consider it the multiplayer playground where everything can happen. this game is, what everyone expected a 9/10 ign rate. until now ive seen no bugs. a very good game to spend some hours playing and great to play with friends. i cant wait to see the mods that are coming. if you are not decided if u should or not buy, i tell you that you should. see you there!",2
"first gameplay expirence: i got in my car and drove to my helicopter, then over a little while i picked two guys up. i took the heli to the stip club and got out for the atm. i come back outside and my helicopter has been stolen by one guy, the other shoots me. 11/10 great community",2
"this is pc porting / optimizing at its best, and most patient. this is what the community expects from a developer that delays a title, for it to be as complete a pc experience as possible, and have dimminished a sense of it being made for something inferior. rockstart has accomplished that w/ gta5 - its an amazing to look at experience, and it runs flawlessly. we all already know how great the content and story is, so ill leave this review as is. its a great game on the pc. it truly is the ultimate edition.",6
"i will write a substantial review once i finish watching daredevil on netflix while periodically trying to actually get into the game since it wont even get past the play gta window. daredevil: one of the best shows on at the moment. 10/10",3
"14 hours in, im enjoying the game. main characters are strangely likable and interesting. gameplay is more or less like iv, but smoother in some respects and missions where you can switch between characters become a lot of fun. the special abilities do seem just a tad overpowered at times though. port seems good. im not running it quite maxed out and have the occasional frame rate hiccough in certain circumstances, but it isnt anywhere near bad enough to say its not a good port. if anything, it could do with the settings menu being less annoying to navigate. the intro movies could also do with being skippable after first launch, they get very annoying when playing with settings that require a reboot. i have experienced a consistant bug with the benchmark going crazy and failing a mission halfway through (it seems to start a new story mode at the same time or something) (pc gamer had the same issue), which made setting up a bit more of a hassle than it needed to be.",8
"wow this game is amazing and to be honest am blessed i had absolutely no issues what so ever except not seeing the ok button in bottom right under steam key pop up after linking accounts /facepalm running this on my gtx 780 @ 1920 x 1080 144hrz with all on ultra and having again no issues. well worth the wait and i really hope everyone else can get their issues sorted soon so they can enjoy this masterpiece 10/10 cant wait to bang a hoe so tried out online and its so much fun ,managed to find me a hoe and a quite spot ,to have another player pull up beside me looking for my hoe ,much honking was initiated and she got scared and legged it !!!!!",5
"welp only logged about 26 hours on this game. so far holy **** is it fun! just like when i had it on xbox 360! i love the revamped graphics for the pc but the sheer amount of detail in this game is amazing! it can be just dumb fun or the most complex game you have ever played lol its up to you to decide how youre gonna play it!",6
"it is a great game. the graphics are amazing. cant stop playing it.",2
"well... its not even a question. buy it. the only reason you wouldnt have that game, is because of your low  specs!",7
"*pro tip, ignore the negative reviews that have 20+ hours of gameplay but their review states they are locked out of the game... by far the best game in the series. first person view mode is a great addition to an already fantastic game, crisp graphics and a video editor are just icing on the cake. story is good and improved from previous versions by having 3 main characters, all of which are introduced to eachother through some pretty funny circumstances. the multiplayer is top notch and considering it was a free update (from 360/ps3) its amazing rockstar has delivered as much as they did. heists improve the mp even further by giving you a team and multiple objectives to work towards a high payout. none of the previous gtaiv issues on pc are present and it really seems rockstar learned some valuable lessons from their previous release. i cant recommend this game enough.",3
"after 22 hrs on this game : got this cons and pros :) pros : + good stories + in a + so many funny moments + good for play with your groups of friend cons : - soooo long on loading when connected to gta v - random game crash and finally : 9/10 game of this yearr !! update : - wanna playing tank vs mode ? - wanna playing jet vs mode ? - wanna playing escort mode ? - wanna race another people ? - wanna kill people in head with heavy sniper ? - wanna run your friend with your car / motorcycle ? if you wanna do what i listed above, so you must have this game in your library !!",4
"this is the gta game i have been waiting for since san andreas. it delivers everything missing from gta4 and so much more. 10/10",6
"i remember it saying that i would get a extra 350k for pre-ordering gta before march 31...... didnt happed ... but i still got the 1 mil for online and 500k or the story mode. i have a decent computer ( not a monster but a good one ) and it runs very smooth on my settings. it look beautiful btw. there are also bugs like when you rob a grocery store and the door wont open leaving you stranded in there, also when i am driving close to a bridge i see a giant grey triangle right inside of it which confuses me because i can see everythibg around it quite nicely but its just that damn bridge. what would i rate it ?? based on day one errors ( that have been fixed within 24 hours ) and bugs and minor glitches....... a solid 8. this is a must buy if you have not played the consloe versions or if you have some extra cash to throw around. notice: gta online works now fyi just incase you dont know or if you heard it is broken.",1
"the cops ran me over, gave me a three star wanted level, then ran over me again 10/10 police brutality",9

"best game ever created !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",4
"id never experienced such slow downloading speeds since everybody was downloading ios 8.... (and im on a 100mb connection). guess servers got pretty busy. game is awesome, i played the x360 version and have seen the ps4 from a friend, this certainly deserves a bow. looks stunning (playing it at very high settings). 60fps its a thrill. worth the wait!",5
"rockstar has re-learned how to make pc games. better late than never i guess. im on a 3 year old pc (i5-2550, gtx 560ti) and i was worried about being able to run the game at all. its currently running at 60fps on 1920x1080. not maxed obviously but the game still looks pretty darn good. way better than the ps3 version i played over a year ago.",3
"ok i spent 40 to pre order this game thats fine the date is delayed again, bit annoyed but ok ok 14th of april release cant because of 60gb download 16th of april downloaded ok lets play nothing happens reinstalling 21th of april reinstalled nothing happens rockstars support crew is non existent and steam cant be bothered to help i think 40 is expensive for something i cant even play",1
"first time playing on pc was with pesants for 2 months before it got released first frakin group all had mics and we even teamworked all the way through humane raid from the coke the insurgent the harrier and so forth we became the expendables 5 got into the first harrier and all i heard was highway to the dangerzone and so before any of my teammates got off the platform into their jets all aircraft was gone one of our team members even sounded like jet li and even did a quote exactly like him in the last raid but 10/10 would top gun again!",5
"its still early on in this games life, but even at release the game plays and looks amazing even on my 760. you will need a fair amount of vram, so watch out and be prepared.",3
"this game has been out for years now, so you should already have a good opinion on the game and its gameplay. the main thing people worried about was optmization, because gta 4 was a disaster. however, i am glad to say that so far this game is very well optimized. i am running this with a gtx 970 and i am never below 60 fps on highest settings.",2
"this game is truly amazing. 1. looks great, runs great. 2. easy to pick up, doesnt bore quickly 3. some hard nut achievements 4. great storyline, best multiplayer gta has ever seen id type more, but i gotta get back to my missions... cya",7
"its a huge step up from ps4 and such. the pc version shines with color and view. textures are amplified and crisp and even a low end gpu can handle most tasks. my gtx 780 runs everything maxed out at 60 fps now that is a deal.",1
"did you know that you can achieve  from a game? neither did i... neither did i...",2
"so long, consoles, and thanks for all the testing!",3

"nothing better then gta games! but this is awesome!!!!!",9
"no launch issues, great work with my not so good videocard, no freezes, excellent start, excellent missions, it was worth to wait, simpliest the main ing event of this spring. thank you rockstar!",5
"you cant play online without having someone blow up your car... then screaming in their microphone ooooooooohhhhhhh kidd get rekt m8 your so bad *swear words* mom comes in saying what the heck did you say and that kid says have to go sorry *friend*! *hangs up and leaves* and im like what the heck. also sticky bombs... sticky bombs",4
"i pre-ordered grand theft auto v back in 2013 for the xbox 360 and i pre-ordered it for the pc this year and i dont regret buying it. i played the console version of this game, and it was incredible, loved the storyline, the features, the online mode, everything, even though i hate playing on consoles. i played it few minutes after the game release, a long with my buddy i was the first few thousands to launch this game. i played the game, its incredible! go buy it, do it. exploring san andreas in 60 frames per second in high resolution feels wonderful. what, youre still reading? what are you doing here? go buy the game!",8
"i like it, not because of the game itself, but that it actually works unlike gta iv.",5
"i got in a car with a stranger and 2 hours later i was enjoying a friendly conversation at some guys house party. only in gta 5.",6
"have the game delayed numerous times to straighten out bugs only to not be able to play the game on day one because of numerous bugs.",4
"+ im surprised how well this game runs on very high settings, single player and multiplayer. (gtx 670 overclocked) + lots of graphic setting options. + new soundtrack + hasnt crashed once + day one multiplayer is working + first person view is great - flying controls are little weird (maybe because i havent played gta on pc before)",1
"i was so excited for this, like the hype was unreal, and it is good certainly, but unfortunately the game has so many issues right now that it severely hinders the experience. i have way over the suggested settings, and the game is supposedly perfectly optimized for my specs, but the game runs very very poorly, with unbearable lag spikes that make the game almost unplayable. it is ridiculous it took them this long and still both i and my friend with high end pcs can barely run it. rockstar, get it together, you more or less fixed the console versions and you better fix this.",3
"worth buying! amazing game! you do need a higher end computer to play this game.",2
"all these negative reviews are people complaining that they cant run the highest settings on their laptop or some  with social club. man it really doesnt take a genius to figure either of these things out. it runs fine on my computer. social club works fine. its a huge open world so i didnt expect to be able to handle the absolute highest settings but the game still looks phenomenal without them. and its the most fun ive in a gta game to this day. my only complaint is the first person fov but someones already made a mod for that.",9
"this is all i have to say: ps3 & xbox360 thanks for alpha testing. xbox one & ps4 thanks for beta testing. key: 60fps 1080p boobs",3
"i can not play the game, it keeps crashing everytime i launch it. whenever i do get in i crash whenever i load a mission or leave a lobby. :( i just want to play the game.",3
"i highly recommend this game as t is amazing and deserves every good rating ti gets. it has a vast amount of opportunities in online and a very captivating storyline. even the after game of the single player story mode is great.",2
"worth every cent of those cs skins ive sold for it! :)) i really really love this game, basically you can do anything, even going to the  ladys  :)) like in real life, you just need money! online is awesome also! i can play counter strike if i want ... or i can race and feel like playing nfs ! :) what else do you want from a game ? + a cool story line .... definetly would buy it again and again! 100/10 :d thanks rockstar! best game this year :)",4
"good game but they have to fix the police spawning when wanted level is high.",6
"its been a very long time since the pc got a game of this caliber. very refreshing!",4

"really good game give it 9/10 but ofcourse its a little buggy at the start like all big games are but its a beautifull and fun game.",3
"the game is the same from all consoles. but the 60fps is what you are looking for. still the mods will be great. i have a pretty good computer. but when im trying to get 60fps its pretty hard. - 780 gtx - i-7 processor - 12 gb ram im getting 60fps on the outside of the map but it dips down to 45fps in the city.",4

"i have waited it for a long time.i have to say how excited to play it. good",4
"still have issues after the patch. some parts of the world isnt loading but frame-rate is fine.",1
"best grand theft auto game! this game seems to me like a combination of san andreas and vice city on very detailed graphics.the world is immersive and the graphics are amazing.the optimization of the game is the best if you put in balance quality of image and frames per second that you have.i recommend it! good game!",3
"love this game since it was released on ps3 its like san andreas but more graphical",5
"with the last incarnation of gta on pc (gta 4) i was very dubious with this purchase, but it was a great purchase in the end, be it with a few les here and there. it might have took a few hours for the last chunk of the game to be installed with it being unpacked and installed but it is just as good as the max payne 3 port and runs smooth on my i5 3570k and amd 7950 3gb. the only time i experience noticeable fps drops is during high speed driving and im sure with a few graphical tweaks in game in regards to texture quality it will improve. all in all a good purchase.",5
"im sorry but this game is unplayable i have a geforce gtx 770 and the game crashes all the time for no reason. dont buy it guys.",4
"this game is one of the greatest games of all time, i mean as of right now you can see it has 19000 positive reviews, i have been playing the gta series since i was a kid, i owned gta 1, and had gta2 on dream cast, and to see it come from its early days from a unknown developer at the time called dma to becoming rockstar, and eventually rockstar north and being this beautifully crafted game is amazing to watch over the years of playing. the wait sucked for pc, but thank you rockstar for another beautiful, epic story line, built on a beautiful, breath taking environment. i fear death because i know once im gone, i wont be able to play these awesome epic games anymore. lol, how much i love gta, and a great improvement on port this time!!! standing applause!!!!",1
"pretty sick 9/10 the long waited gta 5 masterpiece. only one problem my card cant run this :/ get a gtx 770 4gigs or higher to run it.",1
"gta online has terrible consistancy errors and terribly  networking problems that cause both pvp and coop to be extremely unrealible, glitchy, and downright unfun to play due to the inconsistancy between damage to you, damage to enemies, vehicles materializing infront of you, or taking instantly teleporting 90 degree turns. the single player is ok, nothing spectacular, but the multiplayer, the one thing that rockstar should have learned how to do by now considering max payne 3s online was a complete ing joke, and gta 4s online was fairly ok and fun.",7
"the following is a personal preference read the following with a open mine or f*ck off i have played all versions of the game and the changes between xbox 360/ps3 graphics and xbox one/ps4 are massive to be honest it is a waste of money if you own a console copy. the graphical changes between current gen console gta and pc is next to nothing on top of that they have promised many additions on all platforms but it is still not here they promise additions many additions and hold back as proof of this look at the heist dlc it was delayed for a bit over 1 year even the pc version has taken blows like this it was meant to be released in late 2014 here we are in 2015 and it was still getting delayed unless rockstar lifts their game i think this game is in some ways the worst gta to be released if i had to rate it i must say as much as i am level headed between pc and console id say console is like a 8.5/10 and pc in its current state is like 3.5/10 my opinion may change with rockstars progress but i am unsure if this is going to change my opinion",2
"walk around with an ak-47 pulled out - not a problem. take selfies with random pedestrians? death sentence. my life is now complete.",2
"this is every simulator all in one. 9/11 would crash planes again!",7
"the game launched hours early in north america (props to that) the game looks just as good as the ps4 version on a medium end pc but still cranks that 60fps out with no trouble gta online worked, had no troubles connecting. no framerate drop joining a full server either. so far, id say this is a great iteration of the game. having played the last and next gen versions, this is clearly the winner.",2

"awesome game, a bit hard to find friends for heists, but not a problem. great game overall really fun.",8
"best game ever~ 10/10 friends kill me above 100 times.",5
"although this came out after nerly two years after the orignal release, this is hands down the best version of the game i have played. the settings are top notch, it has sli and crossfire support day one and is the best optimised game rockstar has ever relased. they say you can run this game 4k@30 fps with a 760. i play at 3440x1440 with a pair of 780ti in sli and this game runs at round 75+fps on ultra settings. only thing i have to turn down is aa. i highly reccomend this game to anyone who has played the earlier version and to those who havnt yet. 10/10",5
"do not buy this for single player. the gameplay is incredible (as we all know), but theres this glitch where i cant go past 24% (give or take) completion. ive looked up solutions for this and found forum posts from 2 years ago complaining about the same thing. rockstars fix is to start a new save file from the begining. i did this, and (after another 6 hours of replaying content) it still didnt work. single player is unplayable. youd think that around 2 billion dollars in revenue is enough to fix a glitch, but i guess not.",4

"edit: as of waking up on the 16th after a format, while gta v loaded all night, i managed to get it running, whether it was a update from rock star or blind luck. good luck guys. launcher has stopped working. have spent over 6 hours doing a lot of different things to try and fix it, even reinstalled over night. dont waste your money. wait for the game to go on sale and the bugs should be fixed by then. edit: ive managed to get the game to update by using rockstars installer program (you can find it on the social club page) but now it just simply doesnt load the launcher, or the game. with this in total ive put about 8 hours into trying to get the game running. if anyones wondering why theres only 0.5 hours its because ive only had to run the launcher for a minute at a time for it to crash, and as of writing this review ive been using the non-steam installer so its not keeping log. ill try to keep updates on anything that fixes the problem for me. any shitposts will be deleted.",2

"brilliant graphics, gameplay, storyline, and multiplayer. also incredibly well optimized for pc. there are a few issues with the game (namely stutters, buildings not rendering sometimes) but they dont seem to happen to everyone. and for the first version of the game its understandable. other than those issues, absolutely awesome game and enjoying it a lot! been doing multiplayer mostly, and its a lot of fun. cheers for another awesome game r*",4
"oh. my. god. why was this even on consoles? honestly if you thought the game was good on the 360 or ps4 youre gonna love this . holy hell, like r*, way to make me think your game is  for two and a half years before showing me the truth of this masterpiece.",2
"having bought this game twice before i can tell you that, content wise, this game is absolutely excellent. port-wise, its fantastic. its unreal that a game can be so dense and detailed and still run at a rock solid 60fps. bravo rockstar, this game is well worth the 155 pounds ive spent on it so far.",1
"10/10 whould watch 40 min. of unskipable credits again",5
"what makes rockstar think they are too cool to support dual graphic card switching? its 2015 and no laptop have dual graphic cards? which idiot in rockstar made this decision? we should launch a petition to fire that idiot! ive seen lot of players complaining about the crashing and received no reply at all. for me, the crashing is caused by the dual graphic card becasue i can open it using my integrated graphic card. as soon as i openned the dedicated one it died instantly!!! gg rs!!",1

"played it for a few hours on pc. i have to say i definitely prefer it on the pc over the console version, it seems to run much smoother, looks nicer, the controls are easy, driving is definitely a huge improvement compared to gta iv where that was just awful all together. rockstar definitely proved me wrong, after the amount of rage i went through on gta iv and how much of a crappy pc port it was along with all the buggy video editor errors, all of that seems to be fixed in gta v pc with a tidier video editor and less buggy overall. oh and no more gfwl! yes! well done, rockstar. definitely worth buying.",2

"after multiple attempts to get the game to launch, i have decided to accept valves offer of a refund. issues affecting this decision: 1. no direct contact with support to remedy issues 2. rockstar support requires social club membership for 30 days before being allowed to post an issue 3. multiple workarounds published, none have been successful 4. rockstar social club accepted the steam activation code, then claimed no games activated on the profile. no means of requesting support on this issue 5. multiple hours spent downloading, redownloading, and verifying local game files. no success. i understand launch day issues, but for a game that has been in the top seller category on steam for weeks now to have such an issue, with no official instructions on how to make the product work; well i wont gamble on the process getting better. disappointed.",1
"after launch and when it was done unpacking it was difficult to get started, but once i got it working i couldnt stop thinking, holy **** this is great. i would recommend to anyone with a decent desktop, even my budget pc can run at a smooth 30-40 fps.",5
"really enjoying it so far. the level of detail is amazing. espcially like the ai cats.",4
"after the patch which fixed the problem with multiple grafic cards it is a great game.",4
"gta 5 itself is a very fun game and the pc version makes it feel even better",5
"the single-player story is an exhilarating series of increasingly fun missions. and if you have the muscle to run it at max settings, the visual fidelity is astonishing. driving through the city at night in a storm, neon signs reflecting in the puddles and on the rain-slicked hood of your car, it almost looks photorealistic. and it all takes place in one of the richest, densest, most skillfully constructed game worlds ever built. the sense of place these details evoke is lightyears ahead of other open-world games. and the fact you can share it with other players makes it all the more exciting. gta online is a game in itself, mixing gtas sandbox chaos with elements of mmorpg. 10/10",6
"i heard that a game was here somewhere. i must of bought the loading screen edition instead... but i can confirm, got some hours of beautiful loading screen footage. by the way, why is this early access game not labeled as early access?",1
"too many bugs to be released, when you had us waiting for this long, you could at least make the god damn game ready, trying to get in to online and then i need to play the prolougue again because i changed some graphics settings... and i cant seem to find a way to skip it, i bought the game then let me fing play the god damn game, dont restrict me in anyway",3
"runs perfectly fine, smooth as  and i cant put my controller down! detailed review coming when ive had enough time with the game to be able to write one that does it justice.",2
"launcher crashes on startup; 26 hours of troubleshooting solves nothing. this really shouldve been solved in the 2 year delayed release. disappointed.",1

"great game. i cant believe how well it runs on my 2gb gtx 670. they did a fanstastic job with the pc version. well done.",3
"i was so pissed when r* released the game for console and we still didnt know if it was coming to pc, or when. i have waited so long to play this game. i told myself i wouldnt pay full price because they made us pc gamers wait so long, but i ended up doing just that and you know what? it is worth every penny. what i like about it! (1) the game actually has a fairly interesting story. i find myself not skipping the cut scenes for the most part. (2) being able to switch between characters is really cool. (3) fps!! first person mode is really cool. i like being able to switch when i want (4) graphics. wow! the game looks so pretty on my 5820k/gtx980 combo. (5) smooth. the game feels so smooth at release -unlike watchdogs which is still a buggy mess. (6) the game will still provide hours of entertainment even after you finish it. conclusion. it was worth the wait. but, with all of the money they have made, they better hire some more people so that gta vi gets released on all platforms at the same time, like every other normal company does.",4

"i have nothing to say about this perfect game. well optimized, great environment atmosphere. this game runs perfectly well on my gtx 880m. i dont really encounter launch issue so i dont know why thats even possible, and whats causing it. p.s.: dont be fooled by the review (by the time of the writing, its mostly positive [79%]). grab it when you have money, you wont regret it by paying the game for full price. if you encounter any issue, you can always ask the support guys whos much better than ea.",5
"great game. but ing sort out the ing bugs before ing bringing out. you ing delayed it long enough, havent had this much ing trouble with a game for a long time.",4
"i like the feature they added where the game doesnt launch",7
"just like all the others - this game is truely amazing. fully topless nudity lapdances (couldnt believe my eyes, as im playing right next to the g/f) to curb stomping crack heads- fully customisable characters & vehicles. gta online is freaking amazing as well. open world w/ 30 players all causing chaos and robbing stores. rockstar really got this one right!",2
"holy hell imagine mcdonalds. a fat persons staple. they talk only good things about it but when you try it you see all the junk and a waste of money. gta v is that hamburger.",4
"this is so frusterating, i cant play for more then 20 minutes without it crashing, wait for more patchs",1
"game is just incredible! story of the game is fantastic. you can spend money in proper ways. car tuning is just amazing. also im impressed with customizable weapons. after compliting story theres more missions to continue playing without getting bored. i recommend everyone, who doesnt own this game. you should buy this goreous game!!!",6
"2 hours play time, 1 hour 45 minutes of crashes, fighting with task manager and rebooting pc updated gforce drivers with the drivers specifically for gtav, not one iota of difference",5
"the best part about the game is unpacking the steam files...and oh,of course,its awesome,marvellous and everything in between",4
"alright i changed this,im all well for playing this now,thx",6
"game is fantastic and well-optimized; only issues stem from the community and the lack of a more solid group/party system for freemode and heists.",6
"if you only own a keyboard/mouse combo (or plan to only use one) gta is ready to frustate you. gta loves to throw you into the deep end without prep time, wether its driving, shooting, diving or flying. flying however is the worst, with default pc controls being an unworkable nightmare that also happens to be delivered while being shot at. from my current perspective flying in gta v is about -10 of fun and there is no excuse for it. it isnt just dedicated flying titles that do it better, like world of warplanes, but also so called rivals - where one presume rockstar paid at least cursory attention to - like the saints row entries 3 and 4. they all can boast better control schemes right out of the box and that makes the poor performance of gta on this front all the sadder. im now off to see if that gamepad i bought for emergencies is any better at not hitting the virtual ground but even it is - why the hell do i need to install an entirely new input mechanism when there a several aaa title that dont need it ? steering planes on a pc isnt some new and arcane art.",5
"played some in the early morning, school in the morning, decent game still fiddling with graphics, love it!",1
"so imagine gta v on 360/ps3 was like the meal youve waited for all your life that tasted a little raw, but it was a good meal, yknow? then, youve got the ps4/one version that is the same meal cooked ever so slightly better, yet youre still hungry. this version is like, the real deal. the main entre. the dish youve been truly hungry for your whole life. and it may have taken a little longer for it to be done but you craved it even more. in the end, this is the most delicious meal of your life. you get everything and more, especially for those who can crank up to 11 (4k resolution, baby) even if youve bought this game before and thought youve done it all, dont overlook this well optimized glorious experience that will make your return to los santos ever so sweeter.",3
"awesome game, had some problems, but my pc fault. =d",3
"according to the 2010 census china has a population of 1,339,724,852. apparently they all play gta online.",9
"when i launch the game, its says im playing then nothing happens and im suddenly not playing. no word from rockstar about a patch and none of the community fixes worked for me. i wouldnt purchase gta v until rockstar makes an official statement. although, from what ive seen on streams the game looks and runs great but the launch issues overshadow the good.",3
"waited 2 years for a game. gets on and gets shot by a policeman in the first mission. 10/10 would fail again. now proper review : runs amazingly even on my lowish end pc but it is a big step up from gta iv and no roman calls :d . the multiple characters is a boosting pro. but the driving is a bit too over controling, and helicopter controls are impossible. also, for such a popular and high standing company wouldnt you think rockstar would have singplayer cloud saves. as i recently upgraded my pc and my singleplayer is complelty gone. rating : 9.3/10",8
"nice game! but its really exhausting for your pc. you really need a good one. :)",2
"if only public enemy - harder than you think was on the radio constantly then it would 10 be 10/10 but instead im gonna give it a 9/10",2
"last time i played gta 5 it was on the the playstation 3 and was no were neer as good as the pc version. 24 hours of play time id say its a darn good game. a few graphical bugs but nothing big thats all",6
"this game ruined my life. after traveling far across the city of los santos in search of a car that would help me appear more appealing to the ladies, i found a truffade adder sitting on the side of the road and took it as my own. i then proceeded to flaunt my newly found ride in and around the pier. soon enough a young blonde woman (who i can only presume loved me for my car) called me over to her and offered to make my night. i believed that we were going to go out bonding at a coffee shop and talk about our feelings, but before i knew it she was  my . little did i know i had been led under the influence of the earthly equivalent of a siren, known by many as a street hooker. i now have an irrational fear of fish nets, red heels, and anything pertaining to leopard print. i miss the fishing trips with my family. i miss being able to take my son to the exotic plains of africa on a leopard hunting expedition. my life is over. i can not go on living in this way. i do not want to go on living in this way. every day i wake up wishing i hadnt. someone please put me out of this hell. i will do anything. please... 11/10",5
"the game overall is good but my game stutters like crazy. the 1.01 patch was supposed to fix this, but only made it worse and entirely unplayable as of 4/20/2015. this is unacceptable from rockstar since alot of people have been having this issue. there is no fix for the stuttering as of yet. gtav uses alot of cpu and ram for some reason. rockstar support hasnt responded when i put my problem in on the 15th of april. this issue isnt due to my system due to the fact that i get more than 70fps when i dont stutter. ive tried running at the lowest setting, but it changes nothing. rockstar needs to fix the bugs that this game causes for people, it is just unaccpetable.",6
"after a long wait, us pc masterrace folk have finally recieved gta v. not only is this a huge screw you to the console players, but this is a great step for us all. long live the pc masterrace. in all seriousness gta v for the pc is great. its alot more than just a port, it plays perfectly for me and exceedes my expectations. the graphic options make the game really come that much more to life, it plays and looks amazing. if you were on the fence of this being a good port or not like i was, trust me. its a good port. see you in los santos!",3
"even though i have played and enjoyed this game on the ps3, there is no way i can currently recommend it on pc. the game simply does not launch, and there has been no official word from rockstar about a fix for it. hopefully i can change my review in the future, but right now id avoid buying it and wait for a few patches. _________________________________ update 15/04/2015 after finally finding a fix thanks to the steam community (i had to uninstall my antivirus), i can finally recommend this game! looks incredible, runs smoothly, and plays like a dream. 10/10 would preload, rage about it not working, then find a fix again.",8
"this is so far the best game for crashing and not working properly. funny enough i get 60 fps but stll crashes.",1

"i played this game on ps3, and ps4 both were good, but nothing compared to this!",3
"clearly lots of fun for most but there it uses over 1.8ghz when launching, leading to many a crash for some, and and annoyance for others. other than that though, good game. please can we get a fix for the high cpu usage when launching.",1

"in general its a good game but if you are playing online there are small bugs which are annoying and enough to warrant not purchasing this until it ends up on steam summer sale, by this time the tutorial bug and other issues should be fixed. sp is great",5
"absolutely amazing, the graphics are beautiful too, thank f*@# for lens flare xd",3
"i cant login it says this steam account is linked to a different ocial account use that one instead i dont know which social account it is can i get help?",1

"2 hour long, unskippable multiplayer tutorial and impossible flying controls made a really bad first impression. also, controller users have a horribly unfair advantage against keyboard users when it comes to racing. waited 5 months longer than i wanted to to get disapointment. *edit: looks like the fanboys are disliking. oh well, i have a right to an opinion",2
"you have been waiting for 19 months? well, here the good new, youll have to wait only few more months to get this games bugs are fixed.",3
"played 16 hours of it in the first day it came out. so yeah, i recommend it.",6
"apparently a $500 hp desktop isnt good enough for it so better go buy a $1000 computer just to run it without 10 fps...",2
"absolutely amazing! easily the best title in my steam library. though it would be perfect if rockstar fixed the launcher issue for mobile gpus and add an in-game display scaling / downsampling option for those with integrated intel gpu - as of current the scaling doesnt work properly on native resolution.",3

"if you get this to work, its a really good port. if you have money... buy this",8
"first it wont launch into the launcher. so i disable my nvidia video card (!) and it does. then the game crashes on the first screen. i assume thats the menu screen. i play many alpha/early launch games that cost a fraction of this, and rarely have issues. i think there should be a big disclaimer before puchasing that says, game in pre-alpha",2
"good bits about it: very flexible game and brings me back to the times i played vice city. challenging helicopter controls but takes time to get used to. downloaded the game in hopes to enjoy the pc exclusive features, the consoles lacked (ill still trade the x360 for x1 version though to keep up with my friends.) 100% criminal fun garaunteed. 100% hd crime. 0% of life that survives in your murdering sprees, including your internet.",1

"this is officially the platform that gta vs gameplay was meant for. i was enjoying this game for the time that i played it, and i was enjoying it quite a damn lot. you see, i had this $65 knife from cs:go. what happened to this knife you ask? i traded it. for this game in particular. i found a guy, he seemed quite nice, but to avoid a scam for the trade, i had him send me the game first. he sent it. i then sent him the knife. happily ever after right? wrong. a few days after owning the game (pre-ordered copy), gta v is removed from my account due to purchasing issues. glitch in the steam matrix? nope. the guy who sent me the game apparently bought the game via paypal and after a while of use, he then recalled/refunded the purchase of the game making me lose $65 in the process. gotta love spending $65 for 2 days of the best gameplay of your life. all in all, buy this game, please dont get scammed like i did... dont get scammed out of a $65 knife. get gta (t)v",1

"its a good game but without steam workshop and stability issues i dont think i can bring myself to buy this since i already own it for the 360. thats not to even touch on launch day issues which is totally inexcusable for a game that came out in 2013 and has been waiting this long for a pc release that has been promised for so long.",1

"dont rely on rockstar support to ever give you any assistance with this game. due to a stupid design feature you have to log into a rockstar social club account in order to play the game even if you do not want to use any of the on-line features. by their own admission a number of these accounts have been compromised (or in plain english hacked) mine being one of them. as this rockstar account is linked to my steam account i am now unable to play a game which has cost me nearly 40 uk pounds. rockstar supports answer to my logged requests for assistance ? absolutley nothing. thank you so very much rockstar.",3
"this game is a fantastic pc port. i have heard of issues but i have only encountered one bug that was very minor. definitely worth the wait.",3
"gta 5 is an amazing game we should all know this.but the real question is if its a good port(its not realy a port but still)the answer is yes aside from a few bugs i have ran in to like the humorous line glitch for characters online to frustrating glitch were i freeze durring heists but all my concerns can be patched out so i would recommend :)",3
"game is broken. the amount of bugs and manual fixes required to play 15 mins just to have it crash when system specs are 16gb ram, 750 hdd and 250 ssd with a nvidia 780 are just dumb... expected better after waiting 1.5 years for a game to come out on this platform.",8
"it is just the best game i have ever played in my entired life! very well made! if the first person mode had the rear view mirrors with quality view at least for the driver i would call it 100%",3
"gta v and there bugs! i downloaded cracked version much more faster!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",3
"the long awaited wait is finally over.... i just want to say, as a decades old gta fan, ive own every game leading to this. however, due to life changes, i have been forced to limit my expenditure into upgrading my gaming laptop, 2012 republic of gamers g74sx. prior to buying gta v, i was almost hesitant to withdraw and focus myself elsewhere....but im glad i didnt. this game runs flawlessly at 50-60fps on a 2012 rig. so if you are worried about graphical complications, look no further. rockstars optimization is surely a hundreds times better than their attempt at gta iv for pc.",4
"would be great if it would ing work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2
"finally gta v on pc after a long time. good job rockstar games.",9
"this is a half thumbs up, for now. online is buggy for me. idk how fast things will be updated or even patched. otherwise fun, its gta. gameplay isnt to bad, wait till the price drops wont be long. dont see people playing this non stop, loose your freakin mind!",5
"i recommend dis game its fun :] unless u have a crap computer :]",2
"1080p 60 fps gta. sexy [; boobs in 1080p ultra, mmmm.",5
"after waiting many months for this game..... then wait an addition 4 days to play (cause a loading error with social club), i can finally play the game and be as destructive as possible... also i was glad i was able to transfer my ps3 characters and maintain my previous progress (big plus)",8
"gta vs attention to detail and closeness to reality is extremely dizzying, not to mention the awesome graphics. i always end up just driving around los santos for hours.",3
"ps3 & xbox360 thanks for alpha testing. xbox one & ps4 thanks for beta testing.",5
"this game will make you want to spend all your money upgrading your computer, 10/10 .",7
"give over a year to port this to pc, and did a horrible job. brought bugs and crashes, wait for a update that fixes it then buy",4
"i have played this since it came out on first gen, this is by far the best one!!!",10
"rockstar weres all the s i searched every place for them so ican get my online character laid for the first time in pc in ps4 i got to the hood s everywere pc none to be found plz fiz this other than that 10/10",3
"so ive had a good chance to play the game now. and i am really impressed on how its turned out. graphically, its insane. its really really stunning. driving along the coast at sunset with your own music on the radio. cant complain really. i think it has been worth the wait. glad its here. will be totting up some more hours of online fun. cant wait to see any new additions to the game, such as mods and any new content. for me, it scores a grand 9/10 with every game ever released. theres always room for a little more! :)",10
"moves like jagger came up on the radio and i became insane after killing everyone on the server to the rhytm of moves like jagger 10moves/10jagggers would listen to the radio again",3
"online game is more waiting of loading than playing...",6
"check out my video for a potential fix! it worked for me and may work for you.",2
"60 hrs into gta v and all i can say is  yeah!!!! this game is game of the year 2015 hands down, graphics are sweet, it runs smooth, a few minor bugs at launch but nothing gamebreaking perhaps the smoothest launch of any aaa game i have ever played.. huge thumbs up.. thanks r*.",10
"somehow runs perfectly on ultra on my pos cpu. well played rockstar. i originally bought this on 360 and again on pc.",3
"this review for gta v for pc has been delayed for release until may 28th. i apologize for the inconvience",5
"it is very good version of very good game. 60 fps and some minor graphic enhancements really make game feel more polished and enjoyable. first mission in 60fps:",2
"gta v is absolutely awsome, and covers all my expectation of the game. the game runs smoothly, the setting is beautiful, and has easy controls.",2
"really well optimized, compared to gta iv, the graphics are amazing, even in the lowest settings, the shadows are unbeliavable, tottaly soft and without pixels. the only bad thing is the lot of problems that came on the launch day. lots of people trying to download, install, open, but without success. i had to deactivate my nvidia gt 630m and use the intel hd graphics 4000 to launch the game, then activate the offboard gpu to run it, because the launcher crashes at every try. worth the money and the wait, but me and tons of people are still waiting for those compatibility fixes. 8/10",3
"was worried about performance after gta iv on pc, obviously not an issue. automatically optimizes graphics settings for your system. i havent even bothered to do a benchmark or change any settings because it was so beautiful and smooth straight out of the box.",3
"i like what i have seen so far. but even after the new update the game is still crashing saying low memory.",1
"been waiting for this game since 2013. and all i could say is it was worth the wait. ;)",4
"i now own three copies of this game... let that sink in... now go buy at least one, if it isnt worth your money i will personally refund you",2
"wont let me log in keeps saying this acount has been locked is there a cool down time for this? its been about a hour.",1
"a ing boring game.go  yourselves all rockstar staff.a game worth not even a cent.total discrimination against laptops. r",1
"they took all the critic they got from gta 4 and made a perfect game that runs smooth even on older pc.",7
"really worth my cash. the port is totally good, much better than gtaiv. graphics are awesome, everything is awesome on this game. just get this game already! after all the delays, rockstar regained my happiness!",6
"if you take the time to understand the menus/hotkeys/interface, this game is an absolute blast with friends. just make sure to be patient and level to rank 12. thats when the game really takes off.",3
"my system specs are well above the base-line. however, my experience running the game has been less than satisfactory. after running the game for about an hour my pc blue screens (i have not experienced this with any other software) and shuts down. the game sometimes opens in windowed mode for some reason - it should automatically open full-screen or give me an obvious option to do so. the game is fun when it works.",1
"stomped on cat, got shot to death by police. 11/10 would stomp cat again.",6
"4 hours in and im absolutely enjoing it. i did however have some problems right at the beginning and i believe it was from the drivers, reason being was that i removed the beta driver made by amd for gta v optimisation and now i haent crashed since. i still get a few lag spikes where my framerate will drop to around a quarter however it is still manageable.",4
"*me shopping in the clothes store online* *random spanish guy talking on mic* *other random guy on mic* - shut the  up you ing spic. *me laughing for about 5 minutes straight like an idiot.* god, i ing love this game.",7
"gta 5 as an exercise in world building and story is amazing, the world feels alive, deep and most importantly fun. the 3 main characters are varied enough to keep things from becoming stale, and being able to specialize them, through semi rpg elements and purchases is a nice touch. as far as gameplay related bugs go i encountered just one in 12 hours (unable to progress through mission). however the game makes us of often auto saves and allows quick saving so this was not a massive issue due to being able to load previous save. in terms of a the quality of the pc port i have several woes, firstly installing on a samsung ssd caused memory issues and made the game unplayable, secondly crossfire scaling is not as good as i hoped. despite this a great set of graphical options offered allowing intricate customization. overall very happy with the game",3
"this game has the dankest of memes, and rustles my jimmies. you should buy it if you like your jimmies rustled, enjoy the dankest of memes, or if you enjoy an awesome story. do it now or live in regret your entire life, laying on your death bed you will have wished you bought this game to become the dankest of memers and had your jimmies rustled so hard. youll turn into a dust ball of regret. so buy it.",2
"multiplayer doesnt work, you might aswell rename this to grand theft loading, i think i spent more time on loading screens than the actual game because the online servers just dont work",3
"my laptop has 3840*2160 resolution. but i cant seem to be able to run the game in that resolution. and the game screen occupy only a portion of the screen. and the game crash if i change the resolution to 3840. please somebody help me. i cant even run the game in fullscreen mode! my gameplay experience had been disappointing because of this.",2
"after more than two yrs rockstar finally figures out how to press w to move forward.",5
"im unable to review the game since im stuck on a loading screen after the prologue. after walking through a door (20 seconds into the game) the screen goes black and nothing happens. very disappointed with this release.",3
"so i spent $60 and 6 hours to troubleshooting. all i got is the rockstar update service is unavailable (code 2) and dispointed.",6
"you can steal bikes as a black dude 5/5 recommended",4

"this port is great !!!!! i played it with gtx650ti all high and got 3-170 fps all the girls in strip club is suck keep talking about your master race thou",3
"worth the wait. experienced zero glitches, and fluid gameplay. i5-3570k, gtx770 4gb. high to very high on all settings, excepts aa.",6
"horrible launch. with millions in sales and prelaunch revenue this game should be polished and glitch free. i will never pre order a rockstar game ever again. game constantly crashes during game play at random intervals. gta v is not responding to gta v has stopped responding my specs: amd 8350 crosshair v formula z crossfirex 2x280x 16gb corsair platinum",3
"i didnt wait through three delays and pay 60 dollars to have the game crash on me.",3
"i love this game on xbox 360 but on pc right now i have a $2,000 pc overclocked and has a amd turbo card amd 8 gb of ram and a intel(r) core(tm) i7-4770k cup and i cant go any where near the city so i hope gta v reads this because you need to fix performance (yes i know there going to be problems because it just came out) but at the end it fun to play",2
"game is unplayable until rockstar patches it. save your money until then.",1
"very good game but i can not recommend it because the game crashes while playing the mission blitz play so you can not complete the game.",5
"best drink-a-shot-every-time-any-character-says-er game, ever.",4
"12 out of 10 i just lost all my free time points! one extra point for being awesome with the oculus rift, even though it doesnt support it on its own! (vorpx takes care of that) wanna see what that looks like? watch this:",3
"i can see the delays were well worth it. the game runs smoothly on max settings and is well optimised. this is a port well done, my money was well spent.",9
"it works well. it looks well. it plays well. would reccomend.",3
"really like it but i have a few problems - the amount of time it takes to download is way to much and its a bum : the social club screen crashes for me alot and i almost cant play but i really enjoy it its epic, chaotic and i play it in 4k ultra settings and it looks a-m-a-z-i-n-g!!! if you should buy it - yes :d buy it now - no, wait for the server loads to decrease and then wait for a sale ill rate it 9.5/10 because of the a bit anoying launch : enjoy the game :d",1
"i have played few hours in single player and multiplayer about now. this is one of the best games i have played so far and definitely it is the best game for rockstar and the best of the gta series. first person mode is so awesome, that i have played it 99% of the time. just love this game. of course there ar some glitches in multiplayer mode, but i think they will be fixed soon. buy it, you wont regret it!",8
"social club....what more can you say. no support to fix it and its a game that simply wont run. a broken game is what you will recieve. no way to improve the issue currently even after following their support website.",1
"fan-fn-tastic! beautiful game. hopped on a waverunner. took me right back to a summer at virginia beach. you will get lost in this city literally and figuratively. wtg rockstar!",8
"my desktop broke down a week before this game came out sent it in for repairs, though not coming back anytime soon. tried running it on my laptop and 10 frames a second. gg. see ya in like a month gta v",1
"its gta, what do you want to know? better, bigger, prettier...love every part of it, even its quirks...",3
"i accidentally put $80,000 spin rims on the first car i got. it was a minivan. 10/10",5
"my pc is so good but i dont know why do i have lags i think it is bbecause i have some problems with dropped fps but i dont know why... :((( what can i do ? please help me!",3
"at first i was kinnda scared to buy this game, but after i bought it i felt like this game is really worth buying. it is simply amazing and really fun to play, so just go and see for yourselves.",6
"everything runs fine, high / very high settings, 4x msaa 1080p@50/60fps with occasional drops below on an almost three years old gtx680 with 4gb gddr5. i had one crash so far, but nobodies perfect and the game saves constantly.",7
"its doesnt even ing work i just get this error in the social club social club failed to load due to an incomplete installation. please exit the game and re-install the latest version of the social club. then they give me a link and i did all the stuff the link said and it still doesnt ing work!!!!!!! error 37 : rockstar version!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"this is amazingly optimized, and beautiful beyond anything ive seen in an open world game, ever. the hype is real: get this now.",7
"more than a game. a lifestyle. haters gonna hate. woot!",10
"ive waited 4 yrs 4k pc 60fps worth it online is amazing just most perfect game wish i could win the pc their giving away help me a lot.",1
"the worst for trying to log in. the game wants a social account log in then it wants the account to be linked to another account (windows, facebook, psn etc.). then after you get it figured out it tells you that the game cannot be accessed. on top of it all you need to do this to play offline. no playing any of it if you are not logged in. honestly rockstar it shouldnt be this difficult. the people that suffer are the ones that pay for your games and the ones that want to pirate it will figure out a work around. they just will, they are smarter than you because theres more of them. please stop penalyzing your paying customers.",1
"the game is fun as well as the controls being easy to learn also im suprised my 15 inch retina (nivida 750m) could run the games in 1080p 60fps in ultra... very pleased",4
"i would lick peanut butter off a homeless persons toe to play this game for an hour.",3
"no cousin roman 11/10 would not go bowling with that @#%%&$^*$^*#$^@#!#$!!! cousin again",9
"the game is broken on launch. i guess testing wasnt in the budget. very common, above average setup here. at first the game quit after a few minutes. the first transition cutscene then failed. i then installed nvidias update specifically for the game. started it back up made it to the second cut scene transition before it died again. kind of sad that this is the product we get after waiting so long.",3
"i buy and i dont have the money bonus on the game like yours prumse..!!",4
"the graphics are amazing, the game play is amazing but the only problem is... grand theft loading v!",2
"10/10 would karate chop pedestrians to death again.",5
"worst service ever..pre-ordered 2 weeks early..still locked out of social club..never even got to play the game..never trust anything on steam..they deliberatly sell and promote games that they either know are full of cheaters or dont even work at all..total scam site..been using it for years and they are always stealing from people..i could tell you stories of their theivery that would curl your toes..buy nothing from steam",6
"i had more armour than ned starks plot, yet i still get killed and betrayed by friends. turns out one does not simply walk into los santos. 8/8 fantastically optimised pc game. thats all you need to know.",5
"the game runs at 40 fps and microstutters all the time, even though i meet the recommended specs. pathetic port. ridiculous optimization. after 19 months of wait, that is the unfinished piece of garbage rockstar dares to give us.",3
"this game is fun but it runs like crap never once have i hit 60 frams andi have over the recomended settings. its more buggy then watch dogs and multiplayer i cant move it lags so much dont buy this unlell its 2200 and there are super computers.,",9
"grand theft auto are one of my favourite game series. gta v is the best gta game after san andreas, which i loved due to it being my childhood game and being the game to bring new things that year and with a huge map and possibilities. i have played this game both on xbox360 and pc. its amazing. the storyline is amazing, the graphics are great, the pc port is awesome (works smoother than on x360), comparing to gta ivs port (which was  on pc, very bad performance issues). the online is great, as long as you dont play to grind it, and have some friends to play it. anyways, the pc version > console is that theres some new features, and the files were already opened and modding should be available soon, thus we will see some good mods with no doubt. truly a game of the year, for 2015 too.",5
"if you planned playing gta5 with keyboard and mouse...no way. mouse handles like , you can mess with the options in the keyboard/mouse settings men, however it wont work- if you dont have a controller the game is unplayable or as best annoying as - rockstar should have known better. hopefully a future patch will level this out. nontheless- best gta-story ever- the mousething is a shame though",7
"overall this is a great game with some flaws. they should have allowed you turn down your graphics further for with my really bad computer, it lags on the lowest of settings. there are still some graphical errors which are probably because of my low end pc. i would give it an 8/10. i would take two points away because of the general flaws in the gameplay and graphical errors.",1
"best game crash simulator 2015. in all seriousness, i loved this game on console when it first came out and ive been waiting for its release on pc as long as anyone else. after playing a little bit of the game however, seeing its amazing graphics, it crashed, and now all it does it crash on startup. i know its not my computer, because no matter what settings i put it on it has the same problem. youd think since they made us wait so long that it would work on release. guess this is what we should all expect for 2015. ill change this once they fix it, which im sure they will. but when 25% of people whove bought the game cant play it, thats pretty sad :/",3
"as of the most recent patch, the game works very smoothly and i havent had a problem since. i can now safely recommend this as possibly the best grand theft auto in the series, as well as one of the better games ever made. after a rocky launch, i highly recommend buying it now that the ship is sailing more smoothly.",3
"gta v on pc is what we have all been waiting for, its here and rockstar has shown that they have learned from their mistakes with gta iv. this game is well made/well optimized and i havent seen one single bug yet, props to you rockstar! youve done it! 10/10",8
"pros: - no roman cons: - lamar 10/10 would sell cs:go skins again!",10
"runs really well and has a good story is a great game all in all.",4
"i remember that i accidently dropped my xbox 360 with the gta v disc in it. the disc broke and i couldnt play anymore. so i waited for pc. when i finnaly knew that it will came to april the 14th i was so excited. just the hype from the xbox 360 release. i really like this game, the graphics are amazing. it couldnt be better. i will continue to play this game and continue to enjoy it.",4
"roads dissapearing, game temp freezing... well i dont have a good gaming pc. if youre reading this and question your pcs capabilities, i advise you to immediately forget about buying this game (unless youre sure you can run this) have a good day, enjoy reading the other reviews.",1
"this game is insanly fun to play, especially the online!",4
"got so many problems (infinite loading/ no response when clicking the launcher button) after hours of downloading and i couldnt even start the game now. the game has been delayed for so long and rockstar cant even fix these small issues. good job rockstar.",1
"this is a great game,and it feels like the first game rockstar really tried to finish (on pc) those who say random crash and more probably fixed their issue but didnt changed their reviews. but be aware this game could crash on launching then what? you still can get a refund of some sort! the game was broken at the launch (but benchmarks and multiplayer) but thats normal for multi. the first big path is already out,with oculust rift support! why do i even write thise review, ima play gta now",5
"you rockstar. fix the damn game so us gamers with laptops can play. once again,  you you lazy s.",1
"do not buy this game. unfinished crashes and over 14 min loading i have a gtx 760 and a i7 and the best internett conection on the market and still it takes so long to join. most players you meat are fagot  and they suck in heists",6
"worst online gaming experince i have ever had, does not work, its slow the loading screens are un godly and the player base are full of trolls and s, the single player i got stuck as franklin not able to do anything, and that was my breaking point. gta5 is a waste of money do not buy it, stick to your other games",10
"pre-loaded, was surprised i could play it a day early!!! started right up with zero problems!!! i guess i am just lucky! about to call in to work for the next 3 days...due to...being...sick... lmao gameplay.. the initial driving in fp takes a bit getting used to. especially with the crappy car they give you in the tutorial mission. the car is terrible to drive! but the other cars past that are a lot easier. fp owning civies and cops...is like..wow... stabbed a guy on the tallest mountian while he was looking over the edge...he screamed...eyes closed..and fell over the edge and lost most of his gear on the way down as he bounced around... um...i actually feel bad stabbing people with the knife in fp lol. but ...not thatttttttt bad lol.",2
"dont buy this yet until it goes on sale, and or until rockstar makes a patch to fix the launching issues. edit: changing my opinion since rockstar put out a patch and now i can get in.",4
"am not happy with game.it aint playing for the past 2weeks",1
"every time i opt out of the game to my other screen i cannot go back to gta, all i can hear is the sound but cannot re-open the window, have to restart the game. frequent crashes during heists and while online. game does not save even checking and double checking that the game says it saved before exiting. rock star needs to fix their peice of  game before releasing.",2
"absolutely incredible. this is what pc gaming is all about, pretty much the ultimate sandbox game... with explosions... and hookers >_> is there blackjack in this game?",2
"very fun game ..... i am pretty sure you knew that tho !",3
"its gta alrite, i would do pros and cons, but we all already know them all. great series, another great game. +fk you thinking i cant write a review right after release",4
"game runs extremely well on fully maxed out graphics. im also using fairly outdated equipment. ive probably spent a good 4-5 hours alone running over peoples cats.",3
"the game optimized well - at least for amd/ati hw. no bugs, no crashes, rock solid gameplay, good framerate (especially after the first patch), i playing on a four years old radeon hd 6900 series card in fullhd without msaa and the framerate is above 40. well done rockstar! worth of waiting!",4
"after the update, the launcher still does not work. now all im wondering is how to get my refund for a working game, other than something thats wasting space on my computer.",3
"i dont know what to say, because this is exactly what i wanted. ive happily clocked over 300hrs of gta v on console, and im happy to clock at least double that time on pc. everything about the pc version of gta v is a straight upgrade from any of the console versions. if you like grand theft auto games, this is a must have. edit: good god why did rockstar decide to release this game in the midst of final exams?",4
"10/10 i played this game on x360, was already amazing. now on pc its so much more amazing :o super graphics! gameplay is awesome, i like the missions, lots of variation. heists are nice with the set up and choosing how to do it. online is very fun to play, killing each other or bullying people :3 heists and other missions/races are cool too!",3
"its the best grand theft auto yet, that should be all you need to know. scales well on anything from a toaster to a high end machine.",5
"got 7 hours in, and already know im going to play for much, much longer! this game lives up to the hype for this pc version esp. if you went in cold like i did. perchasing this game is the best $60 dollars ive spent in a while.....other then the internet bill :....",8
"everyting has now changed since i last wrote this review amd have came out with a driver (15.4 beta) i would suggest downloading it if you have amd gpu or cpu it helps alot with your fps i went from 18 fps in the main city to now having a sold 60 fps. (i still wont recommend amd tho) everything else with the game is just great! apart from the fact they have have made modding very hard which sucks. over all i would recommend this game to anyone or everyone!",3
"how do i get the refund?  doesnt work, ive tried all the guides.",1
"where did the steam sales get me? they got me right ing here! the end of the road. with a big library, and a useless ps3. and im stuck playing you because no one else gives a . oh im playing the game baby, and that game is ed, ing ed",7
"amazing game, amazing work from rockstar as always, great optimization, i play on high settings with 60fps on i5, gtx660, 10gb ram... pc master race! :)",6
"walked outside of house and was swiftly murdered by a fat man in short shorts. 10/10 would recommend",3
"i give this game a proper review when i can. for now, youll just have to trust me.",4
"this isnt bushweed. this... is mana. i growth it myself. no paranoia, no weirdness. a passport to nirvana. f**k it. gimme that yeah, youll hardly feel it. i smoke all day and im fine. some pure mellowhype. but i do get concerned about the monsters, yeah.",8
"you need this game in your life. gta is love. gta is life.",5
"man id love to be able to play this game, but, it seems like aaa game devs cant put out a title for the pc without it being ed for nearly a month. i, like a lot of other people have been dealing with crashing, constantly. hell, i have only been able to play this game for 5 minutes before it crashed and blue screened my computer. if you are looking to buy this game now, dont, wait at least two months and allow it to be patched then get it.",1
"after playing it a bit more and trying some of the heists its really not all that fun. drive here, kill a few guys. drive back. drive here, grab something, drive back. kill a bunch of guys, drive back. may as well call it grand theft auto: drivin simulator cause thats all there is in this game. it bored the  out of me between the loading times and the lack luster amount of variety in missions. do not buy this unless it is on sale, otherwise you are just wasting money and hdd space.",2
"i havent got into grand theft auto since san andreas. this one is far superior to all the others, more activities, a huge map and vast story. the characters are very interesting as well as humorous. my only complaint about the game was/is getting used to the aiming.",5
"great game, spent 2 days downloading and redownloading from bugs then when theres no bugs it doesnt load. 10/10",2
"loved this game on ps3, its 100x better on pc. 11/10",5
"i think its a great port of the console versions and it could only get better from here",3
"guy was taking a shower and singing for getting rp, people joined him. 10/10, would sing enjoy the silence again.",6
"bye every other game in my library, see you next year!",6
"pc version runs flawlessly, looks amazing. cant complain.",8
"as a person who has never played gta before. this is all i could ask for. the controls are great and easy to get used to. so many ways to customize your character from clothing to tatoos to facepaint. you can play alone or with friends online for more fun and points. my only complaint is that there is only one location to play on. even so this is the golf game pc gamers have been waiting for and deserve. hole in one/10",9
"words dont do this game justice, its how gta v should be played. pc or nothing. watch my video which showcases all of the extra effects/gamemodes/challenges the pc version has.",9
"i got gta5 for ps3 and now for pc as well. i say it worth it. the graphics are much better and aiming with a mouse is like a dream coming true. by the way dont forget the mods that should be coming for pc.",5
"its a good game if you can actoly get in to it i spent 30minets tring to get the game to work and lornch",1
"its a great game but rockstar please fix the grass texture gta san andreas has a better grass texture :p",2
"we built this city, we built this city on rock and roll say you dont know me, or recognize my face say you dont care who goes to that kind of place knee deep in the hoopla, sinking in your fight too many runaways eating up the night we built this city on rock n roll - jefferson starship",6

"this game is freaking awesome. i have it totally maxed out at 1920 x1080, at a steady 60. it has absolutely breathtaking visuals. it has been very friendly so far with crossfire 7970 lightnings. no issues at all. no flickering or other sli/crossfire common issues. it fired right up and worked great! i played about 10 minutes and was amazed, all the time after that was even better. first person view is so awesome. so much easier to drive. when i got to my safe house, moms house i am guessing, first thing i did was sit on the couch to watch the hilarious tv shows rockstar always puts on, my guy smoked a huge dank  jay, and started talking to himself. then i went to the gunshop and purchased a .45 automatic and a cqc submachine gun, there are a ton of mods, such as sound suppressors, optics, and all things that are good. next on my list is to bang some hookers and then get my money back with my .45 automatic. this game is sweet. 10/10 all around. graphics 10/10 gameplay 10/10 weed dankness 10/10 controls 10/10 (a lot to remember.) guns 10/10 physics 10/10",4

"game is just stunning, a masterpiece, just gonna keep playing the shetz out of it. well, i fixed my game at first, it was stuck on social club loading after logged successfuly. maybe thats cuz my system name has a symbol -> . ... heres how i did it: if your username contains non-english or normal characters, then first create an empty folder wherever you want (for example: c:newfolder). then, right click on your c:usersusernamedocuments folder, select properties, and change its location to the new folder that you just created. the computer will then ask if you want to move all the files, say yes. after that, try running the game and it should work. update: now that a patch was released and a new social club, i can play just fine with everything back to normal.",6
"i was a bit scared of purchasing the game after some of the reviews, but after watching some gameplay i knew i had to get it whether it worked or not. i run a single gtx 980 and the game runs smoothly at a constant 60fps on very high and ultra settings. there are occasionally fps drops here and there, but nothing that would affect gameplay. i had two instances where the game crashed, but it was on two different parts instead of the game freezing over and over again on the same part. all in all this game has been a blast so far and the graphics are amazing. havent really tested the online yet, but will soon! but so far i am really enjoying the single player story. i am sure that patches and updates will be released to address all of the crashing issues so grab this game either now or in the future. because once you get the game going you will not regret a thing. specs cpu: intel core i7 5820k ram: g.skill 32gb ddr4 os: windows 8.1 graphics: nvidia geforce gtx 980 storage: 1 tb ssd mouse: logitech g502 proteus core keyboard: corsair k65 rgb w/ cherry keys headphones: turtle beach earforce px22",2

"ive seen some horible launches, but this takes the cake. im actually impressed how well this crashes my system. trying to exit the game crashes computer, but forcing it to quit through task manager just asks me if i want to retry playing the game in safe mode. online character creation is, well, broken too. occasionally, the game will let me into what i think might be the main menu, but that dosent always work itself out. i dunno. overall, im really dissapointed. i wasnt expecting the game to be good at launch, but i simply wasnt prepared for this disaster. i really hope this gets fixed soon. for refrence, my computer has a x4 750k, and an xfx r9 290. edit: occasionally, i was able to actually boot into the game, however i was not able to load anything beyond the minimum settings in dx10, and it averaged 45 fps. with the new update, it refuses to load correctly, constantly jumping the landing page and always attempting to load into story mode. this just makes me sad. edit 2(4/19/2015): game now runs, but the framerate is sub-60 fps, all settings on normal at dx10.",5

(it sounds awesome right? no) theworst part is the game crashes so ing much it punishes you by giving you bad rep... so pray you dont crash to desktop as 90% of players are doing online else youll have to play with the s and shall be branded an .. rockstar i dont appreciate being punished (and having my name i use in other games tarnished) from your own mistakes... fixthis  asap! buy this for simgle player only! i cannot recommend it right now but will be absolutely willing to reassess after a few more months.. and if you do buy it dont use your name from other games you  ;)",3

"its with a heavy heart i have to give gta v a bad review - for now. i, like many other laptop users with mobile graphics cards, are experiencing crashing issues nonstop that has completely ruined the experience. story mode, i get a crash roughly every 5-10 loading screens, online (the main reason i bought the game), i get a crash every loading screen so i havent gotten to play it yet at all. i also randomly get crashes on startup. its really a bummer. im a poor college kid so when i spend 60 on a game its a huge deal to me. its a bigger deal when i spend that 60 and i cant play the game. aside from that, the game is really excellent, and when this issue is resolved and i can play the game i will edit this review to reflect the true nature of the game. however, because i cant play the game for more than a half hour at a time before i experience a crash, i cant recommend this game to anyone, especially laptop users who use mobile graphics cards. from what ive read, rockstar doesnt have a fix for these issues pending just yet so save your money and buy when you know youre going to be able to actually play the game and get the experience you paid for.",2

"*please note that i have a  laptop, and the review will change as soon as i get a desktop* i have had a great experience playing grand theft auto v for the playstation 3, what i really cant seem to figure out is why rockstar took this long to release a game thats still filled with bugs... to be honest, they should have waited a little while longer, then again thats why you release a bug filled game to the public, and have the public complain about said bugs and the company fixes the bugs.. rockstar is a good company to follow, and this game proves to everyone why theyre still the best.. i loved this game on the playstation 3, continued to love it for the playstation 4, and prowd to have gotten it for pc.. but quite honestly, i dont think it should have been made for pc.. i do recommend this game though, its a great game to have on any sort of device that it was made for, i love playing it, and i enjoy hanging out with my friends in it.. theres no reason to get this game what so ever.. got the game for playstation/xbox?? sell it, get money back, and get this game for steam, cause it will be worth getting at the end of the day..",1

"wont load launcher at all. now that i got the launcher to load through the website version after having to completely uninstall my firewall it keeps asking for activation key... even though i entered it into the website instead of the launcher... apparently a big mistake.. still cant play the game edit: i got the game to work finally not sure what did it, moving rockstars downloader files over to the steam one, editting the registry values to the latest version value, etc. still not going to give gta 5 a better rating because the game isnt remotely good (i already played singleplayer on console) because the online isnt that amazingly fun at all.",5

"-is an actual good pc aaa port 10/10 would buy again",6
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played. the level of immersion in the story is very high as the dialogue makes it feel like an exaggerated stereotype of america. the graphics are very good, and even a mid-level pc can run this game on high/normal without any problems. buy this game now.",5
"very nicely ported over to pc, with an extensive list of graphics options. cant comment on keyboard and mouse because i spent 20 quid on a controller for games like this a while back and much prefer using it. make sure your drivers are up to date and dont try and push the options beyond your hardware and you should be fine. reading some of the wailing and gnashing of teeth at launch i can see why rockstar arent that keen on releasing for pc.",7

"i am not sure if i am the only one experiencing this problem but this game stutters as soon as i start driving, basically when i move around quickly. i tried to turn down graphics settings and optimized it through geforce experience and still experiences the same thing. i opened up fps counter and it started above 100fps (im running 3 gtx980s with 144ghz), so is my cpu the issue? i have a i7 4790k @ 4ghz so really? an i7 couldnt run this game smoothly?",4

"great game! a must buy for any previous rockstar fans or new fans alike!!",5
"lov this game. worht the year wait lol installed right away played right away. so far its an amazing game with no bugs. how often does a pc game come out thats actually optimized for pc these days. never. but his one is. only con is its 60gb lol but not really a con just took forever to download.",4

"although i reccomend this game, i reccomend you get it later, after some optimization updates have been released. im getting fps drops on lowest quality just driving. i dont think rockstar could have made a worse port to pc. it could be that its just hot in my room. i dont know, but seriously rockstar. come on. you had 2 years to make a pc version, and you ed it up with your  optimization. all this aside, gta v is a great ing game. note: ive fixed my issue, but people are still having problems with the port. second note: people on gta online dont know how to do the prison break.",4

"do not buy this game until it is fixed. the game is horribly broken with bugs. not only are most people that are having issues not able to play the game at all, the gameplay itself is hit or miss. loadscreens are deathtraps and maybe about 20% of the time i can progress through them without the game just crashing completely.",3
"hello steam or rockstar i did go into an error when i try to launch the game is okay. then it says loading... loading... loading... loading... for so much time i did wait 1 hour to load in but nothing please help me!",10

"other than a world loading error that i seem to have (probably just my computer) the game is beautiful and feels so great in 60 fps. murdering animals has never been so fun before, not even in postal 2. i also killed two deer with my racing bike so... 10/10 would spend a whole day downloading it again (which i have...it was stuck at 99% with .1 mb of downloading to go...) probably not the two years time though. hey, i need my daily dose of family friendly murders ok?",4

"rockstar fix your ing game, the stuttering in this game is ridiculous, the way the textures are streamed is ed up, after 20-30 mins the game just starts eating more and more ram to the point that it starts using the page file memory instead.... there obviously a memory leaking issue, and alot of people are having the same problem no matter the brand or how powerful the rig is. based on multiple users configurations, i can safely without a doubt that your game is not optimized properly. 3 delays for more optimization my , release a patch that can fix this memory leak, after that then i might recommend this game, but for now. hurry up with a proper fixing patch.",5
"just... just buy it, trust me. this is not just a port, this is more. the game is beautiful and the hype is not fake. you must know one thing - 2gb graphics card, is enough, now let me define enough: some features (graphical ones ofc) require a lot of graphics cards memory, and for beautiful game, without huge fps drops, crashing, etc. you will need more than 2gb :) every penny that you give in this game, if worth it!",8
"this game truly is a masterpiece of modern gaming. it has been refined and refined to the point its at and it is glorious. it genuinely feels like a real living breathing city with immense attention to detail. the graphics are astonishing, everything feels smooth and clean. the gameplay is cinematic and addictive and the dialogue is some of the funniest i have experienced in a video game, i never skip a cutscene or dialogue. 10/10.",4

"gta v has been the best game ever, with the loads of activities you can do in the game you can never get bored. this game has the best replay value by far with the extraordinary campaign and online multiplayer to play with friends. although this game has been delayed for pc for over a year it is worth it. the gunplay of this game is good, if you dont prefer using keyboard thats alright because you can switch over to controller with ease-i use controller though but either way this is a must buy game.",2
"i really love this game!!!! however there are some problems i have encountered that affect the gameplay. the game stutters like hell thi is my most common problem. another problem is that the map wont render fast so the floor and buildings appear to be invisible and for some reason i couldnt launch the game on offline mode.but overall i think this is game is a masterpiece so please rockstar release a new patch that fixes most of the bugs especially the stuttering so that itll be much more enjoyable.",7
"the first person mode has really put this game on a whole new level. also lets not forgetting the following: -visually stunning.(4k resolution) -action packed. -brilliant story. -great humor. -massive world. -does a great job to progress the story in a non linear feel. -awesome soundtracks fitting any mood. (gotta love getting into a highspeed chase in a stolen car that just happenes to be playing something fitting to the scene) -hours upon hours of gameplay. -etc. downside: -requires a really powerful pc/laptop to truly appreciate its greatness. -may lead to psychosis ... lol",6

"amazing game; once you get it running. i do wish it didnt use social-club. and i wish it didnt take so much trial and error to get it installed the rockstar hot-fix didnt work. but the graphics are absolutely amazing, and this is one ofthe best ports i have seen so far, despite one or two fall through the world type things. what i did to fix the downloads is just disable short-cuts and windows start menu short-cuts and then you should be good, the thing is you just have to open it through steam.",4

(300mbps down / 20 up) dont waste your time on consoles, heres the real version of the game. thanks for beta testing console users. your move console.",3

"hi, iam really sorry if my english is bad bear with it. good now lets review this game. first the graphics the best i have seen in a long time you can see that they put in a lot of work in it with all the option to change this is a game that will run on a lot of configs. second, the gameplay is good i had a lot of fun playing around in general. third, the story is simple but fun rare are the game that go screwball wich for me is not a bad thing at all. finally the community now here is the big problem the community is complete s*** litle kids going around killing every body shouting in the lobby and to following the plan during heist. in conclusion this game is worth the wait the story, gameplay and graphics are good but it has a  community i rate 8.7/10",5

"this is a good game, but i find it difficult to play it for many hours due to me already playing on xbox 360 when it was originally released for the console. its very similar to the xbox one, and ps4 release apart from obviously 60 fps (frames per second) and better graphics. i can tell a difference in the graphics and the game looks incredible and isnt very demanding which is good. the game suffers from a large about of bugs due to the new, and recent release but nothing that cant be fixed. it honestly sucks that we had to wait just under 2 years for the pc port and its still full of irritating and game breaking bugs which effect the overall game experience. but putting that aside - by the far the best gta in the series imo and a good port apart from the bugs. i recommend this game to any gta fan, and anybody who wants to experience an unrealistic machine gun town 3rd person/1st person shooter.",1
"launched game, went into graphics settings, set everything on max. started benchmark. loads for 3 minutes or so. benchmark starts playing, hang on, thats not a benchmark, thats the start of the story mode. one second later, camera switches to benchmark scene. a few seconds later, camera switches back to story mode (can hear lady screaming for her life), few seconds later, it switches back to benchmark (where the jet is flying). few seconds later, booooom, slow motion, mission failed message pops up. i click on retry, story mode restarts. i play story mode. right after the part where i loot the vault and shoot the cop in the head, the game blacks out. tried to run benchmark, launched both story mode and benchmark simultaneously. 10/10",7

"well im going to start off by saying this version of gta v is definitely the best version of it available. i understand the perks of 4k res and 60 fps, but that isnt what makes it the best version for me. keyboard gameplay is smooth and easy to pick up after a little bit of playing and a few double checks in the keybinding tab. what makes this game the best version is the rockstar editor, i love making movies and this is a home run for me. i am still learning the camera behaviors and the editing tools, but this is an amazing addition. it makes this game shine, i love the fact that you can use action replay and record epic moments that we not intentional or intended. plus it is available on online and campaign. ive been playing this on ps3 since it came out and i am happy that i pre-order this game worth every penny.",5

"10/10 amazing graphics, the ammount of attention rockstar put into every minor detail is mind blowing. i would highly reccomend this game running on a i7 4770k and a gtx 980 g1, and it runs so smoothly. i spent the first hour walking around and looking for flaws in programing and in the game world itself i.e glitchy walls,, misanimations. havent found anything yet. the game world is so alive! i rode the subway, walked around a realistic baseball field, and while i was exploring some rooftops(the parkour reminds me of mirrors edge which is a good thing) i heard get on the ground! so i went to investigate and see cops starting to arrest a guy before he pulled a gun and a firefight ensued. they killed him and the cops moved so lifelike. love it! great job rockstar!",3

"the patch and amd driver update (beta) actually made the game a lot faster and more stable (it was barely playable at first). there are some technical flaws thogh. nice visuals, quite stable fps, a-lot-of-new to explore and learn. suddenly theres something more time consuming than skyrim. i didnt try gta online yet since my internet is very unstable atm; people say its chaos and the most of the time you watch load screens, not los santos. im very happy with the singpleplayer so far. maybe the game is not totally worth the full price (i usually buy games on huge sales), but its not waste either. so, im pretty happy with the buy and i look forward for new updates/fixes. specs: msi gx70 laptop (fullhd) amd a10 5750m (2.5/3.2 ghz) radeon hd8970m 2gb gddr5 16gb ddr3 1600mhz 7200 rpm hdd win7 64 settings: 1920x1080 high texture quality high shadow quality high reflections quality softest shadows v-sync: half (30 fps) fxaa the rest is low/default. 9.5/10 (not so satisfying shooting, few other things are off, otherwise very enjoyable). 2015-04-17",3

"amazing pc port !! runs butter smooth @ 1920x1080 on my gtx 970 with almost all the bells and whistles turned on (and it does offer a huge variety of video options). the graphical fidelity is outstanding -esp. for an open world game. i am very happy they didnt dumb it down unlike so many other contemporary pc ports. beware of the ~ 60 gb download / hard disc space requirement though. the game also seems to be using up almost all of my 4096 mb video memory. so if you have a mid range pc, i suggest disabling anti aliasing and turning the texture quality sliders down a notch to ensure smooth gameplay. im not even gonna waste time reviewing the actual gameplay/storyline as this game has been out on consoles for almost 2 years now. but for us pc players it was certainly worth the wait. brb overclocking my gpu so i can crank up the msaa even more ... #justmasterracethings",2

"ive played gta 5 from the console release, to the next gen release. now finally and most importantly, i have begun to play the pc release. the differences were subtle from console to console but to go from that to the pc, those differences are now striking. with almost every graphical option any pc gamer would hope for and a framerate to boot, what is old is new again. whether you are a new comer or an old one, this installment of 5 will no doubt impress.",8
"its no longer just a game, its a experiance for the soul. i played gta v on the xbox since it first came out and this is quiet honestly the best experiance ive had with it ever since then, and ive had some great experiances. if you want a game where you can do pretty much anything you want and have it look amazing at the same time then this is a game you dont want to pass up.",2
"i tripped over a fence and the ballas shot me to death. 10/10 would be shot again",6
"problems i currently have with gta 5 - loading delay when the game launches - resolution changing from fullscreen to windowed - built in benchmark program does not work properly - graphics stuttering, especially when driving - some textures and objects loading at a slow pace which result in blurred images on the screen ive updated to the amd experimental drivers for gta 5, which helped a lot. im disappointed in amd, they need to make better drivers and churn them out at a faster pace for big game launches. switching to lower graphics improves the fps, but doesnt remove the stuttering. so once again im in this waiting game for bug fixes. the sad thing is this is rockstar games best port they have done for the pc recently. both max payne and la noire had more problems at launch, but eventually those games ran very smooth for me on high settings. shame on rockstar for the mediocre port, shame on amd for the mediocre drivers, and shame on me for pre-ordering again from a publisher with a history of pc launch problems. this game is great, ive played in on ps3 and i really want to play it on pc and change this to a positive review :(",1
"have some problem with social club, have to disable graphics card in device manager to get the game work. but beside that the game itself is very good port. run very smooth, high setting 1080p. this is gta v for pc you watting for. 9/10 recommended.",6
"as a player who already has played throw the game on previous consoles. i think it is 100% worth rebuying it because its so much better feel in the shooting and the grafics is mindblowing 10/10",6
"the graphics look like the damn ps3, some parts look nice.. but the shadows are very choppy, trees are glitching out, and i cant use my mouse, it staggers too much, im forced to use the wired xbox controller, and my graphics card fans are screaming in over load anyway.. rockstar ed up, i thought with the amount of delays the pc version had, i thought it would be better without glitches, i guess i was wrong, i think the rockstar team need to learn to create games for the pc first then work on consoles, they did better that way im playing at 60 fps 60 hz cause i cant play any lower other wise the shadows are all choppy and the cars have glitches in the textures",10
"dont know why everyones complaining. if you cant follow basic instructions, hell, you just need to press 3 buttons to link your steam account and activate your code, then you probably shouldnt have had access to this game. everything worked for me since day one, gj rockstar",10
"i cannot play that the computer shows that the solution has problem",7
"this by far the best pc game i have played in a long time i wasnt 100% sure i could run this game at a decent fps because gta 4 was bad for fps on my old hd7750 but i got to say i get better frame rate with this then a game thats older my hat is off to rockstar for that. this is a must have game and it was worth the wait if you are considering getting it then you should just do it also go for if you arent its still a must have and i rarely say that",3
"this game is amazing! the singleplayer is very dramatic/cinematic and has the feling of a movie about a group of thieves coming together to perform massive hiests. as for the multiplayer it feels like theyre trying to get you to buy shark cards as the online ultimatly feels like a huge grind but over all is still very fun and with the addition of hiests this gives the game a new feeling to it making players who have played the game for houndreds of hours to come back and play even more! so overall this game is worth buying the only thing i think needs changing is the grind in online. 11/10 ign 100% legit",3
"please make a option for 30 frames per second in the game just as a option please",1
"dont buy this unless you like wasting money on a game that cannot even be played since rockstar dont give a damn about fixing it.",1
"from the minute i started playing i have not been disappointed. this game, as far as my experience goes, has been full of nothing but elation. this game is nothing but amazing right now. i have experienced no issues so far (do note, i only played up to the first reposession mission and no side questing, your experience may vary) and framerates have been very smooth. the graphics, or should i say the game, is amazing for what i have in terms of hardware (gtx 770 2gb, i7 3770k, 16gb ram) and i recommend it wholeheartedly at this point and time.",7
"just bought the game and ran it. curious - you cant family share this game, like any other. pretty crappy to not have a notification of that.",1
"you roman! i never want to see you again!!! gta 5 is 5 times better. rockstar have done a great job optimising this. it even runs better than gta 4! however, there is a glitch meaning you can only play once. until they patch it, this game gets an average recomendation. afterwards, this game gets a complete recomendation! and you never have to go bowling with roman again.",5
"dont let someone with a stupid username that cant log in turn you away from this game. its awesome. ive been playing gtas since the top down days and with each entry it just gets better and better. i cant wait to keep digging and turn los santos inside out. i have experience zero troubles and im getting excellent frames on high everything. i5 3570 8gb @ 1600mhz gtx 760 4gb its running beautifully.",1

"this game is so realistic, it taught me you can rob a convencience store with a flare gun!",6
"the game is great and lots of fun! however, you all should know that it freezes and crashes in online multiplayer alot. expect to look and feel like a total scrub because you will crash at the worst possible time when doing heists with a group and let everyone down, and then itll rinse and repeat and everyone will hate you and unfriend you because of it. so much fun and so much to do, but eventually youll get enraged because of all the crashes. good luck, have fun ;)",6
"my anticipations for this game were really high, although they kept delaying it i was still excited to get home and download + play this game however i had day one issues. but this long wait was well worth it. its a great game but sadly not many people have the game :/",2
"this payday 2 dlc has it all... masks, guns, gun mods... it even took the concept of driving cars from that one heist no one liked and expanded on it, adding an open world, bank heists you have to actually prepare for (sadly theres still drilling, but at least they improved that too!), the list goes on. its even got mindless pvp for those that just like to hold w and the left mouse button all day and think its a game. overall, a bit pricy for a re-mastered version of the original game, but well worth it when you realize it includes all of the dlc, weapons etc., with a streamlined level process that takes all of the rng out of unlocking your favorite items. bonus: it still has the kawaii mask.",6

"(warning**** change of heart )update: after first patch this game has been performing alot better. my love for rockstar is unmatched. the devs are on top of the communities issues. recommend this title to all.. ....(original review).. ** for the people that are having problems starting this on laptops, disable your anti-virus.. all of them. (unplug any controllers, or else your system will crash) now for my review love the game, graphics are eye-popping, gameplay is phenominal. when exiting the game through the online (settings) option, my desktop crashed (twice). the secong time i exited my pc never recovered from that crash. im resolving the issue as im typing (system restoring). im not too upset because all of my data is backed-up. just worried that this game is unplayable currently.",3

"cant play this  game because of infinite rockstar social club charging, gonna keep this negative till this ing game works. edit : so i was able to get on the game after having to tweak some  that i shouldnt have to be doing but oh well, i dont know if rockstar came up with a patch or anything yet but this really isnt serious at all, they delayed it so many times and for what ? so many people had and still have issues just launching the game, its a joke... aside from that, the game is pretty well optimised, im running on high and a few setting on very high with a r9 280x oc 3go and an i5 4690k at around 40-60fps, mostly over 50 though which im pretty satisfied about, amd will probably still come out with another driver to make it even smoother (yeah i guess im an optimistic person) only negative point i can really think about which is pretty ing annoying are the endless loading times on gta online, i have the game on a 240go ssd and its so ing annoying as im not patient at all when it comes to video games. all around im enjoying this game now that i can actually play it, id recommend buying it if you have the recommended config.",7

( at least for my system ) i have yet to really drop below 50fps. in terms of graphical fidelity however, it really takes the cake. my god. sometimes, ive felt like i was playing real life. buy this game, tell your friends. 10/10/10 - would ragdoll down a mountain again. but seriously. buy this game. buy it. stop reading this and buy it already. -.-",3

"dont you love it how every single day a new issue appears with a video game? maybe one day it will cause your game to blue screen at start up, maybe it will crash randomly in the middle of the game, maybe the game will just not load when you launch it or maybe your game will stutter from frame rate drops randomly. also dont you love it how different issues will appear even though you have litterally changed no settings what so ever but some how something different happens with the game every day as if it has mood swings? gta 5; youre in for one hell of a fustration ride.",8

"i pre-ordered this game, like many of you did, when it was first availible on steam. a friend and i waited the 3 months for it to be released, did the pre-instal, and on the launch date we both promptly started a skype call and clicked play. my game started up no problem, however he has had a countless number of issues and ever able to get passed the rockstar launch screen. i was able to play for the past few days but then, just about an hour ago it refused to open. i have no fix for this and there is no reason for it not to open. so no, i do not suggest buying this game until literally all of the updates and glitch fixes have been released.",9

"this game had a few release day hiccups, but no where near as many as some games. the hiccups included some unpacking errors and some other bugs involving rockstars social club, however these are easily fixed or you just have to wait a ad longer to play the game. my initial impressions were; the graphics are amazing, lots of customizable options (key bindings, graphical settings ect), the game runs at a butery smooth 60 fps (even on a pentum cpu and a gtx 760 ftw) at mostly high - maximum settings. however i have experienced a few bugs, which prevented my car from moving, however this is the only bug i have encountered. pros; 1) graphics 2)runs on not to good hardware very well 3)60 fps 4)key bindings and lots of customization 5)high resolution and multi monitor support (4k - 3 monitors) cons; 1)release day hiccups (not a big deal) 2)a few bugs (not many though) so all in all this game is brilliant on the pc, i love it more than ever now and it looks amazing.",2

"this game is incredible! not only is it optimized for pc, but the graphics and pretty much everything have made the pc version a definitive version. however, there are a few quirks for this game, at least for me. also, keep in mind most of these problems are specific to online. first is that the stocks for bawsaq in story mode seem to be broken (not moving) for now, but i believe it will be fixed in a new update soon. the second is that transferred characters have a few problems on them, notably the lipstick problem. however, it can be fixed through a simple trip to the barber shop, but even then, it is an inconvenience. those are pretty much the only problems. overall, this game was worth the wait and delays, considering how polilshed it is. i do, however, believe that we will be seeing new features, as well as performance optimizations from rockstar in the next few weeks.",6

"cant play the game any help? its like i open the game then it closes without doing anything",1
"i can now finally diddle los santos with michael by my side. oh and i can play gta v on pc as well.",1
".. i cant even everytime i start the game it just crashes pls fix this r* .-. refund pls",1
"i put 1000 hours in to it on the xbox 360 and have already put 57 hours in to it on pc and its only been out 4 days. on 360 it cost 15 and pc it cost 40. 55 for all those hours of playing this great game thats updated around every 1.5 months. its truly worth buying",8
"amazing game! decent port, although could use a lot of work on optimizing lower end graphics cards. there have been a couple bugs with online, but not gamebreaking. definitely recommend, especially if you have some friends to play with!",9
"dont buy this game if you want to have fun with friends. you wont make it past the tutorial that takes multiple hours of you guessing where to go since you actually recieve no tutoring. if you want to spend hours doing the same thing over and over go for it, otherwise stay away.",2
"jerking while your friend is in the shower is the best feature of the game",4
"pc ulitmate experience my ... buy preorder, download files before premiere. wait 30 min for decoding files on launch. and then what? you cannot play because r* dont know that some countires use more letters than basic 26. i bought this game, paid for it and still i cant play it. on this position for me its a scam.",6
"10/10 spent 2 hours unpacking my luggage. soon i will be done so i can exlopre los santos!",4
"i would love to play gta 5 for my pc. i purchased it for my birthday yesterday and windows 8.1 will not allow windows media player. gta 5 needs it to start. pls fix i need 2 play!!!!",5
"fantastic game. runs perfect using a 980 and 3570k @1440p. coming from the last gta i wasnt expecting this to be such a well made game. theyve done an awesome job, easily the best looking game, and yet its also huge! first person mode is great, and even then its got much better graphics than most corridor shooters. theres only two or three setting i cant quite max, but im running it at 2560x1440. ultra grass (which looks no different to very high as far as i can tell) and hd shadows (which is seperate from the main shadow option, has 15-20fps hit) but im running nvidia soft shadows which means the hd shadows dont do much anyway. online seems to be stable, but i havent played that much yet. very, very happy. great game, id highly recommend. dont let the last gta put you off (which is a mess still to this day) rockstar have spent a lot of time making the pc version. i also have the xboc one version, and pc blows that away.",7
"i never owned a console to play gtav when it first came out. so far this game has been awesome. there is nothing i dont like about it. i foresee me playing this game alot. its too dang fun.",2
"*pro tip, ignore the negative reviews that have 20+ hours of gameplay but their review states they are locked out of the game... by far the best game in the series. first person view mode is a great addition to an already fantastic game, crisp graphics and a video editor are just icing on the cake. story is good and improved from previous versions by having 3 main characters, all of which are introduced to eachother through some pretty funny circumstances. the multiplayer is top notch and considering it was a free update (from 360/ps3) its amazing rockstar has delivered as much as they did. heists improve the mp even further by giving you a team and multiple objectives to work towards a high payout. none of the previous gtaiv issues on pc are present and it really seems rockstar learned some valuable lessons from their previous release. i cant recommend this game enough.",3
"looks amazing runs great gameplay is great story is great what more do you want from a game!",5
"its great cause my modest rig can run this at 1080p 60 fps, the game is very well optmized",5
"until the game gets patched and fixed completely, then this rating wont change. once i can actually access and play the game? then well see. just dont buy the game yet, wait until this thing is legitimately playable.",3
"i know there are a lot of people struggling with some bugs and i fully acknowledge how frustrating it must be having waiting so long after the console release, then preorder, then preload, and then crashes. you have my condolences. when i loaded the game, there were a number of nagging issues.. such as the benchmark utility being worthless since it starts the game while running the benchmark. i have no clue how they could have missed this. moving on, i played last night after finding the appropriate graphical settings. the game is beautiful. when you are considerate to your settings, the framerates are silk. i sat downtown and just watched things, i havent done that in a game since skyrim. its something to see... this is one of those games that will sell a ton of hardware. this and witcher 3 have made it an exciting quarter for pc gamers. paying $59 for a game i played on ps3 was a hard pill to swallow, but it was worth it.",4
"this game may have big improvments in small details on chars expression, etc. but, too bad there is no more accesible burger shots, or well stack pizza, and any other venues.. please make an update, make it more realistic! :d",2
"day 1 cant play crash, crash and more crashes. updated my drivers, disabled my antivirus and every other thing you can do to make this pos work and still crash crash crash. the definitive gtav on pc, except made by a company that doesnt play test. there work around is if you rename has special characters make a new account in windows, what the hell kind of programming is that. my name doesnt and it still doesnt work. f u rock star you azzhats. the best part about this is you cant even ask for feedback they blocked all the people who are using twitter to complain how bad they suck. then when you use their own site you have to be a member for a month before you can post anything. gee sounds convenient that you cant flame a game they so epically fed up again!!! this is the exact reason people steal your games because you  never have anything work on day 1, we have to wait a month before you let us play test your crappy programmed product. yes there are work around, turn off your antivirus, rename your user id on your computer, and reinstall several other software products. where the hell did you guys learn to program?",2
"amazing simply put amazing. gta4 has nothing on this neither do the wash out dogs. so much to do so much fun to have controls are great story is nice",5
"my pc is so good but i dont know why do i have lags i think it is bbecause i have some problems with dropped fps but i dont know why... :((( what can i do ? please help me!",3
"this is a proper port pros: -60 fps -best graphics -incredible draw distance -full controller support with new controls -all dlc included from the console version updates cons: -slight screen tearing issues when using big picture mode overall: i played this all the way through back on the xbox 360 when it released and so far i have seen improvements in every way. rockstar did an amazing job on this port and hopefully continue to do so from now on. this is totally worth the wait!",2
"incredible game, according to a lot of people.. majority of my friends included. too bad i cant play it, because the game refuses to launch and theres no hotfixes or patches in sight. the hour ive spent with this game is staring at loading screens for social club. rockstar is silent, which doesnt really help the case. i am happy that they decided to extend the refund period at least because they sold me and a lot of people a broken game that doesnt even start.",5
"great graphics and sound but overall story is just kinda boring and heists is almost the same thing everytime.",1
"this is truly the best version of the game. no crashes, no bugs, no nothing that is bad (at least for me). and that improved foliage system? its by far one of the greatest ive ever seen in a game. although, i still havent figured out how to aim down the sights/use the scope...",5
"if your mainly interested in the online play then wait for a few patches. if your using ati gfx card then dont bother till they roll out the patch. but if you do get it right now then make sure you are wearing a top hat. it seems the hitbox on the head isnt working when its worn.",1
"got it for gta online. no problems from start. and its been great.",3
"ive played every gta since the top down grand theft way back when. gtav has to be my favourite of all of them. 2 years ago, i played it on x360, and i didnt hesistate to purchase it again for pc. the pc version is of course the definitive version. it scales excellently to any system components, the graphics are incredibly sharp and beautiful, and the online with first person and mouse/kb support is a must play. all we can hope for is continued support for it from rockstar. please dont forget about us r*. i hope weve shown you that we will support you. now that the game is out, please continue to support us. fix those bugs, add those dlcs, improve those servers, and well let the world know what a great job youve done. thanks",6
"for only $59.99 you too can listen to hours voice over work that reinforces racial and gender stereotypes. sit back and relax with a smooth redwood cigarette while this triple a title brings to life the attitudes of the 50s in a modern day setting. 1/10 would be 10/10 but i couldnt run over the armenian npc as soon as i met him.",4
"well, a got a bad luck and i think all this great dev should be more attencious about their games before their let it availible. i got a issue with the game launch and, yes, i did all the steps trying to fix something that i couldnt. to be more specific, my issues were: 1- i cant launch the first screen ( social club ), when i thought it would works it crash. 2- my serial was duplicated. 3- it was missing one .exe file on the folder and i couldnt execute it as admin. 4- i play on laptop and i read that almost every laptop users got problems with the game. therefore, my negative reviem is just because i couldnt got to play it and it was kind of frustrating to not be able to play with my other friends... now im the black sheep of my friends group (lol). for those who bought the game and it doesnt works as well, you can reclaim your money if you want. i did it and when the devs launch a fix i would buy it again.",1
"updated yesterday then nvidia gpu could working, however amd mobility cards keeping unuseful. if we wanna run gta5, unless we disable amd card or setting in ccc. could you fix this? we have waited for 4 days. pshave updated driver. amd graphics cards driver is 15.4 beta. not good english for me.",1

"so far greatest title of the greatest game series of all time. -best content-for-money ratio -open-world par excellence -diverse multiplayer (unlike iv) -framerate friendly -new mechanics (skill & level system, main chars) -so many little improvements -ost what i hope for in the planned dlcs: - more multiplayer modes & customization options - bring back ken rosenberg! - lets ship it out to pc players first this time gta is like beethoven. you cant dislike beethoven.",5

"i started the game just fine but my friend had a problem about social club telling that it is bugging and that it is loading for 14 hours and it is not installed yet so rockstar is a b!tch releasing the game with a lot of bugs that half of the people cant play the game",1

"pre-ordered because of all the hype and how great this game is on the consoles. 2 years later, it comes to pc. does it live up to the hype? is it as good as everyone has been making it out to be? well, i couldnt tell you. day 1 has been full of issues that rockstar had so much time to fix but never did. i cannot get into the game to tell you how it is. after a 60gb download and additional patches, i still cannot get the game to start.",5
"the game is buggy as hell, and sometimes hard to play because of it. this isnt what i waited a year and a half for... but im rating it up because its a good game and very fun to play. if they fix the bugs and glitches i would be super happy",5

"game wont even launch. gj rockstar. ::update:: finally got it to work. turns out i just had to set gtavlauncher.exe to run in compatibility mode for windows 8. im still going to give this game a negative review, at least until rockstar fixes most of the problems people are having. i dont recommend buying the game until then, unless you want to spend 10+ hours trying to get the game to start.",4
"the moment we all have been waiting for ! its here ! and it runs smooth! 10/10 would wait 2 years again !",4
"great game small lag but what does that change? did we wait like 2 years for pc or not this thing is amazing!",4
"went to a friends appartment and watched tv for 2 hours. 10/10 would watch american tv again",1
"this is the game that made me ascend. it looks amazing even on a budget computer. i switch between 360 controller and kb/m seamlessly for many various reasons. moving my old gtao account to pc was hassle free. the only downside is that this is the exact same game it was before. still worth it.",3
"fun game, looks good, runs well, great voice acting and soundtrack. only 3 problems with it so far: 1- game is hyper-unintuitive. i had less difficulty learning to program with the unix vi editor than i did trying to do very simple things in this game, like figure out what the hell passive mode is or how to disable it. hell, i couldnt even find out how to leave gta online, and i had to force it closed with task manager :/ 2- pvp in free roam is extremely shallow. get mg, get fast car, spray from car. if not, get spammed from car, die. shame, if you had to actually aim to shoot from a car in third person this game would be a much more fun and skillful pvp experience. 3- dear god, the law enforcement system in gta online is atrocious. you would think that offing someone in a dark alley with a suppressed pistol would reduce your chances of being discovered, but apparently big brother sees all in los santos, and the nations entire police force will dispatch endless troops from your anal sphincter. why even have a suppressor when you have radar always on and cops see everything? just remove it from the game rockstar, stop misleading people.",5
"bought the game and played for 4 hours. controls felt unresponsive and awkward, kind of like youre supposed to play with a controller of some sort rather than a keyboard and mouse. - auto aim feature is a joke; no real reason to competitively try and beat other players when this function is on. - ui is counter intuitive. again, feels mapped for a console rather than a pc. - spawn system is . killed a guy multiple times only to have him spawn 30 seconds away and had to try and kill him again until eventually he blew me away. gameplay was average, graphics were excellent and the cars looked dope. save yourself some money and wait the 2-3 weeks before this bad boy gets a special.",1
"cant even launch the game everytime i press play it dosent even launch 10/10",1
"the game is great except for one thing. i really hate how im crashing multiple times in row for me and then being fine for maybe an hours. i feel like paying this much for the game and it being capatable for me i shouldnt have to deal with these kind of problems.",2
"seriously one of the best games ever made. we waited too long for a pc version and the result is very, very good.",3
"10/10 best crashing and losing connection simulator",8
"i love this game and recommend it to anyone ! its a nice game if you can look beyond some issues that you might face if you are unlucky.",2
"lovely game with so much content. i played on xbox 360 for hours on end and this is no different and is worth a buy. now go! loosen your wallets! let the 60 bucks fly unto steam cards and then purchase this gamr brcaause this is pretty much the best game on steam as of right now! 10/10!",1
"ive just played about 3 hours now on pc and played a lot more on ps3 and i can totally recommend this game to anyone ! everyone has to experience this masterpiece. on pc graphics are amazing as well as the optimization, rockstar didnt forget us pc guys this time !! edit: it seems that a lot of people cant run the game yet, so right now it would be smarter to wait and see if the problems with the game that people have are fixed and only then buy it. p.s lets take a moment of silents to our pc brothers and sister who cant play it yet because of admin accounts problem and other stuff. they have waited so long and still cant play it. please rockstar fix. (lets hope ill edit this after they have fixed that)",5
"what can i say about gta 5 that hasnt already been said? its one of, if not the, greatest games of all time, and it even more deserves such a title on pc. aside from the crap launch it had, i cant recommend this game enough. best $60 youll ever spend (at least at the time of writing this review).",1
"10/10, no comments. this game of ages, rockstar forever!",6
"as of writing have only played a few hours of online but i am already very impressed. playing with friends is a blast. i anticipate many good times to be had with this game, glad it finally came to pc with the improvements from xb1/ps4. controlling vehicles with keys took getting used to for me but keybinding and/or a gamepad can fix that. other than that, no gripes. exemplary port.",1
"this is a great game it hasnt been out for 24 hours yet and i have loged nearly 12 hours of gameplay so far (that should tell you something) i run this game maxed out on 60 fps. let me just say this game looks better than i could have imagined it. the game is pretty optimized (i will be getting a controller just for flying and driving) i had no issues during install. the 17 month wait was well worth it. 10/10 would buy again!",6
"really good game. thank you old gen consoles for the alpha testing. thank you current gen consoles beta testing.",3

"rockstar has re-learned how to make pc games. better late than never i guess. im on a 3 year old pc (i5-2550, gtx 560ti) and i was worried about being able to run the game at all. its currently running at 60fps on 1920x1080. not maxed obviously but the game still looks pretty darn good. way better than the ps3 version i played over a year ago.",3

"if you can go anywhere in-game without the police being called you are a better man than i.",4
"great optimzation & great port this game ran perfectly on day 1 release and it has not given me any problems at all. im also very surprised that the rockstar cloud servers didnt get rekt on day 1. this port really opened my eyes to how great this game really is. i have 23 days clocked on gta v online for xbox 360 @ level 190 but finally abandoned it due to the lack of new engaging features. now i am able to play this at constant 60 fps on ultra settings on my pc. my brain is still tickled over the fps view since i never got to experience it until now.",6
"the best  gta game since sa, while this is still in los santos it allows you every once in awhile to have this moment of nostalgia, where you will stand there and think, i know this place.",4
"extremely frustrated, there is a huge community of people including myself who have bought the game and it does not work, start, or function in any manor. by huge i mean 1/3 users. will never buy a rockstar game again. there are no fixes for amd users with issues, some fixes for nvidia users. 0 luck for amd, no excuses rockstar.",2

"the only game ive bought in 3 years that was worth the money, and i have almost 400 games. buy it. now. seriously.",8
"fantastic and well worth the wait, runs better on my computer than gta iv did, far better optimization. i do however feel for the folks affected by user account name issues, im surprised they didnt bump into that in 1.5 years of testing. hopefully they fix that eventually but this still gets the thumbs up from me.",5
"downloading is one thing, unpacking is another but still... its worth the wait.",7
"ive never banked more hours in a video game ever. prior to the pc release, i had invested in both the 360 and xbox one versions and have well over 1,200 hours spread across both platforms. the only negative thus far in this release has been how hard it pushes some pcs. however, this should get fixed, and dont let those negative reviews sway you!",1
"the hardest part of this game is getting past the social club loading screen. i have spent around a hour just looking at social club load, and multiple hours looking up ways to fix this.",1
"the game its self is very very good. a huge improvement to the peasents beta test. ****warning**** amd users beware it hates our guts the  dont work right!!!! just warning you. it does work but there are some frame issues. and no its not my pc trust me.......my friends that are amd users as well are also having issues.",6
"a lot of issues that should be expected at launch, but so far i am really enjoying this game.",2

"i deleted origin so i could have enough space to unpack this game 420/10",1
"complete disappointment. cant even start the game to begin with. crashes like everyone else complaining in the forums. im running on amd gpu. but due to the nature of the ing manufacturer, it needs slightly custom drivers. only official ones that could run stably was 14.4. gta v requires you to have 15.4beta, and installing that causes the whole system to blackscreen forever. no games has need me to do this thus far, not even newer ones. really really disappointed with rockstar.",1

"whatever patch was released killed my performance.. day 1 was playing with everything cranked to the max.. now whatever they have done to the game has killed my performance.. crazy menu ui stuttering same in game stutters whenever trying to pan my camera around.. not sure what they did but id like them to undo it.. and give me back my performance.. until then i wont touch this game",2
"optimized very well. this just proves that most pc devs dont even try. obviously because they have a secret deal with gpu manufacturers to optimize badly --> more sold gpus. this is basically an old game with new skin. but thats some nice looking skin, and runs silky smooth. some people have had problems like crashes. for me zero crashes. had a problem with installing though, gta5 needs 120 gb space to unpack files, even though after its complete, its only 60 gb. but the game works fine on (modern) hdd, doesnt need ssd contrary to what many believe. loading time is not long.",2
"stunningly beautiful, well worth the wait. biggest complaint would be the weird air vehicle controls, for kb + m (no-one uses numpad for anything r*). but easy enough to change yourself to something more comfortable. i think this will most likely be my new time sucking game.",5

"single player is awesome, i really hope they can bring back the jazz radio (the one in gta4, its my favourite radio channel) multiplayer is quite laggy at the moment (i know it is just released) also, it automatically switches my character to another server when im on a mission. lack of options on appearance (e.g. cant change body shape, clothes are not good looking as well....) biggest issue is heist, if one player leaves, the whole mission failed, it would be nice if the missing player is replaced by bot. also, everytime i died, my screen freezes and not be abled to play the restarted mission unless the host die as well. (sure rock star will patch it in the furture) overall an awesome game, 9/10 (would be 10/10 if they fix",5
"for the last 2 years , i never tried to know about this game, i managed not to watch a video , or a trailer, gameplay streaming, ever, not even a screenshot. never ever raise the expectation. i dont want to know anything about it before i could actually play it. console players are playing already yeah just fxxk them. for 2 years. now here it comes. wait a sec, why no workshop !!!",2

"very nice game... there are few minor bugs and glitches, but nothing really game-breaking. (if i dont count rp and money glitches).. only bad thing i felt is r* support. it is terrible. 4 days waiting on ticket. - nothing. then some bot replies with some format i should send to their email and i am waiting again lol. otherwise funny, great game. nice graphics. great to play with friends, if you dont have any, you will definitely find some in this game. my rating to this game is 9/10. you can get really angry sometimes and some bugs can occur as i said but nothing else. also 11/10 would kill cats, dogs, wildlife.",3

"i love this game on xbox 360 but on pc right now i have a $2,000 pc overclocked and has a amd turbo card amd 8 gb of ram and a intel(r) core(tm) i7-4770k cup and i cant go any where near the city so i hope gta v reads this because you need to fix performance (yes i know there going to be problems because it just came out) but at the end it fun to play",2
"rockstar can suck my , absolutely no support for those who cannot play the game because of their  perma link to steam accounts... so if you bought the game on a different account not activated to steam rockstar will take outs its big willy and shuv it down your throat and make you wait 1 month to answer a ticket that will probably not help. because giving the power of unlinking your steam account to the customer is too much to handle and would give them a god complex.  you, ruined my day/week.",4
"have been waiting for this game for almost 2 years. i was extremely excited. until yesterday, gta v social club ui kept crashing. i hope there is a fix for this asap. although this has been a frustrating many hours of installing and reinstalling but still no success, i rate the game 10/10 rockstar fix the errors that so many people are dealing with so we can play this game that we have been waiting years to play.",5
"you dont really need me to tell you how perfect gta v is, its unlike any other video games ive played before. how it bests the ps4 & xb1 version and why its the ultimate definitive real perfect version of gta v -1080+p -60+ fps (smoooth) -txaa -nividia tessalation -superb optimization -higher-res reflection -beautiful real-time wet & rain simulation :o -more vegetation -more population density -much, much more population variety -more wild life -denser traffic -smarter a.i. really. -much prettier water quality -better distance scaling -soft shadows -more fun in multiplayer -more particles -ultra grass detail -rockstar editor ! -higher-res shadow quality than xb1 stronger community w/ steam & !!!!!!! mods !!!!!!!",3
"i simply cannot recommend this game right now , the performance are horrible , im having extreme stuttering even with a descent config ( over recommended ) . the game might be good , but something is clearly wrong in the port . so, i will wait for a patch to fix that because i cant play .",7
"review in progress: so far in my experience on xbox this game easily wins 9/10 because of how fun it is. many bugs are easy to ignore. however having any amount of lag can  up your experience when being the passenger of a car because the car, like hydraulics, humps the ground. i feel the same on pc. pc includes better giraffics and better gameplay (imo) and its not fun unless you got friends to play with. the only con is that you really need a good pc otherwise you get 30 fps max. tl:dr 9/10",8
"refunded. im sure the game itself is great, but the launch was not. its not to late to get a refund if its not working for you.",7
"didnt buckle into rollercoaster, got trampled by it while a helicopter murdered me. 12/10 stellar.",4
"definitely worth the 2 years waiting for this game to come out for pc. the first person view is so sweet i ed my pants on the first playthrough of the game. best part is this game is optimized to the max. im only running i5-3570k and hd 7850 which are pretty old but im doing fine on 1080p with 60fps on a mix of high/very high settings. with that being said i would like to give a little shout out to console peasants for beta testing this game. you guys made it much more worth it for pc master race. without your sacrifice, we wont be getting this awesome piece made by rockstar. much love.",4
"speaking entirely about the online, it is like some ed up cross between dark souls and hotline miami it is like darksould in that you have no idea what the  you are doing or are supposed to be doing. it is like hotline miami in that the entire time you thing you are going insane while murdering endless amounts of people who quesionably deserve it. oh yeah and the drm is a .",1
"oh baby that is one optimized port. also the game is really good. mods.",3
"grand theft auto v has exited unexpectedly 1 week and still no patch good job tar!",3
"i saw cats. thats good enough for 11/10 kittens. meow :3",1
"watched a guy air humping in the middle of the street get run over by a semi 11/10",3
"good game great gameplay overpriced for coming out a year later on pc. bought it anyway.",1
"i love this game. ive already played 44.5 hours of the game less than two weeks after it released. ive so far only touched the single player and im loving it. according to ingame stats, i have completed 65% of the overall game. ill start playing multiplayer very soon and im sure that will be just as fun as well!",6
"amazingly fun game! ive been a fan of the gta series for many years and this one has to be my favorite. the graphics and gameplay is amazing, and with the online mode theres an endless amount of things to do with friends. since the game came out ive only played it. keep up the amazing work rockstar! p.s ty console ppl for beta testing it :p",8
"purchased--- 60gb download -- 2.5 days to download.. doesnt run.. and yes i meet the system requirements to run... 0/10",1
"just beautiful looking! floating glasses in the ammunation store very strange...",2
"social club failed to load due to an incomplete installation. please exit the game and re-install the latest version of the social club. 11/10",3
"the game itself is amazing! it is fun as hell. in terms of performance, it runs like a charm. i heard the 750ti was able to get a 50 to 60fps on high 1080p. the downside are the current drivers : they arent too get yet. it may take another month for amd to release better drivers. performance is good but stuttering and fps drops can occur - they are rare though. there is also an issue with system ram. if you play for about 2 hours, your ram will start to fill up. this maybe a slow memory leak. it sucks for those who have less than 8gb. hell, i have 8gb and this ram issue occurs within 2 to 3 hours of play.",4
"worse game ever!!!! cant  open this sh it. fix it rockstar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",8
"highly suprised gta online is such a good game. graphics look nice, the sound is really emmersive, and most important, tons and tons of different jobs, from arm wrestling to racing with many variations, to bank heists and other sort of jobs, and oh yes, car customization is there, also up to the point where certian things will fit different type of landstyles better then other, character customization that goes pretty deep aswell, and a gigantic open world to explore. god, there is not a single thing i can dislike about gta v, this is just the game i have been waiting for, especially the gta online.",7
"insanely boring just like every other gta game ever made. i know im the minority here, but i cant suggest this to anyone.",1
"yes indeed this game is so goood the 4k display too go to the strip club 70/69 ign rating",4
"fix the issues that thousands of people are having. k thanks bye.",3
"me like very much me special boy me recommend me good game",5
"should have brought a poet.... 10/10 my god its beautiful and beyond expectations.",5
"brought this game yesterday, im sure its a great game but i have been unable to play it. everytime i click on the icon i get a steam installation come up for a few seconds and thats it...nothing, gtav will appear in my processes for a few seconds then disappear. ive tried installing the social centre manually and running as administrator as a recommended fix but this hasnt worked either. not worth the 40 until its working correctly after installation for everyone.",3
"i get 60fps but i need the graphics at very low settings. besides that, no issues, got the driver. yeah get the game.",10
"holy  this game runs smooth and the graphics are amazing!",6
"well.... i cant stand all those fake postive posts. but it is the first day ill give it awhile but, so far only story mode is playable. tried transfering over my online character, i think it might of worked, but it said servers are down. so ill give it awhile. but from hear from friends there crashing everytime on their launcher. so will see. so far ill say this wins a place in the est launch day hall of fame. but lets see, hopefully online will be playable in couple hours.",3
"optimization isnt the best, but it suffices. dont get this expecting to be able to play on low settings with steady 60 though.",7
"not sure if the world simply not existing after an hour of loading, freezing when i go too fast, freezing for no reason and floating cats is my computers fault or rockstar releasing a mess of a game.",2
"runs great on my brand new system with a graphics card that cost more than my first car. have not attempted to install the game on my texas instruments calculator yet, but i assume it will be fine. currently, there is a bug where if you pull out your gun while driving the van during the first jewelry heist, the game crashes to desktop. im currently writing this review blind because after it happened to me, i set my monitor on fire. the official forums for gta5 do not allow cursing. no, seriously, think about that for a second. not one character in this game is even remotely likeable. highly recommend. spoiler: darth vader is lukes father. bruce willis was dead the whole time.",1
"so far, its amazing, there has only been one bug fix update and i am waiting on some more to come out before i give my final opinion. i am currently experiencing big frame drops about every 20 seconds and it gets worse as i play. oh crap, the game just crashed, thats also something to remember. anyways, the game is still gta v but with better graphics and new pc only tools. i do reccomend this game as updates are coming soon to fix the bugs, one at a time.",4
"game caused me frustration. updated gpu drivers, hit cancel, ran driver removal, had to reinstall os due to driver install not canceling and removal corrupting driver. then that night tried a system image restore, next day still not done....reinstalled os. everything updated finally got to play the game after going through the intro sequence 3 times, 10/10 would crash pc again!",7
"like crack , on toast , smothered in honey. omgbbq@wtf .... but yes this game is beautiful for the master race",4
"this game is top-notch. worthy as a succesor and all the hype about it =ddd",4
"well worth the wait, im slightly under minimum specs but it runs just fine~",4
"bought this game for myself and 2 friends. 420/69 i r8 8/8 m8",7
"8/8 would m8 again! gr8 game. pros: no roman! yeah cons: lamar and people on missions/npcs crashing into your brand new car... come on ai!",3
"nowhere near as good as gta iv but still a great game regardless. longer review to come.",6
"never felt this anxious and hyped for a game in a long while and the best of it all is, is that it was worth the wait and the hype is lived up to. i want to thank my mom for giving birth to me to allow me to experience this great game. i want to thank the console peasants for alpha testing it on xbox 360 and ps3 and beta testing it on xbone and ps4. 10/10 would have a sleepless night before a release date again.",3
"the best installation and port to the pc by rockstar games since max payne 3. they have learned from their mistakes and given us something that works great right after launch. the game is highly optimized than its counterparts and offers a lot of choices in terms of graphics settings which will keep the average pc gamer busy. for new players, it is extremely important to go through all the graphics settings as a misconfigured option could ruin the whole experience. otherwise, the game runs very smoothly and the online feature has no flaws. the only downsides in my opinion is the requirement of linking your social club account before you can play, and of course the massive 60gb filesize. but we live in 2015, games are bound to get larger, and hard drives will also get larger as standard. other than that, you are guaranteed to have the time of your life.",3
"lots of crashes poor sli support sub-par optimization very slow load times (with no explination) boots in windowed mode everytime (closed game in full screen) frame rate drops are common on gtx 980 (very high) needs buffering to reach close to perfection",3
"payday 2 + battlefield 3 + need for speed: most wanted (2005) = real life simulator a.k.a. gta v 1337/10",5
"i have been waiting for 2 years and it was really worth it. the graphics are amazing, the game is amazingly optimized for amd and nvidia gpus after the update. my favorite game, love it!",4
"it is not working it is stuck on the social club screen please fix",1
"do not buy this game lucky for me, i pre-ordered it and got a refund quickly. it is a broken mess. this is nothing new for rockstar though.",6
"i just love this game, the heists, the missions.. everything! 10/10 and its running smooth at 60 fps! :) pros: running smooth hours of fun cons: taking a long time to join gta online sometimes.",5
"i finally got to use first person mode and like not even 2 minutes in head on collision with a truck 10/10",8
"performance: 110fps average (dips to 89, spikes to 130) with an i7 4790k and r9 290 single player review: will update after ive finished the story mode. multiplayer: extremely stable, expecially considering that there are so many people in the game right now. i havent boot booted once during my first half hour of gameplay in multiplayer.",3
"brilliant game, graphics are incredible, can run on very high settings! only had a problem trying to play the game at first but sorted it in the end",3
"by far the gta series is one of my favorites game franchises. gta v is the most expansive of all of them. a two year game im already familiar with from the peasant consoles. the pc version is an amazing remaster of the game, with insane graphics, smoothness, and whatnot. with a great story with three protagonists, awesome gameplay, and soundtrack. the online multiplayer is by far the best of the series. at first it is confusing how the lobbies work, but you get used to it. my only con about this game is the, incredibly, lengthy loading screens. but i guess thats what you can expect for a 60gb game.",8
"i havent had any problems but my friend keeps crashing so just a warning to all.",5
"really big improvements over the console version i love it the ultimate gta game!!!",3
"its all around better. everything that gta5 was on the othe platforms its just better for pc enough said",1
"more than a game. a lifestyle. haters gonna hate. woot!",10
"notebook users take note! gta v does not support enduro(amd) or optimus(nvidia). this means that you wont be able to play the game with your dedicated gpus, only your integrated intel gpu will work. if you try to launch the game with your amd or nvidia gpu ill crash right away. looks like r* never heard of gaming notebooks before, maybe they shouldve delayed it a third time... !!!update for nvidia users!!! seems like the issue has been fixed for nvidia users. amd users are currently still unable to run it on their dedicated amd gpu though.",1
"rockstar knows how to make games.. yes r made us wait, and alot but it was worth it. rockstar managed to get gta v to the pc amazingly well. the game is beautiful, smooth and polished beyond any imagination. my pc is not new, i am running the game on i3 2.9ghz (2 cores with ht), gtx 660 (2 gb) and 4 gb of ram (no ssd) and the game runs 90% of the time on 1080p but low(normal) settings around the 40-50 fps. if your pc is above minimum req then you need this game. if your pc is below, there is still a change you can run.. my suggestion? try :) if not now, in the future, you will be able to play (and its a must). 10/10",4
"got my character from ps3 . good old times , got to see my old cars and stuff then gta5 crashes , and aint because of my pc",1
"gta v is finally released on pc, with much improvement from the previous gta iv release. it runs smooth 40-60fps even on my old hd6850. the same reaction when max payne 3 was released, why is this running smoothly on my old graphic card? rockstar has done a really good job on this. but still, 4 months of delay is pretty painful to wait.",5
"havent enjoyed a game this much in a while... you can easily loose track of time when playing this game 10/10",4
"good port. was it worth waiting 2 years, yes. would you play it on console, no. what do you rate, 8/8. easy and smooth",3
"fun as hell, much better than console version! the port has to be one of the best ive ever seen! 10/10 highly recommend!",6
"sold my cs:go knife and bought this, 10/10 would sell again.",6
"just gonna throw this out there you gotta have a pretty beefy comp to run this. but enough about that lets talk about the game. everyone knows its great so that enoguh said. if you played this on the prev gen consoles then i would stay say buy it cause playing it in third person makes it feel like a good game. 10/10 would mass murder again",4
"its a good game but without steam workshop and stability issues i dont think i can bring myself to buy this since i already own it for the 360. thats not to even touch on launch day issues which is totally inexcusable for a game that came out in 2013 and has been waiting this long for a pc release that has been promised for so long.",1
"all i have to say is pc master race! 10/10 for me a good launch and ultra 60fps best ever cant belive i played this on console will never go back to console now after this thank you rockstar even with the delays better then the gta iv launch by far pre-order worth!",2
"10/10 review this is the third time buying this game bought it first on ps3 and 2nd time bought it on ps4 and know bought it on pc! this game is so fun! it was easy to install and has really good graphics! absolutely amazing game and plays even better on pc! #console 60 fps all ultra setting i7 4790k 2k gtx 980s sc 16 gb ram",5
"due to consistent crashes, issues that break the game, horrid rockstar support, and the fact that your entire garage and character can just disappear and rockstar wont say a thing, i would highly reccommend not buying this game until they publically fix these issues.",7
"gtav plays excellently on the pc. the optimization is great, with mid-range computers being able to flawlessly play this game with little hassle. its a game that can be as beautiful as you want it to be, with a plethora of options to tweak. the controls work well with keyboard and controller. the awesome thing is that you can have the keyboard/mouse plugged in as well as a controller, and the game will detect which you are using and adjust the tooltips. the polish on this game is very apparent. the character migration also works well. what im trying to get at is everything about this game is everything from the xbox one/ps4, but better in every way. except helicopter control, which i feel is a little loose and more difficult, but still usable.",1
"its a good game. pc controls are surprisingly not . good old hooker killing fun. 10/10",1
"what is this pisswasser? san andreas and iv was ported from console to pc in ~6 months, this one in 1year and 3 months.. and then you dont provide the dlc from the console versions? way to serve the pc supporters a warm bottle of pisswasser. i cant recall a game thats been this much of a disappointment as this. money down the sewer.",6
"my + & - +great game overall +runs well +-already played through the story multiple times so the story mode is pointless but still fun +-fun but not so fun to play in online if you dont have any friends who own this game (pls add me if you want to play :d) - fov in first person should be higher - little too heavy to run even with some high end pcs overall rating 14/04/2015 : 8/10",2
"the best game ever runs great on launch day!!!!!!!!",2
"game is not launching what can i say more! i havent seen anything like this in my life before! in last 3 days i sent e-mails to both steam and rockstar and non of them have sent me a solution massage yet. f*** the solution, i want to know if they are searching for a solution or not, i want them to just let me know about the process. this is f***ing an inpolite behaviour! this f***ing game is a trash right now do not buy it if you dont want to be cancer. this is a terrible failure for both steam and esspecially rockstar games. from now on, i am not going to buy any rockstar games product before reading commends to see if the game is fully working or not. this bad recomendation will stay here untill they fix the game. thanks for steam and rockstar to ruining my week. f*** you all!",1
"its a huge step up from ps4 and such. the pc version shines with color and view. textures are amplified and crisp and even a low end gpu can handle most tasks. my gtx 780 runs everything maxed out at 60 fps now that is a deal.",1
"i owned gtav for the xbox 360 and waited for the pc release to purchase it on a next gen system. it was well worth the wait. the graphics are simply amazing and first person view completely changes the game for me.",1
"most of my hours are from loading not playing 11/10",4
"game says i dont have directx 10 or 11 adapter or runtimes, which is bs because info provided by dxdiag says im running directx 11. i tried updating my directx but it also says im up to date... i really wanted to play this for pc, but if theres no update or fix for this in a couple weeks, then i guess im gonna blow another $60 so i can actually play it for my ps3.",1
"completely unplayable on my system (amd quad core / nvidia gtx980). crashes constantly and has to be bullied into running full screen. hope they release a major patch for this soon as i really want to play it.",1
"rarely do i purchase games day 1, very very rarely do i purhcase a game 3 times all on day 1 release. i love gtav with an amounting passion that easily surpasses childhoods greatest gaming memories. a great story, that has mounting tension between mission that i have never seen matched in another game. a multiplayer of multiplayer games, with great heist missions console players waited what felt like ages for, and a online freemode that can keep any bored gamer happy for hours on end. i recommend this game blindfolded as to the new additions to the gameplay and visuals. if you have a masterful pc and a 4k monitor, all the better. do yourself a favor, and purchase this game.",4
"theres just as much realism as there is giddy fun, just as much performance and optimization as there is jaw-dropping visual fidelity, and just as many dumb jokes as there are impossibly clever bits of writing. if i went to a fancy restaurant that served video games and ordered the priciest thing on the menu, i imagine this is what theyd roll out.",5
"amazing graphics and game. few bugs on release, benchmark tool not working, fps drops sometimes, especially with lots of grass and trees around. early days, though, id hope these minor issues get fixed but so far 9/10! well worth the wait and effort from rockstar.",1
"love the gme 10/10 but the game is demanding on your graphics card so i would make sure you have a good one to fully enjoy this game !",2
"stole a car as franklin and the radio was on east coast classics 10/10 not racist at all",1
"even though there are some launch problems, i can tell i willbe spending a lot of hours on this game. the video editor is really fun!",1
"for those who have a problem with unpacking. in my case i have a 120 gb ssd... (formatted, no os) that not enough for this game unpacking. first, let it unpack until it pop up and error. then looking for an unpacked file in download folder. select some unpacked files and move it to another drive (in my case im moving sfx folder that worth around 16 gb) when it moved, try unpacking again. it will begin on where your left off. when unpacking finished it will back to 60 something gb. move folder back to common/[game folder]/[wherever it will be in the first place] this will be a little tricky cause it may not in a same position before you move it from download folder. doing file check... let it download if necessary. work and play! : ) *if you have more space please do some backup before, just for sure. for a game and 10 minutes in it... 20/10 : )",9
"as a person who liked ivs driving i am a little dissappointed with this. :( why do cars not flip when rammed? do they have glure on there wheels when braking and turning? also, where is the deformation? rckst* pls apart from that the game looks really really really gud",8
"very long loading times, lot of crahes - no so far.",4
"great game, great song track. almost feels like i made one of the radio stations",3
"awesome game recommend it 10/10 cops shot in the head",2
"i recommend this game but mostly guys cant play. if your pc is fuc*** up like me dont even download it. it will be shame",1
"spent 100 dollars on this game only to realise ive played it before. this is now the third system i have played it on. still boring. wtf is wrong with me. hopefully mods can justify this purchase for me",9
"finally! i got it working but i dont know the problem. i literally did nothing and it started working again.",3
"ive had hours of fun on gta online and it is extermely entertaining to play heists with your friends or just mess around. :d",8
"great game, 10/10 would wait two years again. this game runs mostly off your graphics card ram so if youre wondering how to allocate more to it, you cant.",3
"summary: -game is good fun and in greater quality than ever seen before in a gta game. - steering wheel and flight stick is not supported though which is a shame. - people got problems making their laptop gpu running the game. gta is gta, you run around blow up stuff, doing missions, climbing the ranks and making cash. the game has got crazy characters and during the game you get to play as different characters with different lives. despite this during game they will meet and work together to achieve their goals. when you arent doing missions, there is also tons of activities you can do. my overall impression is that gta 5 is just a little bit different in terms of features, compared to gta 5, but it still feels way more fun and overall higher quality.",5
"5/5 actually properly optimized for pc this time and even has raw input. also the first person mode rocks.",2
"i open the game and social club just says loading, and i had it overnight 12 hours and still loading and mt account does not contain any foreign letters",2
"death of my social life. 10/10 edit: runs absolutely flawlessly on my 960 ftw",1
"this game is very fun, i really cannot be asked to come up with more because id need an eternity.",6
"the game launched hours early in north america (props to that) the game looks just as good as the ps4 version on a medium end pc but still cranks that 60fps out with no trouble gta online worked, had no troubles connecting. no framerate drop joining a full server either. so far, id say this is a great iteration of the game. having played the last and next gen versions, this is clearly the winner.",2
"until they fix the ongoing problem of still a large amount of players that cant even get past the social club this gets a thumbs down. as expected gtav was released to pc with a boat load of bugs just how it was released on ps3 and 360 for the first time. social club support is as horrid as steam support because no one answers your question. i really want to play this damn game but now i have to waittill they fix this game.",1
"now i can get a private dance from a stripper in ultra graphics and 200fps. well done rockstar! #heilgaben",6
"this game is fantastic, but i think everyone already knows that: pros: -great open multiplayer world. -awesome story line (even though i havent gotten far) -game runs very smoothly -good customization -you dont have to go bowling with roman cons: it has a few bugs, like your screen sometimes freezes right after a mission. several of my friends has that bug, but no bif deal. 10/10, its that amazing and totally worth waiting for. thanks for beta-testing it for us, console peasants.",8
"i loved this game on the 360. waited 2 years to get it on the pc and just to be disapointed. keeps telling me its limited to saved acounts and i cant play. please just fix this rediculous problem.",4
"awesome game! been playing gta since san andreas till now :)",8
"i5 750+r7 260x 2gb = very high/high config haha 5 stars!!",9
"ive played the console versions of this game and it is fair to say that this is worth the wait. gameplay was great in both 3rd and 1st person mode (dont recommend first person if you have motion sickness), the cars didnt feel slippery, the campaign feels like sort of episodic (if i spelt that right) and the graphics were impressive. especially on the last gen versions of the game. 10/10 ps. be prepared to run into high level pr*cks going on a rampage in their tank on the online portion of the game",1
"steam cant help this but this is not worth your money, its a garbage game that only runs in safemode with 800-600 and if you have a nice high end pc for some reason the game just doesnt boot at all. it shows u are playing for a few seconds in steam so if you want to show your friends that you only played gta5 a couple of minutes per week cause you are trying to boot the game up this is the game for you. also if you want the real old ugly style gta you can run it in safemode sadly there is no sound. good luck have fun.",8
"cant even start the game without it crashing. if i dont have it as my main window it will run but as soon as i switch to it, crash.",2
"it doesnt take much to know theyve just done it right. well done, rockstar. a true masterpiece that will raise my entertainment yet lower my success rate irl! 42/10 - would definitley destroy all my life oppertunities again.",6
"this game is actually less violent and has less bad drivers than los angeles. perfect casual fun. 10/10 works great for me : i7 3.8 boost, gtx 980m 8gb vram, 256 ssd, 16gb ram...laptop",4
"like the developers said, gta 5 on pc is basically ultimate edition. -beautiful graphics (if you got the right graphics card) -awesome gameplay, even for returning players -first person -rockstar editor mode which allows you to play as multiple characters that were originaly npcs (non playable characters) and you can use rockstar editor mode to, you guessed it, make videos! -online can have 30 players instead of 16 (i think 16?) -character customization for online is much more unique and fun -you may transfer your characters from online if you had older versions of gta 5 -who doesnt want to play gta 5 on their desktop? biggest dissapointment is that you cannot play offline. if you have horrible internet that shuts off ocasionally, do not buy this game. buy better internet first. trust me though, the game is well worth the money, even if you have to spend more on internet and possibly a better graphics card, its a very very good game. and this is coming from somebody who has already played the game for almost 2 years on console. overall, 8.7/10 sucks that you need a pricey graphics card to run on full graphics, and i wish we could play it offline :(",2
"help! i downloaded gta 5, run it, created an account, but i wrote this account of steam already associated with another account by the social klab.pozhaluysta use it to login. but i can not do it !!! i spent 2000 rubles that would buy this game, and so here come? no, i will not leave it so. you can get a refund?",1

"dont buy it yet. too many bugs: crashes infinite loading screen etc. wait till its on sale and has been patched properly.",6
"from the minute i started playing i have not been disappointed. this game, as far as my experience goes, has been full of nothing but elation. this game is nothing but amazing right now. i have experienced no issues so far (do note, i only played up to the first reposession mission and no side questing, your experience may vary) and framerates have been very smooth. the graphics, or should i say the game, is amazing for what i have in terms of hardware (gtx 770 2gb, i7 3770k, 16gb ram) and i recommend it wholeheartedly at this point and time.",7

"rockstar told us the pc-version would be the ultimate version and they were right. i just love this game, the heists, the missions.. everything! 10/10 and its running smooth. :) pros: beautiful graphics and city 3 character switch smooth gameplay hours of fun gta online. cons: rockstar social club integration itself. taking a long time to load sometimes.",4

"game is really amazing. download was bad, tho, but gameplay is amazing. i like story and graphics. music is good, first-person mode, i like it all. but most amazing thing is that i dont need to listen to roman on going bowling. :p",7
"game is very good, sadly i spent many hours trying to fix  for their broken launch where they couldve released it a week or 2 earlier as early access and have most of the negative reviews titled as early access reviews. idiots",7
"i had this game for my xbox 360, and loved it. so naturally i bought it for pc, but realized too late that rockstar are ing idiots and didnt account for people not having amazing computers. the game has no low graphics option, and everytime i try and play it it crashed my computer. not the game, the computer. do not get unless you have a good desktop computer!!! other than that it is an awesome game and i would totally reccomend it.",1
"ive never banked more hours in a video game ever. prior to the pc release, i had invested in both the 360 and xbox one versions and have well over 1,200 hours spread across both platforms. the only negative thus far in this release has been how hard it pushes some pcs. however, this should get fixed, and dont let those negative reviews sway you!",1

"you dont need me to tell you how good this game is, but i can say that the pc version is the best version of the game with its extensive array of settings. fully bindable keys ,ability to have own radio station of your favourite songs and ofcourse the ability to transfer old characters from previous versions 10/10 buy this if you can run it",4
"its a good game, but you pretty much need a really good computer to run it at the moment. cant even get off the launch screen :/. once they fix the bugs it should actually be good.",1

"latest drivers for my video cards, all updates, reboot, etc. crashes on launcher. inexcusable. how does (a) steam even allow the title with so many issues and (b) a product already delayed this much even have such issues? a pc or laptop with multiple graphics cards is not a rarity these days!",2
"crashes every 5 seconds but for the five seconds it dose work it runs smothly so... buy at your own risk",6
"tried all fixes; the game does not start. hardware is over the recommended specifications. the most expensive desktop icon ive ever bought, but at least it comes with a free 61gb of useless data, just in case youre not enticed by the desktop icon alone. edit: completely uninstalling firewall fixed the issue. changed the recommendation to yes, even though this fix shouldnt be necessary to play the game. game itself is 10/10",8
"if youve ever dreamed of going to the movies, and having the movie tell you to press some buttons to get from scene to scene, then gta v will make your dreams come true. 9/10 movie 4/10 gameplay id recommend this game if it was cheaper, but its not worth $60. #buyersremorse",4

"havent had a single problem, everything runs smooth on 8 gb ram, i7 4770k@3.5 ghz and msi r9 280x. the game is well optimized. unfortunately, i can see that there are many people who cant launch this game because of some problems with social club. hope that it can be fixed soon. we know everything else about this game, so ill just make a quick conclusion - like i said, i havent had a single problem, so i definitely recommend this game, especially if you havent already played it on consoles.",4
"i was gonna go and buy clothes and then got killed 13 times constantly by an online player. 10/10",3
"i am unable to play after updating my graphics drivers. i was able to play on the first day i owned this game, but that is it. i keep getting the social club code 16, i have tried everything rockstar suggested and then some. if i cant play, i want my money back. i sent a message to rockstar support, and i have yet to hear back. fun game when iit works.",1

"i dont mind day one problems with games, tbh its expected. but after waiting a year and a half for the pc version to be released and then be out for a week and still not launch is discraseful.",1
"had some problems with the launcher but it now runs smoothly in 60 fps on ultra with no crashes this is what ive waited for",6
"best game ever.................hmmmm.......ya.....",2
"its a great game and it is well optimized for pc. its crashing every hour or so, though. please patch.",5
"the game has a lot of potential, especially the online-mode. however, things wanted by a majority of the gta online community, e.g. more clothing, car customization, more diversity(missions), putting cop cars or any other special vehicles into garages, etc. those simple things could make a lot of people really happy e.g. the roleplay community, but the devs dont seem to care. kinda sad. i cry evry time",6

"the best version of gta optimized for the most versatile platform; the pc. if you have the hardware, it runs beautifully with so many configurable graphics settings.

"friendly for normal pc 10/10 online servers so bad, loading too long, stuck at loading screen. if you want better online try psn or xbox live servers, not pc servers!",5
"ive been waiting for this to come out so long and now im deeply disappointed. cant even launch the game? such a shame on you rockstar. this kind of proves that rockstar has a bad software engineering department. shame...",3
"10/10 a literal masterpiece. you will want 16gb of ram, an ssd, a newer i7, and a video card with minimum 3gb of vram to enjoy this game near max graphics. a masterpiece of video gaming as we know it. nothing else can be said. a masterpiece.",7
"extremely lousy physics and damage mechanics, an ai that apparently uses a brute-force path finding algorithm, unoptimized graphics, unoptimized *whatever* that makes my cpu suck the watts enough to sustain a neighborhood, gliches, weird controls, the most horrible menu ever, lots of bugs, big-launch tragedy... it is a game one simply must play, so yes, i recommend it but be prepared to fight your urges that make you want to run away. pros: gta being gta, first-person view is a hit, story is unchanged which is perfect.",1
"way better than the xbone version, smoother, faster, better.",2
"excellent 10/10 the gfx and gameplay seem much smoother and more detailed",5
"almost impossible for me to say a bad thing about the pc version of gta v. i was worried about buying the game, considering my computer is budget equipment. my main pieces are my evga gtx 750 ti sc, & my amd fx-6100. anyways i bought it, and am very surprised how this game runs on my system. even with all graphics settings maxed, except msaa, & post fx, i still can get 45 fps of course i got the settings lowered to aim for 60. but with the system i got, i cant in anyway say this game runs bad.",9
"simply the best game on this generation. no matter if its on pc or console. its so much fun to play this game, it never gets boring and you can do everything and anything! best gta ever, and probably the best game ever. you just must have it! theres no better time than this to use the word masterwork: rockstar did a colossal job creating a huge, visually stunning world chiseled in its finest details, populated by brilliant characters and with highly spectacular and varied gameplay. the city is spectaular and massive it would take solid days to explore, i just cant stress enough how amazing this game is, five years well spent i say",3
"one of the best pc ports ive seen in a while. great work rockstar! :)",7
"please fix soon only can play for 20 mins then it crashes on me",2
"like the developers said, gta 5 on pc is basically ultimate edition. -beautiful graphics (if you got the right graphics card) -awesome gameplay, even for returning players -first person -rockstar editor mode which allows you to play as multiple characters that were originaly npcs (non playable characters) and you can use rockstar editor mode to, you guessed it, make videos! -online can have 30 players instead of 16 (i think 16?) -character customization for online is much more unique and fun -you may transfer your characters from online if you had older versions of gta 5 -who doesnt want to play gta 5 on their desktop? biggest dissapointment is that you cannot play offline. if you have horrible internet that shuts off ocasionally, do not buy this game. buy better internet first. trust me though, the game is well worth the money, even if you have to spend more on internet and possibly a better graphics card, its a very very good game. and this is coming from somebody who has already played the game for almost 2 years on console. overall, 8.7/10 sucks that you need a pricey graphics card to run on full graphics, and i wish we could play it offline :(",2
"great game with lots to do, lovely graphics however the performance is less than satisfactory. my graphics card is fairly decent and runs everything on high and most things on ultra yet even though the graphics arent better than some games out now, the fps doesnt stay at 60 and theres drops by about 15 frames for no obvious reason. not pleased",2
"this one is up there with the greatest video games i have ever played. there are so many things to do in los santos, and so many ways to do them. every single mechanic in this game is impeccably polished, and feels great. this is the most convincing open world i have ever seen, and really immerses you in a way that no other game has before. the fact that it can run so well on even mid-range hardware blows my mind. this is the one and only game that i would recommend for a $60 price tag - it feels like a steal compared to many other full price games. pick it up as soon as you can, you need to experience it to believe it.",2
"well worth the wait. the graphics are amazing and even on launch day, the game was one of the most stable ive ever played. i have everything on high (2600mb/2000mb vram usage) and i pretty much get a solid 60fps. this game is beautiful and fun. im just sad that san fierro and las venturas arent in it. perhaps well see some dlc or mods.",4
"i have macbook pro with 8gb ram and i can run gta v on very high",8
"i was thinking that you will need to have a better pc , but when i bought it my mind changed. the game requires not too much and not too a lot of your memory and speed etc etc. buy the game you will be very happy , many heists , interseting things.",1
"this game is absolutely incredible. the story mode is just phenomenal for starters, but i dont want to give away any spoilers. after story mode there is still so much to explore. with many different activities and countless hours of things to do, its hard to see you getting bored of this game anytime soon. a+ 5/5 stars",3
"i held out for this game over console because i knew i would get a better experience on pc. i do own xbox 1 and ps4 but sometimes pc is the only way its supposed to be played :). games starts strong with excellent graphics :) only played less than a hour but so far so good . gtx 970 i7 2600k max settings :)",1
"perfect game 10/10 but cant get into online servers on launch.",6
"i know, i know, this was just released today. however, i was hoping that, with the release date being delayed twice, that gta v for pc would run well. but, of course, it didnt with the objects loading alittle too late, lag on a card thats much newer than rockstar gamess pc requirements card (xfx radeon r7 260x 2gb), and that i had to restart my pc when i stopped playing. however, i still recommend this, because i know that these problems will be fixed in a given time. but if you arent itching to play, id wait until a few bug fix updates roll out. if it helps, ive got an amd athlon x4 860k (stock-clocked), xfx radeon r7 260x 2 gb (also stock-clocked), and 8 gb of g.skill ripjaws 1600 mhz ram running windows 8.1.",3

"its gta v. also a good port light on drm compared to gta iv.",7
"you wont need to live anymore after buying this game",4
"i own lots of games. this is by far the best. the introduction amazed me. in fact, i didnt even know it was the introduction it was so great! shoot some peeps, drive in my expensive car, shoot some po-pos, drive over a cliff with my expensive car, shoot some hostages. yay.",2
"10/10 much better than that tiny open world gta iv was. runs smooth like a butter, would play it for many years ahead",4
"this game is worth for the single player only the online its only made to make you want to kill yourself",3
"michael desanta was right about all of us. 11/10 for predicting my life correctly.",7
"this is the first review for me and im sad to say its a bad one. the game looks amazing and seems like it would be fun as hell if i could play it. every time i join a free roam server i get a flood of messages saying that everyone disconnected. its really me disconnecting because of some bug. i opened a support ticket with rockstar and they have not replied. doing some research into this i have found that many people across all platforms are experiencing this. rockstar made a guide to fix the problem which said to forward some ports and disable your firewall among others things. well i tried it, and it did nothing. i really hope they fix this but i doubt they will. because this has been going on for years. i think they are just not worried about the few that are getting this bug because the majority are not. just goes to show how much of a  company they are. do not buy this game until they come out with a patch. or risk wasting 60 ing dollars.",2
"just excellent! i didnt suppose that this game will run on my pc, because it is a normal thing nowadays when minimum requirements for the game are just meaningless - there is a very little chance that it will at least launch. however, i was very impressed when i saw a nice optimization - stable 30-50 fps in fact, that every spec of my pc is just as the same as the minimum requirement (i5-2320 3.0 ghz, gtx 550ti, 4 gb ram). the game itself is the best thing ever done for the whole gaming industry - not more not less. rockstar did its job well. 10/10.",5
"very good port, very good gameplay, online works from day 1. would reccomend highly, rockstar have redeemed themselves.",7
"to be completely honest, i had it on 360. never seen its full potential till now. the graphics and framerate are a giant improvement and im running it at ultra. get this game, even if purely its for the online element, thats all ive done thus far.",2
"great game! works fantastic on my machine at 1080p. (nvidia 780ti)",3
"its finally here and i can say it is well worth the wait, the game looks great and runs very well with max settings. rockstar did a great job on this.",3
"plays beautifully for all of 10 minutes then completely locks up, running on an amd fx-8350 with an asus radeon r9-290 and 16gb radeon memory. computer never breaks a sweat. hits, maybe, 40% cpu at times and 5gb ram. this game will not run for long on an amd based system. however, ive now got it running beautifully on an i7-4770 with a gtx 770. if youre running an amd system, wait for the fix. intel based, you should be playing it now.",1
"i have blazed through the hours playing this thing, since the download finished i have barely spent any time except playing this, 10/10, would continue wasteful cycle for as long as possible",8
"punched a fat black lady in the face no wanted level punched a white lady in the face 1 star 10/10 would be racist again",1
"of all the problems to have, having the game instantly fail to launch is probably one of the worst ones, and i dont know how you couldnt fix it, considering  is something thats happened to various other pc titles. not even mad, just sad at this point.",3
"yeah.its a good game...i5+ gt635m can run this game at medium effect...but too many bugs.bugs.bugs.",5
"hit a bong that made me high for 30 minutes 420/10 smoke w33d everyday",6
"you know i was really excited to finally play this game, even though the release date had been pushed back and pushed back i was really happy to preload it and play. i thought to myself, oh they must just be taking extra time to make sure it all works out! that is great! i am really glad someone cares about us pc gamers! but of course why ever have something good and just work when you release it when you can get someone to pay $60 for something that you know they wont refund because they of course want to actually play the game and just hope maybe someday that they might be able to play. it is really frustrating to me to buy into the hype when it is so obvious that we are just not cared about by big gaming corporations. if you make it work i will of course be happier but it doesnt change the fact that it shouldnt be an issue in the first place.",1
"gta v -the best game of my life! *runs smooth like silk *amazing graphics *fantastic story *very good multiplayer *best ever detailed open world with a lot of activities you really feel like in a real world, los santos! best gaming experience ever! thank you rockstar games for such a good game!",6
"honestly the best version of gta5 so far and ive played on ps3 and ps4 hands down gta5 was meant to be for pc",2
"gta v is an open world game with a beautiful world and trevor. pros amazing graphics. trevor. just trevor cats memoriable protaganists and trevor steam and social club combined. usable in 4k did i mention trevor? cons no low texture quality for rubbish computers hackers in online mode you can run people over and kill them in passive mode. same as explosive barrels final thoughts 11/10 trevor is cool",4
"its good. 10/10 ign would unpack the full game again! dont take this review seriously! i am reinstalling the game again because of that stupid unpack thing.",2
"one of the greatest games in this decades. one of the few games that made me laugh out loud as well.",5
"11/10 for this game the only cons is grand theft loading v",7
"really fun, cost too much but it is gta, better graphics, better dynamics, better everything. the only thingis that you need a good pc. i love it and greatly advice you to get this game.",3
"was doing a heist with friends. two friends start beating up a car, other friend gets pissed and launches a rocket at them and kills them both. mission failed. 10/10 would reccomend.",8

"transfered my character from playstaion 3, logged in to online, died within a minute to someone in a prius flipping me off. 20/10, the 2015 skyrim.",2
"it works great(not while on any heist missions) and is as always a great game......right up until it freezes....and ultimately crashes for me, for some reason these heists end up freezing my game which in turn i alt+tab and see the message gta 5 has crashed message.....i thought maybe lowering the graphics down a bit will help it.....nope.....lowering all graphics to the lowest wont do anything, it continues to freeze up and crash in the end, but this is only on the heist missions, and due to this i am now teamed up with baddies, since i end up leaving during a heist....the game is awesome......but they really need to fix this stuff.....",3
"theres a lot to say about this game.. on pc it is a whole entire new game, its amazing!!!! couple problems i have tho is there seems to be a lot of bugs with the graphics and other people have the same problem but other then that its a amazing game add me on socail club @ xxchaoticrainxx",8
"great game. i can run every setting on medium and i have a decent computer. so you get alot of leeway with your pc requirements. great game much boom much gun...... much muder",2
"so good, i dont think it should have taken this long but it is very good.",3
"wow... what a game. i pre-loaded this sometime over the weekend waiting for 4/14 but was released a bit earlier on the 13th. ive had this game on all the generations, 360, one, and now pc. let me tell you something... i honestly looked at the trailers and pictures for the pc and thought well, this doesnt look that much differnet for such a delay. until i pressed play... (i did have the windows account error - which was an easy fix for me.) the game is just purely stunning and the crisp sounds of engine and rifles. the story line... now that is an amazment that would keep you entertained for days and days! the gta online dlcs; some may be bad but then you have massive ones such as gta online heists which is just spectacular. this game could bring hundreds of hours of fun once you really get into it!",2
"great optimization, runs well even on a budget gaming system and looks awesome.",4
"bman1225s hardships in gta:v so far: - i was checking my phone on a side walk and 2 level 80 guys rolled up on me and killed me - i tried to rob a store on a bike and got hit by another player. i went flying off the mountain and died. 10/10 would get hit by another player again",2
"first person i met poured gasoline on my feet and lit me on fire. 10/10 would make friends again",6
"wtf, i cant ing link my rockstar sc account to windows live account. already 2hrs!",6
"played it on xbox 360 and loved it. have waited a long time for this to arrive on pc and was not disapointed. have a pretty good pc and plays with most settings at max. if you have a nvidia graphics card download the new driver before playing, might be the reason so many people are struggling to get into the game. either that or it is the bug to do with window ids. anyway, i would say go and buy this game if you have about 100+ hours of your life spare... and if you dont, buy it anyway as who needs a life!!",4
"as of now rockstar has kept there promise of great version for pc and even though its insallation process takes a while, its all worth it once you get into this game.. people cant get mad over a install process its just going to take longer as we get into the future (for any game)..",3
"really good game, with my i3-2100 , and gtx 650 ti boost, i can run good with smooth settings high-medium. :)",8
"not even lowest settings are as bad as xbox 360 lol",6
"its just super fun to play this with your friends. i highly recommend it, mostly for gta online.",5

"nice gameplay, i just finish download, play and just try for mission 1 very recommend",1
"little kid simulator scream in chat forcin u to mute vc",5
"how could i possibly give this top one sandbox game a bad comment? definitely awesome! rockstar games postponed this game like three or four times, it might make some people critisize the game itself because of that. i think it totally worth waiting. good graphic optimization and integrated contents, even including the groundbreaking first person camera view, are not something you could see every day on pc games. totally worth trying, dont let the price scare you!",2
"grand theft auto v runs like a champ. looks like a king. plays like a god. worth every penny.",6
"as far as nicknaming the game grand theft auto v pc: loading screen edition this game has some beautiful graphics when running with a gtx 970 4gb card. there are a few bugs here and there but thats expected like one of them mention previously, loading screen. sometimes it gets stuck or takes forever to go away. other than that the game is awesome and is worth the $60 i paid for.",8
"you need a really beef computer. so just go into your local butcher and get about 5 t-bone steaks and throw them on you computer to beef it up because this game is da beef",6
"buy this at your own risk. looks like almost all of the negative reviews are from people who cannot even play the game due to social club errors. im currently still not able to launch the game after hours trying the possible fixes. still no response on this issue from rockstar after more than 1/2 a day. i rarely pre-order and i sure do regret this one.",8
"worth the wait and every penny spent. rockstar nailed it with this pc release!",3
"i love it i love it. this was worth the wait. works great on my fx 6300 with a sapphire vapor-x r9 280x. when the game start i was like damnnn awesome graphics like never before seen. better then the ps4 and xbox one because my brothers have it on those systems. hd quality baby hell ya!!!!",3
"fantasic and emersive game, i just cant stop playing. not encountered any bugs so far, and it runs very smooth on my comp. gtx 770 and an old i5 proc runs it above 60 fps with some settings reduced to high.",5
"opened up the game. started playing. loving the game <3 11/10 best game ever!",2
"so good i own it 3 times...personally, my favourite gta. singleplayer is fantastic, story, mechanics, acting etc. just doesnt fault on any level. not a console port! rockstar have worked hard to make this work on a pc instead of just copy and pasting the game.",2
"i cant seen to get my social club account to log in i have the correct user name and password",2
"becomes a roadkill by insane civilians with panic issues... 10/10 would flip & fly in 1st person again. on serious note i would recommend this game to any gta fan, even on my  as pc i can play it on around 30 fps (isnt much but i can play it!), there are some issues with session disconnect etc but i assume its only during the first few days of launch of servers being overloaded and will be fixed soon as we go on, otherwise i havent encountered any issues yet & would defo recommend it as its nicely optimized for pc.",10
"i can say with certainty that youll never ever finish the pre-allocation, unpacking, decryption and finally play gta online. never. ever.",5
"the pc version is the way this game should be palyed.",6
"took 3 days to install just so i could play as a rich dude, a  looking guy, and a stoner. worth/10",3

"i dont really give a reviews on video games but for gta v i should say something. the graphics are great and most importantly it is on pc .as a pc gamer i had a big trouble playing it on joysticks . anyway more detailed reviews should come from other guys who are good on it . enjoy the game !",8
"i sold my bayonet for $220 from cs go to buy this game. its amazing! 10 chops/10",3
"i really love this game. but it is crashing all the time and the stupid drm is not working consistantlyin china so much for the delays. fix this rockstar and i will recomend this game.",5
"great game, great version for pc everything great, just buy it to ensure we get gta 6 good job rockstar",3
"awesome game. well optimized. a few bugs here and there (specially with some people). for me it worked like a charm, only a bit glitchy in a few missions. overall awesome game, graphics are top notch. everyhing else is like gta v on ps4/xbone, story/online/haist is just an awesome experience. glad to see this game well optimized for pc.",3
"11/10 remove razer cortex aka razer game booster to launch the game",5
"love the game but still having crash issues after 20 mins, still need fix. will ran up once fixed",2
"its like that game that the console pesants were testing for us on  tier gaming platforms 10/10",1
"gta v is a massive improvement both in graphics and gameplay. this game will entertain you for quite a while! i am enjoying every moment of it so far.",1
"not recommended unless you have a good computer. i have a modern laptop, and it runs like s***. other than that tho, the port for pc is amazing. i reccommend this for all you good computered-persons-",1
"im surprised how smothly it runs on my first launch! almost everything on ultra/highest and im getting between 50-60 fps at all times. although im running an sli-setup but still, the game has insane ammount of graphic options making it possible to run on high variety of pcs! definitely worth that price tag!",7
"i played the game for a wile got tired took a nap with the game running. i woke up to a gunfight in the front yard 10/10 would nap again.",5
"overall a pretty good port from console to pc. definitely much better than gta:iv was. graphics are outstanding, online multiplayer is significantly better than gta:iv (no crashes, no major de-syncs, and the map is still mostly functional!). the storyline itself is good too. wide variety of weapons to use, and with customizations for vehicles and weapons, the game is extremely versatile. cant wait for mods!",8
"the game crashes while trying to launch. this problem has been reported by many users now, and its been just a couple of hours since release. i will get the refund and go buy the retail version. what a disaster.",4
"this game is good but not perfect sometimes it will run sometimes it wont even open but it will patch itself up and im looking forward to more rockstar produced games and hope they fix gta 5 online.",3
"simply one of the best grand theft auto games out there. deffinetely better on pc.",6
"you can play this game all day long and wanna live in los f***ing santos * great characters * great gameplay * great story * great job to show respect to older characters from previous games of the series ( except killing them :) * great graphics * great *ng huge open world map * great cars , great tuning * great job rockstar keep em coming give it a try 10/10",2
"its goood the singleplayer is kinda laggy but it aint to bad, its still playable ut there are some moderate bug issues and some lag. its fine though. update: i played about 10 hours of the mode yesterday and today and amloving it besides the lag so far. 9/10 the online isnt broken and its really fun though there is some bugs and lag! 9/10 there is a mjor problem though with slow reactions to the keyboard so be careful but besides that this game is great so far i havent tried heists but im expected to play it in about a week and i have a feeling i will be impressed so far its a 8/10",9
"hands down the best gta title to date. i need not explain more.",5
"never thought i would say this... i think this was worth the 1 1/2 years we waited for. r* you really pulled through on this one. game runs like a dream, looks amazing, and (besides some weird mouse sensitivity issues) has little to no bugs. absolutly worth every penny, even at full price. now if you dont mind, im just going to spend every waking hour i have left in los santos for now...",5
"mmm hoew do you choose a server with more people in it",1
"no matter what i do the game crashes at a certain point in the mission...",3
"i played it before on ps3, and i can see that this is a perfect port on pc. the graphics looks amazing, and the first person too. if you played it before on play station 3 or xbox 360, you have to buy this version.",9
"perhaps this will change by the time someone else reads this, but so far its another one of our favorite let downs of a big title game being broken on release. sure works great for some people, but if youre anything like the rest of us, itll immediately crash on start up, with rockstar doing little to nothing to mention a fix. theyve noted it, but were left with a we are working on a fix which is out of the way, and hard to get to in their website. thats it. the game however, great. awesome, 10/10. atleast it was 2 years ago when i played it on 360, whilst i was waiting for another delay for the pc version. 10/10 rockstar. 10/10.",1
"really well optimized!!! played it on ps3, and now on pc its awesome! running with almost everything on high or very high at 1080p with dx11, it was worth the wait and delays. hardware: i5 2500k @stock 8gb 500gb sata2 (os + games) r9 280 3gb dual-x 900w cm ucp tried running it with my old 5850 1gb toxic, and it run pretty well with everything on low at 1080p with dx10 100% recommended! ps: graphics are ic!",4
"a good first few days... until we get infested with hacks. 10/10, for now.",6
"the game is well optimized and it was was worth waiting for. the director mode is quite fun and is a good reason to buy the game, even if you already bought it before. you can play as characters from the story, pedestrians and even animals. (you can use your online character in single player). play as any character like the republican space ranger and you can enable cheats, making you feel like a superhero. youll be able to make some really creative movies with all the options theyve given you, an improvement over gta 4. theyve also added a custom radio station as well. this is truly the ultimate version of gta 5 and i highly recommend it.",7
"if you are a bullguard ueser then turn off ur self protection . restart the computer and , you may enter come! if it dont work turn off the anti virus, open the game and turn it on after",8
"the fact that you dont have to listen to roman asking you to go bowling every few minutes should already be a good sign. provided that you have a decent enough computer, you should be able to run it quite nicely. when the graphics are turned all the way up the game can really look amazing. the controls can be a little wonky, but youre free to re-bind them to whatever key you want. (caps lock was the characters special ability button which was super annoying to reach) but in terms of how it runs on pc, i havent seen many glitches which is a really nice comparison to their 2008 release of gta iv.",2
"! i bought it for 3 days, and everytime i click the game, it always crashed! i still cant enter the game now! wtf!",3
"edit: patch fixed my launching issue, game runs perfectly now.",6
"all dees es complaining about crashes, i havent crashed once. p.s. if youre playing on mobile architecture, its your own fault that you have to restart your drivers to play. i mean seriously, in mobile architecture.",7
"what can i say , it runs so smooth it plays so damned well on max settings on the gtx titan i did really like the 2715 resolution until the update put its highest res 1920,1080 but other than that 11/10",8
"broken, only managed to play prologue before it refused to load anything at all. biggest waste of money ever.",2
"the attention to detail in this game is mind blowing.",10
"good things: -good optimization, runs on my mid-range pc with high settings -great storyline -fun online mode -friendly people online bad things: -sometimes crashes -long loading screens my pc specifications: processor amd fx(tm)-6300 six-core processor memory (ram) 8.00 gb graphics nvidia geforce gtx 750 ti",4
"run great on my evga gtx x titan with 1920x1080p. it is faboulous game and has a really nice hud interface. just like any modern game would have. graphics are great and the best part is customizing the cars. this game is truely a great game and nothing needs to be added. no bugs or anything yet and still pretty nice for a 2013 game.",2
"most of the textures are terrible, vehicles are way too maneuveric. but still the world is good enough. 2.5/10 textures 7-8/10 gameplay",6
"i love this game. i have played it on ps4, but its whole differrent experience playing on pc at 60fps+. the game very well optimized. i did encounter some problems at the launch though, but i looked it up online and made a new a local account on win 8.1 and boom rock stable. if you have money to buy this game, buy it now!. you wont regret it.",6
"100000000000000000000000000000/10 not much to say here boys!",9
"10/10 hoo boy, where do i begin +pc exclusive features, like director mode, custom radio station etc. +a great game improved even further. greater graphics, people density, gameplay, almost everything improved +great humor +great and fun gameplay +beautiful graphics +its gta v, need i say more? -some bugs and optimization needs to be improved/fixed -missing features from previous games, like no crouching (wtf?)",4
"after u run into 1 0r 2 problems when installing or launching the game it is cray cray in a good way!! :d 10/10 worth it",6
"original thoughts: rubbish, game did not work and crashed before anything even appeared. revised 21/04/15: now, i have the game working, was one file in the game which was causing major issues, but now thats resolved, i can give a real review. and what is it that i am going to say? this game is awesome, and i have to say, its a great port too. with gta iv, i even now see some odd issues, but none of those issues are present in gta v. overall, its great. <3",5
"finally, pc players have a well-optimized next gen gta game. its much more smoother than i expect. also it has better online performance than watchdogs. no major issues for me at release, worth the long wait.",6
"go into game, buy aparptment, take a hit from a bong, half an hour later have a five star wanted level, im just thinking this game is the best high! 420/420 would get high again",4
"from what i experienced in the short time i was actually able to get this game to run(probably around a half hour total), i would rate this game 9/10. unfortunately this launch was a huge disappointment as 95% of the time the game refuses to even run, and the few times it did, crashes resulted randomly or even as a result of clicking on a different window and then clicking back on the game screen. i have opened a ticket with rockstar support and tried all of the fixes they and other people have recommended but nothing has worked. funny how they delayed the release again and again to ensure that the game is as polished as possible, and to make certain that both heists and the gta online experience are ready to roll out on day one for pc. well guess what rockstar? the game doesnt even run for a lot of us. im sure eventually this problem will be fixed on your end and then ill be able to forgive you but until then, i just want to warn anyone whos thinking about spending their hard earned money on this game that there is a significant chance the game wont even run, and so i would recommend waiting until rockstar has fixed this issue.",1
"meth heads banging, dogs having sex, ambulances rushing to a npcs aid only to leave that npc on the road only to be continually run over by othe npcs is only a fraction of what you can find in this game. not only is the main story engaging, but is rife with homages to decades of film and pop culture (including the garbage pop culture, which i love that rockstar does not hold back in making fun of). although i have not touched the online mode or the editor as of yet, i can only imagine at how much more they add to the gta experience. best gta yet, (although i do miss liberty city tunes), and may be the best game of 2015. i know its bene out of consoles for a couple yrs now, but as far as im concerned pc trumps all.",6
"okay, so this being the second time, fully priced, that ive bought this game. i absolutely love it. ive played grand theft auto through its generations as well as my own. from gta 3, to now and everything in between. this game has first person down to a t. ragdoll effects and everything. they implemented a lot of cool new tweeks since ive played it last. graphics look wonderful. love this . anyways, i do commentaries. not just on gta, indie games and other . my gta vids up here.",4
"oh yeah i can do anything i want surpriseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee",8
"now i can go to a stripclub in the age of 16. 10/10",3

"amd fx-8320 ocd 4.1ghz. evga gtx 770 sc ocd 2gb. 8gb gskill sniper ram. everything is maxed out except advanced graphics and msaa off runs 60+fps most of the timed and looks so dam good ty rockstar",4
"this game is really good. first off the game is a little pricy but worth it in the end. runs great at max settings, yes it lags sometimes but other then that props to rockstar games and t2.",6
"i bought an xbox to play gta v before gta v pc came out....  my life game is superb would recommend! 69/10",6
"like gta5 on console, only better and for the pc master race.",2
"rockstar social club application constantly crashes. updated graphics card, verified game cache and ensured no anti-virus software was running. there doesnt seem to be any actions taken by rockstar to fix the issues. im adding rockstar to the list of game companies i will not be buying from again.",2
"overall this game is amazing ofcourse the singleplayer is good. but when it comes to everything else its bad. i dont like how you have to restart the game everytime you change the graphics and get a long intro for the game not even a loading screen when it comes to the multiplayer sometimes when you invite people they cant join because it says its full or something even tho its not and random stupid bugs and glitches like that",7
"port is amazing, lots of graphical custimization to fit your tase for looks anf fps 10/10 best gta on pc",9
"hell, i could be going on a heist with my buddies right now, but im too focused on chasing cats and hitting them. wtf.",2
"amazing game! theres a lot of stuff to do in gta v. the story is interesting, and theres always the online when youre finished with the single player missions.",5
"really like it but i have a few problems - the amount of time it takes to download is way to much and its a bum : the social club screen crashes for me alot and i almost cant play but i really enjoy it its epic, chaotic and i play it in 4k ultra settings and it looks a-m-a-z-i-n-g!!! if you should buy it - yes :d buy it now - no, wait for the server loads to decrease and then wait for a sale ill rate it 9.5/10 because of the a bit anoying launch : enjoy the game :d",1
"great port runs so smoothly on my outdated set up. ignore all the reviews complaining about  on the first day... no game has had a perfect release.",5
"the story is great, the graphics look amazing and the multiplayer is even better. what else do you need from a game?",6
"the best game i could ever ask ! better with friends.....:)",4
"open a day early?  yeah so much fun! but you will need a decently nice pc to be able to run it!",4
"well , lets see. oh yeah wouldnt load. game wont play, whats not to like.",2
"this is 1 of my favourite game ever !! must buy!!!!!!! review : 11 / 10",3
"insanely long load times aside, its a great game. online is fun as hell and the story looks fun.",1
"runs at 60 fps on high settings, no problems encountered so far. rockstar did good with their pc ports this time.",4
"was it worth the wait? yes. is it optimized? yes. are the controls nice? somewhat. grand theft auto v is greatly optimized. i currently have a gtx 660 and an amd fx-4300 at 3.8 ghz. i can play the game at high settings 1080p at 60 fps. thats how good it is. i have yet to figure out self radio, but i will figure that out tomorrow. there were slight multiplayer issues at launch, but thats to be expected. after about an hour they were quickly solved and i had no issues afterwards. all in all, a very solid launch. much better than the 360/ps3 launch, and the ps4/xb1 launch. i played about 3 hours with my friends on multiplayer, doing impromptu races and exploring all the new graphics settings and new items. it was incredibly fun. we have yet to do heists, but i cannot wait! if you liked grand theft auto v on the previous or next gen consoles, i highly recommend the pc version, the ultimate version.",4
"dont buy now. story mode and optimization on pc are fine. online mode is full of bugs and crashes.",7
"rockstar has completely outdone themselves this time around. the game runs great! i get an average of 60 fps on my hd 7850 2gb oc and i7 2600k. the graphics are a huge improvement as well. i was a little worried about purchasing this game, but i am glad that i did. keep it up! :)",4
"the best game i ever played. no words to describe. 10/10",6
"this game is a joke, like first of all the community is really bad, which i can understand that its not rockstars fault that janky  who play the game ruin it... i cant even leave the lobby to play with my friends. it keeps saying i have to do the tutorial... no it wont tell me what it wants from me. this. this.... a waist of 40 quid... thanks!",2
"gta online is frustratingly disappointing. lag ridden, glitchy and overwhelmingly close to unplayable.",3
"omgwhat can i say, deosnt work with my 980,could only play it on my laptop,",4
"sorry i was busy downvoting the zero ratings on metacritic. btw, freaking 99/100 on metacritic, so yeah. so far, incredible. amazing. this runs smoother (and of course looks way better) than gta 4 on my machine. now that is optimization the depth in this environment is something i have never seen in any game ever. have been playing gta since the first one in the 1990s this has been worth the wait.",1
"the game didnt run well on my laptop. i bought this game and i am sure that my computer is good enough to run it, but the game didnt even open successfully. a good game should consider all the conditions that its players may have. hopefully, rockstar can update some patches to fix it;otherwise, this game suck.",1

"i hate this game its too good! i use to have a life but now i dont :-| this game is so good its baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahahahahahahad d-:",6
"i played gta v/online on console and aside from a rocky start with updates and bugs and connectivity issues, the game played great. i loved the easter eggs, i enjoyed the off-line story mode. and the online mode was great, even as a vanilla game with no dlc or updates the game had so much to do: racing, darts, tennis?, golf, parachuting, base jumping, deep sea diving, the list goes on. i felt the graphics for this game were about par as far as gta games go, they slowly keep pace with the times, the graphics werent mind blowing, but they were very decent. as far as support goes, rockstar is currently reviewing a ticket i submitted regarding a few bugs, and things seem to be moving in a positive direction. do not rate games on their glitches and bugs, rate the game. and i give this game a very good rating. now if the bugs and glitches are not fixed, my rating will unfortunately change, as i am rating this game under the assumption that those bugs will be fixed sooner rather than later.",3
"rockstar did a good job, i can run it at 60fps+ even with r9 270x at high settings.",10
"its 3:08 am, launch day and i am finally playing it, guess who is skipping school tomorrow... update: best gta so far!",4
"game is greatly optimized.runs fluently 50-60 fps all the time graphics maxed out. stunning detail the best gta that was ever made. rockstar this time you delivreed what you promised and more. would buy again 10/10",2
"very smooth and beautiful gameplay running 1080p high settings average 60 fps, best port evah",9
"the game itself: obviously, the game is amazing and looks amazing. it has something (or a lot of somethings) for everyone! well worth the wait. how well it runs: the game has been optimized so well that i turned everything to max and have vsync on with the refresh rate set to 60hz, and i still get an average of 119 fps. getting twice what you set the limit at... now that is optimized!* my computer specs: evga x58 classified mobo intel i7 990x ocd @ 4.13ghz evga geforce gtx 760 ftw+ (x3 in sli) 24gb corsair vengeance ddr3 ram corsair 1200i psu *obvious sarcasm towards the game being optimized superbly well and the fact that vsync isnt working as intended, or else itd be an average of 60 fps...",3

"it was a tad buggy at release, but theyve since patched that. connection issues? a vpn can clear those right up. gta5 is one of my top games of all time, but running this on pc full 1080p 60+ fps makes it a truly remarkable experience worth the wait (and loading times). i couldnt recommend this game more for someone who enjoys racers, shooters, massive online rpgs, or any combination. a++ rockstar youve done it again.",5
"tried to help cops who were chasing a suspect, got shot and killed instead.  tha police! still a great game tho. 5 starts out of 5.",9
"lester is the best written character in a video game ive ever seen.",7
"man this game was definitely worth the wait! i very rarely write a review but here goes: first off, i had this on ps3 when it was first released and was appalled by the constant ghosting and bad geometry but seen a lot of potential in terms of graphics so had to wait a while but that wait is finally over! my system specs are: geforce gtx 780 gpu 16gb ram amd fx 8150 eight core processor cpu so can almost have everything maxed out but it looks insane! secondly having my online character saved on the rockstar server from ps3 days is a big help meaning i can start the heist missions straight away which is a big bonus as saves a lot time, plus all the pre order money and the rumours of steam mods coming soon makes me a satisfied customer :-d",2
"can throw sticky bombs and bomb people 10/10 would troll them again and make them salty to put up on you bounty",5
"i really love how i dropped sixty dollars on this game and downloaded the whole 59 gigabytes for days and at the end of the day when i launch this game i have to log in to the ing rockstar social club. yes thats right, you drop cash on this and the entire game is stored locally on your disk and you need to get an authentication from rockstar to launch it. no offline mode. there isnt even a hash of your last log in which would serve as authentication. great game but this ubsurdity ruins it.",1
"10/10 absolutely beautiful. honestly, super optimized. im running on all normal and i have an i5 4210u, 840m, and 8gb of ram. the game size is double so i can see people being angry but what do you expect. i preloaded it but didnt have to decrypt or unpack or anything.",5
"runs smoothly with a gtx 970, unfortunatelly also frequently freeze the whole system, needing a hard reboot. once fixed this will be a terrific game",2
"my anticipations for this game were really high, although they kept delaying it i was still excited to get home and download + play this game however i had day one issues. but this long wait was well worth it. its a great game but sadly not many people have the game :/",2
"totally worth the 1 euro per gb. its what whatsdogs shouldve been,. but better everything feels so right.",3
"very nice game, played it on ps3 and still the same feeling. runs very smoothly, but the only bad thing is: the high cpu usage. i can change everything, but my cpu is always on 100%, still on low settings. and this causes no texture loading while driving, which is very bad.",8
"it seems a bunch of people have issues with getting this game to run. regardless of this my review will not be negative and i will try to help people out in this way: if you are a bullguard user, you might have the problem that your launcher will not start at all! this is what i did to fix this: open up bullguard and go to the general settings under settings. there will be an option there called selfprotection (allow bullguard to protect itself from termination, (or something similar) turn this off and reboot your computer, chances are great your launcher will now start normally! :d now for my actual review: have not played the game much, but i love the gta franchise and even though this game has had its fair share of problems on the pc i am still not gonna be negative about the games. the game looks great and what i have seen from other people playing and what i have played myself the game is loads of fun!! go get it!",3

"the single player works for me but that is not why i purchased this game. i purchased this game with the intention of playing online with my friends. after 2 days of frustration and no help from rockstar, i chose to get a refund through steam. it would never let me play online and would only say cannot initiate communication with rockstar servers. i couldnt find a fix online. maybe they will fix it soon but i expected to be able to play on launch day. not worth my 60$.",3
"although there are few bugs, i enjoy it. i also love how it runs better than iv and san andreas on my crappy old laptop: i7-2670qm, 16gb ddr3 ram, nvidia geforce gt 555m (3gb) i have my settings on medium-high, resolution 1920x1080 and no lag at all, i havent checked but it feels my fps is over 30 all the time. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ im one of those whose game didnt start up, but this fixed it (only for pcs that have multiple cards): ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ i disable my nvidia card in device manager, then click play, (then rockstar club opens), while rockstar club loads, i reactivate my card, launcher will complain that you do not meet requirements but launches the game and works like charm.",6

"game of the year? probably once again..:) btw i recommend to update drivers on your graphic card to avoid fps drops",4
"man this is how the game was meant to be played. also they brought back the dukes and blista if you transfer data from the old consols. also they brought back the dodo...as a muthain sea plane!",3
"this game is a huge upragde of the console version. but it also got a few downsides. pros: faster loading screen better graphics good standard controls millions of hours in playtime until you get tired heists which you can replay races apartments good flying controls almost bug free and i could do this forever.. cons: bad community (shooting everyone) a little harder in heists not really much bad stuff. its worth the 60 euro.. just.. buy it damnit!",7
"while at the time of writing this there is an error which makes it difficult to launch this game with an nvidia graphics cards, i still wholeheartedly recommend it. los santos could not be more beautiful and ornate and, speaking from the experience of having playing the ps4 version extensively, the smooth 60 fps is a magnificent change, and the optimization is perfect(almost worth the 500 day wait.) load times are much better too(although i shouldnt raelly compare a port this great to its console counterparts.) my only gripe about the game itself is a. that they didnt port saved outfits(minor, but noticeable) and b. that the camera in the map creator could use a little work. otherwise, wondeful job, well worth the money.",6

"i love the game. it works not as good as i anticipated but it still runs decently. key word, decently. on occasion i get the kick-in-the-balls fps drop while driving, incredible delayed input. im talking about it takes 7 seconds for a button press to register. but fair n all its a good port. im surprised a gtx260m can put up with the damn thing.",2
"pros: - very fun - very fun online w/ friends - worth money spent cons: - dont play infront of asian parents",3
"joy at last! its finally working, been playing for over an hour and theres been no problems! (touch wood!) before it wouldnt last long enough to finish the first mission. now there seems to be stability. from what i can tell there have been two issue affecting my experience. 1) nvidia experience set all the opimal settings to way over my gfx cards capabilities and instantly put the settings in the red (on the game graphics-in-game-settings had me using over a gig above the spec of my gtx 760 2gb, i7, 16gb while we are at it). 2) downloading the game, i repeatedly found errors in the downloaded file according to steams cache checking utility. even when it was repaired the game would crash. today i finally downloaded it with no errors when checking it prior to installation (this is only time this has happened in over four downloads) and its the first time its run perfectly. after all that trouble i can say that it has been worth the annoyance but i could have done with out it. ok now let the scally waggery commence!",3
"the game is amazing, the optimization is great and over all is just the definitive version of gta v. i have a video of fps with gtx 760 and fx-8320 @ 4.2 if your curious about how it runs on a mid range system.",3
"good game but theres no gfwl so im not sure i can recommend. it really brought the experience together in iv.",7
"one of the best games of all time, with the pc port it deserves. wait for more mods to come out, and this game is easily worth paying $150 for. if you call yourself a gamer, you owe it to yourself to play gta 5. a must buy.",2

"i absolutely loved the game on gaystation 3, the only reason why i bought a gaystation was to play gta v and it was totally worth it (selling it now btw) and now i finally have this masterpiece on my 600 potato. it runs smooth at 30 fps at high and you dont need a 4000 pc to run this like most console peasants like to exeggrate their stuff. anyways, 60 is quit high for a game (imo) so if you can wait to buy this, wait for a sale or something. you really want to play this masterpiece to bad? go ahead and throw 60 at gaben fat  (jk, i love you <3). my overal rating would be 8.5/10 it just lacks some life, i mean, the city is almost empty and there barely isnt any traffic/pedestrians. rockstar should take an example from watch_dogs, the city if full of life!",6
"basically the ultimate edition of gta v runs extremely well, looks fantastic. buy it...you wont regret it :)",1

"not recommended untill this 2 year in development masterpiece works.",3
"on my first day of playing gta v, i realized this game is about freedom to do whatever you want. after completing 1,2 missions, i decided to hit the golf course at about 10:30 pm. a sharp pain in my right eye broke my concentration and ive messed up the shot. alas, when i looked upon the cellphone clock, it was 4:30 am and my eyes were bleeding. but i honestly cant remember when i had so much fun in life, and i have a pretty cool life too, cant complain. the thing is, there is so much to do, so much to see, im guessing its gonna take me 100+ hours to see it all. every ride reveals beautiful, realistic eye candy that just puts a smile. dont believe me? grab a chopper or a plane and gain some altitude, then look down on the city. it feels so alive, every car driving with a purpose, every pedestrian doing his own thing. this is so much more than a video game, its the video game. its a life simulator that it sadly, way more fun than real life. p.s. one of the best optimised games for pc ever. looks and plays wonderful. i have to sleep now, or ill die.",7
"gameplay 10/10 graphics 10/10 ability to link my ifruit on android smartphone app to my pc account and train chomp? 0/10 fix your product before releasing it rockstar. i demand compensation, otherwise great job 10/10. <3<3<3",5

"the game is fun, from what ou can play. the load times are ridiculous. it will take about 5-6 minutes to load from event to event. gta v/0nline is not worth the money atm; maybe in a year, when the game is updated, it will be",2
"very well optimised. but i still pray for animals in online.",7

"so yeah 3 hours into gta v and so far ive stopped a dog ing another dog, got into an argument (caused by myself) and beat him to death, gone broke on hookers and visited a strip club. so far so good 10/10",1
"one of the best pc games ever released. it is just that good.",2
"easily the best entry in the series to date. memorable and interesting characters along with neat new mechanics such as the special abilities and character swapping. as pc ports go, its mostly a top notch job, with a few quirks such as goofy mouse+keyboard controls for a few things. in almost all cases a controller will remain the prefered method of play, at least in single player. gta online tends to require the more precise aim of the mouse. few notes of warning though, the load times can be pretty intense if not running this on an ssd, and there appears to be some sort of memory leak as frame rates will stay 60+ for a few hours, then plummet dramatically.",5
"failed a mission during a benchmark test. 10/10 - will gladly watch benchmark fail future missions too!",2
"must must must must must must must must must must buy! great game overall, i have had no problems starting or launching the game ever. i am not sure why some people are having problems. but if you were like me, and wanted the game but had no money, sell all your csgo skins, trust me its worth it! 10/10 gaben would approve!",4
"i saw a dog humping another dog. i switched to trevor and he immediately gets chased by police. i roadkill pedestrians and the bystanders dont mind at all. i pick up random strangers in very awkward situations. and online, i shot a random person in the head, stole his money and drove away. the game stutters when you play it for a certain amount of time and it still randomly crashes. i hope they fix these lingering issues. but if youre looking for an alternate american playground that reacts to you, then welcome to los santos!",7
"cant even start the damn game. what the hell fix this soon!",1
"ok, first, i have to say: why dont you already have this game? and secondly, if you do own the game and are just reading the reviews for chuckles, hello! the silly review (since this game deserves it): upon playing the first time, i was pulled over by a police officer in the small truck-stop town of paleto bay, while driving a rusty tractor down the interstate. probably for going too slow on my journey back to los santos and holding many a semi truck back. then, while waiting for the officer to come around to me, i see his car and him scooting by, being rammed by a small pickup. the pickup was then blown up by a sniper team in a helicopter, for assaulting an officer. continued to los santos on my tractor without further interruption. the serious review: uhhh... later. ive, uhm, still gotta finish the game. pc forever!",7
"this game looks awesome, unfortunately it arrived too late because when rockstar didnt release this game for pc first and i gave on the pc platform altogether and decided to go back to using the swizel and stone. since rockstar abandoned us pc players for years, i lost all hope on this innovative technology and decided to stick whats been tried and proven. due to the godly graphic requirements of this game i will be forced to upgrade the video card of my swizel and stone so something a bit more new age. thanks rockstar for taking so long to remember about the fans that started it all. next time dont sell out to consoles and maybe i will give my rock 3.1 os and return to the pc platform. until then ill stream this game to my swizel and stone from my sons pc.",2
"this game caused me to buy it 3 times and a brand new 900 pc. 10/10 would do it again.",3
"why its fun: you get to kill things rob things fly things shoot things yell at people do missions rob more things steal cars why it isnt fun: download takes a hella long time",2
"i made a goal of not killing any civilians in public. turns out, i killed 76 civilians. then i drove home and started playing gta v. not a bad game. 11/10 would massacre again",3
"rockstar what the hell? why are there issues with the pc launch of this awesome game? delay after delay............................. now this is inexcusesable on your guys part. fun game but a couple game breaking gliches. wow just wow. f u guys really just f u. this is my last rockstar game i ever purchase. so much for rockstar does not release a bad game. im not bashing the game, the root of the issue is the developer. for anyone out there who wants to get the game, it is badass but be prepared to deal with a couple of really infuriating bugs and a broken laucher. rockstar the more you fight piracy the more of your customers are going to be affected by this dmr crap. the folks who pay get the big ugly stick in the behind with no lube and while the pirates laugh when they get it off the  for free. fix it mofos. good game bad developer i need a beer.",1
"this game is awesome! its pretty much what you want in a gta release... cars, guns, explosions and hilarious voice tracks that you get to hear as you mow down all the pedestrians. good times for the entire family",2
"i tried everything possible to play, even though they released a patch, i still cant ing play it. i keep getting the usual  from the social club (code 16)... r* support has been useless so far. thanks, i mean really ?.. 60 for hours of fun. jai test toute les possibilits afin de jouer, mme aprs le patch, je ne peux toujours pas jouer  ce  de jeu. le social club narrte pas de mafficher la  usuel (code 16). les conseils de la part de r* ont t inutiles jusqu prsent... srieusement... 60 pour a ?",1

"absolutely shatters the standard for open-world gaming, and is the pinnacle of the grand theft auto formula. outrageously entertaining: excellent writing, interesting characters and story, much improved gameplay mechanics, and the sheer amount, detail, and scope of fun, funny, and weird things to do make this game a blast. longtime gta fan or never played one in your life, doesnt matter - if you dont hate fun, you should buy this game. absurdly large number / 10.",3
"so far it seems perfect for me at least ,game is at max settings everything looks amazing and is runing smooth super happy im not sleeping tonight i havent wanted to play a game the way i want to play this one in a while it feels good hope everyone is enjoying it .",9
"60 fps on max setting great preformance overall just had a minor problem when installing the game took about an hour and a half just to install 200 mbs for some reason but nothing too bad and mods are gonna be ing amazing",2
"this game is good graphically, very good visuals even for an older pc like my own. for that reason i will give it a thumbs up. the story is very diversified, lots of different situations arise with generally unique results. however, this series suffers from one drawback, considering i tend to enjoy having choices now; there is a distinct lack of choice in how the story goes. this, in my opinion, lowers the re-playability value of the game. while being a great game visually, not having the amount of room that one had back in gtasa is disappointing, not to mention missing some sort of choice making. but i will admit, thats another publishers tendency and not r*s.",1
"it doesnt work. dont waste your time. dont waste your money.",3
"roman is sad in liberty city. he wants to come and play. 10/10 (no bowling with roman)",5
"totally worth the wait, this game is amazing but still some bugs here and there but its real fun. and glorious 60 fps",5
"crazy fun game. great to play with friends. preordering was definitely a great idea to recieve the extra headstart money wise. very detailed environment and gameplay. amazing physics in game and amazing driving. no need for forza anymore. cons- i wish there werent so many different menus. a lot of loading screens. game will not let you go fullscreen with under 1gb on video card (windowed fullscreen is able to be chosen)",5
"better than ever. looks amazing, and a riot to play.",2
"the game runs fine for me. overall the game is a solid story you should get if you want to see how it plays out. you are given the option to skip quests if you fail them too many times. the only bad thing about this game some systems wont run it or some systems run it at very low settings. people have been vocal about that part. as well as it links your socail club account(online) with whatever email you used to pay for the game. keep that in mind. i like it so far. i would pay for it again. overall good game. should research if you can run it and other stuff to be safe.",7
"chop s another dog and i said: man, that`s a dude, chop. man, you`ll  anything. 10/10",2

"the first thing i thought when i first spawned into the virtual city of los santos? well, i didnt really think anything! this game is so advanced, so detailed, and just so fun that it can last your for months, maybe even years! its basically a life simulator. want to arm wrestle? play tennis? race? rob a store? go mountain biking? i think you get the point. there are so many things about this game- it deserves to be the third most sold game in history! what are you waiting for? get it!",6
"havent seen since a long time such a large game beeing released so smooth in multiplayer. except the namebug. the game is fun and the community isnt that toxic atm and you can have fun with your friends. the best part, all dlc are included and they are not splitting up the community. great game, grate release! setting high standards for other major releases! would buy it again!",5
"most useful aspect of first person: rolling down hills 10/10 would get motion sickness again",7
"worth delay and runs smooth in my wooden pc farewell dota",7

"press v, press v, press v, there we go, shootem with red-dot sight !",2
"this game is absolutely without a doubt amazing on pc. ultra settings above 60 fps at 99,9% of the time. the only thing that feels very weird for me are some of the controls. example: flying. ive never flown in a game with numbers before. but after getting used to it its all good. would recommend.",4
"grand theft auto v is a really fun and great open world sandbox with really nice graphics and city with a good story and online mode its the ultimate version of gta and it runs really good unlike gta iv on the pc was good job rockstar #pc master race",5
"this is an amazing game. why are you even reading reviews for gta v? i mean come on. you already know that this game is amazing. buy it.",3
"the best game for pc right now. so fun if you have friends because online is beast, and if you dont have friends it is still fun to  around by yourself. i have to mention that you dont have to go bowling withh roman anymore so 10/10 stolen cars.",3
"after 2 years of porting to pc, hopefuly its worth the wait.",2

"it seems like a really good port, i havent noticed any bugs while playing the campaign however i have been experiencing long loading screens and a few game crashes once in a while. with that said, i have really enjoyed both the campaign and the multiplayer part, escpecially heists and deathmatch and i would recommend the game to anyone that like the series. as i mentioned there is a few bugs that might occur a few times duing multiplayer but it isnt really enough to be a deal breaker, i assume they will be hot fixed in the future.",5
"its been 6 days since i cannot play due to steam being linked to another rockstar account; support never replied me back so i wasted 49.99$.",1

"no players in session. unable to play gta ol because im the only one in the server.",3
"i actually think this is a good game, unfortunately i cant play it on pc because the launcher keeps crashing rockstar, this is the second time this games launch went to , as thousands of others are having the same error as me. i will remove this review (if thats even possible) once rockstar fixes the damn issue. keep in mind i am writing this review 14 hours and 45 minutes after release",6
"feels like this is the actual 1st release of this game. worth it 100 times over.",6

"some bugs on heist, but gameplay is smooth. sexiest graphics ever.",3
"spine stomped a body builder to death and the rest fled like french people good game",5
"good game, great story and a decent multiplayer. there are plentiful bugs in online (long load times, heists failing to start/end, crashes, social club unable to launch the game, etc.) and there seems to be a problem with performance issues for the 970, 980, and titan x (in blaine county you gain around 30 fps when other cards shine thru, this is unacceptable). if you own these cards, dont buy it or wait till a patch fixes this, if you dont, go ahead and buy it.",6
"2 years worth waiting. still missing one feature though, the metric system...",4
"in this video game, you can sit down on your couch, watch tv and smoke a cheech-and-chong-sized joint. 10/10 would do things in a video game that i already do in real life.",3
"great game, almost perfect port(except by windows account problems, some random fps drop, and alt+tab screwing the game). some missions are boring and lame,and some others are ing impossible(requires you to switch the character every five seconds because the dumb ai cant take the anothers characters to be covered,they simply will run into the firefight and get hit and killed and the mission will fail), but it`s no problem since the game have the skip feature. theres also some glitches that will happen when youre inside the mission(like the target that you need to kill get godmode and resist 11 sniper headshots,when you lose the cops and step on the street they will start to looking for you again even after 5 minutes after the stars got away) the gta online is funny to play even when you arent playing with friends, i dont explored the full experience of gta online but its look great! long story short, you might buy this game,both singleplayer and multiplayer are good. good job rockstar,even with the delayed release, it worth it!",6
"great game! but they have some requirements for the specs that are high. :)",4
"this sucks! please tell me why i have to log in to several sites just to play a game? please tell me why i my cd key wont work after rockstar accepted it as being ok? why doesnt rockstar have a 24 hour phone line? i should have known better than to buy anything from rockstar. never again! it has taken me 1.5 hours to get to this point and i still havent been able to find a simple play button! i paid 60 bucks for a game - where is the play button? i want to play the game! not join a damn club. i dont care about selfies and stupid clubs. i want to play the game. f u rockstar!",3

"game looks great and runs great. i dont know who the main character is...or if there even is one. i started off as some white guy....somewhere along the lines i became black. i fully suspect and look forward to becoming asian but hope driving performance wont degrade. maybe i will even swap gender. gameplay is fun so far. best gta i have played. have not tried online. so far i have learned to steal cars using a tow truck. run over aliens. understand car flight physixs. and am trying to learn my way around the massive map. optimization is amazing. i have 3 1080p monitors and get 60fps on high settings. i was not expecting this at all. single gtx 780.",2

"loyal player of gta series and as a ex console palyer i played gta5 to death but the max payne 3 crew must of been outdated with rockstar saying they ported gta5 to pc with the launch problem list being so long after the 2 delays it took to polish with my specs listed on my profile i get lag spikes when driving even on low settings with the latest drivers meaning the game has issues with some gpus! one of the i need to wait for the next patch games in your steam libary. oh one more thing the dlc favours consoles still with rockstar :l",1

"i pre-ordered it 2 month ago, w8ed this far, and now it just wont run with my nvidia gpu, just the built-in one and believe me it sucks to play on intel gpu. 1/10 until fixed",3
"game is just like the consoles version. i cannot comment on the graphics since the only way i can get it to launch is by turning off my graphics card. the game has numerous issues, inside and outside which is to be expected with any new release....wait! . . . didnt this thing come out 2 years ago? can i recommend buying it at this time? - no, not in the slightest.... i could stomach these issues with a new title, and heck i could even handle a bad port, but not a aaa game thats had this much time to get its act together. you have only a small chance of it even starting or being compatible with your rig... but if you do buy, the forums offer a hundred different things you can try to work around rockstarts/nvidia/windows whoever we are blaming this hour compatability issues. heck you cant even use the ifruit app, its not coded for the pc version yet. but the game reminds you every 5 minutes to download it buying this game now and the only hookers you will be wanting to kill are the people at rockstar that published this fiasco",3
"what a huge piece of wet . after nearly 2 years, i have purchased a game that i cant even play. i click play, and nothing cunting happens. well ing done. all that time spent making sure the game would work, all those delays to make sure that the users will be happy. what a joke. im so happy i payed 45 pounds for this, and used my incredibly slow internet to spend a ing week downloading it. screw you, you sacks of . im pretty sure youre supposed to be able to play games. i feel like i should add that i have tried every possible work around suggested online. nothing works. do not buy this game. update: it has now been almost a week. nothing. not a single piece of information from rockstar on how to make this game work. this is great. i have payed for nothing, and there is nowhere on the internet providing actual answers as to when a fix will be available. just silence. thank you so much rockstar. if you were a person id wish a terminal illness on you. seriously,  you.",1
"love this game, can basically find endless fun just playing in the world let along the story, online, jobs, and editor... i think ill be playing this for a long time.",2
"absolutely amazing. everything is fun from the missions and heists that you do to the fun mini-games that you can play like tennis, darts, parachuting, and racing. what makes this gta stand out most is its brand online gaming mode which enables players to play a wide variety of different game modes and earn levels and money. its an incredibly polished game and a huge leap from gta iv which was also an excellent game. if youre a fan of gta, you must get this. this is the culminating point of fun and the best sand-box game ever developed thus far.",6
"so, i tried to launch this game for 4 hours now but it just keeps loading. i dont think that i payed 60$ for a game that is just loading",1
"every ing time i play this game it just ing crashes. i live in new zealand and i had to pay 90 ing dollars for a game that crashes every 5 minutes. how do you even progess?",2
"its a good game. i play it on my ps3. but pcs version doesnt want to work. an error message comes up before i launch the game saying that social club isnt installed properly (it is though). so ill change this review once it starts working for me. until then the frustration persists.",6
"downloaded it from family share and need a registration code to play 0/10 would not reccommend",1
"first review.. so far ive had no issues cant seem to find out how many fps im getting im sure theres a command im missing somewhere though! games running smooth no lag and the settings are maxed, played the game on ps3, ps4 and now pc and i think pc gives the best experience!",3
"had fun with what little i was able to play the online mode. not going to recommend this game due to its poor support and time wasted by me troubleshooting unknown errors that did not lead to being able to play this game. downloaded the game, was fast 59gigs~. 1 to 1-1/2 hrs tops installed and started the game. no issues at first through the story requirement portion. once i obtained access to online play, the entire game has gone belly up. upon starting the game: 14x its not made it past the loading screens, 10x its crashed mid game, 18x its crashed randomly. ive tried everything from rechecking my drivers are current, automatically manage paging file size adjustment, dx10/dx10.1 toggling msaa, setting all gfx settings to the very lowest, r* create a second user profile with basic characters, restarts, and closing the launcher once the game is open. i run a i3 4630 3.6ghz, 8gb ram, r9 270x... which are all above the mark for running this game. i suggest steering clear overall due to r* poor release of this game.",2
"ing beautiful, great port to pc. could have come here faster, but after playing i cant complain.",3
"its not working. it crashes everytime i launch the game.",2
"i cant play cuz the game start for 5 sec tthen it close and then (gta5 not responding) help meeee",5
"when i first saw that gta v would come to pcs, i was kind of skeptical, but i bought it anyway. turns out the graphics are amazing, i also realized how ugly  my online character was, and the campaign is still just as fun. oh yeah, and i should mention: no 12 year olds!",4
"for some reason i cant even open the game cause the game asks me to log in to my social club account and then to link a social club account which i then did, several times over and over, but the game still asks me the same thing!!! what the hell is wrong with this. i even then tried to link with a new account but the same issue occurred. it seems that what ever i do it wont let me play the damn game! for that reason and that reason only so far since i loved playing the game on x360 i will vote this game a no!!! rockstar fix this!!!",2
"very well optimized. i was playing a game of league of legends aram with my generals and i barely got 60 and that is only a linear game. gta 5 is a huge game and a very beautiful game. as the android leader of best korea. this is a good freedom simulator. because i feel opressed by my countrys dial up internet as it took me 2 weeks to download gta 5. anyway i rate 8/8 cause damn good game.",8
"i have owned this game since it came out for the ps3 and xbox 360 in september of 2013 and then bought it again for the ps4 and xbox one the next year, but out of all the the previous versions of grand theft auto both prequels and previous versions of the game, this one was the topper. relatively stable, more features, 60 fps and just an overall better expierence. if you have a decent machine to run this on, i suggest getting this title not only for the expierence but for the upcoming mods and updates. now there are some issues right now with the title like your installation issues with windows user account, some bugs in game as well as online stability and as far as i know right now to run this game at a full 60 fps with everything on ultra and everything turned up and on, you need something way stronger then a nvidia gtx 660 2gb / amd hd 7870 2gb. im running a asus nvidia gtx 980 4gb and the game uses 3 gb plus of video memory and i dip from 60 fps every now and then and thats with updated drivers. but i still very much recommend the pc version of gta v with the overall improvements plus, and like i said if you have a decent machine its worth a buy.",3
"this game might be a little prettier than it was 2 years ago, but there is nothing new added that makes it worth paying $60 for a 2 year old game. the online portion of the game is still an awful waste of time. not to mention for some reason they never got rid of the boring ifruit app which requires you to feed, water, and walk chop. all in all this game is not worth half of what they are asking.",1
"easy: it was created by rockstar. the graphics are just incredible, im playing it at ultra and looks really amazing so..... buy it right now or i will find you and kick yo  (seriously, it is worth the 49 bucks).",2
"+driving simulator +tennis game -too great not to play",1
"probably the best game of all time. the skyrim version of the real world. looks and feels just like la",2
"played 16 hours of it in the first day it came out. so yeah, i recommend it.",6
"dear r*, you have gave me the great gift of gtav before on my xbox360 and my xbone, now you give me this pc verision. i have never seen such a beautful game before ported over! runs like its on ice and looks like a nexgen game. thank you r* for blessing us with your holyness ps give us red-dead 2 pls",5
"robbed a store, got shot in the back. came back, shot everybody, and then got killed by cops. 10/10 would rob again",3
"this game is more realistic than life. 11/10 would wait 2 years again.",4
"amazing game! couple glitches but it is still the first week. i bet it will be patched",2
"really fun, runs amazing on my pc even when 4 ran like dog",2
"great optimizision very additctive with execellent soundtrack!",3

"fun well rendered game playes better that gta 4 on pc",6
"a masterpiece. i couldnt ask for more after gta4. rockstar is indeed a proper name ;)",3
"my gta v installs, and i log in, looks like it works right? no. it plays the intro (you know, the part with the sirens and rockstar logo) and then it freezes and crashes. not recommended at this point in time.",1
"if you dream of killing innocent civilians, hookers, dealers, and more, then this is the game for you!",6
"this game is so  goood just  wurf wurf buy it now and enjoy for rest of your life",8
"ive waited two years to be skeletor getting lap dances. it was worth it.",7
"woah!! cool graphics, awesome gameplay to summarize best game ever!!",8
"this game is so buggy its not even funny. 1. gta online doesnt work at all. 2. steam still says im playing it an hour after i quit it, and guess what? i cant launch it because its already running 3. rockstar offers no support for any of these issues and neither does valve. 4. so many other people are experiencing these same issues, so dont hate me saying oh your comp must be  im a dumbass",9
"killing hookers, stealing cars and now robbing banks. best day ever",10
"now that they patched it so it launches its nice graphics are  with a gtx5770 though and a penom ii but that thats not their fault.",3
"ing phenominal game definatly woth the $60, bt if it does go on sale do not pass it up! play this game it is, again, phenominal!!!!!!",6
"super awesome! last time i played was on the 360 but this is 200% better. graphics are so good.",2
"does not work with laptops with amd+intel switchable graphics.",1
"i dont even know where to start, this game is a huge improvement from gta iv. there is so much to do in this game that you cant get bored. i was playing on ps3 and ps4 before this, and i can say this is worth the wait. the hype was real before the game was released and still is even after the release. i was waiting for pc version since 2011. if you are a console gamer, there is nothing to argue, you cant beat the pc version, 60fps max graphics no problem on any modern pc. 3 playable characters - michael, franklin and trevor. the idea of 3 playable characters was really smart, i cant imagine gta v without that. i do not want to say anything about the story, play it ! everyone who is reading this - buy the game and support r* !!! if you ever get bored you should try rockstar editor as well as director mode, its hard but worth the while. you cant just explain this game in words. good job rockstar games ! 10/10",8
"thank you console people for beta testing our game! xd",1
"strang...when i transfered my character over from xbox. he had small lines all over him. looked like a human zebra. anyone else having this???",4
"as much as i was hyped to finally be able to play this game on the pc since ive never played it before, i was unfortunately let down from an error that i have spent countless hours on trying to fix with no progress. i have searched countless places with countless way of tryign to deal with the problem of just even trying to load the game once properly. this game shouldnt have been released with such a bad error that isnt fixable, to my knowledge and everyone elses that has come across a similar problem. i still really want to play the game, but after almost a week from the release date and unable to play it after waiting months from buying it, to prelaoding it, and now this, im quite upset. i do hope to play it still, but this just isnt a way to release a game with such a glitch that wont let the customer even play it for a minute.",4
"i was so pissed when r* released the game for console and we still didnt know if it was coming to pc, or when. i have waited so long to play this game. i told myself i wouldnt pay full price because they made us pc gamers wait so long, but i ended up doing just that and you know what? it is worth every penny. what i like about it! (1) the game actually has a fairly interesting story. i find myself not skipping the cut scenes for the most part. (2) being able to switch between characters is really cool. (3) fps!! first person mode is really cool. i like being able to switch when i want (4) graphics. wow! the game looks so pretty on my 5820k/gtx980 combo. (5) smooth. the game feels so smooth at release -unlike watchdogs which is still a buggy mess. (6) the game will still provide hours of entertainment even after you finish it. conclusion. it was worth the wait. but, with all of the money they have made, they better hire some more people so that gta vi gets released on all platforms at the same time, like every other normal company does.",4
"excellent graphics, attention to small details, awesome gameplay, all running optimized as smooth as butter! was worried about gta 4 killing off this great series, but gta v is here now to seriously revive it. still needs a rockstar social account to signup and play, but apart from that slight setup annoyance, well worth it.",1
"you know how it says ive played 2 hours of this game well i havnt. just trying over and over again to launch the game, i bet the game is really good and i hope a update comes out soon that will let me play and if one does i will play for a real 2 hours then give it a true review. but until that time comes it will always be my 60$ copy of game launching simulator 2015. 10/10 would excessively launch again",1
"if you cant get this game to run do us a solid and just walk into lake michigan. game is great buy it.",4
"superbly optimized for pc. its an awesome game, looks beautiful and contains a strip club 10/10 rip roman",7
"i played the game for a while now, both online and single player and as a guy who completed the game several times on ps3 its still incredibly fun to play with all the additions and improvements. the game is extremely well optimized unlike gta iv.",6
"if i had to choose beetwin this game and my mother id choose this game edit: im orphan now.",4
"a day in the life of gta:online: 1. rob convenience store. 2. clerk pulls a gun and gets shot for his trouble. 3. lspd goes full dorner on me and i have to flee. 4. escape via submarine with the $1500 i got from the heist. 5. contemplate the meaning of it all while on the bottom of the sea. solid port and it runs amazingly well. remapping controls can be a bit daunting at first, but you only need to do it once. this is, without a doubt, the definitive version.",4
"great ing game even on low settings. 10/10 can allahu akbar my friends all day long.",5
"i waited 18 months to play this on my rig and boy was it worth it!!! its perhaps one of the most technological marvels ive ever seen in a game!! its beautiful, hilarious and it is jaw dropping awesome in nvidia 3d!!! 3d is the only way to play this bad boy!! makes it a whole new game...and that game is a masterpiece!!! 10/10 drink sprunk and dock with buddies!!!",6
"loaded up the game onto multiplayer, loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded, found a lobby with friends, drove around with them doing all the shenanigans most players get up to on gta, then everyone left the lobby. i was then disconnected and sent to single player where i got to then listen to michaels persaonl life problems. pause. go to gta online, loading, loading, loading. rince repeat. i think the game will be fun once rockstar fixes these server issues a select number of us have to endure. but till then i wouldnt recommend the game for multiplayer.",5
"ive been playing this on console since its release back in september of 13. still fun to play and i still have not seen all there is to see. i learn new things about the game all the time. oh man the 60fps is amazing coming from a regular 30.",5
"+fun +trevor +humor +dialogue +weapons +many ways to die +customizing cars +flying helicopters +use taxi if the mission is far +running people over -hospital fee -soundtrack is horrible (use your own music only) -textures -price -cars turning into my lane -flying planes is still  -scripted intersections and events -needs 8+ gb of vram for ultra and still looks like",5

"ok i can play the game, so that is good, but there are alot of graphical errors. i.e buildings disapering. i have a gtx 970 4gb card so dont tell me i cant hande this game. i will change review once the problem is fixed",6
"this game is in full color. im not even kidding, not just the base colors but every combination of color you would expect. were talking everything from dark slate gray to hot pink folks. as if color wasnt enough, these geniuses found a way to include sound, like a lot of sounds. ever wanted to hear a footstep? the sound of glass bottle nudged by someone walking by? now you can hear it all! color and sound, this would be enough to make any game a winner but they didnt stop there. this game uses the alphabet and numbers. thats right, every letter your used to seeing in upper and lower case, numbers, and even punctuation. the amount of type in this game is stunning and youll spend all day reading to your hearts content. i think its pretty clear that we have the building blocks for an amazing game here so expect to be blown away by the experience.",4
"shiit just got real awesomemest game so far by rockstar lol !!!!!!!!",3
"amazing game! tons of activities to do and great storyline, they just need to fix the glitches of the online version.",7
"i laugh at the people talking about the console. they took nearly what, 2 years to port it? and it was because of difficulties so they had to redo alot of things and yada yada. not to mention it was good on xbox 360, xbox one, and is still good on the pc. i will say this, if you played it on the others, its still the same, minus first person (unless you played new gens), and then the graphics of course. gta5: 10/10 gtao: 8/10 (lowered rating due to none stop trollish community in gtao)",1
"the only two things that i do not like are the online waiting times and the steering when using a keyboard which is too sensitive. this game is better with a controller, but again i play on pc for the keyboard, not the graphics.",4
"game stopped working.. cant login. utter bs launch.",2
"rockstar did a great job, i wouldnt even call this a port from consoles. just an entirely new version of the game. i am able to run it with a 3770k + gtx780 at 4k and get ~50-60fps maxed out, i enabled sli for my second gtx 780 and i am running at over 100fps (90-144) with both cards. the first person mode + drunk is amazing when driving because you actually get the holy  im about to  up moment. but overall, i have only crashed one time due to driver issues, but so far so good. r* is one of the few game developers who still actually give a crap about pc and the optimization in this game running at 4k is amazing. all other game developers should feel shamed.",3
"awesome game. the wait was totally worth. ive played 45hrs by now (15hrs of them online) and just finished the main storyline. while i also made some sidemissions im at approx 65% progress of the singpleplayer after already playing 30hrs of sp mode. that alone was worth the price.",8
"always good as it is for gta franchise, even though still found some glitch <gta online>, stuting and lagging <both gta v and gta online>. hopefully rockstar will look at it soon. still good for me.",4
"buggy as all . couldnt play until a day later had to redownload after the user error. in game  is 2buggy4me. r* update pls.",1
"it took me a while to get it to work, but once it started working it was ing amazing!",5
"i have a few problems with this game... story- great storyline, no problems in my eyes. i love it. online- also great, if thats what your into. graphics- looks awesome, but shouldnt be as system straining as it is, considering what small porting of the map youre rendering at a time. i have an /okay/ build and get on average 30fps the in game chat is very confusing (also the bound key is poop but you can change it ofc) but you can never tell who is speaking! there is no on screen text telling you who is talking, leading to a lot of confusion and half the time in game, you cant see the persons name over their character. making friends when you dont know who youre talking to is quite difficult. now for the big one. half the damn userbase cant start the game, and rockstar is ignoring the issue. i bought the game just so i could play with my friends, and they cant even get to the splash screen. at the moment, do not buy this game.",6
"i have been playing the xbox 360 version for over year and have been patient enough to wait for this game to come to pc (completely bypassing the next gen consoles). always love pc gaming and it is hard not to see why. the pc version of gta v is a master piece of open world free to do as you please with some stunning graphics. currently playing with the recommended graphics card gtx 660ti amp edition and i can run most the display setting high. cant wait to test it out with titan x when it arrives. this game has surpassed its predecessors and hope rockstar continues to keep up the good work regarding hackers in the online community, that completely ruined gta iv. i am disappointed when i still have to return to the xbox 360 and play with friends who have yet to experience the true taste of real gaming at its best. well done, nice port.",2
"crash after crash after crash after crash and you all know how the rest goes ;-)",2
"has some optimization issues, and problems with the refresh rate, but overall good port. if you are experiencing frame rates and hitches, and are using a nvidia card. downgrade to the previous driver, and it should work much better.",7

"i saw a cat and was like whoa a cat then my inner cynic took over and went ahh its just part of the scenery, you cant interact with it so i ran over and kicked it. it fell over twitching helplessly. 10/10 would give cat internal bleeding again.",3
"i have been waiting for this game forever! and i cant even play for 10 minutes without it randomly crashing its unplayable!",6
"after almost 2 years finally comes to pc. huge open world filled with brutality and prostitution with amazing story and awesome soundtrack this is grand theft auto v. single player is ok but best thing is online! online will give you a lot of fun especially if you play with your friends. race, deathmatch, survival, capture you can do a lot in online but for my best thing is heists. the heists to need communication and cooperation with your friends. your team can die only one time so you must concentrate and have some skill. i like this style of playing. this game is also well optimized. i would recommend this game for all. 10/10* ____________________________________________________ delay simulator!",8
"runs maxed out and very smooth. visuals make consoles seem like gameboys.. 10/10",5
"great port to the pc unlike its predecessor gta iv no bugs or glitches present although it is quite cpu heavy i recommend a 4ghz oc cpu cos thats what ive got and i run at constant 60fps on the highest settings",3
"so i havent played any gta since gta 2 (1997), and that has been one of my favorite games from my teenage years. i skipped gta 3 and 4 mainly because i didnt care for the change from 2d top down to 3d third person. however seeing the total biscuit review for the game convinced me to give this game a try. honestly, im blown away in regards to how good this game actually is. the attention to detail and the grand scale of the world is really amazing. i have only a few hours in so far, but i am completely sold by how good the game actually is, and look forward to playing it for many hours more.",1
"finally on pc (waited for years) welp, before it was announce to be sell on steam i cant wait so i buy ps4 what do i expect for pc? 1.kids screaming 2.racist people 3.lobby wars 4.trolling everywhere 5.hacker 6.scammer 7.noobs this is what i met on ps4 do you think it will happen on pc? who knows?

"delay simulator coming 2014....erm 15 10/10 would delay again",3
"i personally do not feel comfortable playing this game. this is the only instance where i can say that of any game. using the microphone to hold up stores and other activities just strikes a to real note with me, yes it is optional to use it but speeds up the process if you do. language that reflects real life, and other things that sit to close to reality just make this uncomfortable to play. a lot of effort went into making this game but i am sad that pre-purchasing the game was my biggest mistake, i should have let gameplay video and solid reviews be formed before purchase.",1
"piece of crap. does not download properly, does not sign into social club at all. i have wasted two complete nights trying to get it work and when it finally did, the game crashed. thanks for the great support and the ripoff. actually sorry, i am getting my refund right now",2

"iv played both console and pc now and i have to say im loving the pc version. faster game lobby load times. fast overall load times thus far. - (i know some people have had issues with this, however the unfortanate side is not everyone has an up to date system). the level of extended graphical detail options are amazing, especially at 60fps+ i would like to see a fov setting for first person (without looking to mods) no issues with online free mode disconecting every so often like i had happen on console. so far an amazing product. really enjoying it. thanks rockstar!",5

"im very pleased with the port of this game, it runs well even on my -tier cpu. (fx-4100) the textures look great compared to the previous version i played on the last-generation consoles, even on the normal setting. the game has a very useful video memory gauge like the other rockstar ports which makes tweaking the options a cinch. i had no trouble transferring over my gta online character from the ps3 version, and the online so far hasnt given me any trouble in terms of connectivity. i did have some trouble with what seemed like mouse acceleration, and i was unable to find an option to disable it. but after changing from raw input to directinput it seems to be much better. all in all, id say it was worth the wait.",5
"just like the realese on xbox360 and p3, absolute sh*t. i cant even launch the game, on steam it sayes that im playing it but nothing opens. and all the fixes doesnt help sh*t. you would think that after 1 or 2 years (who counts anymore) that rockstar would have ironed out all the bugs and glitches, but the havent. gg rockstar #pleaserealeseunbrokengamesnexttime.",1

"gta v finally made its way to pc if you are lucky enough your copy will have downloaded and played fine on the first day which is something pc hasnt gotten much of in recent years (cough cough watch_dogs & ac unity). i am also very pleased as i can actually run this game (on the lowest settings, which just looks like xbox360 version) on my potato of a laptop with the following specs. amd a6-5350m (dual core 2.9ghz turbo to 3.5ghz) apu with radeon(tm) hd graphics 8gb ram amd radeon hd 8450g - about 750mb graphics win 7 i also have a desktop with much better specs which will look much nicer but the fact that my potato laptop cant run it is definitely awesome and last of all, its gta of cource it is gunna be a sick  game, good job rockstar",6
"i love this game.there are way too many things that are great about it to even know where to begin. but just to start there was obviously a huge amount of time and thought that went into this the open world is not only vast with tons of things to explore but its also well thought out and interesting not just huge and the graphics of this game are incredible and the physics....well let me finish by saying if i could only buy a single game this year it would have to be this one.....enjoy!!!",3
"a very good game the best i played ever fun interesting looks great .",4
"i love this game but fix the dam launcher because i hade to a lot of  to get the game to work 7.5/10",3
"here is a list of reasons why this game is 11/10 1.amazing port 2.didnt crash at launch 3.didnt make me cry cause the game was broken 4.looks ing beautiful! 5.just an all around amazing ing game",6
"its a gta game, nothing much to say its amazing i love it but you cant play offline at all with is f ucking stupid cause where i live we get a lot of storms and i lose the internet, so it sucks when i want to play story mode and i cant cause i need the internet for some reason",10
"tons of content in this game. you could spend hours of time exploring the detailed los santos or you could invest in the fully functional mini games. you could even (once again) spend hours just watching (very funny) tv stations. the campaign is excellent with only a few bad missions. i played this back on the ps3 and recall it taking me more than 40 hours just to do the main missions. a very cynical parody/exaggeration of modern life and culture. taking the game literally you will easily get offended, but the game essentially channels the style of a tarantino film. if you have played the game before then you know it is worth replaying. never played? this game comes with my full recommendation.",3
"spent two hours waiting for this be unpacked, while sitting on the hype train, after spending two years waiting for it to be realized. launched the game had to make a social club, the servers were dying because rockstar could not comphrend the superior power of the master race, finally got to get into the actual game, pfft game auto set to 800x600 for the console peasants alright, spend twenty minutes changing graphics to the optimal master race specs. game looks great runs smooth. played through the intro nice, decided to try to play online, again rockstar didnt count the number of slaves from gta iv online was down. so, whatever game looks nice might as well play the campaign. two hours later, try to play online again it actually worked, but glitchy as the console. 100-200 cars but only in the color black. shoot a car until it explodes. car hell. steal a viper from some kid, sell it go to bed. spent the entire launch night wandering around waiting and making mass suicide runs while in skype call with five other master race  riding the hype train all night.",5
"litearally the most un-stable and unrealiable and slowest and buggiest not to mention easy to hack game out there for online, rockstar servers constantly dcing people without reason, getting stuck on getting into every car for 10-30seconds people accessing your vehicles set for no-one to use did i forget to mention the 5min loading screens? if you take all of that out its a good game, but reallyrockstar havent even hinted at fixing any of these issues, ive seen atleast 1 hacker a day for the last 6 days, its  game now but when they fix it i reckon it will be 100% not 40%",10
"once you get past the r* social club , its a pretty enjoyable game.",7
"sky simulator 2015. 11/10. love this game tho, the port is incredible, few crashes here and there, some server lag, but yeah, amazing game, get it! :)",10
"this game is well optimized, compared to most other aaa titles. its a bit of a  that you need to use social club but i havent had issues. i love the video editor its alot of fun and i can see the internet exploding with gta movies in the coming months. this is escapism at its best, no other game pulls you into its world quite like gta can. if you already own this game on 360/ps3 then i would wait for the price to come down, it looks like a new game but at the end of the day its the same game with the same missions. port quality: 8/10 game quality:10/10",4
"so was the pc version worth a buy...so far i bought a pad, i got stoned, and drunk, also looked in a few peoples backyards with a telescpoe i dont need!! this games still a 10 outta 10 and probly best copy yet, which i can only compare to ps3 and ps4!!",7
"well...there goes my social life, at least i still have social club 11/10 would wait 2 years again.",8
"smoked reefer, shot up aliens, watched dogs bangs, watched humans bang. i want to bang too 10/10",1
"the game is well optimised. heists are really fun! the story is polished. 0/10 - the game doesnt work.",4
"passed 5 hours and i still had 66 hours on record helluva game",9
"story 10/10 gameplay 10/10 onile 8/10 fix online plz rockstar<3",7
"do you see that? two hours. i didnt play those two hours. i tried to fix the ing mess that rockstar social club made. i cant even enjoy an offline session because of the  drm. you done ed it up",3
"nice touch for fun gaming, gta v online, heist, etc like every single roleplay",7
"joined server went 2 friends house drank wiskey blue screened 69/10 would drink wiskey again",2
"my freinds ask me to come with them durring online play. im stuck in the stripclub looking at the high def boobs. gotta love thoes strippers",4
"after a long much awaited delay... i cant say that im in any way dissapointed. this game is all that i would hoped it would be, it runs on lower end pcs as well as looking great on high end pcs. its a all around good purchase for everybody around the pc gaming community. i am so glad that rockstar stepped up to the plate and made this game live up to the hype aside from some early download issues which are to be expected with the amount of people hitting their servers at one time. all around i can say that this game is completely worth full price(at least for a pc only gamer) and it wont dissapoint!",3
"havent done jack  in this game... even though it says ive played it for .3 hours... why? because i dont know how rockstars account linking or password reset works... getting really damn irritated i honestly dont know if id reccomend this game.",7
"running with a 970, this game runs pretty great. even with that bs 500mb ram portion. now, it is still gta 5. if you played it before, its about the same. no real new things to be too amazed about, aside from the graphics. this game alone will make you feel you want a titan x with a 4k monitor just to truly feel how amazing this game looks and feels.",2
"this game is amazing. the graphics are beutiful and the game mechanics run smoothly. defintely well worth what i paid for it. i recomend this game to anyone who anyone who enjoys robbery games such as payday 2.",3
"i have a beast of a pc. 10k score on 3d mark. this game is unplayable even in the lowest graphics settings. something is just wrong with it, even after the recent patches.",2
"epic game, i dont know why some are crying about the rs social club, it is not that annoying. the game itself is insanely good except you get some weird random russian dude online who randomly shouts give me da money",2
"i played this for 30+ hours in a row, slept, continued for another dozen plus. help.",8
"i played a heist with my friend and he died at the very end making us restart it all 12/9 meth addict rednecks",4
"my team gets mad at me when i kill myself at the end of heists 10/10",3
"really fun game, but with my spec, core i5, geforce gt 750m and 8gb ram you might not enjoy the game so well. still, better than others tho",4
"got the game to launch went into first person started a fightclub got called a ucker 10/10 ign",7

"this game is very crazy, best expectations of the year, without doubt the best of steam !!",4
"love this game since it was released on ps3 its like san andreas but more graphical",5
"i shot a.... stop reading go buy this and praise your lord gaben.",5
"running on a gtx 550 ti. looks pretty great, no lag till 5 hours straight of gameplay. aside from that the game is ing perfect.",5
"warning: for those with motion sickness issues. the game looks great! wish i could play it. seems like fun. i bought it .. played it for 30 mins or so.. got back motion sickness when when driving around. the way they did the camera work didnt agree with me. i turned off head-bopping in the menu, tried a bunch of other stuff. but it was still bad. i was able to get my purchase refunded from my account settings.",1
"runs very smooth :) servers are running very decent considering it launched 2 days ago. didnt expect it to be so vram hungry on high and very high settings. after waiting for so long the r* actually delivered and except few issues (not for everybody) the game is amazing :) goty right here right now for me !",5
"gta v finally arrives on pc and im happy to say that rockstar has done an amazing job with the port. the game runs and looks great and is the definitive version. also included in the pc version is the video editor which i can already foresee taking hours and hours of my time.",6
"huge disappointment. out of all the delays with heist and the polishing of gta v pc just to have some simple login error be the cause of not being able to play a game because of a character in your name is pretty pathetic. i payed 50$ for what? to get a message that says socialblade crash... its fine ill just unlink my steam account... oh wait! you cant! lol absolute trash. way to go rockstar. way to screw your loyal fans who spend their hard earned money on something they cant even play. kudos.",1
"the latest update completley broke my game, i have a 290x and a i5 3570k and on my old settings or even the lowest settings, i cant hold 60fps anymore, the amount of pop in freezing and stutter made me ill. i have had buildings and roads vanish right in front of me then re appear, and when that happens my framerate tanks to ~20fps. its an amazing game pre update, my favorite pc game in a loooong time, but after this update its unplayable",9
"the console beta tests were really worth it! 10/2 - f**king get this now you skrab",6
"the game is great. nothing else can really be said about that. but rockstar done messed up. after 3 delays, the game cant be told apart from the current gen consoles (excluding framerate), which is a massive dissapointment. if you bought the game on ps3/xbox 360 and like gta alot and want a better experience, buy this when it gets a discount. if you bought it on ps3 and upgraded to ps4, there simply isnt enough content for the large price tag and i would stay clear until you can get a massive discount. however if you havent ever experienced gta 5 yet, this should absolutely be a must buy, dont hesitate and just get it. now.",7
"crashes very often, many graphical glitches, unplayable as of this review. tech support blames microsoft.",1
"absolutely beautiful but the framerate drop and stutter s the whole game up. i5 4690k oc 4.6 gtx 970 oc",3
"i skipped class to play this game..... still dosnt work been trying every trouble shoot for 4 hours and still no solution.. i crash right when im in launcher and i have a more then capable pc...... thanks rockstar even battlefield 4s launch didnt have as many bugs as this!",6
"wonderful game i dont have the right requirements but it works smooth",4
"not only is the storyline immensely intriguing and immersive, but it is fairly long as well. the missions are comical, alluring, and ing fun. the game also has great replay ability. simply put, the game is worth the $59.99, and is a must-have, especially when it goes on sale for summer.",9
"glorious pc master edition. 11/10. grand theft unpacker",3
"this game is fun a little hard to get fa,ilar to the controlls",1
"got in game, got spawn  online. 10/10 would play again.",1
"loads of crashing whenever playing online, like loads of other players. guess the delays were for nothing.",7

"one does not know true pain until theyve downloaded gta v at 600kb/s. 10/10 would download ag... nvm i wouldnt",7
"just when i was about to refund it, they took that option away pretty nice computer stress test",3
"+ im surprised how well this game runs on very high settings, single player and multiplayer. (gtx 670 overclocked) + lots of graphic setting options. + new soundtrack + hasnt crashed once + day one multiplayer is working + first person view is great - flying controls are little weird (maybe because i havent played gta on pc before)",2
"loading simulator 2015. probably a good game but bad launch.",1
"praise gaben it is here 2 years of waiting and it was worth it 10/10 pc master race confirmed",5
"to describe gta 5 (online) in short would be; the combination of games including payday, need for speed, the crew with the original gta elements that was in the previous installments. there is a wide variety of things to do from racing to missions to death matches. golf, tennis ... darts. content updates being free makes it more desirable, although faced with some issues right now, (server overload, disconnects). gta 5 online is worth a shot if you got friends, if your a loner then play single player. get a crew going, run some heists, buy a car, mod it, race and impress dem hunnies or get the booty at the strip club and/or random chicks walking on the streets.",4
"this game is a beautifle, interactive, masterpiece that is packed with things to do. it is excellently optimised for pc and there arent many things that are negative to say about this game. rockstar has truely poured its heart and soul into this game and i look forward to the games they make in future untill then though i shall be exploring all the things to do in los santos and san andreas doing missions, races, deathmatches, and hiests with my friends, playing the amazing story with even more things to do, and creating my own missions with the rockstar creater and to top that all off with free dlc and more to come a true 11 out of 10.",4
"review eta: 04/14/2017, dont worry, ill delay it an additional three times.",5
"im on a desktop with a gtx 980, i have updated all my drivers, i dont have any anti-virus program installed, my username consists of characters that theyve said are supported ( i even tried making a new one ), ive tried so many things to get it working, ive contacted rockstar support with no response in the past 48 hours, and i still cant get the games launcher to run. ive never had problems like this with any other game on my desktop.",3
"great on pc love the first person and everything looks great. but still there are too many trolls online and makes it impossible to exactually complete any missions to make any money plus when u lose a mission that i need to pay $40k to start because of trolls makes it not so fun. need people u know who wont troll in order to play online :( so game play is a 10/10. missions online i give a 1/10 because of trolls",2
"controls,  interface, if you fail at an objective the game goes out of its way to start you at the othe end of the city. even the best vehicles control like they were built by a factory of inbreds imported from the stone age. frequent lag spikes whenver someone joins or leaves while you sit there wondering why you give a  when they arent on your friends list. if you want to sit for a round of move you fker!, oh my god just fking turn already and why would that even cause any lag, what the f? then this game is for you. if you dont want to scalp yourself to relieve the rage that will build up when a random lag spike causes you to drift off the side of a bridge then play something else.",1
"+ well optimized + fun as  + long story line + even more fun with friends + hilarious at times - incredible amount of bugs within gta online - occasional slow texture rendering - no bowling",5
"waited over one year for this game, finally. 11/10 would wait again...not.  you guys for taking this long.",2
"just wow... fps view is so seemless and the game is just amazing! great port, no hick ups while using crossfire. getting steady frames. worth all of the waiting i had to suffer =p. very polished, very fun, worth every penny. 2 thumbs freaking up!",10
"waited for 14 april, and started the game, since then i have not stepped out of my house. still playing. 10/10",9
"though i installed the lasted patch for this game, the frame drops and texture missing issues still exists. rockstar must work on to fix the issue.",2
"a social club account just to play a game ? f no!! i want my $ back and rock star can go to hell. dame thing wont even launch. wtf",1
"i had played so far one hour without any problems at all with nvidia 970.i set all setting in very high some ultra,still it ran smoothly for me.honestly i played it before on my ps3 but in pc is exceptional,the game looked absolutely beautiful.it is a fun game,i am sure everyone will enjoy with this grand sequel,so i recomend gta v to everyone.",1
"i cant even play gta v is anyone having this problom",1
"flawless intallation,performance and gameplay, absolutly nothing to say against this title.. best gta ever... dont listen to all the whining, just a bunch of unlucky and or poor ... test your own luck",6
"great game, great work rockstars, a must buy. 10/10 runnig the game smoothly with normal settings in almost every aspect: cpu - core i5- 760 (2.8 ghz) graphics card - asus nvidia gts450 top (1 gb) ram - 12 gbs, ddr3, 1600mhz board - asus maximus iii gene (no overclock) forgot to mention: average fps: 90 fps go from 70 to 120, but normaly stay close to 90",4
"this is an awesome game! ive already used 25+ hours on gta online. 9.5/10 game buy it!",9
"this game is suck, i cant even start it . its wasting my time and my money!! fk r star",2
"awesome game!!!! shame it took me 24 hours to install it.",3
"shot a cat and alerted the neighborhood. 10/10 recommended",8
"i played 24 hours worth in 3 days. its worth it. buy it.",5
"best 60 euros i ever spent in a game. buy it or die! didnt get any crash, didnt see any bug so far, the loading screen takes a while but the game its so well optimized that i dont care to wait a little bit to play this amazing game. so many little details make this game a masterpiece, this game should be considered art. i was waiting for the game to get a discount, but i couldnt wait and i dont regret my decision at all :d thanks rockstar, this is the one!",4
"lets keep it short and simple. singleplayer is great. the story is interesting. there are three different characters with very distinctive personalities that you can control. their have their own missions as well as missions where they work togheter. theres also a lot of things you can do in this game, it feels like its a mix of sim city, payday and need for speed. now, the multiplayer... its great except for the long loading times. you rank up and unlock stuff you can buy, like weapons, attachments, car mods... you can buy your own house, store your cars in the garage. you can play heists with your friends or randoms, you can get killed while you are wandering around los santos. its weird at the beggining, you will feel lost, but once you understand how the multiplayer works, it becomes an addiction. so... the game is totally worth your money. normal price for an aaa title and it gives your hours and hours of fun. not like these ubisoft overpriced and overhyped games that last 20 hours or so.",8
"really rockstar? dont trust people saying this is a good port. maybe it is if you have top end 5000$ pc. - input lag on ing menus. - stuttering fps for no reason at all. sometimes its 100fps, sometimes in nowhere with nothing going on its full of breaks. horrible port, do not buy in the current state unless you have a 5000$ pc. ps: i run all new games in high settings without any problem at all. ------------------------ edit ---------------- solved by buing more 4gb ram, total 8gb, this game is not able to play with 4gb although it is the minimum requirements. now everything is smooth.",2
"no idea how this is getting so many good reviews. this game freezes randomly which then requires a pc reboot every 10 minutes, with no fix in sight, this is a widespread problem with a large portion of the player base, just read their forums before buying this - wish i did. btw - my pc is also close to top of the line right now, with no issues with any other game since building it 6 months ago.",1
"the best gta so far, graphics are amazing, gameplay is amazing but online is a bit messed coz long loading screens and the constant disconnects from time to time other than that this thing is great",5
"still cant play the game. i click play, it spins up, steam says im in game, and it just crashes. dont even get a window or anything. i bought it back in january so dont feel like refunding, just waiting out for a patch i guess? i have a desktop with amd.",3
"worth 60 euros or dollars ? hell yes !!!!!! finaly we will se a game that beats dota 2 and counter strike globall ofennsive on steam top list :)",8
"if you dont have this game yet, i feel bad for you. its so much fun, i cant even put it into words. i mean, sure, it does crash every once in a while, but thatll hopefully be patched soon. then again, it is really rare and its barely a problem. again, if you dont have this game yet, you are missing out on a lot. buy this game.",5
"it is very fun. i just wish people didnt suck at the heists so much.",6
"i cant even get on the game i click play it *loads* and then nothing happens my name on steam even goes green to show im playing the game but then goes blue again if anyone can help me with this please add me",4
"i love this game. it runs brilliantly on my system.",6
"rediclious you buy a 60$ game and cant even play it because they dont know what there doing ill never pre order another game",2
"multiplayer is completely broken as always, graphics are iffy as skin textures are phenomonal, but everything else is muddy and low resolution and the chromatic aberration ruins it all. theres also a double-fu, one being the barely functional secondary drm social club and the fact that they dished out dlc from a 500 ce for free, and then level locked them.  me for buying your overpriced special swag hat edition, right?",6
"great game, origonally thought this was going to run terribly on my pc, but this runs smooth as hell, great game play, and even for a pc edition, good contols",1
"this game is so incredibly broken, it blows my mind. the amount of troubleshooting that had to be done, just to run the game and the amount needed to keep the game running, is too much. i have a notebook thats more than capable of running this game and its not my fault that it isnt working. its broken!",5
"disclaimer! * if you let your kid play this you should have them taken away.* cause its that cool. - trevor. are you tired of office pc oooot? yes? well then los santos is a haven for you! here at los santos we make fun of everyone! black american culture, white, mexican, poor, rich, entiled, lazy, crazy! it doesnt matter! why when we settled our great city we took special care to shove your liberal, right wing loving feminist nazi hating self views right where the sun doesnt shine! here at los santos we bring suvival of the fitest back to you! nature versus nurture is placed on full display for your high idiotic teen while we tell multi layed adult jokes and provide commentary on what is wrong with the world! :) 9/10 would repo the yellow hummer again. :) graphics 10 controls 8 sound 8 its a good port fellas. seriously though trevor will kill you if he sees your dang 12 year old online.",4

"wow, trevors hands are the most disgusting thing to look at while driving in first-person. 10/10.",3
"to say this is a good game is like saying that the ceiling of the sistine chapel is a nice painting. you play it and wonder why all games cant be as good as this. brilliant gameplay, story ,graphics, sub games, achievements. i am 7 hours in and so far i have loved every second. has to be one of the best games i have ever played.",3
"the game is amazing. i played for several hours and it is a jaw dropping experience. only small coin i found is that it is a little unoptimized sometimes when i drive in the city. but it might be my pc. i keep all the settings on max, except one msaa. personal request to rockstar, please, please, get rid of this god forsaken social club launcher. my pc i7-4770k 980gtx 8gig ram",5

"the openworld beauty that was awesome on consoles is now even greater on the pc i totaly recomend this game on the master platform to veterans of gta and new players just make sure your pc packs a punch.",3
"this is the perfect game. let me explain why: - it performs really well from a technical point of view, even on older machines. - the story is enriched with high quality non repetitive action missions with excellent acting and very amusing dialogue. - the characters are fascinating, with unique interesting personalities which makes them very likeable and you can easily relate with them and root for. - the gameplay is highly responsive, the driving mechanics are very satisfying and diverse with different cars. - has great replayability and an immense, detailed interesting open world to explore. in short, it has everything you ever want in a videogame and if you dont agree with this sentence, you might want to re-evaluate your videogame standards.",2
"why does my game not work? i downloaded it and then when i click play nothing happens. then i went onto my task manager and then i clicked play again and the gtav launcher appeared. then about 10 seconds later it just disappears. can someone plz help me and dell me how to fix this? thanks!",1
"best game i ever played from feeling to story! graphics are just wow",3
"amazing. a few hundread hours on consoles, allot better grapics especially vs next gen.",3
"gameplay: 8/10 the game is good, the graphics are well polished but still has a little of stuttering that can be fixed in the next patch. optimization is ok, not too much as max payne 3 but still is good in these days.",3
"look it looks good runs decent and well little bugs but the hiest and online still are just ugggg alot and i feel they shoulda added more to pc users or ect",4

"wow... now i know what playing grand theft auto v on a playstation 6 is gonna look like. 10 / 10 for those who cannot run the game on a notebook, i assume you have some kind of hybrid gpu installation inside. what you need to do is this: disable your external gpu via device manager before hitting the play button. after the launcher starts, activate it back on. this will solve your notebook launcher failure problem. gtx 680m & gtx 680 lightning reported. oh btw, solid 55 - 60 fps with my 680 lightning on very high - high settings with msaax2 on. (i5 3570k @4.2 ghz) i have absolutely no idea how.",4
"i can eat ps and qs in glorious 1080p 60fps now 10/10",3
"best grand theft auto ever!! holyshit. worth your money. xd",4
"even at 15-25 fps on low settings, i love it. heres to everyone with crappy pcs who bought the game anyways!",3

"i bought this game when it was released back in 2013 for ps3 and xbox360. i played alot of online and a little bit of singleplayer. i enjoy online the most i think its what makes this game great being able to access the entire map and do whatever you please. now that i own a decent gaming laptop, the graphics are gorgeous and vivid. i am playing at 900p and getting about 35-40 fps. back on ps3 the graphics are unbearable and i dont know how my eyes got used to the frames. i havent noticed any pop in whatsoever (coming from a regular 5400rpm 1tb hdd user). there is a bit of jaggies and stuttering but i have it under control when i set up maximum pre rendered frames to 1 in my nvidia control papnel and power management to maximum performance. i would reccomend this game to anyone it is truely amazing how rockstar developed this game allowing those with not very good specs to play this game even at normal settings the game still looks beautiful. thank you rockstar thank you pc please guys get this game youll be amazed!",2
"yep, the minimum system requirement is nvidia 9800 gt 1gb / amd hd 4870 1gb (dx 10, 10.1, 11). but it wont be able to run at 1080p with 1gb graphic memory, aka my gtx 560 ti. you need at least 2gb graphic memory for 1080p. very disappointed.  ---/)  --//  -// --///`_ -//--/-/--/ --((- ~/--) ---/ ----/ ---| ---",9
"awesome though i cant figure a way to reduce my sensitivity since its ridiculously high.",8
"you know how it says ive played 2 hours of this game well i havnt. just trying over and over again to launch the game, i bet the game is really good and i hope a update comes out soon that will let me play and if one does i will play for a real 2 hours then give it a true review. but until that time comes it will always be my 60$ copy of game launching simulator 2015. 10/10 would excessively launch again",1
"i never cared for the previous gta titles, but this one is a winner. awesome story mode. wonderful graphics and sound. detailed immersive gameplay. and the online mode is fantastic with friends. the cons are the matchmaking issues that plauge this game. very adult oriented, which is great except i often hear childrens voices while playing multiplayer.",2
"well the game is awesome already and ive just played it for like 5 hours or something what can i say, its so much better than the ps and xbox version i can asure you that and its just awesome lol",3

"1010 great game just love this i didnt play in the console so i having realy fun time in the single and in the online thats all i need to say to describe this awsome game was worth the time of the delay",6
"a car crashed into me cause i did some gunshots so i fly away and land on the street with 1hp. then an dog attacked me so i died x) raging simulator 2015. 10/10 would rage again.",3
"that wait was worth it, great pc game in every aspect.",4
"really great game. i launch it and it opens up a computer simulator that looks exactly like my desktop right before i launched gta v. the only issue im having is getting out of the desktop and into the open world, anyone know how to fix this?",4
"crashing at the same point in the story every time now. takes 10 minutes to reach that point even to test if it will crash again. it does....such a shame. makes it unplayable.",1
"do not buy payday, do not buy battlefield hardline, do not buy the crew, do not buy cities skylines, do not buy fsx, dont even buy a tv subscription, the tv shows in the game are better. buy this game, and it does all those things, but better. i would happily pay $200 for this game, it is a masterpiece, and im sure that opinion is mostly unanimous. im not leaving my house for two weeks, this is the reason.",10
"steam says ive played for 7 minutes, it used to say 6 but i didnt think anyone would take me seriously with only 6 minutes. 10/10, would click play again and again, and again and again and again....",2
"even though i have only played an hour of this on pc i must say this game is absolutely amazing. i had some scares about if my build could handle the game and i was very surpsrised at how well the game ran. i was able to transfer my old character from xbox 360 to pc, no problems everything was the same. got the extra money for the pre-purchase. gg rockstar, thanks for releasing one day early :) cant wait to play this game and do some heists.",3
"10/10 i finally found a game that made my wildest desire to come true... kicking a ing cat in the face and then stomp his little head till i get tired.",3
"the definitive gta:v experience which, for me, was the ultimate multi-player game of the last generation. granted, its been a bit of a wait for the pc crowd, and the online facet of the game is not without its glitches (abominable lag despite having a +100 mbps connection, jumping into a car and not being able to drive for some reason, weird vehicle damage modelling loops, just-killed enemies coming back to life due to disparity between local and server-side assets, etc.), but when you compare it to similar games in the genre, i still think its way ahead of the competition. yes, the delays should have meant a more stable launch, and i agree that the whole windows username thing, whilst not affecting me personally, is a pretty big oversight, but a quick patch or two later and it should all be rectified. then again, im one of the jerks whos been playing it on xb360 and ps4 for the last year and a half, so im probably a whole lot more forgiving than the average pc user. either way, its a 09/10 from me - now we just gotta wait for a pc remake/sequel to red dead redemption.",3
"download simulator 2015 is real. it updated a hour long after the release. but then it was great, not the online mode, because it wasnt accessible, but the rest was nice and looks good. i want more!",7
