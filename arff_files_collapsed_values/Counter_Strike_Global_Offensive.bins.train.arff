"i love the new counter strike they update it so much good wok.",5
"cool game, best fps game of all time, latest version of counter strike.",1
"cs: go stands as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longvity and variety. valve has not only updated the eshooter but has completely outclassed its contemporaries. this is counter-strike, whatever the format you choose to play it on, and there isnt a higher recommendation than that.",2
"great game, super fun and even better with friends",2
"so glad i purchased this game. 1.6 was my first fps game. this by far surpassed my next love for fps.",1
"yeah.... ive been trying to get this game from some time. when i got it i realised that there were skins released in this and discovered that there are knifes and the most expensive knife can go to 500$ so i finally thought to sell my kidney and get a cool knife so that i can show off and the time is not far when my 2nd kidney will also be missing. thats why i give it 5/5 . this game is 2 gud for a kidney , its worth to sell one for knife and skins.it is so interesting that all kind of people will add you up to trade and they are quite interesting",5
"this is a great game to pass time with. i personally am not great or even good but do have alot of fun. i think mechanics could be better, im sure anyone familiar with counter strike knows that the hit system may be alittle off. all in all, i greatly enjoy playing this game and do recommend it to anyone that likes a technical fps like cod2",6
"personaly i love this game and not just for the gameplay the selection of skins for your guns are just awesome i recommend it for anyone who likes 1st person shooter games.",5
"this game is a really nice first shooter game. i preffer it instead of call of duty and shooters like that as it is more skill based.",7
"great game, great camos good community. definitly recommended!",5
"if youre a better than average player or if get a lucky shot then be prepared to be called a hacker. 10/10.",5
"very nice game if you ever played the old school cs 1,5/1,6 its better than source but still has a lot of annoying elements. however, its very nice to be able to find matches using an ingame search function. be careful since a lot of the times you will be playing with russians who will ruin the game 90% of the time.",8
"this game doesnt need a recommendation. best format of cs yet.",1
"i swear im not bad at this game, its just everyone else is is a hacker...",2
"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",2
"its counter strike, what review do you want? get it",1
"awsome game!really fun and time consuming :d.but a game that needs time to get better at.",5
"community not as great as 1.6 but still not too bad",4
"its difficult to put my finger on it, but i cant stop playing this game, its well made, i honestly think its that simple!",2
"very interesting and quite challenging game, i recommend this game for people with good accuracy in fps games.",3
"hands down the best competitive fps on the market right now. the community is great and while it takes a while to get the aiming down, i guarantee it will help you in every fps you play. 10/10",4
"one of the best competitive shooters out there.go and buy it,now.",3
"this game has more bugs than your mother does under her pingabell if you want a dirty game to lag like your mothers bugs this is the game for you!",4
"this game is a very fast paced fps. very fun although it takes awhile to get used to",2
"this game taught me to wash my hands. when i wash my hands, i get a better grip on my mouse! better performance. 10/10",5
"its like a point and click adventure but the adventure is a bullet going through someones head. 10/10 ign",4
"i dont like a lot of counter-strike game but this game is nice. it has some cool games. it is very funny :d if you like counter-strike you should buy it. it is a must for all cs-fans if you liked this review please say yes with a thumb up (like) . thanks 10/10",1
"dont buy this game on sale an expect good gameplay for a month at least afterwards. putting this game on sale just allows users to troll lower ranked players. otherwise its a fast paced addicting game. worth the money as long as you dont play during or dirrectly after the sales.",3
"i absoloutely love this game. its a great fps team strategie game. buy it.",4
"the mother of the ego-shooter genre is cs 1.6 . but csgo is the perfect incest kid of it. play it , it is worth it!",4
"ive spent too much time playing this game and im going to spend more in the future -- its decent game lol",8
"it was buggy, bland and unbalanced when launched, but after valves hard work and dedication with the updates its must have now!",1
"this is the wurst game evur i recuumend it right nauuuu",7
"ive put over 350 hours in. extremely competitive game.",3
"takes a lot of practice. i like how they moved on from source. good flow of the game and very competitive. for anyone that has a lot of time practicing their aim on bots, recommended. 4/5",1
"if you are thinking about transitioning from 1.6 to cs:go, trust me, do so. i did the same thing, after playing 1.6 for 7 long years, at first, it was a huge transition, but after a few matches i deserted cs 1.6 for good, never turned back.",4
"has anyone threatoned to rip/eat your  off before for being bad in a video-game? well now i have.",2
"played cs for years already and still not tired of the gameplay, best allday game !",2
"i like the game its really good fps and a lot of players but there is one thing when you play compe. you get ban 1st for 24 hours 2nd for 7 days and this is really what i dont like, 7 days ? come on too much time to wait ban for: 1)if you shoot your teammate too many times 2)if you disconect from match 3)if you get kicked by your own team and there is valve really fuc*d up",3
"you dont need a better aim, you just need more bullets.",4
"i got a 7 day competetive ban becuase csgo.exe has stopped working goben kniv pls ty 20/10",3
"one of the best and most populat fps multiplayer games. i really like the style of game because its really tactical. game is also good for playing clan wars. game mods are really nice and fun to play. game wont become boring at all. i only dont like spawn system of players in team deathmatch because its really bad. the good thing is that you can get some items in game which you can sell for real money on steam and if you are lucky you can get pretty big amount of money. i really reccommend this game to everyone who like fps multiplayer and action shooter games. game is worth of money. 9/10",2
"boom click headshot all day every day. thats how you instant win.",9
"best game on steam for me packed with action rage friendships desrtoyed and pwning noobs skins fun to get hackers suck mess up fun games a game when you win 16 - 0 makes you call people noobs and when you hemwin with bots everyone cries when you get an ace they call you a hacker or when your beating them all in all its a great game try it",3
"in the beginning i didnt like this game (csgo), but as soon as you tweak around the settings and the new gun aiming (thank goodness they updated the aim on deagles). its a pretty good game, i almost dont miss cs 1.6 except csgo is still a raw game, and still needs a lot of updates. even though its out since 5years (i didnt even know its been that long since csgo beta launched). all in all its growing on me, and i hope some of my other friends finally will switch to csgo as well. the ranking system can be hard on you for competitive mode, because with my six digit account i am stuck at master guardian 1, since i had to relearn how to shoot in this game/ settings as mentioned before. but this account instantly gets up to master guardian elite and hopefully soon to destinguashed master guardian. because i hated to play a competitive mode in my original account because of all the lower ranks. thats my review.",1
"dont get me f*cking starterd about this game it is one of my favourite games ever it is so adicting and fun just go csgo if you dont like well you can suck my balls",3
"id rate this game about 10/10. i know it could have done better but yknow.",1
"awesome game! can be co-op and a solo shooter! realistic graphics and friendly players! nice stuff and lots of weapons to choose! p.s also ruined my life.",6
"this game is for everyone, great for meeting new people and calling people hackers because they kill you xd. if you buy this game you will get hours of endless fun with friends and other people.",2
"good game until competitive matches where you might have over 300 ping and might have to play 90mins with that. lagging like a ! leaving will get you cooldowns. lol this huge company and they cant ing put ping cap xddd",1
"great classic game with awesome new maps every now and then. getting missions to play, unlocking really unique skins, its a very cool game. remains classic because of counter-strike series itself, but with these new additions, it really is an addicting game.",4
"a very fun realistic multiplayer game. i enjoy playing it.",1
"kinda battlefield 4, without bugs, lag, bad netcode, ea and tanks",2
"very fun and interesting game, love the thourough graphics.",2
"awesome game, wich is funny to play with a team. gain items by playing competitives, and trade them with your friends. :) i recommend this game for everyone who been in to the cs scene, and also people who just heard of counter strike, this is awesome. go on guys! you wont regret!",6
"this game is awesome. its counter-strike, but more cool. more community things, and... happines :d",3
"awesome continuation of the series. definite recommendation. getting into matchmaking is a bit daunting but thats where all the fun is at.",6
"if you want to spend $400 on a red knife that gives you no advantage in the game, heres the game for you!",2
"dis game vedy good. much grafic much fun, much wow. grandkidz and me play vedy good, play long time. vedy loud good booom booom basss. make house fall down, wife hate me, i play so much. dis game ruin my life, 10/10 would play again.",1
"just as fun as the original, great lobby system and fast pased gameplay. 8.5/10",1
"i had so many plans for this summer. i wanted to learn to play dota 2. i wanted to learn css. i wanted to get myself hard at work saving for a car and some more parts i need. then my friends asked me to play a couple rounds of cs:go with them. told them i was rusty, having not played since the year before, but id try. ive played 75 hours in the past two weeks. ive gained 15 pounds. i smell horrible. ive slept a total of 2 hours in the past two days. 10/10 do recommend.",4
"taken into account that its only 11 (or less than 4 during a good sale), counter strike is already worth buying. but you cant forget the tight controls and superb levels, that make for some intense online combats. truly, one of the most intense games to play online.",2
"cs:go for me personaly is the best cs so far, you have skins etc. recoil is different, makes it fun to learn again, but when you learn its really fun to play. im impresed..",5
"this game made me grow a ginger left nipple. i never had a left nipple before, i have found it an intresting exspierience and hope that nicolas cage will get a morbidly obease tiger and make it wear a bair costume. this game creates dreams it is worth 19.99 but wait just now if u order right now well chuck in boxes which u can sell for money and buy more games",4
"this is the best game around of the world. i never seen better fps game :)",5
"fast paced shooter with high skill curve. fun and exciting.",6
"spent too much on cases. earned 2.50 in return. ggwp gaben 10/10 would do again.",2
"much like its predicessor, cs:go is a groundbreaking addition to the fps genre, the realistic simulation of weapon physics and military sop such as, but not limited to, rank;units;chain of command; team and leadership skills. like most autistic children, i have a deep, almost sexual love for stickers and colorful patterns so when i see a game with both for guns, i had a light heart attack. as for suggestions and complaints, i dont really have any... other than it hasnt really changed since condition zero... the awp needs to be nerfed, people keep getting rekt... the matchmaking was made by the antichrist...perhaps make it with prerendered loadouts like a cod game... overall, id say i was globally offended 10/10",1
"this game is a great time consuming fps, dont be fooled though, this is not your everyday cod game.",2
"obviously one of the best games ever created. so much more life-like than any other fps shooter ive ever played. 5/5 great game.",3
"a nice game with the traditional counter-strike feeling, im not much of a reviewer, the aiming feels alot different compared to 1.6, cz or css. i really like the graphical design of the game and its really fun to play with friends, i like the addition of skins in this game purely for the reason of seeing the same guns all the time can get quite boring, and for some people that likes to collect items for games but never gotten into the more heavier item games such as tf2 or other things, it can be quite nice, though of course there are the fair share of fools who believe that skins makes you imediately better, it really doesnt. but id recommend the game, its kinda fun, but you can get banned if youre too good in a low skillbracket. just saying.",4
"this is a very fun game with a great community where you can make great friends and have fun: i know i have!",6
">see a guy >shoot him >miss every shot >he turns around >kills me in one shot >exit cs:go 10/10",2
"you shoot people and blow stuff up. you cant go wrong. 420/420",1
"this game is lots of fun. its not your typical run and gun cod clone, however. cs:go requires tactics, teamwork and lots of skill. i would recommend this game to anybody who likes to play first person shooters. its worth every cent of the $15 price tag.",2
"very fun game, with a lot of teamwork required. skill cap is very high and is fun to play casual or competetive. =d best first person shooter on steam for sure!",7
"u need free cs: go skin? heres the link for epic free skins: {link removed}",1
"a really fun game. when i was new it was hard for me to pick up at first but then it became really addicting. now i have improved so much and love this game. you have not played an fps like ever before!",2
"counter strike global offensive or cs:go is the new game of valve . this game giving you to play some kind of mods : 1# arms race 2#domination 3#defuse mission 4#hostage mission 5#team death match thats not all ! theres a lot of casual and private servers that people building to play their mods and maps . valve dont stop update the game by adding skins for the weapons and changing sights , dots . fire rate and more abilities . at all , valve giving to editors to create their weapon/map style by adding their works to workshop . the most popular mod is -match making (mm) / competitive . in this mod you can rank up and play with players in your rank or friends rank . the highest rank in game is - the global elite and lowest rank is - silver 1 counterstrike global offensive is the first counter strike that giving you get you own rank by building your skill . this is my review about the game hope its helps . yours minionrush",6
"fun,strategic,good gprahics, addictive, and competitive",4
"i dont always get flash banged, but when i do, its because i threw it.... 11/10",2
"this game is awesome and i recommend getting it when its on sale ! (dont get it if youre bad at fps gaming)",1
"got killed right after a spawned. 10/10 would play again",1
"99% of the time youll meet some mic talking people they are gonna be russian",1
"immedietly died at the beginning of the round. 10/10",1
"i love this game so freaking much. but i have some ideas for other names negev simulator awp simulator auto sniper simulator blame people of hacking simulator. but counter-strike is good i guess. buy this game now",2
"really good game one of my favorites. all around really fun. competitive gets really addicting.",4
"bullets dont land on the bullet holes on my screen, 10/10 not bad rng simulator -ign",1
"this game brings back some good memories of cs 1.6. i highly reccomend buying this game.!",8
"the best fps-game in history, now improved and even better. counter-strike is more alive than ever!",7
"this game is amazing!!!!!!! for everyone looking for a good first person shooter and doesnt have an amazing computer. : )",1
"you ether die a scrub or live long enough to get bored and play jail break, then get called a hacker.",2
"painfully addicting game. buy if you have a lot of spare time to learn how to control your guns.",2
"this is a very fun game especially when you have a friend to play with you.",5
"too many cheaters in mm, fix your god damn anti cheat valve..",1
"brings many changes but still having its originality on its newest series. new weapons, new graphical changes, new modes, new system, and also brings new experiences. highly recommended for those who has fallen in love with counter-strike series. for me, its 9/10 for counter-strike: global offensive.",1
"only promblem with this game is valve should add more guns and maps from previous counter-strike games and leave them in.",1
"its basically the counter strike 1.6 back and remastered. i really enjoy this game, its allways fun to play, more modes, many new features and its really addictive :d",2
"the cs:go community is strongly reminicent of the american conservative community there eather against terrorism or are terrorists themselves they eather hate or love high powered rifles they worshop an all mighty god (lord gaben) they collect weapons and knives they like chicken as you can see, these communities are very similar",1
"it may lack some of the community niceties, beloved maps, and little features of past games, but counter-strike: global offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful, polished, and better looking counter-strike for whoever wants it. even if the community doesnt meet the golden standard of counter-strike and counter-strike: source, counter-strike: global offensive will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.",5
"really intence shooter hours of fun and a good play with friends 10/10",1
"its a great game, lots of fun. try not to get addicted to opening crates lol",5
"ehm, do you like vodka ? do you have a need to measure your e-? are your from the cold eastern countries? are you vladimir putin? have you even got pubes yet? then this game is for you, having all the things the russians and children needs. just dont forget to upload that one vs two clutch to the youtubes. oh, and also dont forget to subscribe to russianhacks.noviruses.ru for you free dose of haxxx ;) 10/5 vodka bottles. execellent russian matchmaking.",3
"the game is extremely fun. if you like the search and destroy kind of games, this is definately a game to play.",1
"i used my sticker on the wrong side of my firearm. ill never have that sticker again.",1
"fun casual game, but dont recommend going for serious competitive matches. competitive mode is full of cheaters(aimbot & wallhack) and matchmaking system is faulty anyways, it can put 3 or more ranks higher people on the other team. servers are 64 tick so if someone has over 100 ping latency your bullets go through and he can shoot you before you even see him.",7
"cs:go is an awesome game. its fun to play, especially when you play with your friends. if someone asks me if he should buy it, i say yes.",2
"with cs: go its never been easier to learn how to play counter-strike; and considering the game offers such a pristine experience for only $15, there are a lot worse ways to spend your money.",6
"why can i review the game when i dont have it in my library best gaming community to date",2
"counter strike: global offensive logic. score: 0-10 everybody on the other team must be hacking! score: 10-0 i am the lord of counter strike and according to half of the community, they have hade sexual intercourse with my mother multiple times. 10/10",3
"really fun game if you have friends to play it with, or else it gets boring :d",1
"cons - terrible community people complaing about weapons in game , if you use some weapons you will be cursed and called noob competitive bans - i got banned (30 minutes) because i kicked too many people (even if you didnt call the vote, only voted yes) even if you kick hackers, griefers or afkers several people play competitive and leave if they are losing games like 3 x 0 50% of the servers play only dust 2 people are very rude recoil is stupid and havent changed since cs 1.6 pros - weapon and boxes will drop and earn you steam wallet income trough market funny with friends",2
"#rektsimulator #spookie #noscope all those tags for this. 9/10 ~ign",1
"great game, super fun and even better with friends",2
"want a game that says  you call of duty but still has that call fo duty feel with the mix of realism well guess what we i reccomend you!!! this game is a fps with great graphics a good community besides the accasional troll and the lil kid trolls even though the kids can be funny sometimes everyone here is really nice and the game is a great en game i like this game with all my killing instencts in my body i give this game a 8/10 because of the fact that this game can be glitchy during new updates but they are relitivly easy to fix and then the other point is for the trolls you get in this game th game itself is amaing but you do get the trolls like any other game but besides that get the damn game!!!!!",5
"want some steam money? well buy this game and win some items and sell them! :d plus its fun",6
"a whole arsenal of welcome changes to the cs formula. bigger emphasis on competitive play this time around, and smaller 5v5 skirmishes are as intense as ever.",7
"i have put 375 hours into this game and havent reggretted any of it its awesome",5
"teroroists plant the bomb you make ace and the defuser gots mvp. best game ever!!!!!!!!",3
"wait for a sale and buy it, idk why you havent already. i dont care how much you think it sucks or you think valve is patching it wrong or you think skins are ruining the game or whatever you think. its counter strike. buy it.",5
"this is in the best fps game ever great job!!!! for the devlopers of this",5
"i dont really like this game but somehow i played over 500 hours :/",4
">see a guy >shoot him >miss every shot >he turns around >kills me in one shot >exit cs:go 10/10",2
"you either die a noob or live long enough to get called a hacker",7
"you cant hit anything unless youre standing still. 10/10",5
"geat game but takes some getting used to. high skill ceiling.",2
"this game isnt globally offensive, more nationally.",1
"the game requires alot of stragety but fun if you do have enough but there is alot of tryhards there",2
"great game if your to good you will be called a hacker if you die you are called a noob 10/10",4
"best fps game for me! :) superb graphic. cs player from czero till cs:go!",1
"counter-strike, a classic fps game that never gets old. anyone lived through the 90s as a kid or young adult would be familiar with this game and probably watched it grow, as it had watched over you. global offensive offers a new menu system (main menu and shopping menu alike), graphical changes, music changes, improved a.i. with many choices of difficulties, and several changes with weapons. playing global offensive was like walking down a refreshingly new memory lane of old. this is a counter-strike just as fun, if not more, as any other.",1
"once when i was new to the counter strike series, i met a friendly terrorist who decided to help me learn the ropes. he taught me that going to the terrorist spawn and shooting chickens on de_inferno made us win automaticly. in the end i became so hated for my well known tactic that people started reporting me! after a long trial of enduring the many obstacles that i faced. i encountered the friendly terrorist once again, his name was jwonderchild and he told me that because of my tactic he made it on the pro scene. 9/10, lost 54 on ldlc vs fnatic. ing russians got me comp banned.",7
"fun game for sure, but the matchmaking system is heavily flawed with their anti-cheat being extremely weak. if you happen to play thru esea though it is much better. i feel this game will be significantly upgraded when the new source engine comes out (providing they update the game with it). overall though id say 8/10.",6
"this game is great to play and really improves your aim with your mouse :d",1
"99 aimbotting reports but being an asian aint one.",2
"one of the best shooters in my opinion, its very competetive. i would recommend this game for the amount of fun and crazyness that can happen in just 1 shot of every bullet.",6
"this is the best game ive ever played. it involves a lot of teamwork and coordination, i highly recomment i!",2
"best online fps game since 1998 plus cool weapon skins!",1
"this game is better than counter strike 1.6 and much better than cs:source. it is very addicting with the match making part of the game.",10
"although a great game and a great tranformation from its prequels it is not much fun to play here in india asindian servers are almost non existant. they do exists though, but their number is pretty low, and if you play on servers outside india you suffer with high pings. i wish cs go was as popular in indian audience as the previous series, but nevertheless its a great game! :)",1
"i dont play cs:go often, but when i do, i play offline with bots. cause im scurred. stay frosty, my friends. (you know this was very helpful.)",1
"counter-strike is the cornerstone of multiplayer pfs. this game represents simplicity and perfection among multiplayer games.",3
"kids get mad if you say the n word after every kill.",1
"i very like this game. very good game every one should try it better then all cs",6
"this game is so much fun its always being updated making it better, and the skins! there just great.",6
"i recommend this game to those who like fps gameplay also counter terrorism the game is well balanced and seldom see hackers but theres always somone that rage quits, rages and bullys cant change that but its a good game try it",1
"call me mitt romney because im fucking gay and wear magic underwear",6
"just perfect a real counter strike game like 1.6 or css. come back to real fps in esport. moreover this game is realy not expansive.",3
"i get bullied by my friends because of my rank 10/10",1
"you kill pepol with fancy weapons, totally serious anti-terrorism simulator",4
"this game causes me to masticate my teeth against one another",1
"the trick to counterstrike is this, the guns dont work like guns should work. ive never been able to figure out if it was the way damage was dealt, or perhaps it was some other arbitrary calculation that determined your ability to kill the other guy, but whatever it was it gained sentience somewhere around cs 1.3 and has hated players ever since. its just now people are used to that malignant hatred and have learnt to use it to their advantage. a decent enough game, to be sure. but its in a different vein then your usual fps. lots of pros. lots of . lots of mlg gamers who are a mixture of the former two. if you havent had enough cs in your life, this might be for you. if not, just keep on walking, jack.",1
"thanks to counter strike i now know that the true meaning of friendship is to kill your entire team with a fire grenade and get a week competative ban. 10/10 -ign",2
"this game is cool. the competitive is my favorite part... the casual is good for just playing around if youre bored.",2
"the is one of the greatest games there is out on team. the quality of the game is absolutely extraordinary! worth every second playing it.",8
"i do not have a lot of hours on this game, but from playing css and cs 1.6 i can say they have done an outstanding job. i love counter strike and will always love the game, people care about graphics pfffft, it is all about gameplay and this game has it. it is 1000x better than cod and all other first person shooter, if you are looking for a game that will bring a lot of fun to you this is the game to get. once you get into it, you can never stop playing from how fun the game is, best gameplay, best first person shooter and i strongly recommend this game.",3
"$15 well spent. if you havent played cs 1.6 or anything prior, you need the game. if you have played the old <1.6, you really need the game. if you have not played counter strike, this game is slightly more noob-friendly, as it has a variety of game modes. throw in a beautiful achievement system, and trading cards, click buy.",2
"like cs: source with better graphics and more... stuff. its good, trust me",1
"ive been playing this game for over 800 hours. if you are looking for a competive game, look no further. i would recomend this and then some. its also cheap.",8
"slightly updated graphics from the previous version of counter-strike. would recommend if you have any interst in playing cs. upgrades to servers, ability to find match, and much more.",2
"only promblem with this game is valve should add more guns and maps from previous counter-strike games and leave them in.",1
"this gam is teh best i eva playd is not like cod first time i playd i i was sad but skins and more maeks me happy. i am globel elete and is cool too pley it and own soem nobs :) 8/10 cause no kill straeks and nob tub but its coool #yolo",2
"congratulations youve won 2 games today your reward is your banned for 21 hours, dont forget to buy skins keys and cases. 11/10 would play again, now time to buy more skins",3
"full of tryhards and haters but still a fun and addictive game if your gunna purchase buy it for 2 keys on tf2 oupost dont buy from steam store",5
"very good new version from css with great updates and gets better everytime",4
"is shiit game, dont buy, awps op, shiitty recoil, no ads, guns too stronk, armor too weak, all guns are bad and feel bad, you should feel bad also.",1
"in first you will not like the game if you are used to play cs/cs:s. after some time, you get used to the new graphics, and how to play this new cs series game. recommend to all who love shooting games.",1
"awesome, i play this game everyday. i hope i will recive some items :))",2
"i got kicked from my first server seconds after joining. welcome to the cs:go community.",1
"the most great game iv ever played & enjoyed the most.",4
"good game! good improvements from cs:s to go, great community",9
"i am yet to meet someone who uses the in game voice chat who isnt obnoxious and eastern european. despite being the last guy alive, your teammates who all died, then get to watch you and write in chat omg and noob whilst also giving helpful tips on how to go about getting an ace. fun to play with friends otherwise youll be heading towards an early grave with a brain aneurysm.",2
"if you dont own this then buy it now. 10/10 not enough mtn dew would not play again.",2
"i really love this game.it is really nice. i nearly never have any problems playing. but when i had a problem i just reatarted the game and it was compleatly fine. there is no lag to be found as long as you have good internet.",1
"i havent played counter strike that much but i bought global offensive to try it out. i think it is an awesome game and you should really get it if you already havent. its also one of the main games in e-sport.",2
"you can spend $400 to make your knife look different 10/10",2

"cg:go is a blast to the past; a nod to the old-school days of the late 90s, and its more than welcome in my gaming livery. whilst i love cod and titanfall, theres something uniquely compelling about starting up a match of cs:go, with its deliberate and stayed pacing, and its risk vs reward gameplay mechanics, its no wonder this game has taken off for the 3rd time in its lifecycle. its popular right now for a reason, and that reason is good. a must-buy.",1

"have you taken a look at the bad reviews for this game? quite amusing, theyre complaining because valve is trying to make money. > a company > trying to make money wtf? valve is literally ea. truth be told, this game is actually really great, you can play with your friends, or online. tf2 is used by valve as their main trading game, with little competitive play, and cs:go as their main competitive game, with a little trading. the trading in this game is done with weapon skins, and stattrak, which is like stranges in tf2. i strongly recommend this game, and if you find yourself getting rekt by guys who have been playing counter strike since 1.6 or source? just play against the bots on different difficulties, they arent like the cod bots, they actually shoot at you. 9/10 - please dont fix the aug, its great.",7

"looking for a fun way to make money off of a game you will enjoy playing with your friends well look no further because counter strike gloabal offensive is just the game for you you can get weapon skin drops worth some money but you can also get case drops and open those by buying a key yes you can end up getting a 4 cent skin but there is also a possibility of opening a case and getting a $400 knife its not easy though its all based on luck of the case opening i myself have gotten great skins from case openings but thats not all the gameplay is great i love the competitive and deathmatch modes but this game i give it 10/10",4
"personally, counter strike is one of the most outstanding fps (first-person shooter) franchise to be established. they deliver so many things that has increased the fans over the years. it is also welcoming to new players all around. to that, i recommend the game, with a sick gameplay and awesome content.",4

"put yourself in the situation of where generic terrorists have to blow up generic things for random goals that no one really cares about because you get a fancy rank but its okay because some random russian who cant speak english is on your team and you have no clue what hes saying because apperantly the only games the russians can afford is chess and counter-strike. but do not fear when mister boris vladisov comes running because youre a real og busta man that takes zero  from anybody and would rather run into the bombsite alone than with other people. my final note is the following. cs:go is a competetive game where russians run rampant and you get a rank depending on how busta you are.",2

"pay 12 for game, get cases as drops, pay extra 1.50 to open them, get crappy consumer grade battle scarred skin worth 3p ( wanna sell it? too bad valve needs 20% of that which leaves you wiiiiiiiith... 1p). rinse and repeat. 11/10 would play again",4

"honestly, whether you can aim or not is irrelevant. the true definition of skill is your ability to argue with everyone. people being put into 5v5 teams is just to create the illusion of a team game. its actually 1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1. whoever rustles the most jimmies wins. also just like to add that the russians are currently dominating at this sport at the moment.",2

"this game is just plain addictive. it lives up to every expectation it promises you and even more. within two days i had already racked up 11 hours. pros- great strategy. teamwork really is needed. realistic sounds. makes you feel like you really are part of a firefight. cons- valve seems to be trying to scam money out of you all the time. luckily its only for cosmetics.",1
"fire in the hole! epic one for all the cs addicts.",1
"competitive is the main thing that you will do on here, but the punishment for doing something just as bad as dcing during a game can be very consequencial, and as my internet had disconnected to steam a few days ago, i have gotten my 3rd week day ban. they can improve on this game by making it so bans arent so severe for players who do something that isnt their fault. atleast make it reset back to 30 minutes after a week day ban is over. because once you get addicted to this game, you cant stop playing what you love.",4
"a very complex gunplay system makes for extremely realalistic fire fights. its a change of pace from bf3/4 and cod but it requires more skill to play then ether of these games, this will lead to a higher tiers of playing. although the ranking syatem needs an overhaul for the competitive mode as it is based on wins and not individual score this can often lead to mis ranking you to lover or jigher tiers. 8.5/10",2

"bringing cs back into the mainstream with tons of new fun. skins make for an added visual, new maps as well as old re-makes make go a must for fps fun.",7
"as an ex call of duty player this game was more than an average change in tone from your regular fps. despite not having jaw dropping graphical fidelity and advanced texture tessalation like some of the next gen games do, and not having as many features as other aaa fps games do. cs:go makes for a unique take and updated version of a mod-born fps franchise that exceeds quailty over quanity. while it may seem lacking in basic things that fps games have become accustomed to like leveling up, you quickly begin to appriciate that go is a game that wants to stand out as something different. every different feature gives go an inch and when you start to add those features and differences together you start to find that cs is slowly taking over the fps stage. 1 inch at at time. for all time fps fans this game will keep you playing until you look at your watch thinking what felt like an hour, turned into six. thats the mark of a great game. personal rating (my oppinion): 9/10",1
"if u like action games, u might be inlove with this game!",9

"spend up to 304 for a stupid skin... but its a good game for little money, would buy again.",2
"one of the best games i have played. this is one of the first games i have played on my pc, ever since i joined steam. there are so many things to do to pass time in the game, such as surfing. competitive is one my favorite things about the game, it allows for team communication and co-ordination. also, opening cases have been the death of me, i have opened at least 50 of cases and nothing good, but that wontt stop me from opening them and getting the infamous butterfly knife. this game helped me get better at pc games as i was a cod player on console. this game will never get old, and ill never stop playing it. on the other hand, it does have problems in the community such as smurfs and hackers, but hopefully, they will try and remove this to keep the game fair. furthermore, this is the most played game i have on my library. i would definitely recommend this to anyone whether they are good at fps or starting on pc games. this game gets 10/10 on my book.",4
"i have a love-hate relationship with counter strike. in some cases i get an ace clutch, in others i headshot someone but end up doing 10 damage. but its still pretty good. like a 9/10 or maybe 9.6 or kinda 10/10 gaben is an  tho so 9/10",5

"easily one of the best shooters out there. the guns are awesome. the maneuverability is awsome. sniping people is a load of fun. it is way faster than call of duty. speaking on cod, counter strike go allows you to use your brain more to outhink your opponent. there are more ways of tricking the enemy into effectively killing themselves. while there is this to a certain extent in cod, the truth is theres little room to make a decisive decision that wont end with you getting a death after you have taken one kill. on a further note, i like the games when everyone agrees to use knife only. thats enjoyable with its own hilarous moments. all in all, a well developed game that is far superior to the ones which came before it.",1

"simply adore this whole new counter-strike. the skins, the maps, everything is just good except i cant quite enjoy the most of this because playing on 20-30 fps.",10
"just perfect game. i really like it. ive played cs 1.6 for years and this game is great sequel in cs franchise. i would definetly recommend this game.",2
"excellent game, recommend to anyone whose parents are ok with blood nothing too inappropriate except the overuse of blood stains on walls, and some of the players are profane, but all online games are like that.",2
"so bad. i hate this game so much theres alot of hackers and smurfs i ing love this game thanku gabennnn for ing my life",5
"someone thats worst than me at fps should buy this game so i can start getting some decent score.",1
"played cs games since cs 1.0. loved it then... hate it now. but why shouldnt you buy this specific iteration in the series? 1. same graphics. nothing to get excited about at all. if you have css, you pretty much have this. 2. same maps. 20 years later, de_dust is still boring and yet still wins every map vote. 3. the game is well balanced and fun. enter awp. again. hurr lets just add this 1 hit kill gun so nobody wants to use anything else ever unless the server forces them and the game becomes a ridiculous cluster of unrealistic, window-camping snipers 4. no iron sights? its 2014. the aimpoint scopes on guns that traditionally had scopes of some kind, are nice. but its still awful to not be able to aim most of your guns. in 2014. in conclusion, i bought this in a sale for about $4 and im still disappointed. i no longer consider myself a counter-strike fan.",1
"some guy was talking about how he had all kinds of cancers and he wanted donations. he was a funny sarcastic guy. i tried to friend him. he didnt accept. 10/10",1
"this game is so fun to play if youve played css (counter strike source) then you will love cs:go with the awesome graphics which make the game fun and the slight realism towards the game by contrast, cs is totally egalitarian. everyone has access to the same items, and players arent ranked. nobody cares if you play four hours a day, seven days a week. all that matters is how well you negotiate the next firefight. you might take out half of the enemy team... but then again, a much less skilled player might blind you with a flashbang grenade and unload his top-of-the-line shotgun into your skull. its not unusual to see a good player climb to the top of the scoreboard only to decline back into mediocrity. in cs, skill and alertness are your primary weaponsand when you get tired, there are no unlockables to help you keep your edge.",1
"decent game. i would suggest even for those who arent that keen to grab the game when it comes on sale ($3.75) as you can make your money back, just from selling items you get in game for free. this game is what is fuelling my game purchases from now on. besides from that, its a great fps, but is more then just a fps. it uses strategy, teamwork, and commitment, all of which have resulted in a (mostly) good community. its also has custom features, so you can choose your weapon skins, and can buy dlc packs that support community modders. and to finish it off, its got continued dev support, so it will (hopefully) only get better.",4
"good game. becuz these as aint 300. oblah bang bang,  wit me",5
"sadly, there are no sprays in this game. yes, this means there is no longer porn all over cs_office. i am sorry for your loss.",2
"this game is not for the faint of heart at all. i am addicted to this game because it is very different from your traditional shooter. i say its not for the faint of heart because if you are a call of duty player or a battlefield one you will have a hard time playing because there is recoil and an amount of realism involed that only a dedicated player can put their mind to and harness the skills they need to play and earn ranks. team work is a big need in this game because you can almost never lone wolf without getting kicked because you dont know how to play and i like that. this game is very competitive and fun and a must have for someone looking to play a game on pc. terrible computer? dont worry it will run on almost anything! oh yeah did i mention that they have modes like deathmatch, casual , competitive, and arms race? **edit** some updates may ruin the fun as they buff weapons to an overpowered state be warned!",4
"this game appeals to both casual and hardcore gamers in a way that casual gamers can play other mods and collect skins while for hardcore gamers this game is the fps for you because you really need to crank up the hours if you want to even be slightly good at it ( if you are new to fps )",5
"day 1: valve, please nerf the tec-9! its too op! day 2: valve nerfed the tec-9! the game is ruined! dammit, volvo.",3
"the game is enjoyable, especially for shooter lovers, and for cs veterans. the new medal system is nice and keeps you plugged in beacuse you recieve achievements. pros: nice feeling and graphics. (since we do consider this is a 10 not 50 euro game) friendly community (mostly those in your team :p) you dont really get bored cons: cs was a stand alone pay...i don`t think that needed changing with different payble addons, but ofc those are only optional. overall 5 out of 5.",2
"after many years of being out of the cs scene, a pleasure to play a nice revisit",2
"one of, if not the best first person shooter games. amazing mechanics, weapons, and community. plus, new cool stuff comes out with every update. definately worth it!",5
"this is the game that is fair no mather how long you have been playing, no buying to level up or unfair atvatadges just fair gaming and fun. the bad thing is there are a lot of people smurfing, they play on high ranks and get really good then make a secondary account to go play and just ruin the game for the one with lower rank.. this is a real problem all along the lines of cheating and is making online matchmaking a real hell...",4
"i like sweaty  being plunged into my soft asian boy bum.",2
"awesome game! takes a bit of skill but still fun :) unlike any other fps games.",6
"i still thinking that this is the best fps ever. cool and awesome!!",1
"this is a very good game. i came from counter strike source and i loved that, then i heard about cs go and i bought the game as soon as possible and love playing it!!",4
"got addicted, ruined my final graduation at school. good game",10
"counter strike global offensive, best game ever played, good drops, good items, good graphics, and good maps, reccomend this game so hurry up and buy it.",6
"this game is epic, but the rank system takes a while to realise that you are pro.",4
"i will compare this game with cs 1.6, because that game is like little brother of cs:go. pros: + better maps and models + good graphics + weapons have skins + more types of game (casual, demolition,...) + automatic server finder + marketable items + updates with new items cons: - expensive updates score: 10/10.",1
"of course cs:go also has the classic server browser, wherein you can browse the servers, search them by tags/maps/player count/ping, regular stuff. some of these servers also feature funmodes, which you can play when you feel like playing cs:go but you cba to tryhard. most of those servers are noob-friendly. this game gets constant updates, which means tweaks to guns if some are deemed overpowered or underpowered, new skins, new operations, new maps, and more. be sure to have your credit card ready when these things happen, though!",3
"auto sniper most balanced weapon eu/na best point and click adventure game when using auto",3
"when i was playing at dust ii, i walked by the double doors then got headshoted with a pistol across the map. 10/10",3
"theyve done a great job striking a balance of classic counter-strike play that veterans will love. but also introducing enough new gameplay to keep the franchise fresh. new players and lifetime players will all love this. what i really like is that new players can get into this game. the ranking system, and various game modes, will get you introduced to the game in a fairly non-frustrating way. while the veteran players can play against themselves in competitive ranked games - vs. similarly ranked players.",4
"good game for all who like cs 1.6 or cod :) i recommend this game!!!!",6
"shot chickens learned how many children slept with my mother asked to perform things that are not humanly possible to my own body got 7 day cooldowns for my teamates running into my fire on purpose 10/10 would play again",1
"worthy successor of cs 1,6 and source. many awesomly spent hours guaranteed.",2
"this game is similar to a vending machine that eats your dollar and gives you nothing. goty 10/10",2
"great game, classic shooter. really strays from the modern millitary shooters we have today. the community has a large ammount of veteran players that are often rude but the game has to go down in history as one of the greatest first person shooters of all time due to its attention to detail. where the bullet lands is an important role in this game and just because you get the jump on someone does not mean youre coming out alive.",6

"takes on the next step from counter strike 1.6. the hit boxes, graphics, game play, and challenges have all been updated with a few new things to take head on. if youre a strategy team based fps player this is a must grab game!",2
"after playing this for a couple of hours, i came to the conclusion that this game will suck the life out of you. i, being a silver i since forever, still strive to become a better player. even when 9 out of 10 times my teammates refuse/are unable to speak english. so basically, buy this game. support gaben by wasting your allowance on keys to get  skins and sell them for 1/10th of the key price. such is life in cs:go. 9/10 11/10 with rice",2
"we must embrace the pain and burn it as fuel for our journey.",6
"best game on steam, and will improve your skill on any fps.",1
"this game has really good competitive side to it as it does team tactical even though this game isnt as near as good as 1.6 ill give it 8/10..! a game you want to get!",3
"most realistic and strategic gun game i have ever played.",1
"i always play another fps like cod or battlefield instead of cs. i just try this game and its very addictive because the competitive part and the stress when we play 1 vs 3 or something like that. we can get item drops and thats awesome because we can sell them and make some money to buy more games. its a never ending circle. if you like fps you need try this and see how much fun you can get.",2
"good game that really takes skill to master, it isnt just about running around knifing or blasting someone with a shotgun (not pointing any fingers cod)",5
"well, what can i say.. this game is so good i masturbate to it while im playing, awping c*nts with one hand, and doin my duties with the other. 11/10",2

"counter-strike: global offense (cs:go) is the most popular shooter on steam (besides tf2). it is heavily tactics it you will find a hard time transitioning from a game such as call of duty due to the vary in teamplay is objectives. their are additional modes including: gun game and team deathmatch aswell as casual and competitive bomb disarming missions. these modes contain alot of variation so their is normally a mode to compliment the type of fps you enjoy playing. global offense requires you to think ahead and anticipate your opponents actions and work againest them in order to complete that objective. the game consists of no aim down sights system so you must rely on cover and crouching in order to obtain optimal accuracy to be effective in gunfights. overall cs:go is addictive and a joy to play 8/10",1

"a pretty great game, you should definitely consider buying it if you have played any previous counter-strikes",5
"great game, so fun, so addicting. i found it boring at first but then when you start playing competitive it gets really fun",4
"this game may be entertaining at times but in all fairness 95% of the time its try hard 5 year veterans killing you on competitive and then your team mates leaving and you being stuck with bots, oh and team kills are highly over punished. this game should have been thought over a bit more. because in my opinion. i wasted my money. (edit 02/07/14) three weeks after being banned, i would have expected the ban system to have taken my ban to 30 minutes, however it is a 7 day ban, dont believe the lies cs:go flows out. you ban does not roll back in any form, there is no point in buying this game if you play competitive.",1
"just give it a solid chance, if you dont do well, bounce off source and play some go foreal.",5
"great game, took a while to get used to but now im good enough to enjoy it but now when i play cometitive with my friends it is a great time. only downside is the baning system. would recogmend",3

"whenever i get one shotted in the head by a camper with an ak-47, i break down and cry. when i accidentally fall in the water on certain maps, i feel like smashing my lava lamp. whenever i get a kill i feel like i deserve a pat on the back by every team mate that is 60 kills ahead of me. basically the community makes me feel like the worst player in the world. love it, 10/10.",4

"yet another counterstrike first person shooter which started from 1.6, source and now global offensive. but this one is so much different then the others like having chicken running around the map.... also matchmaking with team that suck so much speaking different languages at the mic which you dont ing understand. so come and play and struggle to get out of silver rank. best game 10/10",2
"my father smoked for all of his life, and when he was 50 years old he was diagnosed with terminal stage 4 lung cancer. my father told me never ever smoke it is the worst ing experience you can have, and i would still be around without it., and i understood why. the hatred i had for cigarettes were some of the worst ive ever had. but i guess it doesnt matter though, as this game gave me cancer anyways.",5

"in counter strike: global offensive, you occasionally shoot at people, blow up foreign aid supplies with plastic explosives that kill anyone within a square mile, and rescue tied up middle-age white males that have been given nothing but mountain dew from angry punk-rock teenagers. whilst all this is happening youre getting yelled at by professional gamers who spent their last paycheck on an in-game knife and reading passive-aggressive statements directed at you by the opposing team. buy it.",5
"i really like this game, but the hit reg really breaks the game for me. you can be shooting someone with an ak and see bullet holes appearing in the wall just behind them and blood splattering all over, your first thought is yeah this guy has no chance, but all of a sudden you drop dead from a really lucky headshot and when the box pops up and shows you how much damage you did, see you hit him zero times, even though you gave the wall behind him a nice new coating of his blood.",4

"latest in the counter-strike series , in theory same thing with fancy graphics , but some weapons changed the way they fire a bit , and not since long , but they added keys and crates into the game , with weapon skins (exactly what it sounds like , some paint finishes for your weapons).and also stat track weapons (stranges counting kills) , because yeah , its a valve multiplayer game , and like team fortress 2 and dota 2 , it had to go this way :/ some may complain about the way the weapons fire , how they liked the old look for the maps , incompetent players that are camping or idk what, but i tell you this : give this game a chance, get over 10 hours into it so you can get used to it, and you should begin to like it.however if you still do not like it, you are one of the few people that hate this game, because really , this is a game that is done pretty good. i say it is worth buying , even more if you buy it with the bundle or at a sale.",1

"amazing game yet can be annoying with all of the damn russians!",5
"one of my most played games recently. although i didnt play the other games in the franchise, global offensive hooked me in its simple, yet complex gameplay. the gunplay is remarkably fun and veterans to the franchise will no doubt tell you of the strategy and competitive nature of the game. semi-easy to learn, difficult to master, and tons of fun to play.",4

"still an impressively awesome first-person shooter franchise which is always a pleasure to play. the only downside is that its wide popularity has created  communities and incredibly anti-social players who care less about team rapport and more about personal status. these kinds of people have made the game a little less enjoyable to play, but the mechanics of this game and its many options act as major benefits which outweigh the cons. as our lord gabe had said, it was worth the weight.",1

"cs:go is a great fps game for those who like tactical decisions. whether or not you throw that flashbang around the corner, will mean the life or death of your team. same goes with smoke, incendiaries etc. an aspect of cs:go that is nice is the economy system, if you get kills and/or plant the bomb, you get extra money added on to your base income to purchase weapons with. this limits how strong a team can be at any given time, so obviously at the beginning of the game people can not have automatic rifles, and towards the end, many will have one shot snipers or lmgs. overall, cs:go is a great game, the servers that valve provide are horrendous and need fixing but they work. (dont be suprised if you get matched with people who dont speak your own language)",2

"its hard for me to recommend this game when you have a better option of counter strike source in my opinion. i loved cs source but for some reason i cant get into cs go. the new weapon crates keep things interesting with trading but it cant get to the level of tf2 trading. i find myself getting tired of the game after a couple of matches where i played cs source for hours. but if your looking to get into counter strike and cant stand the old source graphics then go ahead and pick this up. 6/10",1
"it is an awesome game but you can easily get banned on comp so you really have to be careful about that. if you are a new player start with casual and move your way up to comp, this is not like every other fps this game you have to study the recoil and make good habits with your mouse if you want to spray. if you chose not to spray you can always single click for powerful damage. overall this is a pretty fun and awesome game and i would sugest it for people and their friends if they really want a fun fps.",5

"this game is thee most epic game i have ever played. its really has the game potential, and structer! that it needs. its really good were that when you shoot? you really need to focus on your target, where in call of duty? its really stupid when you spray and kill someone. thats what i enjoy, the aiming and the realistic movement is execelent!",1

"after playing over 190 hours of this game i suppose id better give a review for it. the gameplay of this game is extraordinary - the whole game is, like all counter-strike games, completely multi-player, meaning that the valve team can spend 100% of their time working on the game and making it run fine, instead of faffing around with a single-player campaign 5% of players will bother to play past the first level. the community, however... its terrible. but if you just realise that this is a $15us game, dont really take any offense to the little kids, theyre everywhere (but more so on call of duty). to summarize, this games excellent, buy it. now.",4

"this game has many positives. it is a multiplayer only type of game that pushes competitive game to its extreme limits. in the competitive mode, if you leave a game, shoot your friends, or do basically something wrong, youll get banned for a certain amount of time. right now, i am banned for 7 days because i shot my friends too many times. it doesnt matter how terrible the ban system is, this game is amazing. 10/10",1

"picked up this game because my friend told me it was like call of duty so i decided to pick it up in the 2013 summer sales but after playing it for a while (check hours) i realized that the aiming and movement in call of duty are more superior compared to cs:go, i dont like how when you move and shoot your bullets are completely random, im used to playing search and destroy and running around with my mp7 destroying kids dreams not having to stop and worry about recoil and its a huge inconvenience, also how come the mp7 can three shot people on modern warfare 3 but takes 5 shots on cs:go? because valve made a very unrealistic game! buy a game which takes skill such as modern warfare 3 or battlefield 4.",8

"counter-strike: global offensive is a game published in 2012 (it has been exactly 2 years recently) and it has changed a lot since then. some of the changes are good, some are bad. but still, this game delivers great fps feeling like the original counter-strike did and i am looking forward to the next sequel and updates of this game for the next few years.",3
"heres how the game works. one match you do great, the next 3 you get put into lobbies with 10 year olds with raging hard ons for your mother after you miss a kil. and also foreigners who scream at you in some scary language that sounds like they want to drop a nuke on your entire country. welcome to csgo. 10/10",2

"great game overall, and i played a lot on just my first day. one more thing, if youre looking for a good, cheap alternative to cod with 1 hit knives, quickscoping, reallistic graphics, all that other popular stuff in it, then go ahead and do yourself a favor, find something else. either way, another thing is for all of those achievement hunters out there, go get this game. in just the first few days i played this game, i got a lot of achievements. there are tons of acheivments to get, and an achievment for almost any weapon i believe. another thing that i personally think is nice is the skins. you can get these by playing or buying them off the market, and you can make your own and upload it to the steam community, and if i remember correctly, if you get enough likes on your skin, then your skin can get put in the game. either way, great game, i recommend it to anyone (exept like i said before, people who are looking for a cheap alternative to cod).",1
"well, this is the only fps game that i continued to play since the early versions of counter-strike. i can only comment on the classic competitive mode since that is my favorite and most played mode. many might think that cs is just a simple game where terrorist plants a bomb and counter-terrorist defuse the bomb. simple? i recommended to re-think that thought. cs is not a single player tactical game but a team tactical game. simple game mechanics does not necessarily mean an easy and boring game. be paired with noobs like myself and fight against veteran players with good aim; you and the team you belong to gets pummeled. being a lone player instead of a team player will result in losing the match(es). in cs, you have to be a team player, have an initiative, and situational awareness; add to that a good decision making skill whether to do it or not.",1

"fun in groups. valve once again stealing money from customers with cosmetic items.",1
"i have really enjoyed this game - its one of the best games that i have played. allthough there are some bugs after major updates, valve always fix these. best of all, they listen to the comunity. map changes have been put in place because we wanted it. there is a massive comunity surrounding this game - because it is an e-sport, there are international competions held regulary and it offers great youtube content aswell as amazing twitch live streams. the gameplay itself is epic. i play competetive and it is so tense, the small teams and limited time make it a fast paced, action packed game. if you play with a group of friends or even random people who have microphones, it can become very tactical. there are a few bugs with the matchmaking system, and the low-budget servers can glitch and not register your hits which can be fustrating at times. i would give this game a 9/10.",4

"cs:go is a great game, with great 5v5 competitive mode where everything is super intense, especially when your whole team is expecting you to clutch the match while your up against 3/4/5 more people. the only bad thing abot cs:go for me is that it crashes sometimes, causing me to get banned for 7 days from competitive mode, which is really the thing i like best. you also get kicked for absolutely no reason on comps which is completely funny when you just start swearing and calling them r-e-t-a-r-d-s in your head. overall, a great game to play and a must-buy",1

"insanely fun fps. teamwork and communication is crucial.",7
"for those people who are in need of a skill based game, try this. you dont need to worry about having the best attachment combo for your weapon, as they are all the same. the map design is incredible, some maps favouring a certain team and unique landmarks. casual mode is for the people who just play for fun. competitive is where its at for the people who want to be the best they can. 10/10, should be worth more than $15 considering it is such a polished game.",3
"really bad game, hated it in the first hour. just had to spend another 1,000 hours pending my view on it.",9
"great game, fun playing competetive with your buds! :)",2
"if you like competative cs:s, this is definitely for you. while the game isnt any battlefield 4, its still good. i personally give it a 7/10, its basically a huge graphical (and bullet-physics) improvement of cs:s. theres a few new gamemode improvements as well as fun trading and workshop items, as well as new guns. the t models all look the same and lack at least some noticeable variety, which is very unfortuante because you would think terrorists would have at least some distinguishable features. the ct all look the same which is expected from a swat team, so thats acceptable. originality is a low in cs:go but they preserved the cs:s-style gameplay that everybody loves, so it balances itself out. it is worth your money if you love cs:s, but if youre looking for something like cod or bf4, youre in the wrong place.",1
"back in the day counter-strike was all about teamwork and aggression now? its all about skins im a counter-strike veteran and when i first played cs:go man i was dissapointed m4a1-s is much much different then cs (higher recoil) and the ak-47? forget it. also my favorite handgun (desert eagle) is different too. i would recommend this game to newbies but to cs veterans? never! dont buy this game. personal score: 7/10",1

"this game will bring you alot of fun and hours played, ive played the first counterstrike 7 years ago. ive been a counter-strike fan since i first tried it out. ive got a total of 4000 hours in total of all the counter-strike games combined over my 7 years of service. this game is alot of fun and the operations are really great! if you feel like you dont hit, either become a better player by training your aim and reaction, or you could switch from valves standard 64 tick (64 updates per second) to a paid 128 tick server (costs if youre gonna do it the pro way, some free servers for it in the server browser). this game is very cheap and on some sales (which is common), it can cost around 3. thats the price you sell one or two cases for, which drops very common! this game is updated and maintained alot. this is a very good game and i support it to 100%.",4

"i spend 900$ in this game very nice. if youre bad at the game(low skill in the matchmaking system) its not very fun to play considering the lack of tactics and gamesense, the higher ranking you get the more fun it becomes. with the exeption of lem+. this is because in global elite 10% of players are cheaters = 1 everygame. it also has great community gamemodes as minigames, surf, bhop, kz. 9/10. needs better anti-cheat and higher tickrate for it to become a 10. but you can play on cevo, faceit or esea and get mostly cheat free servers with better tickrates.",8

"one day i bought this because it was on sale for about $2.50. i didnt think much of it but then i started playing. i couldnt believe how addicting it was. i started losing sleep and skipping meals. it started to show on my physical health. my family started bugging me about it and even considered putting me into a rehabilitation center. lets just say they wont be bugging me anymore. but now i dont have the funds to maintain an internet connection. ive sold everything i have just to play. i cant even go to starbucks and use their wifi because i sold my clothes and apparently they dont accept nudity. so basically im writing this review from my phone on top of a bridge. my life isnt worth it without this game. yet it seems to have ruined my life. goodbye world. gr8/8",2

"great game! such co-op many lives awesome graphics so wow so doge",3
"this game is very fun to play with friends. competetive is definately the funnest part and overall there is a clear reason to why this game is so popular!",3
"amazing game. suberb graphics,realistic battleground, and challegeing. its pretty hot.",1
"one of the games that doesnt require much from the player with the easy drop in game play and straight forward objectives. worth the buy as well fun to play.",3
"if youre into ing es and getting money, this is the game for you. its a simple concept: kill people, earn money, buy things with said money, kill more people with the stuff you buy. its fun for the whole family!!!! 8=====d",2
"it was not so fun first 20 hours, but after that it was.",4
"counter strike global offensive is a challanging tactical first person shooter that doesnt only require skill but also inteligence. the competetive multiplayer in this game is according to me the most enjoyable to watch the pros play and play yourself for countless of hours where every match feels like a new challange that you desperately need to beat. if you are a person that enjoys shooters that require skill, map knowledge, intelligence and much more counter strike is a both great and cheap game for you!",5
"unfortunately not as good gameplay wise as 1.6 or source, but still has a lot of good features.",1
"good game but hard to rank up. i am in silver 1 and for some reason none of my quickscopes hit. the registration is bs. if there is a fix someone tell me pls -_- k thnx",3
"a great addictive, competitive shooter that we all know and love... the thing is, when you buy this game, with it comes originality, you can customize your weapons to the max. but the thing that separates cs:go from cod, bf4,3..., and other, is the core mechanics of the strategic gameplay it-self. but lately they lost their mojo for this game and did some odd things to it. but it pulls through, and stays a terific game... all-around, an awesome strategic fps.! :d",5
"a real must to have in the coop-taktical genere.its great fun and if you are five persons then its even better. i would absolutely recommend this game.its time less and you can play many matches in a row without feeling like you are doing the same thing over and over again.",2
"if you like counter strike, its a game that you must buy !!!",2
"great game, great graphics and content, flawless ranking system and it isnt pay to win",6
"its very cool and i like the new competitive mode its very awesome (play mm with friends!!!). also valve can you add to drop ammo? here is scenario: you and one more friend have wasted all ammo on the riffles in you and that on the ground. you both have p250 and you dont have ammo and your friend have alot of it. he drops 1 reloading clip (ammo) and that way you have ammo to kill the other team. that way you can make competitive more fun :d!!!",3
"its really really violent, you kill people all the time, and you even have to plant bomb device every now and then. 9/10 would play again.",5
"bought this game, played online, learned fluent russian 2 weeks later.",1
"csgo is the most interactive, and competitive game i have ever played. well done.",7
"kill someone with botgun- noob get killed with botgun- rekt bish kill someone with p90- omg, buy normal weapons get killed with p90- get on my level! kill someone in headshot from far distance- hacker, reported! get killed from far distance- this is how you play cs:go, noob! kill someone with knife- omg, this is cs, use guns. get killed with knife- omg, i have skills, rekt skrub! 10/10 its ok -ign",6
"game is cool, but those prices, are you serious? 300$ knife (more than in real life, what the heck? lol) gaben be like loads of money... its raining money! dosh so, tf2 - hat simulator cs:go - xxxknife simulatorxxx? unbox reactions though... oooooooooooohhhhhhhhh completely gold karambit gay? aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahah karambit case hardened?????? oh my gooaaaaaahahahahah woah aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh",1
"besides all the money i get from this game, and the  items i always get back... i absolutely love this game, would reccomend!",1
"probably.. no let me refrase that. this is the best counter-strike version ive ever played. if you have your doubts about this game then i really recommend that you try it on a friends account. if that dont work.. just buy, you wont regret it. yours truly incite.",1
"this game has kept me entertained for a while. the matchmaking may be broken as  due to the overwhelming amount of smurfs you get in every game. the hacking in this game is becoming less of a problem as gaben and his team work to fix it. the price of this game is well worth it in my opinion.",2
"at first this was my go to game, but then i started getting a little better and it was getting more interesting as i played through the game. i only played casual, team death match, and demolition because i was to scared to go into competetive. after 60 or 70 hours logged in the game i decided, whats the worst that can happen? so i hit the accept button and i was fired up! when i play casual i suck, but when i play competetive im actually way better than i usually am! reason why is i get this huge amount of andrenaline that makes me be able to play like never before! im not the best, but i just love sitting down and enjoying this game for a good hour or 2 or 3 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8... you get the idea. in short fps lovers will enjoy this game for many years to come.",2
"great game if your to good you will be called a hacker if you die you are called a noob 10/10",4

"alot of russians. lower your max acceptable matchmaking ping and pray! 10/10",5
"super fun game with lots of cool guns and skins, and a great community!",5
"i can confirm that this game is amazing. as long as you have a good team, 128 tick server and no anger issues :) also, silvers have all the good weapons & cant use them while on the other hand higher ranks dont have  for skins & can 360 qs with a awp crossmap hs.",8
"best first-person shooter game ever on steam! highly recommmended. just go for it! you will find this game interesting, very interesting actually. good support, no crashes, good fps and what else do you want ? the team support!!!",1
"you buy guns, you shoot enemies, you plant and defuse bombs. if you like doing that, then give this a try.",2
"good mmofps based game with a good competitive scene :d",3
"its a very skill based, frustating game, yet awesome at the same time.",4
"a very amusing fps-shooter game made for pros, which id like to categorize myself as. good job, valve! plz gib me free skinz!1 10/10",4
"ive gone through at least 3 keyboards, purchased 4 seperate copies, spent >50 on skins and subscribed to 4 cs:go twitch.tv channels, all because of this one game. what can i say? its the purest fps shooter that money can buy. no killstreaks, no deathstreaks, no commander mode, no marksman bonuses, nothing. you buy a gun, aim it at someones head, and bang; the person with the highest skill level level will make it out alive. thats why the game is still so popular. if you enjoy the fps genre, do yourself a favour... buy this game.",6
"awesome game just little lag when h press esc while match i think because my pc is little old otherwise this is monster game",1
"just enough new to be different, just enough old to be the same great game.",5
"great game, although i would like to see a russian filter adapted. russians, russians everywhere.",10
"this is best game what ever made it is cool 2 haedshot noob. everything is good (map, gun, cool skin) only bad part of game when ppl insalt hair",5
"i like it because of the gogo girls - cody brooks (and well, the game is called cs:go so yeah, gogo girls... geddit? heheueheuheue) and well, i tried to play arms race but you still run on feet. =/ so i give this game 3/10 because of that b...but.. but... you know what? f*ck it. 11/10 got cody brooks in it.",2
"other than the fact that im a total noob at this game, and that the community sucks, its fun. 10/10 would buy",1
"this game has survived for this long and here is the reason why. its a simple game that requires tremendous skill and knowledge of the map and the people that you are playing with. its great for all types of gamers casual and competitive and i personally give it 2 thumbs way up and would recommend to anyone looking for a phenomenal fps game to play! keep up the good work counter strike!",4
"it is a very good game with good graphics and a great gameplay.",4
"lol nothin like cod but its ok. no akimbo  that, also you can;t aim down the sight?? wtf anyway, for poor kids id reccomend this game (15bucks lol) but id rather play codghosts when this game has dogs ill play, also needs an epic campaign mode",1
"its difficult to put my finger on it, but i cant stop playing this game, its well made, i honestly think its that simple!",2
"this game is not for the short run...its a way of gaming, its a way of life, it is a passion for competetive e-sport....once you go deep in this, theres not a single other game out there that could satisfy you this much.",2
"getting called a smurf has never felt so good. 11/10 would be called a smurf again",2
"great fun, awesome community.(trolls are hilarious!) 5 stars! will flash-bang again.",2
"good match making, most of the time at least. great fun, with loads of features.",3
"great game, brings me back to cs 1.6. competitive matches are always interesting. definitely recommend this game.",7
"gud game would recommend :> also less cheater than in css",5
"this game makes me want to punch a hole straight through my monitor.",1
"great game with some pretty good maps! would reccomend to others.",2
"its really funny playing competitive. what you need to do, is that when youre last person with a shotgun, you run to the spot where there is the most long range possibilites, then, you have to knife as much as possible. youll start crying from laughter. but the kicker, the tapatio to the quesadilla, the cheese to the bun, music! prepare for the laugh of a lifetime!",2
"the game sucks , you will spend all your money on crates. its a trap!",3
"counter-strike: global offensive, its a great game but fans of the older serise hoping it will be the same be weary of this game. while the graphics are vastly improved from the older installments the game, the game plays very diffrently from its older brothers. if youre fine with that and want to put about 20$ into the game just on skins, then go ahead and buy this game. no really, its actually good you should probably buy this game. 10 / 10 this game is ok",7
"this game has no killstreaks like when i did not get a nuke when i got 25 kills with no deaths and how much this game does not need that boll*cks seriously buy this game its good it makes my d*ck hard and bungs me and everyone elses boose 10/10.",2
"its a little hard to understand the game at first but as you play it longer and longer it gets easy",1
"in this game is to hard to get a frag for cod gamers.",4
"the best game ever, its my favourite please buy , this this is sooo epic",4
"this is a great game and very smooth, although there are some things here and thier that could change. but overall thumbs up.",4
"the classic thinking mans shooter, updated with contemporary graphics and online fixins, this is the only fps for me. period. it was preceded by counter-strike source, probably one of the greatest competitive fps games of all time, and only added great things to it with the new update. the console version sucks, this is the one to play. like someone before me said more eloquently, you either die like a -s c r u b- , or live long enough to be called a hacker...",1
"in this game, you can kill a chicken with a grenade, so its a good game i guess",4
"great fps game that takes a lot of skill to master but the reward is fantastic. killing another player is so satisfying because you know you have to work for every kill. highly recommended.",1
"this game is just a classic, i came back to steam just to play counter strike the game brings memories as the devs stick on the same idea of a clean fps shooter which keeps you glued to a chair while playing it,the game has everything what a counter strike should have even now cs 1.6 and source are still beeing played these kind of games never die. lets say if you are huge fan of the game or you want to try a frist person simple shooter from a scratch i suggest this game! lets roll <3",1
"this is a good game just dont play it for about a week after there is a sale...",5
"one of the best and most addictive games ive ever played in my entire life! :) 10/10",3
"66 tick is annyoing as hell but other than that yea its nice 9/10",2
"counter-strike: global offensive is an extremely fun game, ive been playing it for countless hours and i just enjoy it a lot. the graphics are nice and simple and you dont have to be good to enjoy the game. it is a very competitive game and i personally enjoy that. i highly recommend this game if you like fpss and competitive games.",4
"so personally this is my second best game beaten by civilizations. i love how the game can drastically change who is winning the game. i bought this game when it came out for like 2$ then like a month ago i started playing it and it is so fun. i may not be the best player but i really recommend this game. buy now!",3
"a great fps game. if you ever get money on your account you should remember that this game is a must have. i think that it would be better if it had hats, but thats just my opinion.",2
"im bad at this game. but my gun looks awesome!!! :d 9/10 great game!!",2
"man this game is great you should really go buy it... *snicker*",2
"very fun to play! would recommend for anyone looking for first person shooters!",6
"in this game you play as john counterstrike a white man who has had his freedom soiled by brown people. being on a angry rampage against allah you shot the brown people. the game has great characters which a portayed accuratly like the angry russains charactrs are spot on. the story fluxuates as john counterstrike loses matches and wins. this story was so emotionaly ahead of its time i curled up and cried for three weeks after john counterstrikes wife gold nova 3 was lost and he got stuck with gold nova 2. 10/10 would curl up to cry for three weeks again.",3
"this game is my life. i love this game. i had all the gun skins and knives. my dad sometimes walk in and call me names, but i know he is just jealous that hes not silver elite master like me. he tells me to goto sleep every night when i stay up till 2am. my bed is very cold without cs:go next to me. something is getting closer. a warmth came upon me. it was bot minh. he told me this is my dust_2 spaghetti. highly recommended. must play. 10/10. amazing. glorious. great character development.",4
"10/10 best game 2014 even though it came out ages ago but yh would buy eu 2014 gg wp",3
"cs:s + tf2s hats concept = this game. barbie for guns.",1
"yet another revision of this classic game. still based on the source engine, it has brought a brand new design co-developed by hidden path entertainment. it takes a little getting used to but once you get the hang of it, its tons of fun!",1
"not only does this game contain small angry little 8 year old russians, screaming and yelling at you. the game contains one little thing, that can change your view of life in many different hateful ways, the thing is called recoil. it is everywhere in the game, and will make you force yourself to smile while youre crying because those angry little russians keeps on shooting you and somehow doesnt get banend in competetive. because the game has all these russian kids, valve had to do something about it. they couldnt just ban all russians, because 2/3 of their players would be gone. so they made this simple little thing that would make you keep on playing.. being able to make money. yup, you heard me. by playing a single little match, you could make up to 40. that is, if youre lucky enough and/or havent quit yet because of the russians. so basically, this game is a test, which will haunt, irratate, slowly kill and torture you. 7/10 would reccomend",3
"its like watching korean girls stream on afreeca tv",1
"much fun such awesome so amaze very shoot much teamplay wow",4
"this game is fun but sometimes you have team mates that are straight up",1
"a strategically team-based first person shooter. requires teamwork and fun to play",1

"infinite replay value with this game, all the guns are amazing and suited to anyones playing style.",2

"amazing game, certainly the best fps. once youre into it you wont stop playing.",5
"starting with 1.6 till now cs simply ,,, the best game ever !!",4
"this game actually needs skill its hard but i love it i gave up cod ghost for this in all honesty",2
"game play is same as cs 1.6. better graphics new weapons and new gameplay mods. i highly recommand this game. but if you are in pakistan, it will be hard for you to find servers of this game.",2
"ths gem is the prequl to the strtrgy gm cntr strik: sauce but in this gm everyon looks rely prety and u can spend mony to get paintd guns so ppl kno tht ur rely togh cos ur campr gun hs flams",1
"this game is recommended for hardcore fps players.",3
"much more enjoyable thatn cs source, but not quite as solid as 1.6. however, it makes up for it with creative map balancing changes, pretty graphics, a better ui, and awesome character models. for $15, you cant go wrong. the only bad thing is they did away with the original voice files. included are now such sayings as listen to me brothers and were not going on a windy walk",5

"very nice!! everyone should get it! low end machines are able to run it nicely ;)",3
"best fps game known to man kind, flooded with strats, trolls... and badass painted skins. the competitive feature to this game is 25 percent bad and 75 percent good the bad part is the trolls and the people who dont know what the hell they are doing. these players make the team aspect of this game bad. that is why you play with teams :3. the good part is the teammates who are fun to play with even when you loose. but nerver forget that when one plays this game one is the person that could change the game forever!",3

"the best game i have ever played. takes skill which is why cod players dont recomend it. the skin system is very nice but very expensive. and the ranking system isnt too hot either but it is very fun and me and my friends enjoy it",6
"good. obviously someone somewhere will hack, play on an alternate account or play below their potential to fight lower rank players and so on, but such is life; and in the words of a dnd gamer: theyre worth more exp.",4

"#1 fps on pc (in my opinion) this game is a must have. i like how the game devs communicate with the players to make the game turn for the best. also every few months a new operation comes out, basically a dlc, to keep the game interesting, fun, and add new content.",6

"i love it. probably the best fps game that is out now. cant wait for the newest counter-strike game, played counter-strike: source it was awesome! but this game is 100 times better! ive had my down sides, and up sides, the best momments are the up sides. hopefully i get more up sides in this game. best game ive played in a while! still play it! and will play it! untill i get bored of it, which will be hopefully never time soon! :)",3

"eath is a great teacher. failure in counter-strike: global offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldnt have done, and how you could have done better. counter-strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. growth is an important factor in global offensive, especially if youre coming into counter-strike fresh or after a sabbatical. this is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. if youre a call of duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. counter-strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.",3
"this game is beautiful. it has a pretty poor comunnity at times but its stilll fun. it takes a while to get used to , and very hard to find kind people, but i enjoy it",9

"cs:go is a really good game. not made for a casual gamer.",6
"this game is simply the best fps there is! why? all the reasons i can think of are listed below? lets start of simple: 1: the game is cheaper than most other titles in the genre, and still it delivers extremly solid gameplay value. 2:other shooting games may get boring overtime but this games competetive gamemode keeps every match exiting. 3:both reflexes, skill and teamwork is important so if youre a  dont buy this game. 4:the overwatch system and the brilliant steam support team keeps the hackers away! 5:the community.......the community is what really, really makes the game so great!(atleast 90% of it) 6:im just gonna say it.... im addicted to skin collecting and box opening, chances are that you will become addicted aswel!",8

"i do not have a lot of hours on this game, but from playing css and cs 1.6 i can say they have done an outstanding job. i love counter strike and will always love the game, people care about graphics pfffft, it is all about gameplay and this game has it. it is 1000x better than cod and all other first person shooter, if you are looking for a game that will bring a lot of fun to you this is the game to get. once you get into it, you can never stop playing from how fun the game is, best gameplay, best first person shooter and i strongly recommend this game.",3
"great game! compared to the good old counter-strike 1.6, the graphics are alot better and they added new game mods. also weapon skins are cool and competitive game mode is great! i recommend this game!",3

"i love the game. it requires some skill though, but ofcourse you could always practise in the game. the best thing about its ranks. they speak a lot about how youre doing in game. the game is not recommended for ragers (you will probably lose a lot of money on breaking keyboards.) 10/10",6

(if you wanna show off a little.) you can get these skins in things called a weapon case. there are currently about like 9 different types of cases i believe. you can unlock these cases ingame or buy them off the steam market. certain ones are very common, but others you have to have a special pass. bravo, payback, phoenix, and the newly released breakout. you can buy these passes to unlock new maps and the ability to unlock the cases of that specific opertation! overall i would recommend this game!",10

"global offensive delivers for us faithful cs followers--a step up from 1.6 and source.",2
"very nice game, no its not that complex (pff youd wish..) and theres no ads for guns except for the awp, scar & g3 which have scopes. is it a nice looking, well sold, e-sports supportive game with a great community and a very competitive community for that matter? yes, and that just makes it great! buy or die!!! :d",2
"omg! i cant believe i have never played this before. to think all the years i have wasted play call of duty. a very good fps is to pick up and play. the action is fast and there is always a game going. picked this up on sale/ this is the best money i have spent on steam so far. i recommend this to anybody that wants some fast action or a extended session of first person action!",1

"at first,i thought this game was sh!t. no aiming,no sprinting,and all that. after some time i decided to play it again with a friend,and now i love it :). you need to get used to the mechanics and when you do,youll get lots of fun and hatred outta it. 11/10 *posted from a cod player*",2
"i cant stop playing! im stuck to the game! 5 stars",7
"as a player with huge heart for quake 3 arena i used to hate counter-strike without really trying to play it. i just saw that people really camp a lot there and something like running or strafing isnt a real option there.. but the the summer sales on steam hit me right into my head and i decided to give cs go a try. ive tried the cs 1.6 and source too but as it is now, ppl mostly play cs:go so i sticked to that. i spend quite a lot of time on this game, i dont think im bad.. guess some of my aim and call for fast thinking from quake was left in me :). conclusion: cs:go is a nice fps game, maybe too good graphics for me, cause sometimes its really hard to see the enemy or to determine if its a friend or an enemy :d.. anyway as long as its a team game i recommend playing it with friends, because random ppl not always know what teamplay does mean. have fun!",7
"an epic. the original multiplayer pc shooter. ith the betht",4
"the true definition of a first-person shooter. counter-strike: global offensive is the cherry on top of the cake of valves masterpieces. probably even better than cs 1.6, this game offers a wide variety of game modes that hook up to the game for hours. the matchmaking system that valve introduced into this game is simply brilliant: matching you with others players who have the same skill as you, or somewhat close, and who live fairly close to you to give the best experience possible to both parties. - as a former professional player, i give this game a 10 out of 10 in my own criteria because the astonishing graphics and the immersive gameplay make this game the best arcade first-person shooter to ever exist.",2
"besides being incredibley addicting, cs:go also packs weapon skins, and stickers to customize your weapons, cs:go is casual fun, except most players take it to seriously, if youre looking for a fps shooter to play, this one definintly conquers other games like cod, linear, but fun.",4

"really addicting game. and never gets booring, always somewhere to improve. lot of russians tho.",3
"let me start off with this is a great game. no doubt about it. i think they have upgraded a lot since counter strike source and they have added so much! they have added new game modes, new graphics and even a new trading system! it makes it the perfect game for old school counter strike players from 1.6. i give this game an obvious 9/10",2
"this game is fantastic, ive played about 48 hours and i just love it. its nearly impossible to get kills when you first start, this is because its such an addicting game, people play it for ages. i love it as a player who has never played any other counter strike. if you have not played any counter strike, i am tellingyou to buy this bloody great game! if u have played counter strike, then i cant say to u cause you would be more experienced than me",6
"good game, hopefully doesnt become f2p while it has serious players needs a damn linux port great game otherwise would recommend, but stay off classic competitive till you know what youre doing (im tired of skrubs team killing cuz they didnt know theres friendly fire in comp).",2

"really worth to pick up if you love fps. while it may not have tanks and vehichles, it makes up in team fire fights. its also worth to pick up because of all the community mods and servers. zombies, mini-games, prisonbreak,etc are all fun game mods.",2

"its strange switching from css to csgo, but once you get the hang of it the new graphics are nice and its fun collecting skins for your weapons. csgo is deffinately harder than cs and css due to all the newer recoil features and such though.",5

"at the moment the most engaging competitive fps multiplayer game arround, strong community and a big prospect to grow much more. reccomend it to new but specially old cs players who dropped after 1.6 because of their distaste to source. i believe this is a better version of both and the competitive matchmaking, even though very flawed has a lot of potencial",3

"great game. i have been a fan of counter strike for a few years now, and this game really impressed me. the graphics are great, and the gameplay is polished and fun. with the addition of a few new game modes like deathmatch, it really adds to the experience from its original objective based gameplay. if you are looking for a great online competitive first person shooter, this game is definately a great choice. 10/10",1
"despite the glaring lack of client-sided modding, the included game modes offer a nice distraction from time to time. its not nearly as versatile as counter-strike: source, but it looks prettier for sure thanks to the new shaders.",1

"best counter- strike out right now, unless your computer sucks then go get cs:s",1
"possibly the greatest fps out there today, i never played the older cs games in their prime so i cant compare go to them. the only downsides i have ever found in this game are the hackers from the terrible anti-cheat system and the horrible registry from the 64 tick servers. other than those problems this game is fun and one of the only fps games i know that require skill to be good. until those problems are fixed i give it an 8/10.",10
"this is the natural evolution of cs. graphics have improved, game play is quite the same (just a bit more dynamic), the community counts tons of online players everyday. i would reccomend you to buy it.",1
"bad, , worst cs ever created, if it wasnt for the money prizes this piece of  would be dead within the first year, wish i never got it, it will give you massive amount of cancer cell generation. id rather give some sloppy  deep throat to a baseball bat with barbed wire wrapped around it while getting repeatedly anal fisted by the entire african dinka tribe.. choke on a chernobyl fart",3
"i once had a life, but that is all over now, cs go has taken that away from me because of my urge for cool skins, and then i was introduced to the competitive ranking system to find myself at silver elite master but before long with many games with not good team mates the dream of being a gold nova has become non existant this game is life this game is love buy it and if you are bad stop playing forever",2
"really good game alot of fun good o play with friends",1
"counter-strike: global offensive is a point and click simulation game, where you play as a travel agent who sends people to paradise.",5
"its an amazing competitive game with friendly players, as you get higher up the ranking the people get a bit more serious, but there still great to talk to. the only critisizme is the cool down system, where if you leave a competitive match you will recieve a 30 min, 24 hour or a 7 day ban, sometimes this is justified, but other times, for instance when you get timed out, and connot rejoin, and then recieve a 7 day ban. this has happned to me 4 times, all there fault. all in all a fantastic game though.",6
"the good and the bad counter strike global offensive release in 2012 prier counter strike 1.6 (cs) and counter strike source (cs:s) the game engine of the game based on the source engine. the concept of the game is great mixing both old counter strike games together with the core mechanics of cs 1.6. the overall experiance of cs:go which was suppose to be based on 1.6, there completely different games the way the guns shoot etc. the good matchmaking system the bad matchmaking system 128 tick servers ant-cheat system certain guns are over powered overall: cs:go is a great game to play, although of its faults, hopefully the dev team can fix the issues with the matchmaking servers and ant-cheat system.",9

"out of my most recent purchases this is one of my favorite. there is a big learning curve on getting those headshots down and using some of the guns. if you are use to aiming down iron sights this game doesnt allow it, however i like the play style well enough to get past that. lots of fun! looking forward to many more hours in game!",1
"its the best ever shooting game ive ever played it has all the fun u need",4
"this game is very fun and addicting. it makes you wanna play match after match. i like the realistic damage of the weapons as well. i also think the addition of weapon camos is great, and it adds a social aspect, trading. i recommend this game, but not for people who enjoy call of dutys fast-paced combat and killstreaks. this game is much more strategically based.",2

"its have been changed a lot this game. now its even better. play and enjoy your game",3

"you shoot people with a gun so i guess its pretty cool",5
"this is an amazing game and is a nice change from most first person shooters!",3
"great game especially since they added the arms deal update :d this game wont let you down",5
"great game from a long running succesful franchise, guns, action, angry noobs, ego boosting trolls, simple design, and days of your time well wasted.",1
"i love this game. i have been playing this game for a while and it is one of the most balacned games on steam.you are able to get skins for your gun but it wont change the stats,only the looks.it is hard to learn how to play well and some people may call you noob but once you do well it is very rewarding.",2
"if you like competetive gameplay this game is for you if you like good physics this game is for you if you like to kill chickens this game is for you if you like to use p90s this game is not for you",3
"100% livesteal i played cs 1.6 since 2004 and 10 years later csgo was the most awesome game for me :d",5
"good game. however you spend most of your life playing it, and the amount of hackers and smurfs in the matchmaking are ridiculous, so you can never really rank up. overall, you waste your life to get nothing out of the game, in fact, youll actually derank more than rank. 4/10 for competitive, anything other than competitive is 9.5/10",8
"i thought cs 1.6 or quake would never be outdated but cs:go managed to make it. ill go straight to the point: this is the best multiplayer shooter game. a real game for esport and casual competition: - a great gameplay for huge possibilities for whoever can appreciate fps games. - an addictive game when you find a team or people to play with. - graphics are great (cs source players, youre going to feel a change) - a high required level of skill, strategy and game sense, so a really competitive community (thats not cod, kids). and the game is still young and probably going to be still improved. as usual, many cheaters and some obnoxious players may blot its copybook, but damn, this game is great.",10
"cs:go is different to most fps games ive played. its got 2 teams, both have an objective, and the teams have weapons that balance out according to the objective. most of the core competitive maps balance out the weapons and objectives even more, and theyre also aesthetically pleasing. cs:go should appeal to all skill levels, with its competitive ranking system youre almost guarenteed to find a balanced game with people your skill level when you play in matchmaking. overall, id probably give cs:go a 9.5/10, it could use some more balancing between the m4a4 and m4a1, but other than that its perfect for an fps of this day and age.",5
"this game is absolutely awesometively kewl. definitely get it.",5
"outstanding game, same gameplay. different textures and remade maps from the past cs games. would recommend this to anyone, who enjoys first person shooter",3
"you shoot people and they dont die. then some ing scrub comes with a 300$ knife and heashots you while running and you derank then you check your inventory and realise you only have  skins because youre not gonna spend money on this  game yes umad",5
"ing start playing some error  come up okay i start sliding around like ice skating then i get a 24 hour cooldown for no reason i wait the cooldown play comp start play plus its a money waster put in 10$ worth of keys unbox and get 5c wepons in return  you gaben you do nothing to help with these ing errors!",3
"very good game i would give it 7 out of 10 because there are some bug like closing a game,but i think the steam will fix that!",7
"this game is as complex as it is simple. two teams struggle over control of a small map. counter-terrorists must save hostages or defuse a bomb. terrorists must keep their hostages or plant a bomb and blow up a target. as easy as this may sound, a great deal of skill and practice must go into this game before you can good at it. however once you get good it is well worth it. with multiple game modes and an affordable price with constant deals bringing it down often. you wont get bored easily with this fifteen year old classic.",3
"this game is awsome, i just cant play other games, i play this game all day and all night :d, cause its awsome and a good game. the cs 1.6 is awsome too and its like first global offensive and the real one is second. 10/10 i hope this game will be the best forever.",5
"this is the wurst game evur i recuumend it right nauuuu",7
"didnt like it at first over cs:s because it looked to much like call of duty. after playing it more its a very good game thats a lot more fun than cs:s. any fps fan should buy it.",1
"i have had this game for the last 5 to 6 months since school started back in august, since then i have gained around 1300 hours or so and i very much love the game, i just got my first knife and personally love how the game works, i am very competitive, so this is right down my path...",9
"cs:go brings new strategy on the classic game. longtime players will find many of the maps to be familiar but revised and imrpoved. slight tweaks have been made throughout to make the game even for both teams. an upgrade on source, but some may prefer the original.",4
"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",2
"my friend bought over 9000 keys and cases and didnt even get one knife and because of that he killed himself with a hotdog!",3
"awesome shooter. its very well balanced, despite the  community, like any other competitive game. deserves a 10/10 for me.",3
"out of all the first person shooters i played, this is one of my best games i ever played. the games are balanced, weapons are balanced, and better than fps like call of duty and battlefield. a lot of skins you can get and is awesome. i would rate this 9.5/10 the community is kinda toxic and you will hear people saying a lot of swears",2
"competitive: recommended if you like russians, and people screaming at you for not being a csgo master. never played the others, who does?",2
"great game! simply amazing, perfect graphics, perfect gameplay and still its the best old school shooter. i think it is even better than battlefield !!! well spend money ! :)",7
"counter-strike: global offensive, where teamwork is laughable and everyone is russian. 10/11",2
"good game. doesnt have aim abilities for most weapons like cod does which adds to its unique challenging gameplay. highly addictive and recommended to players looking for a fps.",2
"my favourite game one of the few you never get bored of.",1
"crappy d2-like mm, and of course counter strike cant live without  camos and kills tracking versions of weapons. moar hatz and crates",2
"was unsure about this, thinking the game couldnt get any better after cs:source but it can and it has! makes it more competitive friendly and easy to find servers. gameplay is the same but improvements in the maps and their enviroments but are the same as the classics, though this time you cant pick what skin you wanna use but the skins are decidided according to the map/area and the audio voices are now varied which gives boost to the game and makes it abit interesting. though menu can feel some times its made for controller/joypad but you get used to it in no time. only a downside in my opinion is that, once you get a cs:go ingame case which includes weapon skins and thats that., which you have to buy with real $ a certain key to open it, but you can choose to just sell it, though the temptations sometimes overcomes me and thats my problem hehe.",4
"this game is really fun to play with freinds i whould r8 8/8 m8 its gr8",4
"the only problem with this game is the community. it is full of s. its even worse than dota 2. valve doesnt seem to care enough to try to fix this huge problem though.",2
"ur my gurd this is like the best freaking game ever i think i might have a gambling addiction but who the  cares?",1
"great fun for people who loved the previous games or if you are just looking for a new fps to start playing, definitely recommended.",2
"an amazing game one of the best shooters u have to play it ..",1
"by far, one of my favorite games i own on steam. its going to be one of those games that you can play for countless hours and enjoy because of the community. there will be frustration and enjoyment all in one. and who can beat all this entertainment and fun for only 15 bucks. i highly recommend this game.",3

"this games very good and fun!! highly recommend!! :d",8
"amazing fps game that is very competitive. will get u addicted in seconds. 10/10",5
"this game is absolutely great. has the same mechanics as the original counter strike that launched back in 2000 but with slight improvements that make the game more enjoyable than the original counter strike such as better graphics/hit detection. personally, my favorite feature that this game has to offer is the competetive matchmaking. competetive is a lot of fun, especially when you assemble a full team to play with. competetive encourages team work which is something that most modern day shooters dont really push. i would highly recommend this game over cod or battlefield. for the price ($15), this game is most definitely worth it, not to mention that i managed to get it for around $4 during the 2013 steam winter sale. anyways, bottom line: if you want a game that is simple but yet tons of fun, counter strike: global offensive is definitely the way to go.",2

"the third game of the famous counter-strike franchise. the graphics in cs:go are amazing , as well as the gameplay. this version includes more gamemode to play , weapon drops and weapon skinning (making weapon skins for valve to add by submiting them on cs:gos workshop.), its also a good way to make some profit for your steam wallet. you can do that by simply playing and selling your drops on the steam community market. however if you plan on quiting durring a competetive match , its not recommended. youll be given a few bans and after that every single quit will lead up to a 7 day ban. cs:go is like counter-strike combined with team fortress 2. its a title that deserves the money. tl;dr ive invested too much to fall back now.",3

"awesome game. very enjoyable. the graphics are great, barrely any laggs at all and the best of all, you can enjoy playing with your friends! the only thing i probably dislike about the game is the community. it has nothing to do with the game itself but the majority of the players are very rude or immature.",5

"simply addictive and absolutely fun to play both alone and with your friends",2
"at first i thought, why do i need cs:go when i have cs:s?, well, that changed when i got this. there is so much more involved in cs:go than cs:s. personally, its a lot better and more fun to play. get the game now you fool, you wont regret it!!! :d",1

"this game is probably the most fun ive had in a while. at first its hard getting used to if youve played games like call of duty or battlefield. the aim is totally different but its very competitive so you learn quickly from the people that are playing. i recommend 10/10.",5
"i only bought this on the last day of the holiday sale, thinking that i would just shelve this game and sell the cards. boy was i wrong. from that time preiod till now, ive over 3 days worth of gametime put into this. very recommended.",5
"super fun, i used to be a console gamer and csgo is much better than call of duty and the community is better.",1
"same problem as css: great game, bad community. the ranking system does a good job to filter out all the trash talking elitists, but thats only if youre playing competitive. outside of that, the new casual modes (arms race, demoltion, deathmatch) are great fun to play with a small group of friends, regardless of skill level. at the same time, playing competetive with a few friends you trust can be an extremely rewarding experience. in the end its a valve game, and i dont think much more needs to be said than that.",2

"i am sick of games such as counter-strike:global offensive being considered actual competitors to games such as cod. in counter-strike, your gun doesnt even shoot straight, meaning that the entire game is based on luck. you can spray at someone for days, and all the bullets will normally miss. unless you are lucky, then you will get a head-shot. if you dont have much money, i would recommend that you go and give tf2 a try. although tf2 came out before cs:go, i can assure you that it is leaps and bounds better than cs:go. if i were in charge at valve, i would change tf2s name to cs:go 2. it is not only better than cs:go, but it is also free.",4
"although a lot of stupid, , antisocial and sometimes maybe cheating people run around in this game, and unfortunately you have to play with then sometimes... still it makes fun and wont let you go so easily for a long long time. so beware of its addiction factor. but maybe im one of the people described above. dont let the game get to you so hard, try to have fun and take it easy, thats what i should consider more often!",9
"just buy it, your a member of steam and its a counter-strike game.",6
"what do i expect from a cs? lots of fun and tactical gameplay. since cs.go grants these, its as good as any cs before. its ofc a change from cs:s to cs:go because they made recoil changes and so on, but come on, its time for change as gold ol obama would say, so get up, train hard or die tryin. good luck!",1
"this game is just like muhammad alis swing to the foremans jaw....",4
"counter strike global offensive is a game which refuses to conform to modern first person shooters. this is what makes it such an amazing game. i love a game which is purely about your own skill, not about what weapons you have unlocked, what rank you are or how much real money you need to pay for advantages such as better weapons. there is a real competitive atmosphere revolving around this game. players actually work together as a team, communicate to each other, manage their economy and as a result will grant them victory. the complexity behind cs:go is immense and this makes it extremely fun to play. its a mind game, its a maths game, its a strategy game, its a shooter game and its a valve game. need i say more?",4
"i poked my head out of a door for two seconds before getting awped 0/10 put sherk in.",4
"teamwork and skill are the standouts that gap this shooter from many others. improves on previous cs editions with imporved mechannics and alot of balancing along with micro-purchases. this game is highly addicting with a strong emphasis on co-operation and and mental strengh teamed with aim and many other factors. with the goods there are still problems; the biggest being the community, with many people hacking or generally being a pain in the . i highly recommend this game for anyone that loves shooters and competive games.",6
"i dont know how they made cs better, but they found a way.",2
"this game can be really really really fun or a life ruiner...community is also beyond random. ranging for really annoying kids and trolls to really hardcore  . but when you meet in the middle its an experience like no other so i guess its alright despite the really inconsistent people. the game itself is amazing though so thats what makes up for it. takes a ton of skill also so not for the filthy casuals. if youre new to cs...gl hf youre in for the  breating of a lifetime 10/10 would derank again",2
"i have many feeling for this game, i love it but yet hate it. i will start off with the hates, one of the main things about this game are the prices of in-game items. such as keys for example. i personally think that these keys are way too much. really? $2.50 a piece? that crazy, now the cases, those are different story. cases are pretty decently even with price wise. 10 cents to around 50 cents at the max. but keys, its like paying for a gallon of a gas a key. now for the good side of what i think of this game. i love this first person shooter/ competive/team work game. its action packed, gets your heart pumping, and is alot of fun. but one thing i do wish valve does in the future is that they decrease the price of their items. its insane, my rating: 9/10",7
"a slightly better looking addition in the counterstrike series, it delievers its promise of new gamemodes and inovation and is literally the best built competitive multiplayer shooter on the market. along with multiple community servers full of fun game modes that bring a never ending amount of fun. and its 15$ what more to say.",2

"i used to be super into good graphics and fancy new innovations in shooters, however, cs:go is a breath of fresh air in comparison to a lot of fps games on the market today. i played a tiny bit of source, but never really got into counter strike until now. the main thing i love about this game is actually its integration with the steam market place. the steam market makes the game more three dimensional, because it adds skins to your guns. you can buy and sell skins on the steam marketplace, and the entire system functions as its own economy. the steam workshop is also a cool feature, because after a few months pass, valve takes some designs from the community workshop and integrates them into the game. external websites also make cs go fun, because there are sites to bet on professional games and also trade with others. 9.5/10",6

"awesome, just look out for the people who can no scope across the map.",2
"best game i ever seen! :d i have more than 4 accounts more than 150$ in my inv from cs go and im still enjoying the game i will never stop playing it! the competitive is awesome",6
"so fun, especially in custom servers like minigames or jailbreak. great new game modes compared to old counter strike games. not so long ago, they implemented a skins update where people (and valve) make a profit from all the skins they sell and trade with each other. its a great way to show yourself to others through skins. (and to show that you can afford some or to brag :p)",5
"really good if youre into farming sims with chickens",1
"awesome game, definitely a change from its predecessor counter-strike: source. i wouldnt describe it as an upgrade, nor a downgrade, but rather a completely new feel. definitely worth getting.",2
"by far my favorite game. i love playing this with friends and i enjoy the item system. 9.5/10",3
"how to be a pro knifu stealth and kill with knifu of course 8/10",1
"if youre not already playing it, you should be. even if youre mainly a cod player, it can really help you develop some great tactics that transition from game to game.",2
"this is a really fun and addicting game, youshould decently buy it",1
"this game plays so well, the in-game matchmaking system is pretty good despite what others might say. the graphics in this game are better than in cs:s, enough to be a nice difference but not enough to blind you. the buy menu in this game is a vast improvement over the previous ones, where memorizing hotkeys were necessary. the workshop and the combination of the operations makes for a game that doesnt get old. 10/10",3
"its freaking counter-strike why you even need a recommendation , its one of the best fps game out there !",4
"to this day the cs series remains the most suitable for competitive play. quick aim, map knowledge, smart grenades, good tactics and mindgames is what you need to be successful. highly recommended",9
"killed a chicken and gained 1 point for my team 11/10",2
"this is one of the most difficult shootinggames i played. so much accuracy needed. besides that it is a great game for amusement.",6
"the good points: cs:go isnt reinventing the wheel of first person shooters. if youve played any iteration of counter-strike over the years, youll find most of the content very familiar. that said, go adds enough to keep it interesting. all of the weapons feel unique and the variety of gameplay modes will mean endless hours of entertainment. the bad points: ive been playing video games for a long time and the cs:go community might be the worst ive ever dealt with. in addition to the run-of-the-mill trash talk, you can expect to be inundated with anti-semitic, racist, and/or homophobic slurs (ive heard some people use all three at a time to insult other players). i dont think ive ever heard someone say something insightful on the mic in all of the matches ive played. your best bet is to simply mute as many players as possible. all in all, a great game as long as you ignore what everyone says during a match.",1
"game based on skill, sometimes luck. really good fps.",3
"amazing game !!!!!!!!!! from pubs to comp its a all out great game.",2
"some pros are on vacations, but over all for the average gamer, cheating is not as bad as they are making it out to seem.",1
"cs go... where to start... this game has a lot of great and a lot of bad stuff. i will not deny any of the problems cs go has... for example the tick rates and bad community. but the game has a lot of good stuff aswell and tries somewhat to keep the old cs running. i would rather play cs:s tho but cs go has better popularity and competative match making. this game is like 50/50 when it comes to skill and luck. if you keep your crosshair on someones head from a long distance and just one taps theres a 50/50 that you hit or miss because the game did not register the shot. 128 tick might make this like 80/20 or 90/10 that you will hit but still  when you compare to the older versions of cs history. i think this game is worth it tho. you can play this game for days without end and still have lots of fun if you play with your friends. i recommend you to get a team of some sort and play your way up in ranks.. best way.",6
"its the most competetive fps game out there allthough its very hard, and will take a long time to get good at it. most fps games you are just runnnig and gunnnig, in this game you actually have to be good at it. pro: cheap dont take a expensive computer to run the game smooth always new stuff to do there is a workshop for people who wanna be creative steam market to buy and sell in-game skins and items its not a buy-to-win game cons: it takes a really long time to be good at the game.",7
"i dont even have this game. how am i able to review this?",1
"meet interesting people, and knife them when they fail to wear headphones. every summer this is hands down the most fun you will experience making 12 year old children cry, without the risk of a restraining order. listen to their pre-pubescent cries of omg h4x as an endless series of small children who all claim to have slept with our mothers fail to understand that the ak-47 is perfectly accurate on the first shot, and that awps can kill through walls. 10/10 would make the children suffer again.",3
"this game is all around good game addicting too if youre into fps shooters youd love this one its a little difficult for starters and gets frusturating but eventually youll understand how it works and how to be accurate once you get that down its a 10/10 game graphics arent the best but you get used to it, its gameplay that counts. you should really get this its a must buy game",5
"csgo continues the brutal, infuriating, and wonderful counter-strike series that taunts you to be a better player with every game. i was somewhat skeptical during the beta before the addition of the casual mode, but the continuous updates and gameplay additions makes it the new tf2 in my mind. the bifurcation of competitive from casual and gungame does a good job grouping players with like minds. this title is endlessly playable with a vibrant community that is quite a bit more mature than the cod (fish?) players that slime around the net. the map system and continued mod extensibility makes it a premiere title on steam. my lame complaints (no more tmp) (mp7/ump are too awful) (aimpunch kinda broken) dont really detract from the goodness to be had. graphics got a very nice upgrade over source and most of the maps got carried over. 9/10 for my next obsession.",6
"really good and funny game. the best thing is the rank system. skins. skins. ez skins ez life",3
"ahem, allow me to begin this review with a bang. *bang* that is one thing you will hear a lot in counter-strike, mainly because youre blowing your own brains out in real life because of randomers on matchmaking calling you a noob team and saying wtf noob. but ive talked about one of the bad things, lets talk about a good thing, the guns go badaboom, pow pow, bim bam ding. overall, id say this game was 5/5 codpiece laces and id highly recommend calling your team mates codpieces for comedic effect.",4

"addictive fun. if you die you really wanna get revenge on the guy that killed you while rinsing and repeating it which makes it all the better.",1
"awesome game... hours and hours of fun with your friends :d",1
"this game is truly amazing. launching it is like a gateway drug, to more counter strike. if you want some tense, nervewracking clutch situations, competitive is for you, but be warned; silvers will do the most messed up tactics, call you a hacker if you see them or kill them, or if you even win a game, i never knew how many 12 year olds had ed so many peoples mums there is not enough lifevests left. however, there are some good community servers too, full with surf, hs deathmatch, jailbreak, bhop etc. which is good until you meet the admins, 90% of admins are 12 year old donators who abuse the  out of their power",4
"its nice and awesome for me :) competitive play sometimes can be unpleasant because of cheaters or communication issue with your team. there are many good/decent players and sadly, more than few bad apples. if you find the team for you its awesome :)",4

"this is an all around good game for people who are color blind. most of the time (atlest, for me) youll be drunk out of your mind, and will only be able to feel your bulding cancerous lump in your genital region. it was very enjoyable for me to play, even though there was no budder implemented (i wrote a death note to valve so that will change soon).",1

"garbage game compared to cod or bf4 dont waste your money",2
"this game will bring you alot of fun and hours played, ive played the first counterstrike 7 years ago. ive been a counter-strike fan since i first tried it out. ive got a total of 4000 hours in total of all the counter-strike games combined over my 7 years of service. this game is alot of fun and the operations are really great! if you feel like you dont hit, either become a better player by training your aim and reaction, or you could switch from valves standard 64 tick (64 updates per second) to a paid 128 tick server (costs if youre gonna do it the pro way, some free servers for it in the server browser). this game is very cheap and on some sales (which is common), it can cost around 3. thats the price you sell one or two cases for, which drops very common! this game is updated and maintained alot. this is a very good game and i support it to 100%.",4
"just good ol cs nothing else. if you have cs:source you can pretty much skip this title. as for the game itself it can be pretty fun but i wont recommend it due to large amount of crashes. wtf valve fix this f*** map change crash.. oh and when you put multicore rendering on? haha game crashes like every 5 minutes. you need to tweak your cs:go to fully enjoy it.",1
"this game is amazzingggg. i have 3 accounts because of wanting to play with all of my friends. my old main had 1700hrs.",2

"if you like 1.6, you will like this game, pretty addictive game, more fun with skins. recommended.",8
"a nice game, very intense and more realistic than the versions before it.",5
"cs has evolved so much over the years and to me cs:go is hands down the best one in the series a lot of you may disagree but to me the game is a mixture of 1.6 and source its also extremely fun to play , the game works kind of like tf2 when it comes to items you get different skins for guns and knifes theres tons of modes to play plus all the mods you can watch live matches and theres just a lot of content for a great price if your looking for a fun fps to play i recommend cs:go is your looking for a game to get really competitive in i suggest this, overall its an amazing game that any fan of the genre well fall in love with 8.5/10",1
"people with aimbot and wallhack in almost every game. you watching them as a spectacular and see that they can see through the walls. it is not pro skills, when someone watching and aiming at you though 3 walls and waiting when youll come closer, also too pro snipers, that killing everyone by shooting in the air. they scared and shooting not even in player and making headshots. how? lol dont tell me *t that this is pro players with super skills. game is ok. but vac is too weak.",1
"another great game by valve team, its fun, great graphics, there is competition between players and much more fun things, i suggest to buy this game",3

"never played this thing. my 1st hour of playing was discovering how to buy grenades, now i can kill people with boom.",1
"global offensive is definitely a counter-strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. this is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game thats as satisfying now as it ever was, but its for a specific kind of player. if youre not willing to learn to play different than youre used to, look elsewhere. otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.",2
"this game is a great fps better than call of duty in some ways",1
"this game is amazing besides the smurfs when your a low level but once u get a higher rank most of that dies down overal though great game.",4
"csgo is just only for fun it is educational game too. i have learned so much team playing skills for example how to use flashes correctly and also not to hurt my team friends. my knowledge of languages have also increased much while playing this. i know now what  and blyat means ocks att alla finnen r jvl , fittan. i have also learned that my mum is such a hore because she have slept with like 50% of all cs gamers. in my opinion i think that cs:go is 4,5/5 game. -0.5 comes from trash drops, like sticker capsules.",3
"this game is great, although its really hard to get into. if you come in expecting anything similar to cod or battlefield, prepare to get completely wrecked. at the end of the day, if you want to play competetively, its all about map knowledge, strategy, and teamwork, with some skill at shooting here and there. if you want to run and gun like a maniac, you will not have a good time, but thats why i like this game.",3
"counter strike gloabal offensive is one of the best multiplayer games till date..(y).a must play.. the game is not story driven..we chose between the cts and the terrorists..and complete objectives according to the chosen side..we can play the game offline with bots or multiplayer with friends...the graphics are awesome...the only thing that cs 1.6 lacked!!..",1
"counterstrike global offensive is a really  game there are hackers/smurfs there is no chance for the lower rank to get a higher rank. i truly think that valve dont care about this game, wait why would they care they are getting there money from you boys/girls buying cases/skins. this is my review on counterstrike global offensive i hope you ing like it.",5
"it is an amazing game but if you start opening cases...your gonna have a bad time.",8
"they need to fix the reconnect to competative matches because ive gotton cool downs for loosing internet than trying to reconect and it wont let me",5
"this is a very great game, if you are looking for a hardcore fps this is the game for you. it is a difficult game to get used to but once you get into the competitve part of it its an amazing rush!",3
"you can screw around in deathmatch, play offline with bots, or play super cereal competitive. its an esport. its srs.",2
"awesome,one of the worlds most played fps,all must have this game,its just great and fun time!",3
"wow...if there are less hackers, this will be a perfect gaming community...",2
"the game is unforgiving at first, with a steep learning curve. but after playing and watching other players you will learn what works and good tactics. your first matches will be all deaths, but eventually you get called a hacker. 10/10",3
"the definitive competitive first-person shooter. this is one of those games that requires years to master. the more time you invest, the better you get, and the more rewarding it becomes.",1
"better than payday, but not as satisfying as rainbow six (for you tactical ops fans like me). still, a fun and more realistic team based shooter than most.",1
"as cs 1.6 player, i got used to this game aswell, 9.5/10 (also knows as weapon simulator for gabe newell)",2

"this is a very fun game to play, the best thing i like to play is compevetive becuase its really fun to play with a smal team of players and also to get items and win of course. i would of rate it 5 out of 5 if you are in to shooting games.",1
"best fps game ever >.< counter-strike?? theyre my childhood :d",1
"raised the bar since 1.6 from 1999. love the atmosphere and challenge. the creators have done a good job!",1
"when a friend told me there was a game that let players re-enact the well-known modern skirmishes of dust 2, nuke and vertigo, i couldnt believe any game developer would have the audacity to create such turbulent moments in contemporary political history. valves counter strike: global offensive allows people to play through the scenarios the real counter-terrorism squads had to operate in and, for me, it has really been an eye opener. id recommend this game to any person whos studying a course based on inter-pol or counter-insurgency history as well as to those who are just into realistic shooter sims. re-live the intense close-quarter engagements that our trained elites had to go through!",1
"faze clan doesnt recomend this game... cuz all dey know is trickshot =/ but in dis dey r scrubs and get kicked cuz dey no clutch on clutch or kick :( this game is also helpful if u wanna get yelled at by 29 year olds who dont have jobs :) such scrub, much hate :( 11/10",2

"great game!!! if you have low blood pressure (if not) stay away.",9
"counter-strike: global offensive delivers something rarely seen in modern shooters. it brings us back to a time of simpler multiplayer action. in this war, you dont need to call in screaming jets, there are no pointless tchotchkes to unlock, and a stray bullet could mean plotting your revenge for minutes rather than seconds. modern shooters do their job well, but counter-strike is the series that helped build the scene. at 1o euros, global offensive is a great extension to that legacy.",1
"i play offline alot, so i was excited to find that counter-strike: global offensive had an offline with bots feature. it is really fun to kill bots and defuse bombs as a counter-terrorist. its also kind of funny when you spectate a bot to find that they have horrible accuracy. i like using shotgun weapon, and testing out cs:go skins on an offline server without bots. i do recommend this game.",1
"absolutely amazing game. nothing in common with previous versions !",5
"this game is great because of the leveled multiplayer, the large community to back it, the use of gun skins to make the most dull game exciting and especially the competitve scene. but with every fps multiplayer; there is always the children who try to ruin it for everyone with obsene and vulgar language. but other than that, this game gets a review of 8/10 for the fact that this is a solid game with a good company to back it. just some of the bad apples can ruin the experience for everyone.",2
"addicting game that combines : fun , gaining money(and losing 2x more than you gained) and playing with your friends.",2
"great masterpiece of counter strike with a lot of chicken.",3
"this is a game that needs skill , not recomended to cod players .",4
"standart counter-strike, with altered graphics. added a lot of trash on the cards, machine, drums, and more. in some maps, the light falls so that it becomes impossible to watch. physics has become even more disgusting. particularly noticeable shooting deagle. played since closed beta test, nothing has changed after the release, with the exception of a couple of buttons on top (show matches, achievements, inventory) fairly well made selection matches conveniently find any game on the official server with good ping. (as there is not official server). in general, play nice, if you spend a lot of time to learn how to shoot. overall cs and should be such for a given time. 9/10",5

"this is like call of duty... but so much better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"most recent update inferno (csgo map)  removed pretty flowers behind yellow car in banana.  added a ton of flowers in other areas to compensate.  calmed down dog in apartments.  added a chickencoop to t spawn.  changed max chicken population from 10 to 12.  added back relaxing flamenco music to t spawn. glad to see valve is working hard....... great game dont play if you like cod. dont play if you want to save your money because in most instances you will see yourself buying expensive gun skins that increase the aestetics of the game. 8===d",6

"its really good specially for the people who loves fps haha",4

"recommended! 121 hours and still not bored to play this game, i started play cs 1.6 since i was on elementary school and now i think this global offensive is a very good remake from the other cs. and i hope in the future its still a competitive game and i recommend this for a competitive shooter player,cause i think cs series are the most competitive shooter game unlike other game. great graphic, superb gameplay and competitive mode. 9,5/10",2

"a somewhat realistic fps game. a game were grenades can make all the difference!",2
"cs:go is an excellent game with various weapons to choose from and modes to play. it is a fast paced fps that can be played single or multi player. i personally like cs:go because it is easy to follow and tons of fun. extremely recommended for anyone who like fps. there are few glitches in the game but overall, fantastic game. :)",3
"pretty nice game, much better then both css and cs 1.6 in my opinion... the weapons are very limited though.. 8/10 would play again :d",1
"this game isnt for light gamers but its great fun when im not smashing the keyboard against the wall.",1
"beware of smurfs and hackers! otherwise its a good time.",2
"this game has changed really, everything is better now. less hackers than before, and bugs/glitches are patched what made me angry. gg valve! ^^",6
"if this game was a potato it would be a good potato. but all features ripped from hello kitty online. 4/20 -volkswagen",2
"this game is wher its at in fps games. a timeless classic with some minor differences from its predecessors, but sure does have the good old counter strike feel to it.",4
"this isnt one of those weekend games this games deserves dedication and funding if you want to do well and be stylish at the same time. with dedication and perseverance will only success be insight. i may not seem to have a lot on record but trust me ive been with the cs community for around 4 years now and i can tell you im not even half way there. thanks for wasting 4 years of my life gaben gaben is love gaben is life",2

"absouletely great game! it has great graphics,physics and its optimized very well.you can buy/sell skins and you can even make some cents off of this game! it has everything that an fps should have...absolutely brilliant...i am so glad i bought it!!! <3",4
"hello, i could say that counter strike global offensive is the best fps shotter of all time, maybe only except battlefield 3, 4, and hardline, because the graphics of these games are just amazing... but what can i say, valve worked really hard on this game, and of all games (most shooters), i would give this game second place. i recommend this game for all the newbies and even pros to harden their skills. i think thats all, good luck valve. i hope youll release one more counter strike, and i will totally buy it :)",2
"one of the best games i have ever played. there are some anoyying bits here and there, like how you get cooldowns after every 2 games you win if you are unranked or if your computer shuts down and you dont get back in the 3 very very very short minutes then you get a cooldown and if that happens over and over again you can get a 7 day ban. well other than that it is a fantastic game. i have been playing it for 3 weeks and have had so much fun. competetive is the best its not like your playing call of duty and you can just play for fun. most of the time its serious because you are trying to not derank and you are trying to rankup. overall 5/5",3
"cs:go is a fast paced action game with many modes, many skins, many knives, and alot of competitive players trying to go for the top of the hill. back when i was involved in the beta, there were few players that i knew, but alot of great enhancments from 1.6 and source. it did take a while to get used to the new engine, but as i progressed into the game, i got used to the new hitboxes. the arms deal update - this update introduced new ways to customize your weapons with different items from either map packs, collections, or tournament events. trying to get the rarest can sometimes get easy or rare, cheap or expensive. knives are hard to get, but also are some of the covert rifles. why do i enjoy this game? i am able to play with many other players of similar skill and more of the updates are helping making this game alot better with the reddit community having a voice.",4

"i find it to be a new twist on first person shooters and it is very fun and competative",2
"conter strike is one of the best games ever. global offensive is a very good successor and pretty cheap.",1
"case opening simulator 2014 is the most entertaining way to lose money online that i have ever experienced. 10/10 would bet again",4

"you either die a noob or live long enough to get called a hacker",7
"a really good game. ive spent a few hundred hours of my life on this game and would do it again! but hours is not the only thing ive spent on this game, no ive dropped money into this game to get keys to open cases in the hope that maybe, just maybe lord gaben might give me a karambit or a m9 bayonet.",6
"*gets ranked up* *opens 2 cases* *gets statrack knife and mw awp asiimov* i only made like $180 but its an okay game.",2
"fun shooter but there are a lot of hardcore players so noobs beware",1

"great game for what its worth. i have made alot of friends through this game over the past 10 years. highly recommend!",7
"with a simple recommedation, i recommend you this next valve impression wich is based on counter-strike 1.6 that is known for every one of us. with high model and textures,sweet gameplay,powerful weapons,matchranking and game modes it involves you in the world of shooter gaming.",5
"awesome classic fps multiplayer that you should all play! :)",3

"amazing game!!!!!! so much fun just when ur playing compitive dont tk xd",3
"its the follow-up to the groundbreaking fps series counter-strike. and its brilliant. counter-strike: global offensive retains the same classic feeling of counter-strike and does it while strutting its stuff. i can remember playing counter-strike 1.6 when i was but a small child, and i still have fond memories of it. the graphics feel appropriate, and i love the art style. the fandom for this game still grows strong today, and i cant imagine the funds that its raised for valve & its employees. good job, guys. hopefully there may be more to come in the series.",2
"do not buy this game , i am putting this in the reccomended section because steam odesnt show the bad comments. you will get banned from steam for no reason for playing this game and it will all be a big waiste of time. i am not able to trade any items or play with friends because they banned me for no reason. if you are reading this just dont even play any steam games, after paying for a game i bought with my own money i am unable to even play because i am banned from the game.i am currently working on a plan to sue steam for alot more than they will be able to afford if i dont get my account back.",2
"feels a lot like old counterstrike, a++ would play again",1
"the first fps game i really play for hours on end. the classic feel of counter-strike 1.6 is flowing through the game, but it looks very modern and up to date. it would be false compare if it was up againts titles like call of duty or battelfield, because it isnt the same playstyle. a perfect game with an active community, lots of updates and seasonal extras. 10/10 (what were you expecting? its counter-strike)",1
"cs:go is an amazing/aweful game! its so good/! i really love/hate counter-strike! 10/10 can/cant recommend to everyone/anyone.",2
"im a game addict, and cs:go is my drug of choice. the many variables, players, maps, t or ct-side, weapons, budget, make that every game is different. never gets old.",7
"this game is extremly addicting, please dont download this, it will kill you!!!",1
"very hard reaction time based twitch shooter. it simulates real war alot better then most other fps games.",1
"the recent installment of one of, if not, the greatest competitive fps games ever created. if you know cs from past installments then youll fit right with csgo. if youre completely new then good news, csgo has helped create a balanced and fun game for all skill ranges from people that are brand new and for those of us that have been playing cs competitively since long long ago. highly recommend this game.",6
"very good game. the competitve multiplayer is one of the best out there.",5
"yes and no. this game is great but it the most painful experience possible. the amount of smurfs in this game is horrible, solo queing is a nightmare, and when you combine those two its even worse. ive been deranked lord knows how many times due to smurfs and teamates who afk/leave the game. all in all its a good game but fix your matchmaking for s sake.",6
"best pc fps currently being updated. has a great community. just an all around great game.",3
"buying a knife makes you play better and win more. 5/5.",2
"this game is great ! it has memorable game modes and has compelling game-play mechanics, warning, this game is not for people who are new to the fps genre, it is at first challenging but after half an hour and playing the tutorial a couple of times, it gets fun and intense especially in the competitive bomb defuse game-type... also, i will have to mention that this game has no single player / campaign. it does have a bot mode (versing bots [ai]) but that is used for practicing and trying new weapons..... 9/10 - caspar younger",1
"just as great as counter strike : source, a very huge improvement and has alot of fun.",3

"you dont have cs:go yet? where the  have you been living? the woods?",2
"cs:go is my favorite game on steam so far. as far as competitive gaming goes, look no further than counter-strike or dota. counter-strike is a game where the outcome is based on each players skill, reaction time, and teamwork! communication with your fellow soldiers is crucial to win. calling strategies, reporting enemy whereabouts, and working closely with teammates makes this game more immersive than most pc shooters. make sure you follow your teams economy to decide what gear to buy at the right times. learn common locations on all the maps so you can keep your team aware of all happenings around them. it also helps that the games mechanics are about as fluid as it gets! have fun.",10
"smgs are too accurate lmgs are too inaccurate assault rifles have way too much recoil shotguns are way too overpowered sniper rifles are 1-2 hit kills pistols are too weak knifes only insta-kill from the back this game sucks! 10/10",1
"game is somewhat of a mixture of a wet noodle and brown sauce - bland. in theory this game could work as a cooking simulator for single mothers with a lot of time on their hands however i do not think that this could be possible as this game requires a lot of decent leg movement. overall this is the best game of the year 2/10 - ign",1

"it used to be my favorite game! but now you can just try try and try very hard. but you will keep loosing and more and more people are using hacks. vac does not detect them as they are sophisticated programs. whats the point. unless this is addressed along with a huge list of other bugs.. its just you trying your best to no avail. go ahead and keep tyring but hackers are wining. this applies to the match making and competetive play more than it does to casual. but you have hackers in casual as well. so sadly this negative review.. changed from a previous positive one. :(",10

"very good game it became better of new weapon skins. it will prepare us to zombie apocalipse :d",1
"a great game with to play with friends, just bring some patience and be ready for one hell of a learning curve (for some, not all). the only real issue i have with this game is the seemingly toxic community, from what i have seen anyway. whether it be: teammates that ignore you or dont have mics, or enemies that are very unsportsmanlike and rude. please note that most of my play time was on competitive not casual. i cant say anything about casual because i dont play it. so, to summarize: if you like to play extremely team oriented games with friends or with random people, without the ability to sprint or aim down your iron sights (except for the sniper rifles and the scoped rifles), and are willing to learn how to play then this might be the game for you!",3
"tis gam gud. bai it. tuu guud tu bii druu! cage is lie! valve gaben god! dis gam mad bai dem and u sud bui it!! it has lot of guns and cuul baints fur dem!!!! most realitic suuter evar!!!! cod and bf4 suks kompared tu tis",4
"great game even though i currently suck at it. its best to have friends buy the game before or with you so you can plan out startegies in skype rather than on the spot with total strangers. worth the money i didnt spend (thx beanmocker) 11/10 would buy again.",2
"nothing compares to cs 1.6, but this game is almost good",8
"good game, sharp learning curve, competitive aspect is probably one of the best alongside lol, dota. casuals tend to be somewhat cancer with low rank players who mic spam and flame. however most people arent cancerous. nice community. every 3-4 games you will run into a hacker in competitive, and in the higher ranks of eagle + every 1-2 games you might have a hacker. sometimes you will run into toxic players, flaming you for small things, mute them and go on with life. many players in competitive games are toxic you dont have to deal with that person for an hour so mute him. tl;dr good game, good community except some toxic people, fun and competitive.",4
"this game feels like cs source with better graphics and more maps, very enjoyable! i would recomend this to anyone that likes cs source.",4
"counter strike s my first fps game and ts new of the game i liked t",1
"good game, though it does feel like its just a recycled css in some places. though, it is still a good one.",1
"best and most competitive fps you will find on pc..... halo is the best though ;)",1
"this game has the best chicken ai of gaming history. 10/10 would knife those chickens again.",1
"some serious and intense , this game offers a very competitive fps environment for those who are willing to play seriously and for those who are able to co-operate with teammates. it provides a different feel that other fps games liek halo, cod, battlefield doesnt truly offer as its ranked matches provides much more intense and adrenaline fueled action, like literaly, your heart will be pumping ridicoulously fast.",2
"my favorite competetive game. like competetive shooters? this is the game for you. *warning* people who have high tempers.. be warned..",4

"if you dont like this game... well, nobody cares.. this is abso-.ing-lutely a great game! 11/10",1
"game is very tactical, competitive, and progressive. at the same time, its enjoyable, has a great community around it, and above all else is addictive.",6
"one of the best multiplayer experiences on pc. ive tried the likes of battlefield 3 and had painful experience online, but cs:go works every single time. mines a 2 mbps connection which goes down to 512 kbps at times and there never is a lag... i was a big fan of the original cs 1.6 and never thought there could be anything simpler and / or better than that, i am glad i was wrong! super like!!!!",1
"very cool game if you like fast-paced fps games which take quite a bit of skill.",3
"i suck at this game but somehow it keeps me play lol kek lel.",1
"if youre into competive, try this game. live short enough to call a noob and long enough to be called a hacker! xd",3
"i love this game because its not only about running and shooting, its a more tactical shooter and more skill and team play based than all other games i know. its great to play with friends in a team but also allone its still good to play. another big advantage is the price, its a brilliant game and comparable to bf or cod but it costs only 13.99 euro in steam, and you never get tired playing.but the big advantage of the price is the biggest disadvantage as well because many hackers are online and only their steam account gets banned from cs, not their ip or pc and buying a new game for 13.99 is not a big deal.",9

"when the classic returns! a good game, to play with friends, and have fun. with graphics from cs source, and physics from cs 1.6 ,",1
"a decent successor to counter strike: source, but in my honest opinion i feel as if it doesnt live up to source, might be due to nostalgia. any way you should get this over source due to the shift of the competitive scene from source to go.",1
"a truly outstanding game by valve, which everyone has heard of. the temple and the progenitor of all shooters. game of childhood. does one need to say more? the remake was more than successful. all his hopes, he fully justified. graphics and the gameplay has changed significantly. new weapons and maps, nice paint nostalgic memories. if youre a fan of the series cs, feel free to take this game. constantly updated workshop stirs interest. the game is still alive. the last of the legendary family 9 chickens out of 10",4
"its fun and all, but everyone else is just too good.",1
"pros: graphic gameplay ui and other all :d --------- cons: nothing. this game is just awesome <3 thanks to valve for making this *n great game.",1
"in this thrilling sequel to such classics as call of duty: modern warfare and borderlands: the pre sequel, a young squad of 19th century american cavalryman is pitted in an epic struggle for survival against the forces of nazi occupied europe. captain alfred hitchcock is tasked with leading his men to battle against an lifeless horde of undead chicken aliens from the future. i highly reccomend the campaign, but profess that the original book has some qualities the game obviously and tragically lacks. 7/10 would belly flop again",2
"fair balanced gameplay that never gets old. if you want a fun, yet challenging game.....then ing get cs:go !",3
"this game is awesome! better then all cs ever came out! #bestgameof2015-6000",3
"i really like counter strike, and this entry is no exepcion, everything is good now and it has a lot more room for expansion. but please, create an east server so the rest of europe can have more fun while playing... for more than 20 game in streak, i only listen to russian, and since a medium percentage of them hates america, they refuse to speak english, and this is totally unsocial and breaks the communication in game, ending up to a serious problem that leads the player into frustation and despair, summing up in a deffeat... this is the dark side of the community in the cs:go scene and it can be easily resolved by creating a new server. with this said im not being racist since im not that and i have friends in all over the world, but it hurts the community to see the player personal beliefs and cultural influences get inside a game, that is used to relief stress and to socialize a bit more with the world. dramatic actions should be insued lord gabe, just make it happen...",2
"great game. the ranking system has taken in me and my friends. i feel a lot more compeled to play the ranking system compaired to source since it has multiple ranks and puts you up against people of your skill level. though it could use a little fine tuning when you have a non-ranked individual in your party.",9
"its a very competitive game,you should buy it :d.sure youll enjoy it with a lot of weapon skins and crates that you can sell.",2
"long time cs player, since beta 4.8 or so, love this version the best",3
"this game is action-packed and is a great strategic fps for a great price. while some players may find a lack of game modes, this is definetely a game to purchase in a heart beat",2
"i was really looking forward to the new game mode arms race but i was dissapointed when i found out you ran around on your feet. 0/10",3
"amazing game fun competive ranked win items just for playing unlock the skins such a great fps game worth every dollar i spent on this game",3
"broke my kneecaps to the theme tune of this game. totally worth it because i made the nhs and i can fix it.",1
"counter strike global offensive, tf2 edition. now bundled with awesome various crates. keys and the thing you all love so much; camos! its not about being the best, its about having a $100 camo on your awp.",1
"this game is freakin amazing. the tactical combat in this game is outstanding and its so immersive it feels like more of a simulator than a game (obviously thats not a bad thing). thanks to the sophisticated style of the game you rarely come across trolls and other people that destroy the gameplay. the one thing i will say is that there are alot of accusations like he is a hacker or he is a noob. this is fairly rare, but even when it does happen, the game is still good. buy this game- it will be one of the best games you get.",3
"i tell myself before i play a game, alright i need to win this game or i will derank. i go into a game and have four trolls on my team, one which is afk in spawn, but has something on his keyboard making him spin in circles at spawn so he doesnt get kicked. oh yea not to mention the entire other team is a japanese clan. i am currently in my bathtub in the fetal position writing this from my phone, trying to figure out what i did to deserve such misery...",5
"its awsome but if they clean the hacks it will be over power ^_^",1
"when i joined my first couple of matches i noticed something pretty obvious. everyone who plays the game is pretty much a pro since the game has been out for a while. i really only have fun with this game when i play it with friends only. if you get the game you should try training with bots or having someone show you the tricks of the game. all in all, the game is fun to play and has very fast gameplay. its not my favorite game, but it will keep you into the gameplay until you ragequit. i would recommend this game to anyone who likes games like call of duty.",1
"so if you plan to buy this game be prepared because this is not cod or battlefield where you can spray guns and require little to no knowledge about the maps or equipment, weapons etc and go good regardless. because in cs:go if you turn a corner be prepared for pure  because you can get 1 shot killed by almost any gun if your hit in the head, oh! and by the way anyone who plans to join the 720 double yy no scopes clans such as faze or optic your gonna be right at home with this game because be prepared the.... awp! #jk youll get demolished if you expect to bring your quickscope skills to cs because you will most likely get kicked or banned form any server because everyone will hate you and probably want you to die.... so yeah! welcome to world of counter strike! 11/10-awp of the year!",5
"dont shoot anyone or else youll be hacking. 12/10",3
"awsome game... u have to choices to do.. 1) die fast and get called a noob 2) play hard until they say u are a hacker if u didnt like those choices then dont play this game but u are the loser for not playing i give this game no less than a 9/10",3
"this game is the next level of shooters, when i first started playing this game i had no idea what type of fun i was getting into. the game provides team communication which is the most important feature in this. if youre bad at shooters, this game helps you get better. it will teach you how to aim, when to shoot, and how to be a team player. without this game i would be a really bad sniper, and team leader. this is a must have game.",2
"so good i dont remember the last time i went outside",4

"this game is pure gold. pros -original gameplay -new buy menu for quick access -skins -new maps -workshop! cons -crates & keys overview all in all, this lives up to the original games just as well. it has everything all the same, but with new maps and skins and workshop compatability, this game is just endless! tons of acheivements to rack up your ranking and competitive games to give you a rush of adrenaline, cs:go is just one of those games you have to play and love. the only problem i feel with this game is crates and keys. it feels a lot like it is following tf2 in its footsteps. it really feels like you could be better at how you play and acheive which makes the game feel more like a bully to you than anything.",4

"very interesting and fun game, but its kinda hard to learn to play it properly. if uou like shooting or you had played other counter-stirke games you should definately buy this game. its even more fun to play with your friends. i also like that there is competetive games so i can know my ranking.",5
"havent played an cs games before and bought this because i can see a lot of my friends play this. the first time i played this game and i hooked myself into this game. apart from little bit waiting time in matchmaking servers, i dont have any negatives for this game. graphics is good, maps are excellent, control is easy and overall game is fun and enjoyable. it takes time to master the game but nevertheless it is a good game. i rate this game a 10/10. it is a must buy for all gamer for its sheer variety of game types.",2

"best counter-strike yet. at first, like most players i was skeptical on how valve would be able to take source and amplify that even more while bringing back certain portions of cs 1.6 that we all came to know and love and yet, they did it. cs:go has so many different game options and makes it a great game to play with a group of friends or alone. the weapon skins are a fun addition to cs along with stickers and other options. valve has created a game that allows players to play the cs theyve always known and loved, but continue to see new things within the game itself like operation breakout and new maps/weapons from the steam workshop. cs:go gets a 10/10 from me for sure.",5

"as someone with over 200 hours, i can tell you its a really good game, im a gold nova and i still meet console gamers, though. pros: interactive shadows in which source didnt have at first, hard for cod gamers >:3, and gives me money for free! cons: cod gamers be like: ho du u am dorwn ur sites? 10/10 ign, still a better love story than twilight.",2
"lastest patch broke my favorite game and it makes me cri everytim",4
"fantastic game. worth buying as its at a low price!",5
"this is a very fun first person shooter. in terms of competitiveness, this game adds a lot more than most of the other first person shooter titles out there, because this game is not just point and shoot. you have to manage your economy, focus on team play and on superior tactics to play and win this game. the combination of all these components add to up to a well rounded first person shooter game that is enjoyable and replayable. this shooter has been here for a long, long time which allowed the game to build up a big community/fan base. so if you decide to purchase and play this game, you can be assured that a bunch other people will be playing one of the most tried and tested fps titles with you.",4
"at the moment my favourite game. the only bad thing is matchmaking and some bans like you kicked many people. i really hate this cooldown but its still the best game ever. 10/10.",6
"super sick game. love the engine this game is running on. only real problem i find with this game is via the competitive match making side. they need to work on it abit. but otherwise super fun game. some kiff skins aswell. #definitely a must have.",9
"never invite me to cs go i rage too much. angry dad appeared i thought we talked about this years ago..... yes that was css i stopped afterwards, however now the nightmares are back help me!!!!!! i always find myself standing with a sniper shooting..... 1 miss..... 2 misses..... 10 misses...... afterwards i get killed by other sniper and start raging. this is one of the funniest aspects in the game pros: fun gameplay lots of skins (for the crazy collector in all of us) good match making systems. good interface cons: you rage a lot. angry parents. too high blood presure during gameplay but no actual errors with the game itself. therefore i rate this game 10/10 (do keep in mind this isnt for the softhearted, always have some friends chatting with you otherwise you might destroy your screen)",2
"this game is amazing! comparing this to older css , it is a great improvement. just awesome.",2
"if you want to study russian or any other slavic language this game is for you! it is an amazing exchange student simulator. you feel like you are in russia or that russia has occupied your country. to put the game to this exchange student mode, you need to start up the game and play competitive. when you hear  blyat, you fawk! you have activated the exchange student mode.",2
"where to start? this game has it all. great graphics, plenty of guns (including awesome camoflauges), and a large community. while it may not have as many maps as cs:s, or buggy bots, the tactical gameplay makes up for these flaws. all in all, i would say this is a must play for a big fps fan. 8.5/10",1
"competitive game with great community. addicting, fun and sporty. dont play after a sale though, lots of hackers are coming! there are more modes of gameplay. theres arms race (which is basically gun game for those who have played previous cs titles), deathmatch, classic casual, classic competitive. classic is in my opinion the best to spend time on and once you feel ready you can hop on a competitive with your friends. dont worry if none are available, the matchmaking system will match you with adversaries and teammates with matching skill. improve your skill and more important: have fun! who knows, maybe youll be the one to beat the champions.",8

"when i bought this game in early 2013 i didnt think it would become into on eof the most biggest esport games of 2014/2015. at first i wasnt that keen on the game, everything was unbalanced and it was so weird and bad compered to 1.6 and source, then when valve decided to put some efort into polishing this game it turned out to be one (if not the best) game that they made. everyone on steam needs to have this masterpiece of a game. 10/10",7
"counter strike is single handedly the biggest outcome of rage quitters. they started rage quitting. ive played since 2002 and this is by far my favorite game, anyone can get good over time, it just takes patience, and lots of laughs at people who get mad. mostly good community with a few bad outliers with easy fix of in game mute or steam blocking.",2
"really solid game. gameplay is smooth. community is nice for the most part. maps are good. overall i would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes online fps games.",4
"i love this game. the first day i got it, i played 6 hours. competitive is so much fun and addicting. would totally suggest cs:go!",3
"counter-strike global offensive is a simple game , its nothing like call of duty series or other fps games , no assaults , no air supports , no flags , nothing , this game is based on cs 1.6 (which is the most popular game ever) inherited all the guns from 1.6 and has few items added to it plus it has amazing guns , you could actually feel the art on your hand in this game , totally worth buying and playing 10/10",1

"when i first bought this game here was how it went 1. join a match 2. get killed 20 times 3. get 1 kill 4. get harrased for being bad at the game 5. rage quit after i learned more strategy, as well as how recoil worked, here is how it went 1. join a match 2. get 20 kills 3. die 12 times 4. get praised by your teammates 5. think your the best player ever 6. cry after realizing your not all that good then after some more playing, i realized that in competitive, sometimes you should just have fun, it went like this 1. join a match 2. flash whole team 3. get yelled at 4. shoot the person that yelled the most 5. get votekicked from the match",3

"this game is very good, it takes actual tactical skill while other shooters like cod are based on twitch gaming. but this game is very hard if you are new you will die and die in your first matches by people who have 5 years expirience. pros -good gameplay -very tactical -fun -the guns are cool and accurate to real life. cons -community is o.k. -not noob friendly",1
"by far the best team-based fps on steam. very competitive, offers loads of additional content at low cost, lots of gamemodes and maps, and a great sense of community. highly recommended.",1
"first, i thought it was a mistake buying this game bec i get dizzy easily and feel like throwing up. if you havent play fps(first-person shooter) before, youll get dizzy playing this one. the technique is take it slowly. bit by bit. until you can play for an hour straight.",1

"heavily addictive, brilliant graphics. number one fps game by a awp shot.",3
"growth is an important factor in global offensive, especially if youre coming into counter-strike fresh or after a sabbatical. this is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. if youre a call of duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. counter-strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.-ign.",3

"typical counter strike. nothing broken, just few improvements. only thing you will hate about this game are smurfs. 9/10",6
"old school counter strike revamped!!! cs has always been my true love when it comes to fps games. it has a hard learning curve but pays off if you stick with it. with new maps & skins being added, it has much more to offer than the previous versions of cs. in the words of the great fps doug boom, headshot!",7
"tired of little kids screaming into their mics on call of duty? want a mature community for a mature game that takes alot of skill and teamwork? then cs:go is for you! alot of people have mics and or always type so there is always teamwork involved. rather its rushing b stacking a or anything there will be guarenteed teamwork. youre also not going to find alot of squeakers on the game either. beware! the game has a very high skillset and learning curve. this shouldnt discourage you though as you get placed into a rank with the same skillset. there are also alot of veteran players who will be 200x better than you but youll get up there someday! 10/10 would bang again",5

"this is way better than 1.6 or source. both 1.6 and source are full of hackers, this one has too, but less. go also adds molotovs and decoys which is pretty cool. this version also has much better graphics and improved maps, which keeps me playing even more, because graphics do matter. gameplay stays faithful to the original 1.6, which is really great because theres lots of 1.6 players that moved on to this version. it also runs great on old hardware. rating: 9/10 if there were less hackers, it would be 10. (and yes, the awp is still 1-shot kill. .)",1

"ive owned this game for about a week, and encountered nothing but smurfs, hackers, trolls, and general immaturity, with games decending into awp/p90 contests within minutes. that being said, im giving this a positive review, because aside from the awful community and obvious balance issues, the core game still is fun to play. against bots, players who want to have a good time, its a great tactical experience that sees teamwork and strategy rewarded.",1
"lets start off by saying this game is the best one in the cs series. id say that cs:go is a remade version of 1.6, which suits the needs of the current generation - better graphics, stuff is fancy. there is also this gambling aspect of opening cases and betting skins. i really do not know if i like it or not. some kids get happy over their new stuff when the other kids are crying after losing their whole skin collection in one click. now, the game itself. theres a new mode called competitive. people take this rather seriously. you can play it to get higher in rank - in case youve got what it needs to get there, which means youll get better opponents when you advance. remember that you have to be on the same (or higher!) level as your opponents to get higher. you can also play it to realize you belong to the bottom floor. but being on the bottom floor is okay, right? you can only get better.",4
"its a great game to play, if you love being insulted by raging nerds who blame their teamates every time they get killed.",1
"great graphics along with very realistic sounds. some of the most realistic game play i have seen in a while, although some of the bullets do not seem to actually hit the target when they were in the sight. in total the game is amazing with a few problems but can be excused for how good the game play is.",3

"during competitive, if your teammates are all dead and they are looking upon you, dont worry, pull out your factory-new blue steel karambit and press f to inspect it. all your teammates that are spectating you will sure be jealous. why i recommend this game? because you can kill chickens but not fishes.",2

"a very good game. very realistic. different to most first person shooters. probably one of the best ones ive ever played. the matchmaking side of things can be a bit dodgy sometimes but you have to think very carefully to fault the gameplay.",3
"what can i say... its an awesome competitive game, is a bunch of fun when you play competitive with your friends. its counter-strike. game at with this price tag that is better then some aaa 60$ games. if you dont like tactical shooters, but you like running and gunning i wont say dont buy it because everyone should own this game. if you never played cs before, there is a huge learning curve because the game is so much different from other fps games.",5

"cs:go by far one of the best fps for pc. this game will bring moments of despair while bringing moments of pure accomplishment. this is like the call of duty of pc but better, you have multiple cheap exspansions that become free after the event. competetive - where pros play for rankings deathmatch - where you kill, die, spawn, kill, die, spawn over again and again. demolition - basically search and destroy arms race - go throught most weapons in the game to finally a knife and get a kill with each to win. this game is a 10/10 for me and i highly recomend it! also no aiming! only on guns with scopes you can aim!!! beautiful!",1
"more realistic gameplay than other fps game, better graphic and gameplay than previous one...",1
"this game is if not the greatest, the best fps shooter in history. its been going for some time and has the most intense and rewarding competive system there is. the only real money purchases is texture remakes (skins) for all the guns in the game. this gives no advantage to the user at all, it just creates a badass feel and look to the guns. overall, this game is the best that ever happend to gamers life. that is all.",2

"cs:go is amazing! it took me a while until i got used to the weapon feeling and recoil, but when i got used to it, i was literally addicted to this game! i played it every night with my friends, trying to rank up in competetive or just having some fun conversations and troll around in casual. the only thing they should change is the price for the keys.... it started with 1,79  and after months the price slowly raised to 1,99 . all i can say is that cs:go is definitely worth its money.",5

"counter strike: global offensive, or cs:go, is a fast paced shooter. most guns do not have a zoom feature so it isnt like call of duty if that is what you are wondering. you have to have a base understading in order to get really good. now that doesnt mean the game is not fun. there are many game mods for all types of players. they range from rescue the hostage, to plant the bomb, to your basic team deathmatch. there is also a competitive playlist if you are into that hardcore stuff as well. most of the maps are really well made and dont get old, if you do happen to get old of the standard maps then just buy the $3 map pack, or make a friend that has it since you can just join his lobby and play with em, that gives you this cool badge. this is a great game if you want something you can jump in and have fun.",5

"an incredibly fun fps that is well worth the price. however, keep in mind that this fps is completely different from other shooters like cod or battlefield. if youre going to treat cs:go like such, youre going to have a bad time. imo, cs:go has a much higher learning curve compared to these fpses ive mentioned and youre probably going suck when you first start. however, once you pass this learning curve, getting kills will be much more satisfying in this game compared to getting kills in cod/bf. 10 chickens/10 would recommend.",1

"hard for starters this int like cod where all the skills you need is pointing and clicking.on cs:go you need to use your brain the only thing i dont like is that you need to buy pho3nix pass to get some maps and you can only plae it once, and that competitive is the only good game mode for cs:go so this game is not for quick plays i would recomend this game if you have 100 minutes to spare on the wekkend",1

"good game i like it but there is no options in offline bots to add how many bots and etc.",1
"to anyone coming from cod and thinking they can dominate in counter strike like you can in cod, youre sorely mistaken. this game has a much higher skill level, and is extremely difficult at first. however, its so rewarding when you can finally pull off the headshot in only one bullet like everyone else. buy this game if you want to see how the first multiplayer fps has evolved.",8

"i thought nothing was getting me out of tf2, i guess i was wrong :p amazing game!",4
"this game is most definitely best game of the counter-strike series. they finally managed to create something different comparing to the earlier versions. with new graphics, new weapons and new game modes with the matchmaking system it creates the perfect game for anyone who likes to play competitive. they also added the games own versions of deathmatch and gungame gametypes. not to mention the skin system they created for this game which makes the game unique when compared to other fps games. this all combined with the low price of 15 euros, it is definitely worth buying and i recommend it to anyone who likes fps games and competitive play.",4
"kill terrorists. kill the guys killing the terrorists. either way, its a good time. 10/10 best movie since twilight",4
"best game ive ever played. better than cod, battlefield and other fps because its unique gameplay, strategies and the community.",6

"how often do you run at a game that can pay for other games?",2
"very fun, but its hard for new players. it takes lots and lots of practice to get good, and you have to learn what all these places are called because if you dont, you wonder why people yell things like cat and banana and mexican and its kind of confusing. plus there are skins for guns that take a while to get, other than a lot of practicing, everything is fun. good game.",2

"counter-strike: go doesnt fail to please me. its a great competitive game with new guns, new modes, better graphics, and a gy community, thats pretty much the only downside... but cs:go is a very well made competitive game. but if you are me, you would prefer css over this game. but both are spectacular games. thank you once again, valve :)",1
"very fun and balance game. you just need to practice your aim to not get kick at competetive. keep playing casual til you think that you can play in competetive mode. ak-47s 1 tap headshot is op,valve please dont nerf the ak!!! verryyyy fuuunnnnnnn gaaaammmmeeeeee..",1
"+10 years into cs. 1.6 was probably the best, source was good. this blows source out of the water, adding a lot of the 1.6 mechanics and so many community features and options that i hope that this scene keeps growing. a must buy/play. if you need help starting out hit me up.",4
"great game, hackers here and there but what multiplayer game doesnt have hackers?",3
"great game, but theres a bit of lag (i live in alabama, thats why). alot of weapons have there reasonable damage and recoil, the designs look awsome! (i may say this is a great game other than the lag, why here in alabama) so on a scale to 1/10, it will be... 9.5/10",1
"its counter-strike. no innovation here, but what it does, it does well. there is pretty much no aimbotting, so that is a big plus, although i have seen wallhacks and smoke hacks. the operation maps are a huge plus. for a few bucks, you buy a pack of maps, which you can play in most of the modes, made by the community, and you get nice special drops for them. all around a good deal for a great game that might otherwise seem stale, given that many of the maps have been around for over 10 years. this version plays a lot like cs 1.0, for those who can remember that far back. 1.0 was fairly different from 1.3, which was again fairly different from 1.6. but yeah, this is a very nice iteration of cs in my opinion, so 8/10 from me.",9

"very good game to start playing if you have moved on with call of duty or even with battlefield. this game is only 15$ and will be every worth the money and you can even make a ton of money on the items you can sell. be careful not to be tempted to buy the keys, or you can to try to unlock cases like tf2 that have a chance to get you a knife which is worth 50 - 500 dollars.",7
"64 tick matchmaking. stick to it for now. go buy some cases and get addicted to putting your money in this game. its worth it",5

"counter-strike: global offensive is what a fps should be. this has to be the best skill-based fps on the market. the guns feel powerful and rewarding, and the addition of camos is great. the only problem with the game is the difficulty. the game is played competively, and a good amount of the players on it have been playing counter-strike since the beginning are godlike. so the game has a bit of a learing curve in the respect that it takes practice to be able to compete against some of the other players. but once you are to that point, this game is extremely rewarding. getting a kill in this game is so much more satisfying than any other fps ive played, mainly because getting kills arent easy. all in all, counter-strike: global offensive is a must have for any fps fan due to the rewarding gunplay, great map design, and large community as soon as you overcome the learning curve.",5

"graphics and game play are much better than the counter-strikes before it... but like all other cs games, playing online can be a bit hectic. ive played online only a few times and realized that i dont possess the patience needed to play with others in the cs community. there are some that are real great competitive players out there and others that are screaming kids that you have to mute.. but i assure you that im neither one those. so, i enjoy casual play offline with bots from time to time.",1
"very immersive experience. great visual effects and graphics. stunning performance when it comes to highly action-packed moments: the game has no stutters whatsoever and always runs smoothly. neat variety of gamemodes to choose from, along with competitive matches, which represent a great feature of the game itself. they are complex, yet very understandable, which is good. only slight drawback is the community, or at least a big part of it. many people, unfortunately even in competitive matches, do not show any interest in the game itself by cheating and hacking, or simply by throwing the match and dragging the whole team down. overall very well made game. all it takes to master it is practice. everything else is already taken care of.",5

"i am one that generally does not enjoy the fps style of games. there is just something about counter strike: global offensive that makes me not able to put it down. you feel like becoming a better person is the goal of the game each time: you get a clutch victory or even die in a bad 1v1. this is a skill based shooter! the game is not about getting a new scope for your weapon... improvement of yourself as a person and understanding how things work. i cannot recommend this game enough to anyone i talk to. if you want to become a better person and learn about discipline, self-respect, and teamwork. you need to try this game!",4

"great game in general. the learning curve is much steeper than other games that are newer and is satisfying to play. just a blast to play so far. although so many other people are incredibly skilled, keep at it and get gud skrub. one of the most fun fps out there in the gaming world. i would recommend this game to all fps lovers. also a very competitive game, but the matchmaking system makes sure that similar skill levels play each other and not global elite professionals. i think that its an excellent continuation of the counter-strike series.",1

"this game is very good. it is one of the best shooter games i have ever played. it is super fun to play this game with friends using voice chat. there are different matches you can join. competative may be hard for new players. this game is hard for new players. it is completely different counter-strike game. it has a lot of skins, weapons, maps, and other cool stuff. i recommend this game to everyone who likes games which need teamwork and cooperation.",5

"counter-strike: global offensive contains content that the average player would want; the large arsenal of weapons provides the player with the right gear for the specific game, simple controls make it easy for the player to maneuver and navigate around the given map that was chosen, the wide variety of maps made by valve and the community keeps the game entertaining. cs:go is made of a complete combination of luck, accuracy, and decisions. just keep in mind that the css play-style is no where close to cs:gos(except for the maps, atleast).",1

"very nice game. cool skins of weapons, team game.... shooter!",2
"great fps, despite the bugs. the community is nice. you rarely meet rude russians (unlike in dota 2) or anyone rude for that matter. lots of skins for guns and pistols. you also get drops that are worth money and if you snag it below 2,5, its very well worth the price. last time when it was on sale, it went to 2. anyways, im going to give it an 8/10 (would rate it 10/10 if the bugs were fixed (for lower end machines (higher end machines may also have these bugs)).",1

"this game is very addictive and i would reccomened it to everyone :)",1
"do not come into this game thinking you can hop on and kill people. that is my main reason not to buy it if you think thats what its about. this game requires alot of skill, patience and focus. even casual isnt fun unless you actually try. despite all of that, this game is really fun if you get a premade (group) to play competitive and work your way up the ranking system. there are alot of different community servers to mess around on if you want to, and deathmatch, gun game and demolition for a bit of fun. cs:go involves alot of camping, waiting and looking at the mini-map, and working as a team to win rounds, which are vital to your and your enemys economy and morale. the camping/ waiting part sounds bad, but it just adds to the drama. oh yeah. ez skins ez lyf ez!11!!!1!",4
"fantastic buy, i myself though this would be boring as its a pc shooter but i was proven wrong! easy to play with a mouse and keyboard, isnt a game that demands a high end pc which is awesome! games are really easy to get into and even if you cant be bothered to play online then try the offline bots its a hell of alot of fun! loads of gorgeous maps to download for free! and loads of different skins and guns to download! basically what im saying is its a must buy! although i have only player for 4 hours, i can sommenly say i will be playing again very very soon! so what you waiting for?!? try it :) +happy gaming+",1

(counter-source is my most played games by like 100 hours btw.) we were playing arms race and demolition and casual mode. arms race is stupid but so much fun. demolition is a fun quick version of defuse where you get new guns every time you kill someone. those stupid bots? well you can take over them if you die. very fun with friends, not great own your own but arms race is quite addicting and allows you to play on your own if you want. i like this game, source will always be my favourite shooter game, but this one is really good too.",1

"its still a counter strike, but theres a few things that should be changed. this game should be about holding angles, not about checking corners. map designs should be similar to cs 1.6 maps. second thing, the flashes should be way more effective, as if you turn around you barely get flashed, while in css or cs 1.6 your screen would actually be a lot brighter than in this game. third thing, quick-scoping with awp is so random now, unlike in 1.6 where it is perfect as it should be. fourth and final thing, the deagle: it costs 800$ and you can get p250, which is way more useful, for 300$. deagle should have the same specifications as it had in previous counter strike games, because then those 800$ would be worth of spending.",10

"if im going to compare this, and css. i want to say, that css is more for the fun stuff, like: minigame, gungame, surf, ba_jail and etc. but cs:go, this game, its a really good game actually, in the start i was thinking it was bad. well i was wrong, this game is very good, but i think its mostly for the competitive players. btw, there is also a new game mode, demolution. if you want to play serious, you should get this instead of css. this game is worth the full price! 4.5/5",10
"been playing the counter strike series by valve for about 10 years now, pretty great series imo. definitely better than call of doodoo, halo and battlefield 10/10 would buy.",6
"heyyo, its another counter-strike game. its got decent graphics (using the aged source engine) but among the most solid gameplay of any shooter to date. adding in weapon skins is a nice touch though. luckily theres nothing very offensive due to using the steam marketplace for most of the skins plus valve is always running contests and such on the game and its quite pro-scrim friendly with the built-in match making system that works good on top of the server browsing system. if you loved cs1.6 or css? im sure youll love cs global offensive. my only wish? cs go was on source engine 2 with much improved graphics instead of being more like an hd version of css. :p",1

"one of the best multiplayer. ive played alot and this one is the best, very fun, fast, and hardcore. 9/10",2
"great skill-based tactical shooter for which you need a couple of hours to get into, but its really rewarding and worth your time. also you can play one of the easy custom gamemodes, for example minigames, parcour, deathrun and a couple of others, but due to many maps and mechanics to learn, you can spend hundreds of hours in every single of those gamemodes, apart from the actual main game. really worth your time, no stupid leveling or unlocking weapons, just your skill.",5
"a very enjoyable game and requires strategic thinking i recommend!",3
"this is a good first-person shooter game. played it sinced 1.6 came out.",4
"this game is not your typical first person shooter. it may seem like just a basic shooter, but you will not be good if that is how you think. you have to have at least a little bit of straegy, as cts, you can not run in and expect to win the round, and as ts you can not expect to have clean takes on sites without using grenades. other aspects like controling your recoil, tapping instead of spraying, knowing when to peak a corner, and knowing when to have patience for a kill all give the game a high skill cap. i have 200+ hours in this game and if you buy it i hope you enjoy it as much as i do.",2
"im so addicted to this game but now i start hating it so much , since cs1.6 vlave coudnt stop cheats and hacks on this game , and now in csgo mmr most of players are using wh but they dont get bans . im really so upset now and i dont recommend this game unless you playing it in lan enviroment .",7
"amazing first person shooter and easy to run for people who want to get into pc gaming!",2
"if you like destroying the world or saving it from terrorists, this is your kind of game. a fps cooperative shooter aimed around teamwork above all else, this game is a must have. you can play either as a counter-terrorist or terrorist. your aim is to stop the other 5 players from achieving their goal in competitive mode. other modes such as, demolition and arms race are really fun as well. competitive mode is where its at though. you can group up with your friends or you can brave it solo trying to rank up to global elite. no matter what your playstyle is, enjoy the game for its unique way of gameplay. this game is a must have if you love pc fps.",2
"its one of them games where you absolutely hate yourself for playing it but for some reason you just cant stop yourself from playing it. youll forever be ranking and deranking if youre as bad at this game as i am and competitive will make you want to kill yourself at times. but for some reason youll keep playing it and recommending your friends to play it to. i recommend you get this game.",2
"it may lack some of the community nicest, beloved maps (assault, anyone?), and little features of past games, but global offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful, polished, and better looking counter-strike for whoever wants it. even if the community doesnt meet the golden standard of 1.6 and source, cs:go will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.",1

"great game, usually a one time fee of $15 but the past winter sale had it at $2.99/copy. valve does have some work to do on this game, while other games have balancing issues and a crappy player base, this game is not so much affected by that so much as it is affected by the subpar servers. about 95% uptime, but when they go down you get a penalty for leaving the match and get banned from competitive servers. this may happen multiple times in a row, and an undeserving player may find themselves left with much rage and a 7 day ban.",4
"i never played counter-strike before. cs:go was the first cs i ever played and i love it! great gameplay, good graphics, simple tasks and lots of missions. the thing i love the most about this game is that you can actually earn cool skins. you should definitely buy it!",4
"very good fps and of course very addictive, once you start you cannot stop. pros -visuals dont look too bad -addictive -not imbalanced -great matchmaking system -lots of game modes to try -hats lol cons -no linux support -bugs occur but rarely -community is quite bad ( not as bad as dota ) definitely worth the 15 usd and if you like fps w/o shift sprint or right click iron sights then go ahead and try it out. but of course check out gameplay first before anything.",1

"i definitely reccommend this game. it is by far one of the most fun fpss i have come upon. gameplay is very simple, there are different types of gamemodes with different objectives. additionally, the variety of maps also makes the game more unique, simply because of the different secret and strategical locations there are. you wont be meeting any cod fanboys in this game because it is simply class, however a recent change made a few guns have scopes similar to cod gun scopes. guns and all equipment is very well balanced allowing for a fair environment. counter-strike global offensive simply brings a sense of real fps. no healing, no medics just guns and people trying to shoot other people.",4

"making a new counter-strike game: smart. having new guns and  in the new cs game: pretty fricking smart. making the new counter-strike game have custom made skins by the community and operations: f*cking genius! although some may not agree to the whole dress-up concept of the game, but thats just the minority. who doesnt like awesome looking skins on your favorite gun? ok, but seriously, the game has improve is someways and fell in someways. for example, the accuracy on the guns are really... realisticly inaccurate?? idfk, but the accuracy on the deagle became sh!te unlike cs1.6 and cs:s. but the game has better ideas with keeping players in the zone/game. the new ranking system for example, players can now play ranked games and have scrims with random people or a clan. it makes you feel like youre a pro player playing in tournaments. do you feel satisfied with my review so far? if not, then how about you buy this freaking game and try it out yourself, eh? thank me later... for now, go have fun, good luck!",1
"great game! really enjoy the teamwork aspect, when you and some buddies can work together and complete the mission! worth a buy for any cs fan or someone looking for a more challenging fps.",4
"i like this game because my guns have skeletons on them.",2
"its fun but as soon as something happens like your computer overheats and you have to turn it off or your iternet connection decides it doesnt care anymore valve decides oh look that player has left the game for 3 minute i know lets give a ban. it starts out ok with a 30 minute then a day(i think) but then its a seven day ban and if you keep disconnecting from games you will constantly get a ban like me.",1

"unfortunately not as good gameplay wise as 1.6 or source, but still has a lot of good features.",1
"been a huge supporter and fan of cs since 99. there has been many changes over the years and releases, some good and some not so much. if you got over the difference from beta, to 1.1 to 1.5 to 1.6 to cs:s as i eventually did, youll feel the same going from cs:s to cs:go. while it is a bit different, there are a few great additions such as crate drops which you can buy keys to unlock a random weapon with different rarity levels. proceeds goto tournaments and its players so while being p2p at least a percentage is going to the community, and there is a chance to roll a rare weapon that you can sell for real money. all in all, ive only been playing cs:go for a short time now (about a month) and am slowly growing to love it. looking forward to losing many more hours of my life to cs and its greatness.",2

"while the multiplayer isnt very fun, the campaign entitled competitive provides an enchanting story with such great dialogue as fk u u  hacker and can sum1 buy me p90 pls. the story brings an intense buildup as the counter terrorists search for campers and accuse the enemies of hacking upon death. you will cry as a player disconnects due to rage over an online game, and you will laugh at the expense of others. 10/10 game would play again.",2
"fast, strategic, and punishing just like the original. now with chickens!",4
"as a cod player previously, this was not as much of a harsh slap in the face as expected. i find my gun skills are very sharp, and i am frequently asked if i have a second account. the only difficult thing coming from a fast-paced and careless call of duty experience is to focus, have patience, and actually think about winning. strategy is vastly more important in this game, and that is why tournaments are much more captivating than call of duty ones. if you are interested in something with teamwork-based elements and a competitive flair, then this game is perfect.",10

"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",2
"this game actually forced me to study russian. this game is genuinely good if, and only if, you have a full team to play with. if you go solo queue, its 99% that you will get the ruskipolskiblyat team that calls gg after the lost pistol round / and then again you will get a full team of svenskapojkar in your enemy team that have the most luck in this game no explanation available. -start pistol round, buy kevlar, go somewhere, see a t running on the otherside of the map->one dinks you in the head. also the timing in this game is something magical. get a nade/knife in hand or reload -> no matter what situation enemy will be 500% more likely to peek. watch a certain spot for 30secs, turn around, get killed from the spot. -half time, the screaming and all nonsense noise contest. once it gets in your blood, you cant quit.",10

"i would have not reccomended cs:s to many people, just because it didnt have a gamemode for everyone. however, cs:go does have a gamemode for most people. coming from cod and want to say youve played a real pc shooter? play deathmatch or arm race. warming up for competitive? play demolition. good at the game and the other gamemodes dont challange you enough? play competitive. cs:go is applicable and accesible to more people that cs games have been in the past.",3

"its just like call of battlefield 9 but you can also be a terrorist.",5
"its a cool game, just like cs 1.6 has ever been. if you like fps games then youll probably like cs, like i do. there are some bad points like the highest recoil i have ever seen in my life, you crouch and shoot on feet to get a headshot... sometimes you get modified weapons, there are the boxes that you can sell on market and etc. if you get to play this game a lot, youll get so many items that are marketable that you can even get your money back.",2
"awesome game that requires a players personal skills like reaction, strategy, foresight and practice, instead of relying on items or money for better items.",3

"yeah, lets write this review of cs:go shall we. good game, allright graphics, nothing spectacular, but the reason i dont like this game what so *ing* ever is the same reason as with why i stopped playing cs altogether so many years ago. the games community sucks and theres a hell of a lot of cheating. it is counter-strike alright, nothing more, perhaps a bit less. on a scale from 1-10, 8 for the game itself with the enhanced graphics, sounds, purchasing system and what not, 1 for gamingpleasure. do. not. buy. this. game. its not worth the price, since youre probably gonna ragequit in 30 minutes into the game anyway.",1
"you have seizures? cant aim straight for ? mouse is your enemy? or maybe youre blind? this game is for you! this is the only game where you spray down the enemy by aiming not at him (sniper rifles are the exception)! of course you have these nasty one-tap-headshots but who cares? all you have to do is to put your crosshair below your enemy and move it left-right and youre be gonna called a god! sounds good right? theres more - ever wished that using terrain to your advantage could save your life? now its possible! a single wooden step can cover you from a grenade lying 0,5 m from you! oh, and did i mention chickens? counter-realism: global addiction",5
"when i play this game i have fun somewhoat reliably",3
"i have not had a good ime with cs:go. it is another arcade like fps where you fight another team of soldiers in a small area, a concept which i see alot of and it is starting to get boring. i play alot of shooters like counter strike but for some reason i didnt like cs:go. i felt like the hit detedtion worked very poorly and people werent getting hit by my bullets even if i was directly behind them, with some gamemodes like deathmatch you respawn instantly after dying but because of the spawn system as bad as call of duty you die as soon as you start moving. cs:go also does something i hate in multiplayer videogames, it gives spawn invulnerability, that mixed with the bad spawns means that an enemy can spawn right behind you and kill you when you cant kill them because they are invincible. overall this is a poorly designed game and it brings frustration to me when i play it, i liked counter strike source but this game just feels like valve remaking call of duty.",1
"i love this game and play it for a few hours everynight and enjoy it very much. its a team bassed games and strategy is definly key. the competitivness is amazing and will get you hook once you understand the weapon base and recoil each individual weapon specificaly has. overall an amazing game from valve and is definly why i am hooked on steam!",3
"really really enjoyed this game when i played it. its very addictive and the economy was great so was the community but i think they need to sort out their anti-cheat. i kept going on about how bad it was, then one day, i am banned. so i feel it must be improved in some way. but to anyone buying it, there are lots of hackers lower in the ranks, but once you get higher its an amazing game. only buy it if you like playing with friends, teamwork and sometimes raging.",1
"this is a ton of fun im 400 and somthing hours its a great game you will get thousands of hours out of and a great community,in my opion its better than cod. rated 9/10 (would rate it 10/10 but russians ruin it -_-)",3
"this game is amazing! i recomend it to people. but would really be good is if the terrorists could move the hostages.",1
"very nice!! everyone should get it! low end machines are able to run it nicely ;)",3
"one of the best fps games i ever played, the graphics is stunning, and the part i like the most is how smooth the game goes, even when im using a crappy laptop, the game still runs smoothly without lag. this game requires skill and teamwork, controlling recoil, strategy, which i feel like this game can improve your awareness and tactics. i would rate this game 4.5/5, i would definetely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a new fps game.",4
"a really fun and exciting game that makes you want to play more. excellent game!",4

"i was banned 7 days. and i play and i just kill one team mate .. pga he steal my gun.. and now i am banned 7 days more... wtf.....",4
"very bad matchmaking system. it is a great game when the match is balanced, however that is a rare occasion. it would be better if the game took the rank of all team members and averaged it out and used that rather than using the highest rank to find a match. if there was a way to rank it halfway i would do so. money can, however, be made in this game and quite a lot of it; however, it is a gamble every time you open a weapon case that usually results in loseing money rather than makeing it. the game itself is good, but the matchmaking system could use some work.",3

"cod tetris mode! its like cod but without all the fun. some people might want to lure you in by saying cods fer fukkin kids bra, thissis so realtik, but standing still and shooting (not aiming god forbid) a pixel is surprisingly not as fun as it may sound. this is so realistic that a grenade doesnt kill you and a flashbang makes the screen go white, which is racist. if youre to poor to buy cod and you dont want to resort to prostitution, i recommend buying this 1999 mod, even though 4,99$ is a bit much for pixel hunt deluxe",2

"awesome game 10/10 if you get board switch it up and play surf or zombies such a fun game xd",5
"this game is pretty good. the community though can get quite annoying and they are the ones that can ruin the game for some players. the game is all about tactics and cases and how pretty your awesome knife looks. in some ways its cool to have but in others is a pure scam. other than that the game is usually heavily sided to the counter terrorists and alot more difficult when there are people without mics, but that is beside the point. competitive is a great way to really show your skill and prove to your oponents you are a force to be reckoned with. casual is well really casual and really layed back. all or most of the people dont really care if you win or lose or what your rank is, they just want a nice simple game while they talk about whatever. the guns here are usually pretty good but some are really over powered. the maps are nice and you should really lean how to read them, it will give you an advantage against newcomers. overall the game is a 8/10. cool game but has some dumb elements to it.",1
"this game makes marcel adams very happy because i can shoot other ers in the face while 7 year olds scream and yell at me in competitive while they continue to go 1-69. this game has amazing chicken a.i. i have enjyed all of the chickens as they turn me on. 69/69",3

"this is truly one of the best games i have played recomended to anyone who has free time",6
"this is a great franchise which started 10+ years ago. this game starts off with a cheap price even though it wasnt hit by a great steam sale. it is one of the best competitive games, but the elo system is a bit odd and doesnt have an indicator to when you are going to rank making you guess it out. overall most computers are able to run them; even the cheap $300 dollar dell you just bought from best buy. my biggest complaint with the game is the audio settings as you cannot adjust the output volume or incoming volume, and many other audio issues. not much hackers now a days but you will see a few lingering hackers. i give it a 8/10 since there is no default single player for those loving single player campaigns and stuff.",4
"this game has come a long way since i started playing, and i gotta say that valve has made the game so much better, it used to be a   game with  balance but now its (somewhat) balanced and fun.",4

"do you want a game that you spend half of your time yell at or being yelled by someone? do you want a game that will suck more money out of your wallet to get more skins? do you want a game that may or may not break one or more of your keyboards and or mouse? in all seriousness, counter-strike: global offensive is probably one of the better shooters, its even better if you have a team of friends that you can play with. it can be rather annoying at times, as it is one of those games that can make you break something that is within punching distance. the game also gets common updates and patches, that fix bugs in maps and buff and nerf weapons. they also have the operations that add new maps that add new spice to the game. so yeah, you should probably buy the game, make gabe happy. 8/10 too much water -ign",3
"counter-strike: global offensive is a great game. it has multiple game modes, an in-game skin economy that is not pay to win, and an active multiplayer even though it is a relatively old game. even if you dont enjoy it, its only fifteen dollars. there is no reason not to buy this. plus you can kill chickens at a nuclear plant.",3

"i was a bit late to the counter strike franchise. i played most cods (mw2, waw, and black ops 1) my life untill shown steam. i do own the other ones but this one, being the most current and with its own competetive online play is fantastic. get in a group with 4 other friends and youll have a blast yelling at each other for the entire game as someone will mess up and then everyone will start fighting. its pretty great fun, especially since after mge its very common to come across ddosers, wallers, triggerbots and aimbots. all in all, i do recomend this game, its pretty fun, and when youre not in a game with any of those people and you really get into it with some friends, its fantastic to play. get in there and start terrorizing or counter terrorizing!",2

"pretty fun, even though a 13 year old said im s h i t",2
"this is an amazing 10 out of 10 competitive ,team-based, fps for the pc, that has all the emphases on team. this game is non-stop action that requirs constant comunication, and fast reactions. this is no cod, or battlefield, this is hardcore, no jokes. the basic idea of the game is , 5 on 5 terrorists vs counter terrorist. the terroritsts have to plant a bomb on 1 of 2 bombsites. the counter-terorists need to either kill all the terrorits, defuse the bomb, or prevent the terrorests from planting the bomb in 2 minites. easier said then done. -stay low, move fast, shoot first, die last,one shot, one kill, no luck, pure skill.",5

"cs:go is the best competitive fps game i have ever played. i believe its difficult enough to be a challenging game for gamers. plus, its a really nice and enjoyable game. it has improved graphics from the other cs games and you can find it for only 10,99! there are two bad things about this game, one is that the competitive matchmaking can sometimes ruin your game (join you with noobs), the second one is that a lot of people get addicted with the weapon skins (valve items) and can spend a lot of money in cases and keys. to sum up, i recommend this game to everyone whos looking for a good fps to play. my rating is: 9.5/10.",2
"its the game of the future what are waitning for... :)",10
"can be more graphically improved. the weapons are more than excellent and the new grenades are awesome. cannot be compared to source or the classic counter-strike. it has probably the best game perfomance and optimization i ever seen. the only thing i really hate is that valves competitive servers are 64 tickrate, which is awful for me. # graphics :: 9/10 # sound effects and sound fitting :: 10/10 # gameplay :: 9.5/10 ### overall :: 9/10 - badass shooter!",7

"the game itself presents a good maps where co-operation is needed. this game is unusual, in case of co-operation needed where other games doesnt contain this thing at all. community itself is helpful to each other, if theres a need to help someone. so if you looking forward to buy this game; dont waste your time! buy it!",3

"cs: go stands as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longevity and variety. valve has not only updated the shooter but has completely outclassed its contemporaries. this is counter-strike, whatever the format you choose to play it on, and there isnt a higher recommendation than that.",2

"this game is very fun, it takes skill but its easy to get the hang of. its a fps shooter that made me a fan of the counter strike series. this was a short review but there is soooo much more to find out about this game. i recommend watching counter strike global offensive for dumbies on youtube it will tell you alot more",8
"its a very nice game if you dont know it i think you should buy it because its good and you can hook up whit your teammates and friends and play togeter there are mutch game modes that i can talk about for about an hour so i think you just have to try it out on your own !",1
"why i like the game: + there is a skill curve; high skill ceiling + nothing to grind (i.e. battlefield, you need to level up to unlock better guns/utilities) + very tactical, guns to buy in a round, map clearing + very different from the standard mms (modern military shooter) e.g. cod + weapons skins and stickers add a modest but impactful level of personalisation you shouldnt buy the game if: - you are looking for an easy-to-be-@-good fps. learning the weapon recoil and mastering them takes time - it is a sprinting-immediate spawning-grenade popping mms - if youre looking for a shooting game with ads",2

"first of all the trailer was amazing and had great detail, by far the best trailer ive ever seen for a game. the gameplay is amazing and the only problem with this game is the community some people can be impolite but valve was smart and added a mute function, the only other problem i have with this game is the teamwork issues in competitive sometimes i get into games and the people are idiots other times they just dont listen! overall i would say 10/10 it is an amazing game",2

"hey, i am just curious if anyone else does this. every day when i take a shower, i like to turn the water super hot, hold my nuts in my hand and let the scalding hot water run over them. lately my balls have been extremely itchy for some reason, so instead of itching them, i burn them with scalding hot water to relieve the itching and it is quite possibly the most amazing sensation ive ever felt in my life. it feels amazing and im doing less damage to the skin than if i were to scratch them. i just have to be careful because the hot water hitting my hand or my thighs hurts really bad so it can be difficult to only let the scalding hot water hit my nuts and nothing else. as ive been doing this, the itching has gotten less intense as the days go on so the treatment seems to be working. i know its weird but im telling you it feels incredible. im not saying other people should try it, but if youve got an itch, perhaps a better alternative is to burn them with scalding hot water. posted: 19 april 2014",5

"i totally reccomend this game. it can be competitive, casual, or you can play team deathmatch if you want an all-out firefight. this game can stomp call of duty any day, with its advanced tactics and intense gameplay. 10/10 would buy a key again.",2
"counter-strike: global offensive is the best counter-strike game",2
"seems decent for casual gameplay. still long way before it is as goos as 1.6 on a competitive level.",9
"even tho the game is great, we need to definatly have a better cheat detect system",6
"one of the best game ever!!! its just that stuffs are freaking expensive :((",3
"ing awesome game it gave me old memories of cs 1.6 back must play !",5
"great game , converterd from cod . this is great exept some russians",2
"i just bought the game cause some of my friends wanted to, first time i played, i wanted to quit. but i discovered that you can spend your well earned money that you want to save for sales just to buy virtual weapon skins. then theirs the recoil that gets in your way all the time. but, after around 3 days of playing csgo in total, i have mastered the true art of the recoil. the crosshair is the most important thing in-game, since that you just change it a little bit and you aim like a god. competitive is the real deal, but i am the sensei of ct. 10/10 would clutch again.",1
"i seen css when i was about 12 and thought i hope to play that in the future as i was a console player at the time. so when i finally got a pc i searched the latest version of csgo and ever since i have downloaded it i have never once got bored of it as it is exciting and unexpected if you dont have this you are missing out",3
"although it may have its flaws, it is a pretty good game. like every recent valve game, it has its own little economy, which takes place on the steam community marketplace. you could easily make a quick buck selling skins that you find throughout each week. the weapons occassionally get changed through updates, and will cause you to re-learn the ones that have been changed. overall, pretty good.",6
"i recommend cs:go to veteran players and beginners alike as the game has a balanced community, you can meet people who are complete s yet find some that are rather tolerant. the graphics are ok for a game that was pretty recent and maps created by the community are also playable. if youre aspiring for an competitive environment this is the place for you!",7
"good decent game, gameplay system and pretty much of the gameplay content is good but by good gameplay system means that this game lack of the freedom to control the settings, bots, weapons and such; which past counter-strike series once have. great graphics, lightning and environmenting which is visual pleasure that doesnt hurt your eyes like some of the other modern fps game.",1
"dont buy this game, its so good you will get addicted and it will ruin your life",5
"great sequel for a great game, counter-strike: source. smooth gameplay with twisting battles in amazing graphics. what else can you want from a fps game?",2
"this game is very good. and you will enjoy every second you play if you dont discover the csgo market. buy and selling knives cuns and anything with a big price tag will get you spending all your money on it.",3
"if i hear one more russian kid im going to be the first europe who is invading russia.",3
"i think this game is a great revamp of the old cs: 1.6 game. all the maps have updated textures, models and graphics. the fun just got more entertaining!",2
"by looking at the amount of positive and negative reviews you can come to several conclusions. 1. (and most obvious one) this game is pretty good. 2. a lot of people play it. 3. you will be addicted to the game, after playing several hours! why? because this game may not be the fastest paced game, may not have the best graphics, may cause you to be jealous of others, because they have paints on their guns (also called skins) in the value of more hundred euros, it may even cause you to sabotage your pc by raging, but the satysfaction shooting others while using teamwork, finesse and map knowledge and killing them is so satisfying, like in no other game!",4
"only the most competitive and skill based game on the market. you need some serious work if you want to become a professional cs player. great graphics. you need to think to play this game run strats to beat your enemies. the only thing in cs:go that i have a problem with is the map balence. every map is ct sided besides one map: de_dust 2.",4
"a really nice and enjoyable game..such different from the old cs.. it worth its money for sure.. +1",1
"i dont recommend if you are bound to get upset over a game. why you may ask? you have to deal with man-children. alot of them.",5
"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",2
"counter strike global offensive is a worthy successor of counter strike 1.6: - the graphics are great - it has all the good old maps - fun gameplay - new guns - sound-quality and weapon-models are better - over 50.000 items and maps on workshop this is the best counter strike imo. 10/10*",4
"if you enjoyed cs 1.6 youll love this. the potential to make money off of skins is an added bonus.",2
"for those who do not have the game to take it quickly. because its too strongly imaginative 1.6 with pretty good graphics i learned as a pc with a 4.0 rating you can go very well. and you and some cool items you win the competition. and too much fun !!! . rate this game 11/10. xd",2
"good game. requires tactics and knowing the right time to do certain things. many things come into play like recoil or accuracy when moving. would reccomend it to anyone who wants to play a shooting game but a tad more slow-paced and more tactical. if you want just a quick game you can do a casual or deathmatch. the competitive scene for this game is great and really expresses the tactics and teamwork of this game. without that your just a bunch of idiots with guns! 10/10",3
"anyone who played the original or cs:s will love this game. an alternative to the standard cod or gr games. for anyone who considers themselves a first person shooting pro, you need to experience playing this game",1
"a very old school game that still delivers in a new suit",2
"really good game. can make money by selling the weapon and case drops in community market.",2
"this game was activated with a product code that is valid only in a specific geographic region since your not currently in that region cs:go is not available to play",4
"cs:go best shooter game in the world!       valvethank u",3
"1st very good cheat detector 2nd realistic aiming 3rd realistic graphics 4th cool guns the negative is 1. bad competitive search server / glitchy 2. ragdoll needs improve 3. negev to op :v",4
"in all honesty, this game is not for people who like fun. this is for competitive people. for people like me, who just want to have fun and just play? dont waste your money, save it for something else. if youre a person who loves winning or losing and can stand people who are better than you, along with, in my opinion, terrible balancing and matchmaking, this game is worth every last penny. for graphics, it performs well, seems nicely optimized. not saying that its a bad game, just that you have to be a certain kind of person to get your moneys worth.",1
"strongly recomended,awesome atmospheric game,engine,effects,gameplay,system...you defenetly will like this game )",4
"1 hour in and the improvements over css have made me love this game. great buy for 3.75!",1
"great game, takes alot of skill! i recommend this game",5
"i can sell the crates in this game for a decent amount of money so theres that.",5
"the best one from the counter strike series the game keeps u addicted beacuse of its drop system,skins,crates and all high action packed game for fps shooter lovers highly recommended",5
"great game, definite successor to call of duty. except you still die from a sniper bullet to the toenail. 9/10",2
"making the switch from tf2 to cs:go is really hard because youll go into hat withdrawl from the lack of hats in this game. play at your own risk",2
"tf2 retextured. dont play unless you enjoy being called a noob and generally treated like trash by leet players.",1
"a really nice game few things need to be changed and it will be one of the best games",7
"this game is hard and stressful and i suck. good competitive play, updates regularly, well maintained, im gay",6
"well this game has to be one of the most retardest game in the world. oioioioioiooioioioioioioioi the number the numbers the numbers the numbers . nein nein nein nein nein nein nein nein.cancer cancer caner ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. what is this game anyway. who in the world buy this game.",1
"a good team game that relies on focus and skill. needs a ton of practice in fpss though gameplay and weapons: 10/10",1
"i got kicked from a match for telling someone their mic is too low. 10/10",3
"great game to play with friends or yourself worth the money. i have never played any of the other cs but this one is a must have if you like fps 10/10 i would say!",3
"allow gaben to roll around in his billions of dollars.",4
"game features: you can shoot using weapons !! you can crouch!!! you can jump!!!! you can throw grenades!!! 10/10 ,what do you want more than those amazing feautures?.go buy it.",2
"great game jsut be careful you dont blow your life saving on gabling on skins and knives! my bank account is empty! 10/10",4
"counter strike. the only game ill ever go back to. great!",6
"the game is a lot different from source. i find the game unique because it brings other new things such as mollies (fire nades), or even being able to put out those fires with smokes. i do think and hope that the competitive servers get fixed to 128tic so we can get better regs",3
"this game is awesome dont compare it to any game you wont find a game as unique as this it is hard at times but you will end up loving it i recomend this even if you dont like fps and if your into dota or lol try this game for a change it has the same compedtive inviroment",9
"best game from cs series, there is some differences from old versions so you want to lean them and accept. instant classic. buy it! play it! love it!",3
"i think this is very good multyplayer,good graphic and action-war game. 9/10 if you wanna buy one awesumeh game,buy this !",2
"it would be a great game if it werent for the russians.",3
"you shoot the peeps, they shoot you, you plant bomb, they defuse bomb, also, i like commas ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,",2
"this game is fantastic and i love how fast this game plays through",3
"if this game was a potato it would be a good potato. but all features ripped from hello kitty online. 4/20 -volkswagen",2
"good game, too bad its full of  who like repeating doge jokes and watch montage parodies. :(",3
"1. skins cost more than real things in life 2. watch katowice for 10h and not get any souvenirs 3. play agains wallhackers cuz vac sucks 4. 9/10",3
"much better than css, and actually makes me want to get back into counter strike. lots of different modes which are enjoyable and a decent game to play considering the price. my rating : 81",1
"a very competitve, comradery driving game that has been out for 15 years and still going strong. this game has changed the gaming industry as each year passes.",7
"great successor of the original counter-strike. matchmaking, competetive match system and rebalance are only making this game better. i strongly recommend to purchase this game - it is worth it.",4
"it is a good game so i recommend this game to be free for all, but... still i love it!",1
"lots of tactical shooty-shooty action. its not exactly like counter strike 1.6, counter strike source, or even condition zero if thats your hipster-like style. but this is in a good way, it just feels cleaner and more fun to play",1
"throw molotov at the door middle dust 2. teammates ran into fire, and i kicked for 2hr. 10/10",4
"counter-strike: global offensive is definitely a step in the right direction. all the people who played the older cs games will feel right at home with all the classic maps. however, everyone, no matter if its a new player or veteran, will have to get used to new things like recoil patterns, movement, etc. so everyone has an equal chance of winning, depending on how much theyve played and gotten use to the game, of course. cs:go combines tactics with shooting skills so well that it is one of the best well-ballanced and competitive shooters out there.",1
"bought the game on sale. made back all my money by selling items i got in game. best part of all i suck at the game.",1
"+ takes everything source did and does it a little bit better + much more customizable + very simple and addictive fps - again, most of the people in this game are hackers. you kind of need to be a hacker to have fun. its kind of tradition, but that doesnt mean youll have a good time.",1
"fun fast-paced multiplayer shooter that excels in both short and long gaming sessions. good balance with old-school and modern shooter and a nice variery of maps, many that are very familiar to those who have been playing earlier counter-strike titles. equal playing field as in there is no levels or anything, you get the access to best weapons right from the start. could be a bit rough for a newcomer but its all good fun and you get better as you play.",1
"got reported for hacking because i had 60 kills and 40 deaths 420/21 would get reported again.",2
"many good geme but bullet no go where i shot pls how do shoot and scope",5
"this game is awesome and intense at the same time :d",5
"we need 128 tick servers for the matchmaking ques!",4
"this game is too good. ing love it, unfortunately the community is .",8
"cs:go is a very good fps game with high quality and balanced wepon shooting. the other versions are more difficult to get in compepetive, but cs:go matches people with your level and i think it is very good.",6
"classic counter-strike for the modern age. taking the feel and style of 1.6 with the graphical and technical improvements of source, cs:go makes a strong case to be the best counter-strike. a well done matchmaking system makes it easy to find matches with stock rules. this is furthered by the ability to choose between casual rules for when you want to practice and ranked competetitve mode with the original rules. and, should you still want the modded community servers, its got that too. the esports community is alive and well with events like dreamhack and multiple other major tournaments with massive prize pools, drawing in the top teams from around the world. counter-strike:global offensive also introduces a weapon skin drop system for customization and seasonal passes to support mapmakers. all in all, this is the best of source and the best of 1.6 mashed together into one shiny, fluid, and amazing game. if you only are going to get one counter-strike, this is the one to get.",2
"this is one of the best fps games you can buy. if youre looking for run in, fire at everything then you may want to go for call of duty, but if youre looking for something with a bit more tactics and team play then this is it.",8
"worst call of duty ever made. call of duty:counter strike is a hipster minimalist approach to the franchise. imagine the game you loved with less guns, no perks, and no iron sights. how is this realistic, i dont feel like when i play this cod i am getting expieriance i can use in real life and pretend i was in the military with. come on activision get it together.",2
"theres still no dogs in this game... and i still cant watch them. also, i find it a little hard to move around and get supr pr0 h@3dsh0tttzzzz becus u hav 2 stand stil, whihc is stupid. valv3, y no ads? no, but seriously. buy this game. if youre looking for a competitive game thats not mmo, this is your game. its delightfully evil in its recoil patterns, and over 200 hours in this game and i still have trouble with recoil. not that its hard to learn, its quite easy. im just woefully stubborn... sometimes i feel weaker when my hair hits the speaker sometimes i feel stronger when to make it long fear, it surrounds me kicks n snares no boundries when the love of the music- wait this isnt a lyric page? oh. yeah. counter strike: global offensive. hard. fun. buy it. now. pls. k thx by by bby",10
"won a deathmatch round by killing chickens with a sniperrifle! 10/10 would buy it again",3
"best fps ever. havent stopped playing it 200+ hours played",4
"mw3, bf3. look at me. yes. that tiny ant. im look helpless, right?. let me tell you one thing: im going to recover my throne, since both of you suck hard. so yeah, goodbye. you can keep your 7 years-old ragekids, because the rest of players want play a good game.",1
"this game is like a roulette, fun until it turns into russian",2
"i was called autistic on multiple occasions. now i speak fluent autistinese.",6
"beginners ! be careful, this game asks a lot of patience and practice to be  good  and more enjoyable ! it asks also a lot of  rage  and  mind game , sometime things incomprehensible happen, maybe youre against a cheater (yeah, there are a lot of them unfortunately) or youre against a good play, maybe you should ask him some tips if you want to ! if you like fps, i would really recommend it !",7
"it`s a very weird fps, but in a good way it has a diffrent play style then the multiable othe fps i played and thats why i like it so much! :d",5
"highly recommended, a lot funny moment i got, but watch out for kill ur own friend",8
"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",2
"cs:go is a fantastic game that is one of the best shooters i have ever played.",3
"great game! if you love playing fps game then this one is something you should have.. whether youre looking to play casually for fun or want to be competitive ... this game is the one for you.. great price at $15 and no bs premium to unlock 80% of the game.....",6
"a really good game for fast gameplay. tons of fun would recommend",4
"with this awesome installment onto the original counter-strike games, you cant go wrong! some people get addicted to weapon skins, some people get addicted to the awp. the only bad thing in the game is that quitting a game in competitive gives you a penalty, but thats just because the team heavily relies on every member to do their job. get it now!",2
"move up. the team leader whispers, scanning the area in front of us with his m4 as we slowly cross the street. sweat circles my brow and hits my shoulder, making me alert of my surroundings. i think i see a figure in the distance but it is hard to see with this heavy helmet and these dark goggles. i tighten my grip on my carbine. i am in my element and something is in my presence; i can feel it. a feeling of sheer nervousness and dread washes over me like a tidal wave, am i going to die? i asked myself. suddenly, i hear a loud ping and an explosion of blood erupts out of my teammates helmet as i hear boom headshot over the mic. before i can even point to the shooter, i am on the floor with a bullethole in my head. boom headshot  i ed your mum last night... i am dead. 10/10",1
"this game just proves the fact that videogames dont need amazing graphics to be good. amazing work! piece of art :). 9/10",5
"this game is just awesome!! the grahics are amazing, the gameplay is great. i just hoped in competitive mode that you could abandon the match without a cooldown. i would rate this game 9/10. its just awesome!!",2
"i really like this version of the old cs. nice graphics and good game flow. just missing ranked clan play",1
"everything about this game is awesome. except the official matchmaking. and its 64 tick servers. and the hit registration. and the community. and the anti cheat system. oh and its digital knives cost more than real ones... yet somehow i blew a thousand hours on it. i guess the chicken ai is half decent?",7
"ive gone through at least 3 keyboards, purchased 4 seperate copies, spent >50 on skins and subscribed to 4 cs:go twitch.tv channels, all because of this one game. what can i say? its the purest fps shooter that money can buy. no killstreaks, no deathstreaks, no commander mode, no marksman bonuses, nothing. you buy a gun, aim it at someones head, and bang; the person with the highest skill level level will make it out alive. thats why the game is still so popular. if you enjoy the fps genre, do yourself a favour... buy this game.",6
"very tactical,nice first person shooter,btw no iron sight though :(",2
"great game. fast old school fps with some new things. its still good old cs though its not czero would buy it again.",1
"a really good game, made more then 60$ off it and a lot of great time. 8/8 - i r8 m8.",5
"the storytelling and character development bring cooter punch: worldwide defense together to make a truely gripping tale of sorrow and hardship",2
"uhm, i love pretending to shoot people, and this game not only makes that something i can do frequently, but also enjoyably. also my gun is purple and covered in stickers, and thats really really awesome! love video games!",3
"modern rebirth of the legendary team-based tactical shooter, this game builds on its forefathers addictive gameplay with a polished new engine and slick mechanics,and all this makes the game host of one of the largest professional esports scenes.",2

"you either die a noob or live long enough to get called a hacker",7
"would recommend if you like black people. a++ would play for hours with a bunch of africans.",1
"if youre missing out on cs:go, youre missing out on a lot. the counter-strike series has always been an enjoyable expirience, but with global offense the fanbase and the series have improved tremendously. i may be no casual gamer, but over 300 hours is still a lot for me, considering i have a rather busy schedule on my hands. cs:go has exceptional graphics, good sound quality, an excellent player-to-developer setup, and since i upgraded my computer i have found very little issues with this new installment. very competetive, however, and for anyone who is new to the game i recommend spending many hours into bots before you go online. bots can be more predictable, and more importantly if you miss a shot your team isnt going to scream at you. there are also some excellent people out there like thewarowl who can really help newbies learn the basics of the game and then that little bit extra. the only thing i really have to say besides that is that every dollar ive thrown at cs:go on the market ive wasted: never un box",2
"its a fat cat hat simulator. what do you want from me.",9
"for someone who played counter-strike for years, counter-strike global offensive is the succesion of that legendary game. valve perfectly knew that people wanted the real gameplay of counter-strike, and they did it good in cs:go. the gamemodes are awesome, especially the matchmaking. overwatch is something revolutionary to avoid cheaters, but there are still some that are not respecting fair-play. i recommend cs:go to every people who want to see what a real fps is.",4
"worth every penny and agonizing moment of depression.",9
"if csgo was a banana, i would eat it, and thats saying something cos i dont like bananas :o",3
"this game is the really fun and comepdetive play it or die! :d tip dont open cases just buy a good gun if you really want it! :d i got a asiimov and a stattrak mehndi so im very happy!",2
"this map is awful. you can cover the bomb site from your mum - orix - 10/08/2014",2
"gameplay: insanely realistic, trained anti terrorists can not shoot unless they are completely still, shotguns can be used as sniper rifles. balance of weapons: all weapons are very balanced. especially the sniper that can 1 hit kill you anywhere but your pinky toe. community: friendly and forgiving. except for the ocassional team of 4 smurfs and a hacker that seems to happen every game, as well as the 2 members of your own team whocant speak english/are 7 years old. 11/10 would commit suicide again. seriously though",3
"the king of competitive online shooters, need i really say more?",1
"good game but need many server in my country, my region",2
"blue things with white hats, blue things with white hats everywhere.",2
"if you enjoy a game with players that do not see the sunlight, this is a game for you. i personally dont understand why aiming wasnt implemented.the aiming makes no sense whatsoever. whoever designed weapons were their bullets would continuously either hit the ground or fly to jesus, should be hung. this is a real weapon shooters nightmare, a bunch of little screaming boys spraying their weapon to all , and the hardcore sniper using mlg players, is attrocious. the amount of time players have on this game is concerning. upwards of 1500 hours is scary. the best way to waste $15 is to buy this game. i would much rather eat $15 than have bought this game. i just plain dont understand the point of this game. also, who the  would want to be a terrorist anyway? 1/10",1
"why i cant rank up: russians teamkillers squeakers trolls hackers (from the other team) internet problems 4,20/10 best geim,worth buying :)",6

"full of raging 12 year old kids! but a great game overall.",3

"very good game, if you want to play for fun- casual is perhaps not as fun solo but competitive mode with friends or on your own is incredibly fun the majority of the time (if you win). easy to get to grips with, much different to most fpss and takes a lot of skill but can be picked up reasonably quickly with more gametime.",2
