"i love this game.....this game having best performence in online.....cant stop playing when i start it........:)",2
"the good old shooter that was one of the biggest things that started nowadays fps ..... great game if you know how to play it",1
"counter strike    first person shooter game(fps)   mods : public , deathrun , jailbreak , furien , zombie , hidenseek , hidenseek blocks.        .     .     steam      server gather         non steam      48.     gather(servers grnet)      mirc. all rights reserved.",3
"what is there to say.. its counter strike, the best shooter ive ever played, forged cod, cs forever.",1
"wow.. its amazing.. i quit this game year a go.. but now im again addicted o that!!",3
"by far the best fps i played. to many hours lost to this game as a kid.",1
"this game , is the best you can get. lets us to make friends , and makes brotherhood between us <3 but the recent  hackers which have joined has made it hard and annoying. but this game will live forever. <3",1
"the original game that started it all. innovative, challenging, and teambased multiplayer. it takes years to master, but once you do, its an amazing feeling. 9/10",1

"best fps ever.the best counter strike game(following go on 2nd place).the hardest tactical fps out there where the guns have actual recoil and you need real teamplay and cooperation to win",1
"spent many years playing this game and it was amazing. console commands and the simplistic gameplay makes it a great game. mods such as wc3, uwc3, shero make the game half fps half rpg which i loved :). however, like most fps, hackers ruin the game and is probably the main reason for the low population aside from the repetitiveness.",1
"still addictive to play and very fun! with lots of servers to still play in.",2
"my first game ever purchased, it will be in my life forever :)))))",1
"if you join the army or some special force, you have to buy your own gear. the heck?",1
"absolutely speechless, is what i am when i think of the counter-strike series. look at this game, it was one of the most detailed fpss for its time and it still has it. no game series has been able to remake css addictiveness or its smooth gameplay. this game is one of the few titles that still requires skill, every weapon is earned and every weapon requires its own type of mastery. a truly great title that me and many others will return to play for a very long time.",1
"i have a lot hours on non-steam version. counter strike forever!",1
"i wish i could give a comprehensive review on this classic shooter, but im not allowed to play it anymore. i have 1.6 hours played.",1

"one of the best fps games ever. still play it till this day never gets old.",2
"i just cant stop playing that game it controls my mind",1
"this game teaches people why graphics dont matter.",2
"yep its the original countre strike, be a terrorist or a counter terrorist and shoot points to score, beautiful smooth gameplay, much better than that crappy source engine updates, come up with a good spraypaint logo to reach the bonnus round, i like the surf levels as well, valve when will you finally listen to the community and make surfing an actual game mode? it is a very respectful game for its age and i give it a good score in the end.",1
"its the most ultimate game a person can ever play !!! love everything about it !!!",1
"best oldschool game ever, and still playable... but only one think is frustrating me is cheaters...",2
"i recommend this game because the great gift pile asked me to. also because its still the best ing shooter out there. thats right,  call of duty,  battlefied,  halo. 1.6 peoples.",1
"cs 1.5 or 1.6 was the birth place for me, to be a pc gamer - 10/10 !!",1
"most fun ive ever had playing an fps game on pc. so much better than call of duty, and probably has better graphics too.",1
"best call of duty community simulator with old outdated graphics so far.",1
"the game may be old, but it still gives hours of fun.",2
"nothing like the good old days with the classic of the classics, counter strike has been such a huge game for me, and also for the world as one of the most played multiplayer games on the internet, i remember like if it was yesterday the old days when i was a children playing lan games on the computer class with my classmates, and not forgetting when i learned to play it with the help of my older brother, it is such a nostalgic game and one of the best ive owned in my life. totally recommended to get back to the old days",1
"oh counter-strike... if you dont have this game then where have you been the last 15 years -_- (also its my personal favorite fps)",1
"nu imi mai merge counter strike cs 1.6 intru in joc si imi apare half live ma poate ajuta cineva?",5
"15 years on and this is still the best first person shooter (fps) game in the history of gaming which formed the base for all the new fps games developed so far!",2
"its a very good game for relaxation and even for joy... the best part of it is defending others!",1
"cannot emphasise on how great this game is. its ridiculously fun with friends, mods and such. a tad old, but its still functional. 9/10.",1
"best game ever. counter strike of all counter strikes.",1
"ive played this game since i was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever i launch it to this very day. over 12 years of endless entertainment. no other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than counter-strike 1.6 has and i doubt no game ever will. reason ive only got 38 hours here is because i no longer use the account i originally played cs 1.6 on. func_vehicle is what makes this counter strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.",3
"pew pew hip fire headshot best competitive fps ever made bar none 11/10",1
"after you play counter-strike:global offensive you cannot play this game any more.is garbage beside counter-strike:global offensive.dont buy this game.it was great game at is time but now is too old.buy counter-strike:global offensive.",1
"awesome game. if you have a lot of free time cs:go is definetly the best fps to try. i recommend this game!",1
"hellio guys plz help me when i am run counter strike it works fine i see ct then the black screen shows up and half life ahs stopped working :/ plz help me",1
"great game!! nice graphics!! online servers are good... sometimes non-steam cheaters appears but if the server has admin, should be fine... nice game for people who got low graphics in the computer",1
"my first game ever......:`( good memories.... it helps you to play csgo! 100000/100",3
"best game of all times. hope it will have match making system like cs:go with a bit better graphics.",1
"the world will never forget this game! i am really proud of it!",1
"the best fps games i have ever played. it has over 15 years old but even that it still keeps the level of gameplay. a lot of modes and free dlcs made by players makes this game even more amazing. i dont regret hours spend on playing this one.",4
"this game is a classic and will never die in my mind. i have not purchased the new global offensive yet because i am still stuck reliving my glory days on this wonderfully made fps. happy hunting!",1
"the best fps created. it is because of this game that the fps was revolutionized, be it in the competitive scene and the casual scene. nothing can compare to the greatness of this game.",1
"best game you can get on steam, but it was better on won.",1
"i recommend this game if you play with your friends or at least on only steam servers.",1
"every counter-strike is a must buy. not only are they all really fun, but it is really interesting to see the progression of them. 1.6 is the start of the series, and i thoroughly recommend looking up and downloading the original beta maps from 1999 like docks as they were originally part of the game (although most of them removed due to unfair map design [except docks]). cs 1.6 is a fun game, but if you arent interested in playing older games then i wouldnt bother, source and global offensive are newer and more replay-friendly games.",1
"one of the best fps in the early 2000s. this game just brings back nostalgia and memories. a must have game for all players.",1
"cs 1.6 one of the best and addictive fps games ever made",1
"its like cs:go....but losing isnt even that bad in this one. which makes it better. no ranks which is also nice",1
"i am not a pro but yea 10 years ago i bought it and i <3 d it so much , i still do",1
"this game sucks so much it makes cod look beast. screw you gaben you fat piece of sh*t",1
"this is the best counter-strike ever, ruined my life. 5 stars <3",4
"one of the most played steam games, even now it still is. great game to pick up if you own csgo, to see where it all started.",1
"the game is very fun for its age and i have had a lot of fun playing this. this game means a lot to me and to some of my friends. this game was my first ever multiplayer game when i started playing it in 2007, when i didnt have steam and had to pirate it, sadly. im fairly sad that it is dying, but it had a good run. 10/10",1
"probably would be better if the playerbase was actually ing english",1
"this game as its released a long time ago, but it still carries the compitive sense, unlike the new versions of counter strike (source and go), playing this game is fun and i think it would remain as a favourite game as much as i play anymore games.",1
"great game, old but gold. i dont get bored at all",1
"ive spend bajilion hours on this one. best game from the series imo. remember its not all about the graphics - gameplay is what matters. 8/10",1
"this is still the ultimate fps in terms of skill and balance. i have yet to find another game that has come close to the level of skill required to become a professional.",1
"best game i ever played in my life! recommend this game!!!",2
"a still alive first-person shooter, since 2000. the game that changed everything, along with half-life. still, the best first-person for thousands. and you know why? because this games focus isnt on graphics. its for having fun with your friends, or, even aim for world turnaments. all proffesional teams, such as fnatic, navi, sk, still play counter-strike, doesnt matter if it is 1.6, source or global offensive. highly recommend this game.",4
"this is my fav game and i like it so much .. its so good .. u should try it",3
"15 year old game @ $9.99 really how gready can you get valve.",1
"launched the game, joined a random server , laughed about 43 minutes because of the graphics and animations, got rekt by some fgts , insulted them and their families , closed the game and laughed again because i acted ridiclous , opened the game again, rejoined the server, insulted them again , closed the game another time and laughed enough to cry a bit. one of the best gaming experiences i ever had. 9.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10 would get eye cancer because of the graphics again. its not a full 10 because there are no 499 knifes.",1

"revolutionary new game for 2012, better graphics than cod",1

"this is the game that started a genre, every shooter since cs has copied its competitive team-based style of play. its the original to a legacy, and many people still play it to this day. it has older graphics for people who might not have an expensive computer, plenty of dedicated servers, and the core gameplay that is known worldwide is right here where it belongs. but obviously you know this already unless youve been spending your life playing on xbox and playstation. right?",1
"this game is very old,but it is still one of the most enjoyable and played games.i red in a comment that,for gamers,the graphics arent important,but the gameplay is.when we talk about counter-strike 1.6,it is very true.",1
"this game is simply great and skill based the problem though is that most people who still play it are super experts litterly shooting through walls and kiling you when you spawn also the population is not to high but still there for the price i think its worth a buy",1

"great game, tho graphics are not nowadays quality because its been made in 1999.",1
"you know buddy i played the game, it was so confusing i dident have a clue what to do, i had a gun in my hand for some reason and others too. i just ran for some minutes and was too afraid my pc was gonna die of overheat of how hard it had to work for those graphics so i quit the game. this was a 15 min of playtime with half of the time loading. 0/10 would never play again. it all was a joke sorry. xd",1
"tactical and strategic game and a lot of team work :) nice game...... i love to play cs 1.6 every time i open steam. n1 :d",1
"one of the best shooters ever made. no levels, no accessories for your guns, no cheat guns... just you and your skill. lots of hours spent in this game and so much fun i have had with it. 8.5/10 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- uno de los mejores shooters de la historia. no hay niveles, ni accesorios, ni armas chetadas... solo t y tu habilidad. muchas horas jugadas en este juego y me he divertido mucho con l. 8.5/10",1
"this game is a proof that games do not need to have good graphics for it to be fun & addictive. its one of the games which gives you the oppurtunity to go online & have fun with your friends :d",5
"it truly was one of the best first person shooter games at the time. i still play it to me graphics dont matter, the playing of the game matters.",1
"ahh cs...for many of us born in the 90s, this game took our fps virginity...writing a negative review about this game is like writing a negative review about sex...im sorry if you had such a tragic experience...",1
"this is my favourite game and also from my point of view the moust interesting shooter game ever made. is best to play it with friends or with other people to test your skills.",1
"great game! this game shows you how fps has evolved into one of the most popular game genres. this game is old, has not many multiplayer servers and has graphics that arent the best, but i assure you that you will have some fun with it. if yoiu are getting this game because yiu are looking for a good fps, buy counter strike: global offensive or even better counter strike: complete.",1
"its old and the graphics are outdated... but screw that! this is really fun to play, even though there are tons of pros",1
"as of 2015 i get a resolution problem loading any goldsource games i cant see any of the menu buttons. i have tried every fix i could find nothing works.",1
"arguably the best competitive fps so far, the skill ceiling is very high; however getting started is easy.",1
"very fun game, graphics are disappointing and just not nice, i personally live in israel, israel has a lot of multiplayer servers and their sons loads admit most enjoyable so it makes up for the graphics ... also has the option to fight against bots you can practice with it or simply pass the time, i wish there was such a nice single player. so in short, if you are looking for a game with many indians, multiplayer servers, easy and fun then this is the game for you!",1
"this game i got from my brother its fun to play and it has plenty of lag free servers.i recommend it!",1
"although i dont have nearly as many hours on this as go, its my favorite cs (besides 1.5 and below). the game is more tap-based. i feel like its more strategic than go. i wish the pro scene had not died out for this game.",1
"best game on the pc, game 13 years ! the audience of players still be numbered in the millions. the perfect game engine provides unlimited possibilities, a large number of modes (zombi, biohazard, surf, gungame, jump etc) make the game varied and exciting. only here you can with one clip to put entire opposing team, then plays the role of your skills playing shooters. the only game in which you can play for years and still have fun.",1
"this is my very first game that i played on steam, counter-strike. this game brings back good memories. very addicting. its probably the only game that people are playing today on that isnt running off from a source engine. if you never played counter-strike 1.6 before, try it out. its one of the best fps game of all time. if you dont like it, well, you didnt paid alot of money for it.......or did you?",1
"this game fun when i stuck in russian internet cafe in forest but now i live in glorious european i can play csgo!!!! ( only poor chinese and russia play this, sometimes a german))",1
"fun fps but there is a high learning curve. suprisingly fun after 15 years.",1
"the best online fps game. not as good as v1.5 though. but since 1.5 is no longer available, this will have to do.",1
"i think it`s the best of the counter-strike. graphics aren`t good but it`s not most important part of this game.",3

"great game with an active community! just dont expect to be playing any normal missions any time soon, i also enjoy the smoke in this installment, you can see through it if you walk right through it, also it is suprisingly difficult for the first installment, maybe im just bad, i dont know, so anyways get this game if you like team based fps if you dont like that genre, i reccomend you skip this one, 7/10",1

"the original where so many people destroyed their computers over this game from being sniped. ahh.",1
"one of the best first person shooters ever the thing that makes this game so awesome is that you will always have competition and theres no excuse for losing or winning because the only thing that can make you good in it is experience there are no in-game purchases and its really hard to get pro or even decent as it doesnt have auto-recovery as many fps nowdays highly recommended",1
"unlike cs:go, with getting expensive knives and later after you finally figure out how to use it you get shot by a noob. this game offers true russian language speaking lessons, i have now learned fluent russian and somehow learned german along the way. it works like a true russian language speaking (and german) simulator should, 8/8 m8.",1

"best ever in the century. no matter graphics, this game takes your gaming upto a higher level and brings you a better gaming sense. <3",1
"this game is the best action shooter ever made, its gameplay is very well balanced and you have many options and tactics to do. actually, if you play cs:go, then this game is exactly the same except that the graphics are from 2000. but this does not matter. gameplay is far more enjoyable then graphics! and if steam was built aound this game, well, then it must be some good stuff.",1

"counter-strike is one of those games that i can play for only 2 minutes. seriously, the graphics suck big chicken nuggets. the thumbnail for this game makes it seem like its graphically in tents, but it is not. id say wait for sale then buy because this game sucks.",1
"better than source or even global offensive. traditional old game that comes from another awesome game, half-life. you can not end your gamers life without playing cs.",1
"i love counter strike, i should end it here. but ill be honest and say i grew up with source, wasnt old enough to experince 1.6 sadly. but giving it a try, its very different, having to buy ammo, see what the original maps looked like before being changed in source. and dealing with pros that somehow can deal with the game choppyness and inaccuracy. ill stick with source, but great game! 9/10",1

"possibly one of the greatest first person shooting games ever made. try it out and see how you like it. too bad that numerous number of hackers are around these days, but not a probem if server admins are present. you can try maps like dust/dust2, assault, or even fy maps like snow and iceworld. awp maps are also great if you like scoping and killing opponents with one shot. maybe even go for some of the fun surfing maps that are still around. lastly, fyi it does take some time to find the optimal sensitivity setting that you play the best with.",1
"i grew up with this game,best children memories , new friend , adventures. this game will stay on my heart.",1

"this is a good game i recommended to you. this game is old bath a good game for nolifers. if you play this i recommend a server ladie.lt this is a good server. this server is of lithuianian country.",1
"although this game was made 100 years ago, it still retains its core value being a great fps shooter that requires team work and not just 360 no scoping. this game wouldnt mean anything to a 13 year old because the graphics arent great but to a person my age this game holds many hours in my heart. 8.5/10",1
"best game ever...spent more than 10 happy years playing it. beware of cheaters tho. gl & hf",2
"the great classic. this is my favorite fps of all time next to team fortress.",1
"play the original that started it all. complete with no skin no crates no keys and a whole lot of nostalgia!",1
"one of the best multiplayer games out there right now. fun, strategic gameplay. best played with a couple friends or a full team of people that you can communicate with.",1
"on my imac cs 1.6 the mouse glitches, lags whatever... lost 7 quids ... :( cs:go way better despite of its usage, my imac can play the game perfect with lags!!!",1
"counter - strike 1.6 is the most original first person shooter i played in my life. counter - strike is an absolute fun game with action - packed maps full of different varieties to choose from. there are tons of weapons from automatic to semi - automatic, shotguns, handguns, and etc. it will definitely give you a blast of fun memories and its a good game to enjoy for a long time. check it out !",2

"the original,the one that started it all......great job.*clap*",1
"no matter what, hands down my favorite pc game. all-time best shooter, in my opinion, and im always hoping for the comeback.",1
"although it has poor animations and graphics, it is still one of the most played games, and its still running. this game is created to test out players reflexes. with great skills, comes great victories. put your skills to the test with this counter strike, one of the best first player shooting game ever released, with more than 1000 of servers online 24/7.",1
"i found that once i lowered my resolution to 640 x 480 i became 70% better at the game. makes heads bigger and easier to aim at so its pretty similar to cs:s. gg ez noobs get rekt fgts easily 9/10 go buy it",1
"when i was 17 years old, i escaped 34 days from school to play this with my friends and i didnt pass in school that year . now its 11 years later and i still consider that year the best in my life . 11/10 would escape from school again .",1
"it seems i am now a legend after playing this game...",1
"best game ever, too bad there many cheaters on it.. r.i.p.",5
"it is impossible to play this. gl if you try, i even tried noob servers and still got owned. any fps looks like an ez pz game compared to counterstrike.",1
"best game ever made... domination of movemenet, shooting mechanics - recoil... exaclty what a fps game need... when developers of this game genre learn that this 2 things are the most inportant for good fps, they will make a game as good as cs 1.6 is... cs:go does not have these major aspects, and doesnt deserve name of counter-strike (imo). as a third very important thing for fps game, i would say the animations... the animations of player models such as runnig, walking, crouching, gun holding/fireing/reloading etc... graphics isnt so important, doesnt need to be sooo good, but decent due to visibility...",2
"this game is basically just cod with bad graphics. i rate it 10/10",1
"why cant i run counter strike 1.6? its running half-life and gives me some kind of error message, and then i press ok on that, and it closes down...what the hell?!",3
"this game is the game of the millenium...its the only game that is played from 2000 to today. every pc is capable to play this game, even the one that didnt got their driver updated on 2003(probably). so yeah, if you are a fan of old-school, this game is for ya.",1
"awesome game! excellent variety of weapons and maps. great feel. not like any other fps i have ever played. 100/10!",2
"counter-strike its really amazing, but today really its bad we cant play good, just before are good. server are sh~# ppl are sh%$ really its bad people play free, play clean, play to your mode, and off hack, off cheating , off scripting, off all play fun :)",1

"the wise counter-strike 1.6 veteran said.. if you dont like 1.6. you dont deserve to live.",1
"new into cs?? counter-strike is in!!.. well actually, counter-strike is a good game incase youre starting new carrier of gaming. counter-strike is the best in my opinion. before playing counter-strike: globle offensive, i chose to go in line.. counter-strike > counter-strike: source > counter-strike:globle offensive. ive been playing cs:go from a pretty long time but, i loved counter-strike. this counter strike is counter strike 1.6.. so, id like to recommend this game:)",1
"just amazing <3.. most complete first person shooter game :d",2
"probably my favorite fps of all time, been playing since the m4 had a scope.",1
"the granddad of all shooters! this game is the definition of excellent. this game may be old, but its still a great game to play. also, its really cheap!",1
"the good old counterstrike never seems tiring and boring. i still play it till date alongwith counterstrike : global offensive. valve should release update for the remaining bugs and glitches and revamp the graphics keeping the gameplay same.",2
"not quite addicted about this game like others but i must praise it for its realistic like recoil of the weapons and the sounds but overall the game must rest some day an 8 out of 10 this game is not my style but still playng it with some friends when we try to prove who is better at giving head shots. :)",1
"its ing counter-strike. what are you reading this for? buy it already.",1

"repeatedly blew myself up all on my own. 9/10 would be forever alone again",1
"a game which will never bore anyone.. i never tire of playing this game..been 8 years and still counting..life as a cs player rocks..",2
"one of the first first-person shooter games i ever played, and im so glad it was. this game was amazing and i easily clocked 1000 hours over the years of playing. for its price now, you should definitely buy it. source is good and all, but the original of the series is the best, by far.",1
"it was the best game ever made before valve  it up!!!and yes i still hardly recommend this hardcore shooter!",1
"played this for like 7 years before steam was even created. great game.",1
"what to say ? the game is amazing ! this game is my past ! :)",1

"my first game on steam, and after all these years since 2004, cs is still my favorite game. its interesting, fun and nice fps game. 10/10",3
"oh...its only the best team based first person shooter of all time.",3
"there nothing but to say, its counter strike 1.6 best mlg game that ever lived! jk its not the most, but you know its really good! 8/8",1
"best online shooter ive played also because you can mod it for fun. this game takes more skill than a multitude of other games and for anyone to ever miss out on this game is doing a complete disservice to onesself note to get the original onscreen multiplayer skins set the game models to not be hd in the video options menu",1
"probably the best shooter ever made (and it will probably stay that way). this game literally changed the way how shooter games are today. well done valve, well done !",1
"i love this game its such a classic that stands the test of time i highly recommend it",1
"its counter strike, the whole reason steam even exists!",1
"source ,1.6 is and will ever be the best m8.just check itand feel the diffrent. aight",1
"dis is an excellent game mindblowing cant leave without dis game",2

"love this game. you can play it for 5 mins or 5 hours, try hard or barely try. it will always be my go-to game.",4
"go to your library ; right click in counter strike ; properties - launch options -nomsaa -nofbo",2
"the game that started it all for me. simple and to the point is how i would discribe it. bad guys vs good guys, eliminate the team and take your place in the cs hall of fame. i ended up playing this game for a professional team in the cpl tournaments.",1
"in my opinion, this is quite simply the best multiplayer fps shooter of all-time",3
"this is where history was written. the son of the big daddy half-life. since the game was released, even with newer versions like source and go, it is still very popular. example of a masterpiece.",1
"if you cant get counter-strike: global offensive, this is great replacement for it. its not as popular, but it still has a big amount of players. some servers may be in languages you cant understand, but the game is still very fun and requires a great amount of skill. one of the best first person shooters, that still holds to this day from 1999. although the games graphics...arent really the best. even then, you can get skins, map textures, etc. to spice the graphics up a little bit. though to me, graphics dont really matter. highly recommend this game. 9.5/10",1
"not really know what to say...but still the best online fps game :d",4
"simply the best game ive ever played (and possibly will ever)",1
"this game is awesome. shoot face and impress the girls.",1
"in my opinion 1.6 has less hacker than counter-strike:global offensive. then again 1.6 is made up of a few servers with small coumminty base and more than likely has an admin in game. best physics in any counter-strike game. probably not top notch graphics.. just get your friends and have a piss",1
"played more than 300 hours since steam is counting. this is a must-play for everyone, an absolute classic.",1
"if you want to be a pro in team fortress 2 , you must be a pro in this first . dont ever stop playing this.this will make you a true sniper :d",1
"this came out 14 years ago, and it still has better graphics than your average call of duty game.",1
"cs 1.6, gameplay is good, good fps shooter game, enjoy it. buy it",1
"if youre on steam and you havent played, or own this game, just kill yourself.",1
"hello people, i would like to spread the world about this game. graphics kinda bad, but its about the action, eh? so, it is mainly based as a game, terrorists vs counter-terrorists. terrorists have to plant the bomb,(at de_maps) or secure the hostages (at cs_maps). counter ones needs to do the opposite, defuse or deny the bomb (at de_maps) and get the hostages back (at cs_maps). there are a lot of mods, if you dont like the classic mode. but i really think that everyone knows about this game :). p.s. im doing this for a steam badge :d",1
"this is a fun but old game will still make you amd like any other fps (this is alt account so i know what im saying)",1
"this is cs. nuff said. no review needed. if you have steam and dont know cs, there is something wrong",1
"still nice after all these years. just need to get all those annoying cheating kids off your back",1
"well known fps shooter game counter-strike will change your life! dont be lazy to pay 9 for such good game. i recommend you to try this game! seeya ingame :)",4
"how to end your life step 1 - download this game done .",3
"this game used to be good, but that was back in 1999-2005. now, its just filled with  children and people who dont have jobs and live in their mothers basement playing cracked copies of this game, while screaming at other people in russian and lithuanian, and theres cheaters galore. i recommend buying cs:cz or cs:s, or even better, cs:go.",1
"after playing cs1.6 (sorry for not playing earlier ones), css and csgo, this still reigns supreme? why? it feels so smooth. its fun. great maps. graphics arent all that bad (and are done much better than csgo) and the bots arent all that bad.",1
"first game i played competetive, enjoyed, good watching the professionals play",1
"thankx valve laav this cs pack and 1.6 <3 my life :)",1
"a very good game you get a lot of cookies and potatoes",1
"running this at 60fps doesnt really help seeing as how the animations are at about 15fps. gotta respect the classics though.",1
"the original recipe of counter strike. play it or die!",1
"very nice game. most addicted multiplayer game of all time!!",1
"excellent action packed dynamic game, where you get to test your reflexes and meet and play online with your friends!",3
"the multiplayer fps that started it all. might be a old game, but its better than cod, also, even though the graphics are , that doesnt mean the game is. instead of picking your loadout, you get in-game money to buy weapons from a menu. there are no attachments to the weapons. there isnt that much to say, but its still very good. final verdict 10/10 classic.",1
"the reason why you should be using steam in the first place.",1
"first game i played competetive, enjoyed, good watching the professionals play",1
"this is quite an enjoyable game and one of my fav ,,,",2
"this is an old game. but its good and have some multimod servers and its funny game and i also play it , any 1 rich in steam can buy this game soo easly because its cheap",2
"have been playing since 6.5 and there are still 12 year olds flaming me in voicechat 10/10 for tryhard authenticity",1
"i really enjoy playing cs 1.6 . this is a great game and i really enjoy . i recommend you all to play this game . hence, this is one of the best games i have ever played .",1
"ok, ill be honest when i first got this game i was a little uneasy but i just played it today and this game is astoundingly great for either nostalga or somebody who want a fun experiance when not haveing such a good pc so id buy it. have fun",1
"a must have,i love it,it has a lot of tactics. childhood memories playing this on my old windows 98 computer. come on its only $9.99. it is worth it you know.",1
"in the beginning, there was counter-strike. classic tactical team-based shooter.",1
"the best action game beginning of the 21th century",2
"even after 14 years this game is still going strong (and is full of hackers) i rate 8/8",1
"this is the most legendary game ever, i have played this for many many years. i wish i had my old account with all the hours i put in this game when i was younger. gl hf (>  -  )> boom headshot!!!!",1
"the best fps team based tact shooter on the market hands down. if you dont believe me just check its history.",1
"its a classic fps, and given its reputation among other first person shooters it could be considered the grand daddy of them all",3
"hardest game ever every time i try to play online i get killed 10/10",1
"its counterstrike, plain and simple. great for lan.",1
"nice game, playing this game sometimes too feel nostalgia.",1
"this is game caused the revolution of fps games so it gets 5 out of 5 but be warned if you are not mlg you will be mocked and called a noob.",1
"counter-strike can join in with golden eye in taking credit for defining the comman fps game as we know it today. its servers are still active over a decade of entertainment. you customize your gear then choose to either use tactics to disarm the bomb, or you can just rush in like an insane person, grip the hostages by the arm as you say follow me now!!!, and get them to safety. it is pure greatness. and the system requirements are not demanding, so virtualy any computer nowadays can run it.",1
"i grow up on cs 1.6, but now it is unplayable. a lot of garbage on servers a lot of music and useless things. low download speed, and everybody hack everywhere. please make something with this game, just need some patch, for disable downloadable contetn, and useless things...",1
"play the worlds number 1 online action game. engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. take out enemy sites. rescue hostages. your role affects your teams success. your teams success affects your role.",2
"this is not a game but a religion, a way of life. if you are not upto the competetion better stay away from it.",3
"yay steam forced me to write this, are you happy now steam!?",1
"one of the most groundbreaking and legendary multiplayer games in the history of video games. all created by 1 guy in his college dorm, in this spare time. it doesnt get any more awesome than that.",1
"this game ruined my life. its an awesome title! i never knew a game 14 years old would be so good and still, its active in the community! thats really nice! this game is a huge hit in the market and still there are lots of buyers. it is a little thought for a guy like me who just plays non fps games. but still, it is really interesting and amazing to play with friends and online too!",1
"in my opinion, cs is the single greatest first-person shooter ever created. complex, addictive, challenging, intense, precise, and infinitely replayable, cs was the defining game for an entire generation of gamers. but be warned, this game is absolutely brutal if you are new to shooters.",2
"one of the best games in history of fps games. i know this game is old but i still prefer this game than other shooters out there.",1
"great game. you should pay up to $25 for this game.",1
"old school 10/10 shooter, good mods, goods maps, good fun, runs on all pc specs.",1
"i played this game like 7 years, but it still hasnt boored me once, its the best game form me and for the most people on this polanet. i sincerely recommend this game to anyone its just that awesome. :)",3

"working on debian as a charm, even with xorgs radeon driver! :-)",1
"counter - strike 1.6 is the most original first person shooter i played in my life. counter - strike is an absolute fun game with action - packed maps full of different varieties to choose from. there are tons of weapons from automatic to semi - automatic, shotguns, handguns, and etc. it will definitely give you a blast of fun memories and its a good game to enjoy for a long time. check it out !",2
"we all know one thing. this games kicks call of dutys !",1
"this is a fun game if you are an older cs player. im stuck in csgo though!",1
"best fps out there, no doubt. with so many different mods, maps and time it takes to get bored with this game, i just cant think of a better fps game. best of all, its all fun usually - except when you get kicked from a lithuanian/polish server for speaking english or asking to ban a wallhacker. 9/10 ...because server list is so big and many of the servers are full of bots, only serving purpose to redirect players to join someone elses server. it can be hard to find a real server.",1
"classic counterstrike you havent experienced any cs until you have played this",1
"best fps game, its so awesome get it its totally worth it",2
"wow one of the best game created ever in the world recomend to friends and ++++===+++++ iovvvvoi",1
"hi, i have a problem with the game counter strike 1.6 st ofcourse, what happens is that when im playing i get problem connecting",2
"was disappointed with the low graphics technology. i made the mistake of purchasing the whole cs game pack. only decent cs game is cs go",1
"a classic. if youre here because its on sale, grab it.",1
"cs.16 its a good strategy onling game and i suggest you to buy it ! beacause cs.16 have a lot of skills and mods too,like (deathrun,jailbreak)etc.!!!!!!!!!!! maybe have not good graphics cause cs1.6 since 1999 but its the most popular game in the world..! so thank you to read my review!",1
"the biggest game changer of all time in the online fps genre. respect it.",1

"this game is probably the best game ever. even it is old, it is still the best shooter game.",3
"one of the most important interactive medias to get yourself better than before in themes of thinking, hand-eye-coordination, reflexes, individuality and so on. it is like a million little games in one game and you can play it with enough real humans to experience for yourself.",1
"this game will always be my favorite counter-strike and its a game from my younger years that i enjoyed. not alot of people play it anymore but its still good. id just get a bunch of friends to buy it and have a 5v5 lan. c: :3 <3",1
"a hell of a game :d (y) .. this game proves that graphics does not matter . 10/10",1
"after so many years the game is still playable and enjoyable, its one of the first most competitive fps game that i known and it still have pretty good player base.",1
"best fps of its time. really fun and great community.",1
"played first time 13 years ago and got totally hooked up, awesum game.",3
"ive been playing this game for 10 years, and its still my favorite. 10/10 stars!",1
"i would definitely recommend this game for counter-strike or fps players.",1
"very addictive to this game. like to play with my friends. i enjoy this game a lot.",2
"it was better before 2010 when there were not so many hackers. now is full of hackers... in cs:go are like 30%-50% of hackers but in cs 1.6 there are over 60% hackers. poor game now.",1
"counterstrike was and is the foundation of the great fps games - great game play for its time. great team play game. full recommendations to all who love fps.",2
"not really know what to say...but still the best online fps game :d",4
"so i just played the original counter strike, cs1.6 for about an hour and after over 100 hours of both css and csgo, this game is amazing! but so different! i love this game and its game series! it taught me tactical gameplay and how much communication is key but this game lacks a bit of that but not much. i absolutely love this and highly recommend it!",1
"fire in the hole. i hear that so many times. 10/10 the game that revolutionized multiplayer first person shooters.",1
"i play this game since 2001 and i still cant stop coming back:) its the best game ever!",1
"all i see when i play this game is bots. i never liked counter strike very much, because i wasnt into the way the game was played, and also the money system kind of confused me. it seemed to me like if one team won two or three matches in a row, they were able to have complete domination over the other team and that just isnt fun. and maybe its because i wasnt there for this games glory days, but source and global offensive just seem so much more superior. so im gonna say pass on this game in favor of the two newer versions that have all of the same content but with more.",1
"i cant believe this game is not free-to-play yet. i mean, its been like, what? 15 years? and people can simply just download the non-steam version. should really be free-to-play to encourage non-steamers to play it on steam.",5
"one of the best online multiplayers game to enjoy and only the name is enough.",1
"i have played this game for 10 years now since i was 6. it was not on my steam until last year due to using nonsteam version which i regret. but hey i was little. i still play it even though i moved on to g.o this game is still fun to play with friends or in mixes/pugs. i believe this game was and is one of the best fps games out there and there is no reason for you not to buy it. enjoy.",1
"one of my all time favorite games... this is a classic. i will never forget the fast paced action this game encompasses due to my youth. i played countless hours of this and loved every second of it.",1
"went on a server and i was overwhelmed by brazilian piraters. makes me think why i bought it. 10/10 move to brazil to pirate the game.",1
"its a world filled with racists, 12 year olds, drug addicts and mexicans. they call it - cs 1.6",1
"having only played csgo for the past year or so, it is really nice to see what that game was rooted off of. i now know playing 1.6 what all the hype about counter strike is and the history behind it. 1.6 for its time period was such a benchmark game. really awesome!",1
"so, the original cs, where it all begun. great game which made a great series!",1
"great classic. i prefer it over cs:s. ten out of ten easily no matter how dated it is.",1
"i always find myself coming back to play this game. a true classic",1
"classic is always a classic, i smell this one will never die. counter-strike 4 life.",1
"tons of fun, but theres a couple newer versions now.",1
"this is a classic and better first person shooting game the history.",1
"the best fps gameplay you can play, playing it since 2008",1
"this is my all time favourite game. it is one of the first game i played. this game has been with me until now and i am still playing it with a big joy. it may be old but there is no other game that can replace it in my life.",1
"old classic - if you starting with counter-strike adventure, start with 1.6 - its a good start from zero to hero!",2
"this is the game that started it all...quite literally. this games popularity spawned the very system you are reading this on. steam would not exist if not for counter strike, and quite frankly the world would not be as good a place without it. if you dont have this...you should be questioning why you even have steam. (although its acceptable if you are younger and have a newer version like source or go).",1
"awesome old schoooool game :) i hop on to this when im sick on cs:go",1
"everybody get up, its time to slam now we got a real jam goin down welcome to the space jam heres your chance, do your dance at the space jam, alright",1
"lol this game is hella dumb there isnt even camos or killstreaks idk why anywould would even make a game like this if these key assets arent even going to be added 0/10 not even worth looking at",1
"its just counter-strike, i dont know what to say...",1
"simply the best game ive ever played (and possibly will ever)",1
"i guess its okay, i havent played it all that much tho",5
"this game has eaten half of my life, dont know how to review this.",1
"this game is the best shooter game and the game that i liked the most! but there is nothing for non steam players that hack in the servers!",1
"this is the only pc game which i play till to date from the time it was released. i am playing this game for past twelve or thirteen years and i am still very much addicted to it. the game play is phenomenal, highly challenging and had a very realistic feeling during then. the recoils are amazing and very realistic. this was the only game of its period to have gun recoil. the whole game playing skills revolved around the ability to control the guns recoil which was its best feature. great game of all times !!! cheers!",2
"can enter only original, new mode surf ski server manages a unique mode who publishes a candidate for admin ielhhh join now =] 84.94.214.173:20889 $$$$$$ cs 1.6 $$$$$$",4
"best 1st person shooter of all time. even all these years after its release, its still the game i end up playing. ive been playing cs off and on since 2005 and i still love it just as much. the gameplay is perfect and flows perfectly.",1
"ill say one thing... its a challenge and like that im sombody that isnt really good at this game but i can still mange to get that rewarding 3 kills or headshot.imo i think that this a good game challenging but rewarding in the for me that is. im 13 years old and i just came from cz and i like it. more severs than cz so more fun.",1
"counter strike one of the best multiplayer first person shooters out there even though it came out 14 years ago it still has outstanding graphics a good level design and alright player models i would recomend this game to anyone with a spirit to play oldschool shooters",1
"best game ever made... domination of movemenet, shooting mechanics - recoil... exaclty what a fps game need... when developers of this game genre learn that this 2 things are the most inportant for good fps, they will make a game as good as cs 1.6 is... cs:go does not have these major aspects, and doesnt deserve name of counter-strike (imo). as a third very important thing for fps game, i would say the animations... the animations of player models such as runnig, walking, crouching, gun holding/fireing/reloading etc... graphics isnt so important, doesnt need to be sooo good, but decent due to visibility...",2
"an awesome game takes me back to the good old days !!",1
"i got killed by a team of mexicans, russians, 40 year olds, and one asian. 10/10",1
"the best game valve made after cs:go but the updates made the game very poor :( wish it could be like in the past",1
"nothing like the good old days with the classic of the classics, counter strike has been such a huge game for me, and also for the world as one of the most played multiplayer games on the internet, i remember like if it was yesterday the old days when i was a children playing lan games on the computer class with my classmates, and not forgetting when i learned to play it with the help of my older brother, it is such a nostalgic game and one of the best ive owned in my life. totally recommended to get back to the old days",1
"i disliked this game because hardly anybody plays it and it is pointless without other players to play against.",1
"this is the best game ever like ever come on this darn planet!",3
"this game is so old that every fps player owns it xd",1
"this game is a classic master piece. and has amazing replay value. as a young gamer my self growing up in a world where most casual gamers are xbox humping, cod playing, graphic s. it is shameful that this game is not played. this game made and broke friendships and made a childhood for many people. even if you dont play the game often. please just get it for it to be in your library. 8/10 for some bugs and a now strange community. but nonetheless a great game.",1
"the only one game that holding me for more then ten years.",2
"my favorite fps shooter, i think i will never stop zooming because aim is not for me at all =] p.s im awper...",1
"just one thing i would like to say is that i can live without my girl friend but not without counter strike. :) ;)",1
"back in high school i used to live and die by this game -- then got a girlfriend and my gaming time diminished to an almost non-existent level for a couple of years and i just fell away from cs. still, it was great fun. ran a clan, competed in ogl team matches, etc. great game especially if you get a group of friends together to run with.",1
"if your on steam, and over 18, get this game. it is where online fps games really started.",1
"best game ever..... so many fun times, great fps, worth way more than it costs! its just great!",1
"great game, 10/10 ign ++ edit: no,  ign this game is worth",1
"after all these years this shooter remains to be a classic that cant be ignored. this game was a major turning point in the history of fps, and this game is what made online multiplayer competitive gaming so popular.",2
"why would anyone stop playing the greatest multiplayer game ever?",1
"the last time i played this game was at 2004. now the shooter games have changed. better graphics, better annimation and of course better physics. but this game even if passed 14 years, still remains in our hearts. (10/10)",1
"i love this game since 2006 when i played it first time. im playing it still and its 2014! this game rocks!",2
"what can i say ? most played fps ever with a reason",1
"counter-strike(1.0 - 1.6 not source) is one of the greatest esport fps games(if not the greatest) in the gaming history and is still worth buying today. graphics doesnt matter for a good gamer, gameplay does",1
"when it boils down to competitive long lasting first person shooters, counterstrike 1.6 is king. the unique money system on a two team map design is what puts counterstrike apart from other run and gun fpss. many custom maps and mods are available, while still boasting a steady player base even 15 years after release.",3
"probably the most played game in the old days. epic gameplay, not so epic graphics, but tons of fun and joy for hours. 10/10",2
"little problem, there should be 3 options when u click new game, server server settings or server info and game, i have the first (server) and the second (game) i cant add bots and i cant change the settings, how do i fix this?",1
"the original counter-strike, valve made a multiplayer masterpiece here; it is almost faultless, apart from its old graphics. 14/15 - perfect bar graphics",1
"15 years and it still has a somewhat strong multiplayer community. thats just enough reason to buy it. 10/10",1
"only skill important in this game. i liked this game :>",1
"time proven classic that will always be most fun us born in 80 last century !!!",1
"counter strike 1.6 is a good game. it used to be sooooo much better, but now there are hardly any servers running, and even less vanilla counter strike servers(servers without mods). unless your a hardcore counter strike player, id reccomend you just get cs:go. the gameplay is better in the first place, there is workshop, and billions of hours of content. back in the day 9.8/10 now...6/10 dont be hatin",1
"swat is upset about the de_forge update because hes never played that map before :(",1
"old good game never dies. i remember first time playing this game when i was in elementary school. hiding teacher to play this game with friends is very fun, you should let your kid have experiences like this.",1
"i dont like because steam blocked redirections from server to server. i know that people using it to slowhack, but now... servers with redirection are unusefull.. also, vac not working good for counter-strike 1.6. maybe it could be good for some update, or something... i can give you anything you need for it. contact me. kinds and regards, drag1c.",2
"i wouldnt recommend cs to anyone, not even my worst enemy.",1
"you have this game to thank for modes like call of dutys search and destroy. cs is arguably the most widely-played online shooter of all time, and its still got a thriving community going on 12 years later. its got simple, easy-to-pick-up gameplay thats spawned a massive competitive community. unfortunately, its extremely stale thanks to the fact that there are 3 game modes. luckily, there are tons of customization options available online. still, worth checking out for the sake of history.",1
"first game i ever played online and worked hard at becoming a pro at. <3 cs. my last id was ari1911386. #oldmemories #loveforthegame #respectplayers #donotcheat #playhardgopro #rusher #onlyheadshots #nostalgic",1
"basically the best competitive fps of all time if you dont already have 10,000 hours invested then its probably not worth playing",1
"best fps for valve. i love this game. you should really buy this epic game and its franchise.",1
"best fps game ever. played it for 13 years & still playing it, this game is just epic.",1
"b17b4367...,.,.,.,...., 4 terrorists / 3 counter-terrorists",1
"its counter-strike. sadly, with all the other good games that come out, this one is just... that old game that you wont ever play again. the game just gets boring, but, it has a lot of different mods and server plug-ins which can make of this a decent game for a few hours. i have bought this, and i dont regret buying it, but if you have something else in mind, leave this one as the second choice. 6/10.",1
"fun, classic, well executed even though its old! definite recommend!",1
"i grew up playing this game and im still playing it. this game will never die.",1
"graphics not always matter and this is an example! awesome game since 2000! rating 9/10 because of losers cheaters.",1
"this game is a real classic and its still in the top of the best first person shooters this day, the graphics arent the best but they are still good. the community is nice and still active. this game is in the top10 for most played games. its a really good game for a cheap price.",2
"best online fps ever. the simplicity of this game makes it one of the most fun to play, with a match never the same to another. the steam version has no changes or bonuses whatsoever.",1
"un des piliers du jeu vido... one of the pillars of gaming...",2
"old school fps. the one that started it all when it comes to modern shooters. still fun, fluid game play. i cut my teeth playing cs, my first fps game i played. takes a bit more skill. many, many good times!",1
"oldschool, nice mechanic, pro game phisics. forget about nice graphic, drop out cool free to play systems with donations for hats. this game is really for ninja maniacs.",1
"it has stopped working , giving an error library 4 not found.. it was running fine till date and now suddenly its not -_-",1

"classic, functional fps multiplayer shooter that everyone can enjoy. although its showing its age now that modern fpses have the aim down sight function.",1
"brilliant gameplay, lots of options, graphics are very good for a game thats old and made 1st november 2000. one of the best first-person shooter games aroung its time 10 years after half-life.",1
"all good old counter-strike. still better than beta cs1.0, 1.1 and 1.5 with a few new standards and fixes, but now is a new age with a cs:go, cuz cs 2.0 we wont see soon enough. :)",3
"a classic game, still good and played to this day, though im not pro enough to use the awp",1
"i think pie is good i think.... you cant sue in case this is wrong... :d this is a good game...",1

"pain in the  for new players like me but still hell of alot of fun ::d::d:d",1
"this is one of the best first person shooters ever created because of its tactical team-based gameplay and a feel that old-school fps will love.",1
"somehow i still find myself coming back to this game...damnit.",4
"probably my favourite game in the series. has a more arcady feel to it, probably give it a miss if youre into realistic shooters and maybe get go instead. if youre more of a quake guy like me then its worth it, but probably wait until a sale before you buy.",1
"i have deleted the game after theat i installed it and then it become dont work",2
"although a bit old, this game requires a lot of skill and strategy. once you learn how to play it youll get to enjoy it.",1
"many people in this game have been playing since 1999+, and certainly have the skill to prove it. this game changed the gaming industry greatly, and is of very high quality, though ages like anything but a fine wine. only get it if you have someone you know that can teach you how to play it. otherwise stick with cs:go.",1
"one of the best online multiplayer games of all time.",2
"yes i have only played ten minutes. ten minutes is enough! case closed",1

"cs was the very first fps game i was introduced to (over 10 years ago omg), and ive been in love with it ever since. makes me a lil giddy sometimes, and compared to the graphics and simulation of todays shooters the quality is pretty  (im prepared for some flak), but really, its like that bottle of wine that has aged and mellowed on the beloved alcohol shelf *hic*...nothing can beat the classics. a bottle of the finest chardonnay for this veritable *hic* shooter! and another just for me. *collapses in drunken stupor*",1
"endless fun i could end up with over 1000000 hours on this game xd. everyone sucks at first because with this game its all about practice and trying things out, seeing what weapons you are good with etc etc. anyone can be good at this game its all about how much time you put into it as long as you have some very basic fps know-how you could master it for sure.",1
"timeless classic! counter-strike(1.6)is one of the greatest esport fps games(if not the greatest) in the gaming history and is still worth buying today. graphics doesnt matter for a good gamer, gameplay does...",1

"classic and yet still the one of the most entertaining fps-style shooters that has ever set foot on earth. gameplay mechanics are fun and yet challenging. game provides many different gamemodes from regular deathmatch-bomb plant mission to platformer style of gamemodes. overall an awesome game and i recommend it to anyone who has any cs experience or has any interest in fps-shooters :)",1
"the best fps created. it is because of this game that the fps was revolutionized, be it in the competitive scene and the casual scene. nothing can compare to the greatness of this game.",1
"no i dont recommend this game, i just bored when i wrote this recommandation.",1
"its counterstrike, plain and simple. great for lan.",1
"no fps game will ever come close to the original counter-strike. its a shame the days when everyone played it are gone.",2

"this is such a great game, even though this is the first game of the counter-strike series.",1
"let me just say one thing: who likes to play counter-strike 1.6 just play! as the saying goes, spomenite childhood !! the game is excellent, but other versions of counter-strike is also awesome:) the very rare i go because i play counter-strike: source, and other games .i advise everyone to play. if you have not played in counter-strike 1.6 - that you have not had a childhood = ((",1
"a beacon of online gaming, that despite being a dated title, so many players come back to it because of the well defined game mechanic. theres no great depth of content, just a simple yet enjoyable platform for team deathmatch with map objectives thrown in. years ago i spent atleast 1,000 enjoyable hours playing it.",1
"i like this game very much because it sounds good to play and helps us in making a duel in any other game which belongs to fighting/action",1

"this is an all-time favorite of mine. counter-strike has changed my life forever. it has instilled keen sense of awareness. cs helped train my reaction timing as well as my accuracy overall. i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a fps. finally fast, finally! word of advice for any first person shooter : -always keep your crosshair(if you use one) at head level. -when exploring, keep in mind the layout of the area & always try to place your crosshair where you think the enemy is going to be. (being ready is key)",1
