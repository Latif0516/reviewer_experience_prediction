"i usually play this game to relax and wind down because of its super nice community. it calms my spirit to be told to get rekt  and neck yourself you feeder nub. i especially enjoy it when super awesome pro players stream the games to twitch and say that their 5 viewers are laughing at me. classic banter. every now and then ill give back some playful jabs but im not very imaginative. my favourite lines are ill wear your skin kunt and your whorsish mother will taste your  blood tonight stain classic banter",2

"dota 2 is the best in the moba class. ive played lol, dota and some lesser known mobas and dota 2 is by far the best. in addition, it is f2p which is amazing. unlike lol or hon which require you to use a rotating hero list until you buy your own with real money or accumulate enough in-game currency to buy a single hero, dota 2 immediately gives you access to its entire library of heroes, for free. the only paid content are cosmetical items that do not change gameplay. graphics are great. gameplay is great. crashes are very minimal. its free.",1

"learn russian for free. 10/10. better than rosetta stone.",2
"the game itself is good, had a lot of fun. but the problem with this game is that u are too much dependable on the people u get with you in matchmaking. apparantly you have too much people who want to play carry, and then fail at it, what results in a waste of time. it usually starts already a hero selection. people dont communicate, only play what they want to play and usually lacks of teamplay when the game is busy. too bad, because the game itself is good, the community is for 80% flamers, egotrippers, wannabe carry players, very rude",2
"i hope the russians get nuked and never play dota again",2
"dota ii is a fun free to play game, i have been playing its precursor since it was released as a mod for warcraft iii years ago. i have sunk more than a 1000 hours as it never gets boring. its a incredibly deep game which intergrates complex gameplay and mechanics, its a very popular game when you notice the international competitive scene. however be warned that this game has a steep learning curve and i still consider myself a casual gamer type for this game and as most multiplayer game, you will encounter abrasive players in the community which could ruin the experience, though that can bes fixed by muting or reporting the player(s).",3
"i hate this game so much. it hurts so much. i cry every time i see a . i am pretty sure after almost 800 hours of dota 2 i have developed a deep understanding of the russian language. i even grew wings and taped almost 300 popsicle sticks together and super-glued a flashlight to the end of it and starting yelling gibberish with a thick accent.",2
"i think many good game. my favorite is d2tidehunter, he is p cool. he can spit water and summon tentacle army. and enemy so afraid they jump into the air while you kill them all. but teammatees always steal kills and do nothing. never give donkey wings or buy vision sticks. and joffy always scream i noob, but otherwise p nice game of nice. 4/5 meatballs.",4
"they took my favorite game and gave it hats. 10/10",1
"i was a jamaican guy and when i healed people i swear he used a lil bit of ganja! great!",1
"the game itself isnt bad. nice depth, decent character selections. the community is garbage. pure filth, the likes of which you wont find anywhere else that is not a moba(youll find it in other mobas, apparently the hellbound enjoy this type of product). the game keeps wanting me to try it. the playerbase keeps wanting me to abandon all hope in humanity. so.......if you really dont care about other people, this may be for you. if other players can ruin team based experiences for you, keep looking.",1
"imagine youre playing a game with a few friends and youre having fun. you exchange jokes and high fives all around after every epic moment. your bro turns to you and says, i love this game, and i definitely do not want to kill myself! you all laugh. you are having a good time. you are not playing dota 2.",2
"never before has being maced across the cranium by a greasy, oiled up purple powerlifter with no visible face while being a golden tooth gerbil with a magic shovel who can mass-replicate whilst inside a large, purple time-stopping bubble looked so good. >we need wards",1
"dota 2 is the most enjoyable moba i ever played. the updates getting good every day, tournaments and other shows are worth to watch. its good only if you know how to use character you playing with. + graphics + many tactics and strategies (only for smart peoples. :p ) + detailed heroes + great community. + fun to play with party of friends + very good hero balance (you will know if you play) + diverse hero sounds + easy to learn, difficult to master. + increase in servers letting you play in good ping. - very hard for beginners - you will face opponents who have played game over 1k hours. - takes time to learn each hero and ability and find your preferred hero among them. still cant figure out how to jump. :p",1
"best moba game (.) period lol better than lol ... lol. 10/10 still cant find my friends...",1
"dota, a game where every character is op in their own unique way, fun to play with friends, requires team work, and communication. game is lots of fun. 10/10 recommend, gg commend me, report team. and remember to get up and stretch after everygame, or even go outside and take a walk.",3
"this game isnt like call of duty at all. 0/5 stars, not worth the money.",2
"called me , reported. quit the game, reported. asked to be commended, reported. told me to stop pinging, reported. prevented me from killstealing, reported. played as a hero i think is op, reported. stole my last hit on a creep, reported. you will not be allowed to use the courier if i have items in stash. you will not be allowed to call me a noob when i get 10 deaths and 0 kills. you will not be allowed to pick my hero unless i say so. i will ping you to death the moment i have a reason to. i will play io as a hard carry. i will take the invis rune as riki. good luck and have fun",2
"i think this game gave me cancer from all the russian s who scream 10/10",1
"totally unfriendly game for a new players plus extremely toxic community",1
"its bassicly meth, ruined my life, lost all my friends, gpa took a nose dive, parents have no more faith in me, no longer have hopes and dreams, and its the only thing left i know how to do. but the high i get while playing has yet to be matched. 10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone.",2
"do you like to be insulted about your mothers sexuality? like to have your intelligence questioned ? like the sound of pinging ? do you like to wait ?!? then maybe dota 2 is the game for you ! enjoy all this and so much more ! 10/10 would be a feeding noob again",3
"an accurate representation of pubbing in this game would be to imagine yourself trapped in a sewer swimming around eating nothing but turds your entire life, each turd represents an average public game. now imagine after all of those turds you go to eat the another one and to your surpise it is a chocolate bar, it is the best feeling in the world. that chocolate bar represents those occasional games where everyone is evenly skilled and tastes so good that you continue eating turds just hoping for that next chocolate bar.",3
"10/10 best point and click adventure ive played in a while unfortuanly there is only one level.",1
"i really cant say anything other then this game is ing amazing. look at all the hours ive spent in the game. you all are probably like well, there are these people who have spent thousands of hours in the game, so thats not many. but do take into account that my total time owning this game hasnt even exceeded a year yet. there is not a day i remember since i got this game that i havent at least opened dota 2. usually to play a public game, sometimes to play a bot game, and sometimes to brush up on hero knowledge and look at guides. this game will ruin your life and obliterate all your free time. my only warning to new players is that the community it pretty toxic to new players, and not everyone speaks english. just mute anyone calling you a noob, flaming you, etc. but never do so to the people that legitimately want to help you. overall rating: 11.6/10.",2

"10/10 got swore at in russian and portugese within the first 5 minutes, then decided this game was too hardcore for me. i would easily recommend this game to anybody that wants to feel like a worthless, bad video game player in 6 languages from sunday!",1
"dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena, that adopted most of its mechanics from the original dota mod of warcraft 3. now, lets come to some of its features: - --> once you understand the basics, and become good at the game (oh wait, everyone of us is a noob) , you will soon have a huge backlog of other games. :p --> basically hat simulator. --> can cause rage, anxiety and affect your mental state. (too many , griefers) --> you make 1000 good moves in a game, and you wont be recognized. go feed once and get reported. --> you will start putting aside other priorities. ty dota2. --> to sum it up, it has a  community like most other mobas, unless you are insanely good at the game. 10/10 recommended! best game ever played!",4

"having a wonderful time, browsing for games? well then, look no further and behold! the most russian-infested game you will ever find! for my first, what? 40 games maybe? i never once found an english person, even when i put the language and location to english speaking countries. if you think you are pure of heart, try dota 2! it will turn you extremely racist and ruin your friendships! got a black friend? gone. got a white friend? gone. got an asian friend? gone. any other sort of friend? gone. ? oh yes please!",1

"dota or defense of the ancients, was the first of its kind, and originally started off as a warcraft 3 custom map but it quickly grew to become one of the most popular games in the world as well as spawning a whole new genre which we know today as mobas. the game is simple, 5v5, 3 lanes and both teams objective is to destroy the other teams ancient. there are over 100 heroes in the game each with their own unique skills and attributes and forming a well rounded team with synergy is key to victory. closing notes - the community can be awful. you will get yelled at, flamed and even reported for making mistakes. if you can overcome this, the game is amazing.",1
"+ free-to-play, and not pay-to-win! + great graphics + addictive gameplay + has 100+ heroes that can be played + supported & featured by esports + can actually grant you big money if played competitively - the community sucks real bad - hard to learn, hard to master (at least for me anyways)",1

"cyk@ and axaxaxaxa are the only phrases youll only ever have to use to communicate.  dont be decieved by the server names, as every server is a russian server.  id recommend never to play this game with friends, as your friendship will be destroyed into tiny pieces.  phantom assassin is the source of all depression.  going into the depths of low priority is like taking a trip to hell with no way back.  you better be lucky if you random otherwise youll probably get earth spirit.  if youre afraid of rats dont play this game as theres a gigantic one named natures prophet.  pray to the lord that youll never be against spirit breaker because his name doesnt lie. but somehow i keep coming back to the game. gg wp valve 10/10",2

"anything great this game could provide you gets completely driven off by the so real rrp (russian retardation phenomena) which will put and keep you off from any sort of enjoyment you could ever witness playing it. if you happen to be an easily losing temper person or you just cannot bear dealing with down syndromed people most of the most of the time, do not play this game.",3

"dota 2 is the sequel to the popular warcraft iii mod known as dota. it is very well crafted and improves the gameplay from orginal modification in the source engine. gameplay mechanics are solid and is very difficult, it requires to be attentive at all times. positioning is key throughout due to the very long stun times and high damage output by every hero at a certain point in the game. dota 2s graphics are much improved from the original warcraft iii modification in the warcraft engine respectivly and shows great colours and lighting on the map and characters. unfortunatley due to its difficult nature and very large learning curb and tends to push back a large amount of players. my recommendation is to start with a group of friends in bot matchs, and play every single hero at least once to figure out their abilities. then play the game online where everyone is an idiot or russian. glhf",2

"the greatest game ever made. at face value its just another top-down video game, however once surpassing the initial learning curve the depth of this game is second to none. the animation is perfect, the voices are pristine... however every game has its flaws. the community is horrible, there are numerous bugs and thats just grazing the surface. that being said, i never recommend this game to friends as once you pass that learning curve you wont be doing anything else once it latches on.",3

"really great game. introduced me to mobas. very addictive and a friendly and helpful community. little confusing at first but fun once you get used to it. fascinating graphics and crisp sounds. gameplay can feel repetitive but theres always an element of suspense. each player hero is unique and powerful and the user interface of the game is easy to understand. does not constantly bug you for micro-transactions which is great. only problem is that finding a match, even on my closest servers takes quite some time (3-4 mins.) loving the game otherwise. 9/10 - the best moba",1

"dota 2 is a very intensive video game that is just as good as league of legends, although it is somewhat lacking in its misogynistic protrayal of women, where all the female heroes are highly sexualized and often oppressed by the patriarchal standards of the game. there is only one strong female character (both metaphorically and literally), named legion commander, and even she is highly sexualized and often the target of pornographic parodies. although they are perfectly equal in the terms of gameplay, valve has quite a ways to go before they reach the same plethora of well-characterized and non-sexualized female characters as riot games managed to do in league of legends. therefore, although the game is reasonably fun, i cannot honestly recommend it to any mature gamers out there.",1
"i hate this game like seriously i hate all of this like i have learned to hate things i cannot understand, peoples i have never met, and emotions ive never know to feel before i playd this game. its like learning just to fail. it tests the limits of humanity in a philosphical way that degrades the mind, and stamps on the soul. why did i ever play this? why did i particpate and ignore the warnings of others and sink all this time into this madness? this game is like your crush continuosly telling you she doesnt like you and slowly pushing you out of his or her life. this review says i have around 400 hours of gameplay. but you dont understand, every one hour of stress is about 5 more hours and self hate, loathing, and mass sprits of depression man this stinks",1

"this game is so bad, why would i even think of playing this game.... 10/10 would get matched with russians and brazilians again.",2
"a pulchritudinous looking game, it is definitely my personal favorite moba game yet. it has a huge hero roster, is completely free (the only possible transactions result in aesthetic changes), requires coordinated teamwork and has a huge fan base and community. that said, you should be wary of many of the players, as many are extremely negative and will work to frustrate and annoy you in whatever way possible. in many cases you will feel that an opponent is overpowered, or a particular hero is cheap, but i can assure that in 95% of these cases, that is not true. i would also highly recommend that you learn the basics first and complete the tutorial, because your first few games are gonna be rough; you will probably get crushed into the finest paste youve ever been in your life.",3
"excellent game, but be careful, it gets very addictive :d",1
"dota 2 is a great game if you want to put in 100 hours into a game before you start having fun. in my 600 hours of gameplay i regret nothing except for the mass amount weight i have amassed playing dota a total of how much i gained. i figured for every hour played i gained 1.5 lbs now i am going to be competition for the worlds biggest man. overall dota is a great game. i would recommend this to anyone i have noticed also my grades have slipped but i have plenty of time to catch up with the grades becuase i am only in thrid grade.",3

"to start with if youre thinking of playing dota2 its going to be rough when you start and its probably best to start with some friends, but when you get past that barrier youll never find another game to fill that void of dota2s moba experience. would totally recommend this to anyone thinking of playing just beast through the beginners block and ignore the flamers :)",2
"this game litterally ruined my life. i started playing dota awhile ago, thaught it was hard, but fun, so kept playing.... but now, dota has taken everything away from me. dota is my new life. i now dont get to go outside with my friends in the glorious sunlight. i no longer worry about grades at school. my dream is now to be dendi. this game a has also brought out the dark side in me. out of the over 800 hours ive been playing this game, at least 20% of me playing has been me screaming at my freaking teamates because all they do is feed. this game has also made me extremely rasict to all non english speakers, especially: peru, brazil, every spanish speaking country, and russia. do i reccomend this game? hell yeah 100/10",3

"im pretty sure all of my friends play it (caused this is where i met all of them lol) but this game is amazing! strategy is perfectly orchestrated into the captivating gameplay and perfect graphics, storyline is not key but there are hints and traces of it shot out at you through weapon flavor text and fanmade comics. all in all this game is great, and although it may seem that this game is kind of lame because you dont keep items after matches at first, that doesnt matterf after the first hour or so of gameplay.",4

"this game is truly amazing! you will have to stick with it for about 10 games before you begin to like it but afterwards it is a hardcore stratergy game, where you will have to work with your team if you have any hope for victory. i know from personal experience that once you have gotten into the game you just want to play more and with the new updates dota has really progressed and delivered a full fun game for everyone to play.",4
"addictive but frustrating. best played with a group of friends who work well together.",1
"in this game, you can easily find friend and enemy, it was like from the beginning of the game, you already can decide, is your team mate is your friend, or your actual enemy, but that said, i have find more friend, much more friend rather than enemy. and it is one of the greatest learning simulator, 9/10 would play everyday to learn. 100000% recommended for anyone who want to get smart!! :)",2
"this game taught me more about human interaction, leadership psychology and foreign cultures than any other single experience ive had to date. also made me racist.",4
"real time strategy, micro one character, but strategize with bots, teammates, items, board features, and more! replayability is like a physical sport, the game is different every time! one of the founders of the moba (multiplayer online battle arena) genre! one of my favorites obviously!",1
"this game, like most moba games, is like an abusive partner, it will hurt you and make you feel awful so you tell yourself you will stop yourself and that you will put an end to the relationship but when you confront it it pulls you close and whispers in your ear while gently carressing your back that it is sorry for hurting you so you forgive it and the cycle continues. great game",1
"dota 2 is quite an interesting game. being a little complicated at first, one can be skillful and better at the game after several weeks (or months for some). i really do recommend this game.",1
"teamwork, fast reaction, attention to details, this game has it all",2

"if the game was a banana,it would be a good banana!!",2
"often i am asked what does a good game truly mean? hue much depends upon the game (lets say dota) will you be a tryhard? then we have heroes that are overpowered as  will you be a nooblord? then we can grant you matchmaking that puts you against even noobier players will you be wise? can you can pubstomp nooblords till their chocolatemilk explodes on their multiple chins what does a good game truly mean? that is for you to decide.... theres also a talking tree and a fat cockney who hooks people",2

"well. like every other new and popular game that your friends force you into joining, dota2 is worth staying in. very heavy focus on team play, stunning graphics, massive hero/heroine selection, and the only thing you actually need to pay for is cosmetics. honestly, i dont care much for the flamewar between dota and lol. seriously, shut up already - its obvious dota 2 is better.",1

"im not a huge fan of mobas, but i do enjoy league of legends very much and ive played smite when it first came out. like most mobas, the community can be cruel and insane at times, torching you for the simplest mistakes. neat and interesting abilities that can be even complicated the first time you use them, this game has a lot of replay, giving you the choice to play many many heroes. unless you like competition and a fierce community, stay away from dota and try lol or another moba, but you should still give it a try, play a bot game or two and feel the game. no pay 2 win as its a official steam game, and a very successful one. you can earn and buy costumes and cosmetics through playing the game and buying them with real money. if you feel up to it, you can also trade unwanted cosmetics for ones you want through the steam trading system. personal rating: 3.5/5",1

"if you rage quickly,i recomend getting a steel mouse and keyboard.",2
"its an amazing game - technically outstanding, showing all of valves usual polish and attention to detail, especially in the all-important multiplayer aspects. the continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. its hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. it took me a long time to warm up to, but im helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. if you can spare the time - play it.",1

"dota 2 is one of the deepest and most interesting games that i have ever played. sure its difficult to learn, but once youve grasped the basics, dota will provide hours upon hours of entertainment. the learning curve is undeniably steep and the community unforgiving of your mistakes, but the game itself is worth the pain. i highly recommend learning dota 2 with a friend-it will be much more enjoyable. on the question of lol or dota: both games are great and i recommend you to start the game that your friends are playing. after all, mobas are team games, not solo efforts.",4
"i wouldnt recommend this game. after a huger then huge learning curve, you will log in, be online, and  up our matches, because you suck. after proving you suck, we will still have to play with your noob  for at least 30 mins. so you will get hated on. you will get reported, you will be in waiting queues forever. after about half a year you might grow some ing sense and skills to play decent, but i doubt it, and even then youd be no match compared to the ogs.. so, stick to css dude, go play tf2, have a nice portal experience or something... just keep away from this game, itll damage you beyond repair, and you will intoxicate our dota2 experience, and besides that, your just too dumb. now get lost. move!",1

"dotka is a good game, i feel like it ripped of the more superior league of legends though but its a good game nonetheless. doesnt require any skill and is a good game.",1
"this game is very good fun, maybe a bit difficult to pick up at first, but stick with it and im sure that youll get the hang of it! it has a great range of unique characters that are all very fun to use, its a bit of a shame that you are only given a small selection of them each round as it means that even if you have a favourite, you wont always be able to play as them. still, i recommend this game for anybody who enjoys strategy and winning ;) *this game might be a bit laggy if you have a lot of other stean games, thats the one reason why i dont still have it or warframe*",1

"very exciting! as far as i played games this is the best for me :) hope u guys like it too",1
"dota 2. better than lol or hon by almost every extent possible in my opinion. the graphics are beautiful, you can deny, slower pace gameplay, more impacts when you die. all of them have a problem with their community. you get everything for free and only have to pay for announcers, hero skins, and other stuff that only affects looks. not pay to win. its play to win. get it now. its free. the reason people dont like dota 2 over lol is because its too slow and harder for them or because it has a higher skill curve.",1
"dota 2 is a wonderfully fun game! the game is bright and colorful and with a huge variety of characters to play and has easily become one of the biggest played multiplayer strategy games ive seen. as you play it rewards you with items you can use later and customizable items for your favorite characters in game. i recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good strategy game.",1

"a rts game which play by 10 players,divided by 2 teams ( radiant and dire) this game is so excited because of there are so many heroes which their skills are so variants,such as stun,kill,healing,disabling and so on. dota is the game like chess and soccer, because you must use strategy to defeat your enemy,not just kill,looking for gold. for amateurs this game can use build help if the amateurs dont know what item must they build. remember,in this game you must be patient and cooperative when your teammates doing some fault because in this game there are winner and losser,the way you prove that you are pro is by cover up your teammates. i very reccomend this game not only just a guy can play this game,also a girl like me can also play too. end of my talk, i love dota2",2

"this game is truly amazing! you will have to stick with it for about 10 games before you begin to like it but afterwards it is a hardcore stratergy game, where you will have to work with your team if you have any hope for victory. i know from personal experience that once you have gotten into the game you just want to play more and with the new updates dota has really progressed and delivered a full fun game for everyone to play.",4

"its a pretty fun strategy game with a wide variety of items and character. you wont get sick of it very quickly, under normal circumstances.",1
"an interesting proposition. unlike most games, this is the gift that keeps on giving. over the lifetime of dota 2 many additions have been made, and many continue to come along. dota 2 is based on an old warcraft mod, and on a weekly and monthly basis, valve continues to update and add features to the game. aside from being a lucrative scene for competitive gamers, it also has a steep learning curve and endless combinations as far as team compisitons go. if you arent the kind of person who likes to play versus other players, the game allows you to play cooperatively against bots. and to further add to the lifespan of the game, the developers release festive events every 3-5 months to add something extra for players to do. as the game is free to play, this game can potentially net you some gains in the form of the marketable items you recieve for playing.",2
"i recommend this game if you are trying to become more familiar with russian language.",2

"dota 2 for me has set the standard for mobas. the level of detail gone into this is brilliant. the characters are well thought out with hilarious quotes and rivalry with the combat being fluid and fast paced. the only downside to this that i would say is the matchmaking. there is a steep learning curve when it comes to playing proficiently and already seasoned players do not take lightly to new players. beware of this, and if this kind of stuff doesnt phase you then match-make away!",2
"i leik this game and it it awsome while mitchelle is  at it. ;)",5

"i got this game more for nostalgia than anything else. never really enjoyed defence of the ancient type games and at first it didnt seem like i would enjoy this either. the community may be fierce at times, especially when you are new but once you log a few hours and get the base mechanics under the knee the game and its community actually become pretty enjoyable. serves to provide many laughs and wtf moments and is best enjoyed in a party with people who will be willing to help you get through the first few games.",1

"a very fun, but hard to master game with lots of varied characters (at least you dont have to unlock them all *cough* lol *cough*)",1
"the greatest video game in the history of time and space. ...is what dota 2 turns into, after youve done 50 hours of boot camp and 50 hours of homework. before that youll be shocked and confused and humiliated more times than you can count. in the end the investment is well worth it, just be warned youll need enough time and thick enough skin to survive the trial by fire.",1
"only play this if you have thick skin and the patience to learn the game. if you have both then you are in for a good game. if not then lol",1
"this is a game that when you have played enough you will hate, but you will still come back to play again. when you loose you will say i hate this game, then come back an hour, two hours or afew days later to try again. when you win you will love this game, play again untill you loose and quit the game again! 4 of 5 stars. will play again.",3

"most games reward the player to some degree, when they have sunk hundreds of hours into them. dota 2 is the only time sink i have experienced where you get absolutely nowhere for your troubles... thanks to a heavily broken matchmaking system that can take forever to queue up a game (as i am writing this, a 5 stack for a ranked match can take up to 20 minutes!). dota 2 is less about how skilled you are, and more about who you know. if you dont have at least a dozen experienced friends who are consistently competent, prepare to queue with some of the worst players you have ever played a multiplayer game with. as an added bonus, you will often get players who do not speak your language -- even in ranked games! i have often wished that i never started playing this game...",3

"a massively multiplayer game, highly recommended for those who havent try or even know dota the basic tutorial are very helpful and the community as well",2
"dota 2 is a good game but i quit after i reached a point. the community really is worse. they are no cooperation at all. i appreciate some people trying to make the game a good game but the game is simply overrun by immatures or people who just wants to rage at others. as for people who are curious if they should play this game or not. my answer is: go ahead since its free to play. as for those who just wants to have fun, this game is not for you. people who play this game is not about fun but about winning. if you plan on having fun, i suggest go get other game or people will just insult you in many different crappy languages (that doesnt even exist).",2
"great game, intense action pack gameplay thats fun for everyone.",3
"a wonderous 5 lane world of 20 kill supports, 1 v 5 heroics and lost russians. each game guarantees: -a noob who does exactly the opposite of what the team suggests, this is a great time to practise reverse psychology. -at least some form of russian, be it english players that enjoy their newly learned dialect or a genuine player of russia who due to their 3rd world conditions are obviously too famished to actually play the game properly. -a pudge pro that insists on mid and then deems it a great time to showcase exactly how not to attempt to hook players for all of 27 minutes while the other steam rolls you entirely. -a support with a dagon. with numerous repetition of the line but i thought he was getting away while he is now 4 levels above the medusa right next to him. in summary this game will make you very... very... angry. a lot of the time. i cant go a single day without playing it.",3
"the moba equivalent of getting kicked in the , repeatedly, for hours on end, until little remains of what could resemble genitalia. however, the truly astonishing part, is that this wasnt torture, but done through your own volition; you wanted to made miserable. hell, you probably paid for it a little. every game brings such traumatic pain and anguish, this game should be considered a war crime. psychologists have analyzed why dota players put themselves through this kind of hell, and all tests have come up inconclusive. this game has caused the perpetual virginity of thousands of people. friendships have been ruined, careers lost, and marriages have ended, all because of this game. dear god, get rid off this awful blight on humanity. only the dead can know peace from this evil... 10/10 i recommend this game to all my friends!",1
"when i first started dota 2 my brain had downs, i had no idea what i was doing at all... but i soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying and the learning the heroes (all heroes are free!). before i knew it, i was performing better and better. i focused and kept learning little by little and bingo! i got pretty good. you will encounter a lot foreigners good or bad but most of them can understand english. theres a lot of great people in the game and some are trolls and jerks but its fun . i recommend this game for everybody! if you play lol stop, unistall, and play dota 2. that game is canerous especially its community has grown to filth i played since 2009 it was a great moba for many years until this game came out and perfected the orignal one(warcraft iii mod). its really hard at first i know that but give it a try and learn.",1

"if you are new to pc gaming or rts/moba games, dota 2 will appear as impenetrable as a wall. the learning curve for this game is by far the worst element of mobas. however, those of you with some experience with rts games or are willing to learn will find the teamplay experience of dota 2 an enjoyable. would recommend to anyone with a competent pc and drive to play competitively.",3
"a great game! its like league of legends but with a better community that will not ask you to kill yourself if you get a kill as support",2
"dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably wont suit you if youre looking to play casually. theres a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. but once you start to learn its secrets, theres a wild and exciting variety of play here thats unmatched, even by its peers. its a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. the fact that its completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isnt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. may the best team win. ps. dont play with russians",1

"get yelled at by people in languages you cant understand. get yelled at for dying. get blamed for teammates dying. but the yelling doesnt matter because for all you know, they could be complimenting you. but it is a free language learing software which you cant really find anywhere else. 10/10 learned russian.",1

"an exellent example of a game that requires teamwork. made lots of good friends here. be patient and learn the mechanics, u will end up enjoying the game a hell of alot more. be patient though, especially with (no stereotyping) pinoys and russians...... the picks they make... lol. and for the love of good stop playing riki! 9.5/10. my game of the year for 2013 game in review as of 26th march 2015- not much changes from my first review, except for some terrible events from valve, such as the oracle pa fest, as well as the year best 2015 which constantly crashed servers in its ludicrous pay to win concept. really hope this does not become the norm for dota. other than that, current meta is pretty stale with sf, sniper and jug in every game. hope ti5 changes things up for the community. side note. managed to learn fluent russian and tagalog in this 2 years. who knew dota was a language simulator?",4
"an interesting proposition. unlike most games, this is the gift that keeps on giving. over the lifetime of dota 2 many additions have been made, and many continue to come along. dota 2 is based on an old warcraft mod, and on a weekly and monthly basis, valve continues to update and add features to the game. aside from being a lucrative scene for competitive gamers, it also has a steep learning curve and endless combinations as far as team compisitons go. if you arent the kind of person who likes to play versus other players, the game allows you to play cooperatively against bots. and to further add to the lifespan of the game, the developers release festive events every 3-5 months to add something extra for players to do. as the game is free to play, this game can potentially net you some gains in the form of the marketable items you recieve for playing.",2
"never thought id enjoy playing a game where other players continuously ask me to develop some form of cancer and then burn in a fire for securing a kill.",3
"this game can be really fun sometimes other times i hate myself for playing it at all",1
"this game wrecked my social life ! good games for teamwork",3
"do you like mobas? enjoy league of legends or smite? well this game is, of coruse, another moba. however it is also the original moba. one of the things you may love or hate about dota is that there isnt really any sort on unfairness to new players beyond skill. if a person with 10,000 hours faces a player who has only 12 they have no different items, no different heroes, no different abilities. the veteran may have new aesthetic things but the only thing seperating them will be skill. if youre new to mobas i encourage you to try this one, they are very fun and are fortunately not pay to win.",2
"this dota2 is very great for my life and love playing pudge,invoker,juggernut i hope i meet dendi someday",2

"this game is extremely fun to play. very team-based, but it still involves a lot of player skill. dont be discouraged if you play your first match and die 20 times. this game has a very large learning curve, and you will become a good player with practice. i recommend playing a game with bots before you play against players. this gives you an idea of the mechanics of the game, as well as some of the heros abilities. overall, a very great game...and free!",2
"this game....... many times ive told myself to stop playing, to resist the constant urge to pwn scrubs in public matchmaking...but as singsong would say nein! dota is life! and well ggwp thanks dota 6 month anniversary, still flaming :) -10/10- also ruins social lives",3

"one of the best esport games in history. a lot of people have problems with its steep learning curve. itll be hard for really long time to compete with veterans but its an esport game so thats what you should expect from games of this type. also prepare for flaming from russians. they think everyone know their language so they select all servers to communicate with wider range of people.",1

"i like this bcoz its 3d and nice effects.....nothing to say big yes this game",1
"this game has a lot of mechanics to it, be it controlling your character, managing other units at the same time. game is hard to pick up, but worth learning the steep curve. if youve ever heard of league of legends, this game is the hardcore mode of it. i would also confidently say that this game has a better community than league of legends. players are slightly more mature, and less hateful(?). i highly recommend this game to anybody that is looking for a game that has unlimited replay value, every game would be different, be it good games, or bad games. sometimes you meet people who are rude, even though they did very badly in this game, sometimes you meet people that are actually doing what the team needs them to be doing.",1

"a great game everyone should try, if they like league of legends. dota 2 is very similar to lol in many ways, with the gameplay, shops, and graphics. although, in lol you have to buy items, and there is no way to trade or earn anything. plus, in lol you get skins. in dota, you get sets, with individual pieces. you can mix and match to your hearts content, and get discounted items from the steam community market. a must play game! 5 out of 5 stars! <3",1

"this game, like most moba games, is like an abusive partner, it will hurt you and make you feel awful so you tell yourself you will stop yourself and that you will put an end to the relationship but when you confront it it pulls you close and whispers in your ear while gently carressing your back that it is sorry for hurting you so you forgive it and the cycle continues. great game",1

"good game, like it better than lol. takes a bit to get good at but worth learning.",2
"dota 2 is a moba in which you dont need big bucks to be better than anyone else. a new player is just like an old player with the only differenece being the experience. the game is balanced to a very high degree and has a lot of tournements with stupidly large prize pools. the heroes are fun and unique, and the mechanics are great. in my opinion it is the best game in this genre so far.",3

"lets look at this in a civilized fashion. if dota was a person, it would be bill gates, complete and perfect. however, dota does not have its own island. league of legends is like the ymca. its full of children, who never had a taste of bill gates lifestyle. the people who have had a taste of it will never set foot in the ymca ever again. ever. unless, of course, they find that everyone is too good, and they leave to join the ymca (nothing against the ymca, but bill gates life is probably better).",3

"so my friends dragged me into this game just over a year ago, and i can now say its one of the the best things that has ever graced my computer screen. the game is challenging, has a beautiful environment, allows one to choose from a multitude of unique and diverse heroes, and most importantly, fun. the sense of teamwork that you receive is fantastic, and the knowledge that your co-operation with your teammates is winning the game is very rewarding. of course it isnt perfect, but nothing is. and to be completely honest, the most amount of grief you will encounter is the ness of a certain few players. but that does not detract from the huge amounts of fun and challenges that dota 2 offers. i highly recommend this game to anyone.",1
"i can now speak fluent russian. thanks dota 2 c y k a blyat",3
"there was a time i wasnt playing dota 2. i felt empty and shallow. now i speak 5 languages, i am racist towards russian nation, and i get very easily annoyed. 50/10",1
"this is another game by gabe newell and is good because it has monsters that you can hit other monsters with and you can buy things that make your monster a better hitter than other monsters and then when you hit all the monsters you hit their church and when you hit it enough you win and everyone calls each other names",1
"amazing game! i have put ton of hours in this game and i never get bored!",2
"this is literally the best applictaion to become fluent in russian. 10/10 would have sex with this game and then do it again every night for the next 80 years...kinda like marriage. league of legends is basically a game where in a marraige the couple are about to get a divorce but one of them end up murdering each other.",3
"i used to like this game, but then i got disconnected from the server and when i left game i was pinalized for 3 minutes because gabe likes to fist my prostate. 10/10 would get fisted again.",1

"besides the russians, peruvians,  servers, flamers, complainers, throwers, smurfs, and did i mention all the non-english speakers on english speaking servers?... this game is ok",1
"this game can either be really fun with friends, or can destroy relationships with your friends. its definitely not fun playing alone though.",3
"this product helped me learn russian in less then three months, thanks valve!",1
"after 2000 hours with the game i realized how much of a time waster this  is, that added with valve being a piece of  of a company... i dont even have to tell the reasons (hint: reusing source engine which caused multiple bugs and made the game take 3 years to develop...  ground textures,  art style, 1 hero per year released, crappy language matchmaking, etc).",4

"great game for friends to play + its free with many heroes to pick from get it! and you wont regret it",1
"this is a game that surprised me. most of the game is just clicking with the mouse, right click to do this, left click to do that. it did require a bit of effort getting used to it. but it can be picked up easily. still getting to grips with the camera. and the lengthy matches means that you play for hours without realising it. this game probably will take up a lot of time in your life, so make sure you have many reasons to leave your computer screen.",1
"dota is the best moba game ive ever played so far. even if youre new to moba games like i were you should still try dota! its free, its fun.. the only thing you lose on it is your social life!",2
"its an amazing game - technically outstanding, showing all of valves usual polish and attention to detail, especially in the all-important multiplayer aspects. the continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. its hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. it took me a long time to warm up to, but im helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. if you can spare the time - play it.",1

"the most played game on steam. i tried to like it, i really did. something about it puts me off. too much micro? too much reliance on random teammates? too many characters to choose from? you should try this, millions of people cant be wrong? i just cant seem to get into it... 3/5",1

"dota is either fun or infuriating once you figure out what to do. dota destroys relationships with friends, makes you racist to nearly everyone that doesnt speak your language, makes you a terrible, intolerant person who insults people when barely provoked. if youre going to play dota, dont play it with good friends. play with friends you dont mind losing. thatll either make you super close or hate eachother. over 9000/10 get it now",2

"dota 2 is my fav game and it is good because i have learned russian from it 10/10",2
"yes this game is hard to learn. yes people can be rather aggressive. yes it is possibly the best multiplayer experience ive ever had and yes once you play at least 10 games youll be hooked. i try to play at least one game a day and have been doing so for months and dont plan on stopping. give the game a chance (more like 5) and i guarantee that youll see why its the most played game on steam. be prepared to be dumbfounded as to why you were playing anything else. also a side note: the games free. steam is free. the only thing u have to lose from giving it a try is alil self respect in the beginning. but dont worry after one game where u actually do really good youll feel like a million bucks.",2

"the game is simply like life: has its ups and downs but overall a great experience.",1
"too much hero choices , too much items and cosmetics , too much good graphics.. good co-op , medium gameplay too little item drops ! , hard for beginners ! , hard for non-strategy gamers i recommend the game , come on its dota 2",1

"once upon a time a russian in the other team told me peka you good. 10/10 vodkas would play again.",1
"blyat. after 1,000 hours of this game, i can say it is one of the best games i have played. but, i wouldnt advise you to play it as it will drain the f***ing soul out of you, and you will not have any life from then on. however, if you do decide to play this game, report the russians and flame your team.",2
"friendship destroyer, stay away from this game. 10/10, would spend another 2k hours.",3
"after playing over 1000 hours of this game, i would love to say that valve have done an amazing job working with icefrog to create a game that, although objectively the same each time, is engaging and extremely dynamic every time. screams of joy and frustration will be heard when you play this game, maybe you will develop an unrelented hatred for the russian people or simply call mid or feed. all i can say is, i am glad i took the time to get past dotas steep learning curve for it has been a rewarding experience that i am looking forward to continue for many months to come.",5
"man, i dnt think i have the time to marry someone after playing this game",2

"more competitive then dota 1, but yet so hard to play. it was so hard for some players who were used to dota 1 mechanics to adapt to dota 2. abstract game, the camera is too close to the players, is just a pure chaos in a teamfight. dota 1 is better.",1

"doto of the ancients > lolegend league of legends 10/iv would play again, best fps in todays scientific community",3
"simply put, the best multiplayer game of all time.",5
"if you love rts and want to cool off from war hammer or starcraft, why not play dota? you control 1 hero (at most 5 units.), a lot of depth, easy to learn hard to master and most important fun as hell. in my opinion takes lol by a long shot and the fact that ice frog and valve are behind this gives it credit alone. ive been playing the dota 2 test and this is my conclusion; on the sound nice ambiance and very engaging battle music, on the graphics the environment needs a bit of work but the hero aesthetics are great and on the mechanics... well i think its too early to say but seems on the right track. all in all a great and (again in my opinion) a must have game. score: visuals: 10/10 musichero vocals: 10/10 mechanics: 9.5/10 overall: 10/10",2

"the best moba hands down. the lore of the heroes, the diversity and unique design of each hero, every aspect is well thought out. while some heroes are a bit overpowered, you can still counter them, and you can still win. the setting and soundtrack adds to the aspect of gameplay as well. this game crushes lol, smite, and hon in my opinion.",1

"dota 2 is dota on a new engine. if i was to compare it only to its predecessor it is the whole package. you get the game that you loved with the beauty of the source engine. if you come from playing other newer moba style games this is the granddaddy of those games reborn. and hey, free to check out if it is for you or not. so there is that too.",1

"if riding around on a big hairy creature, bashing people with a hammer is your thing, dota 2 has you covered. sort of. dota 2 offers a huge array of characters that enable players to take roles that are in their wheelhouse. whether you like sneaking and ganking, smashing through the frontlines, or sitting back and supporting your team from a distance, there are characters that do all that and more. what immediately strikes me about dota, to coin a hideously overused clich, is that its easy to learn, but difficult to master. while the game is generally forgiving, the players are much less so. as with all multiplayer games, the experience of playing with others can be a bit of a mixed bag. the most important thing to remember about dota 2 is this: its not about winning, its about losing stylishly to progressively more back-breaking, marrow-sucking odds.",3
"my grandfather smoked his whole life. i was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, if you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.. tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. he gave it up immediately. three years later he died of lung cancer. it was really sad and destroyed me. my mother said to me- dont ever smoke. please dont put your family through what your grandfather put us through. i agreed. at 28, i have never touched a cigarette. i must say, i feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.",1

"when i played dota wc3 mod for the first time i died as windrunner and moved on to hero line wars. now that value has made dota 2 i tried it again. the f2p model is very fair, almost too fair which lets in undesirables. the graphics are clean and crisp. the gameplay is what you expect from an rts, lots of clicking and moving your unit around or, for you plebs out there, lack there of. there is a rating system that and that really is the worst. i have close to dial up internet and lag all game. my rating sucks because of this and the reason i am writing this is because i am waiting for a 100mb download aka 2 hours. all that said icefairy has made heroine in video game form and its free /dance....zzzz doesnt work",5
"dota 2 is the best free-to-play game ive tried this year. even with its significant learning curve, this game had me completely addicted within the first three matches. plan to dedicate hours to practicing against bots before approaching online matches or you will be seriously owned. it will hurt, you will feed, and everyone will yell at you, yet somehow you will still enjoy it. just play this game! you will not regret it!",3

"a combination of great game mechanics and compelling hero backstories make dota 2 a cut above other multiplayer online battle arenas (mobas) such as league of legend and dota 1. of particular interest to new and old players alike is the hero mirana and her trademark w-button ability, sacred arrow, which when successfully deployed is often considered one of the most fatal not-ulti moves in the game. when not utilising this 360-damage 5-second stun, players may take solace in miranas other special abilities such as leap, a devastatingly evasive jump, starstorm, a powerful aoe magical damage dealer, and her notorious ultimate moonlight shadow which will render all heroes on miranas team invisible at the click of a button. whilst dota 2 does not necessarily revolve around the ever-popular hero mirana at this time, many hope to one day see her in an online action/adventure of her very own.",2

"the game resembles a world greater than the first game. besides its great graphic texture, it provides easy gameplay that would acknowledge new players to try the game. it gives a clearer universe that blooms a stunning visuality that makes a normal player make their experiences with the game. the simplicity of the game makes a player focus on the action decided. it doesnt make you stop playing it.",1

"so i have compared dota 2 to hon, since alot of the heroes are the same. needless to say, i stoped playing hon :) i found the heroes to be much more balanced than in hon and what stood out the most wasnt really the game as much as the people playing it. its a much calmer atmosphere in 8/10 games than in hon... i cant remember when i last played a hon match where someone didnt curse at just about everyone... all in all its a great game and is starting to ruin my life :p",1

"dota 2 is a brilliant game; it takes teamwork and takes it to a whole new level. in dota 2, you fight in 5 v 5 matches and if you dont play a part in your team, you will lose! there are many characters (a bit too many for my taste) and many customizable features. but these customizable features are like the hats in tf2; they dont do anything but they look cool. speaking of tf2, the sniper character also makes various references to the sniper class in tf2. if you like league of legends or rts games then this is for you. if you are cod fanboy who cannot play different games without declaring that they are  then go and play some starcraft 2 you trogladite. 8/10",1

"this game is like heaven on earth :) more power dota 2",1

"can be lots of fun... or as equally frustrating. lots of time to play this game, as it builds over the length of time you invest into it. it all depends on how good your team plays together and how bad the other team does the same. no matter how good you are or your team... there could be just the perfect group of characters and teamwork on the other team and they just stomp you. or other maps where your whole team randoms their characters... and you win without really trying. argh. but i am still drawn towards this game like a moth to the flame. much to the moths demise. and mine.",1
"my friends tell me dota 2 is hard to play just judging from watching me or other people play and yet theyre playing wc3 dota. after some time they decided to try it and to their surprise it was not as hard as they first thought. so, try playing dota 2 instead of just watching other people play. good luck and have fun!",4

"dota 2 is the best rts games. this game can help you increase your teamwork ability not just in-game, but your teamwork ability on real life, will increasing too.",2
"its a great game. i highly recommend it because of the amount of variety. it gives you over 50.. no.. over 100 combinations of characters and items to use in battle. in dota 2 you rely both on strategy and strength, and in some cases, even teamwork. but there are some few drawbacks, for example, theres only 1 map and finding an online game in some regions takes several minutes. ( or at least, that is my case ). but still, the design of characters, effects and models, compared to the ones from dota 1, are fascinating. i really like the new heroes look. plus, its not like you really have to pay for useful weapons and items. you can buy things in-game, in map shops to strengthen your hero, and even your team. i really give this game a high ranking!",1

"it was nice i liked it. the graphics were awesome and so was the music and all. the beginning part explains it all. like how you can get items. also enjoyed being that sniper guy. i like the dragon knight the best though to be honest. however, i do not feel like just sitting here on my computer for hours trying to defeat someone or the computer. they had that dota 2 international championship for 3 days for a reason people. i also rage quit. no i was just getting angry at how long the battle was taking and how annoying it was to keep on dying with the healing potion or tree healer items just healed me for a little bit like maybe just 5 hp at a time. it was still a good game to play.",1
"great game, lots of replay value. easy to learn but tough to master",1
"this game man this game is totally awesome. firstly its free. and its total fun. also its not a pay to win game. ive been a fan of dota during warcraft itself but dota 2 is more amazing. this game requires you to have alot of patience and determination. yes there is customization in this games and yes you have to buy the items. but u also get items each time when level( this is a for sure getting) and u also might get an item by chance after each game. u can also sell the items u get. in total this game is spectacular.",4
"dota2 is something more than a game. it is a test. but that let my comment put you off. what lays under this very intricate, complex game is and experience you wont get anywhere else. it raises the bar on teamwork in multiplayer games. because without teamwork youll surely fail. and that is something a lot of multiplayer games try and fail with the self appointed hero player trying to show off. each member, including the npc are important. the controls, the interface will be daunting and put most people off, like me for instance. because the game itself is instense from the get go! but once you get use to the heroes you can play as, the lingo and system, that instensity that put you off, will drive you. dota2 is more than just a game, its a sport. and with all sports, you can make a great hobby out of it. you can have great fun. or you can go pro. oh! and its free!!! give it a go and dont be put off.",1

"i avoided mobas for so long, you know. i really did. barring a short and entirely disagreeable experience with the original defense of the ancients map for warcraft 3, and a brief stint playing demigod (which i thoroughly enjoyed, all the while failing to notice it pretty much was defense of the ancients) i hadnt touched this genre at all. heroes of newerth? nope. league of legends? nah. dota 2? good grief, no. there were plenty of reasons for this. first, my initial experience with warcraft 3s dota map really was that bad. second, moba communities have a rather strong reputation for being full of complete cockhandles, and i dont deal well with destructive criticism. third, im not a huge fan of most pure multiplayer games; i tend to prefer playing solo where i can. it did not appear to be the game for me...",3

"awesome game , only trouble with the servers lags",3
"fantastic game. much longer more intense games, better skill cap and actually requires teamwork and mana control. oh and you dont get shitlords that scrap their way to 6 build because you actually lose gold if you are bad. secondly, there arent runes so everyone is equal at the start and you dont get shafted by picking the wrong runes or not owning some, hereos are all free, items are cheaper and you can mix and match items from different sers as they go into slots and are cheaper. finally you dont get summoner spells so people if they get caught, die. they dont flash away and you cant just run up and hit a tower without creeps due to backdoor protection, so rat dota takes skills.",1
"this game is good and fun to play very competitive",1
"sometime need find 2 time server why also server down",4

"been 10 years! i feel like the play style and the heroes are the really enjoyable. dota is never ending fixing balancing etc. however this is not a downside. as it is a growing game. dota 2 is the best at his class. if you are a new player here is what you should know though; - make sure you ignore flamers - try to watch couple twitch streams in order to understand how pros do it - be polite in games, if someone is rude to you just ignore him - if you dont want to ignore make sure you do not respond them. because talkin back to them in order to explain your thoughts will just make them insult you more. they will not understand %100 guarenteed. if you mute everyone at start of the game you should have a wonderful experience! =)",5
"exactly, must play this game but too much update in this game",1
"dota2 is the first reason for me to register steam. a perfect standalone software of the famous tft map <3 i told my friends to play this game too. if you are a fan of dota , you will be amaze by dota2s features. but you need times to level up and item drops are a little something(maybe im greedy). however, this is a must-play.",2
"addicting as hell. its too good of a game. play it and you wont stop.",3

"its good to play, the graphic is more interesting, but some times u maybe meet someone who ruining the game, its relly sucks, but i like the game :v",2

"its a really good game, with good mechanics and good graphics. at first, it is boring, but when you practice and start understanding the game, it becomes a pleasure every time. all the matches seem like theyre the same but theyre not. its a different game every match, with tactics and fun. 10/10. ps: there are russians.",2
"a nice refreshment away from sandbox, rpg, fps games. also a great comeback from the old dota mod on world of warcraft 3. great game, fun gameplay, new modes kept it more interesting.",1
"its a real free to play game! no purchasable content in the game. its not pay to win. its competitive. just take a look at the fastest growing game in e-sports.",1
"awesome and immersive gameplay! well ported from dota ! hats off to valve",3
"this game is similar to the super smash bros, but it diverges from that mold as it has a certain touch of sorrow and a solid connection with the concept of the human condition. these two factors truely make it a great game. plus these as put in some flying- donkeys 9/10",1
"best way to create conflicts with your parents/girl/friends",3
"first of all, there appears to be no need to ever buy this game. someone with 10 copies of this will gift one to one of your friends, who will find his copy multiplied by 10, who can then give one to you. now, should you actually play it? sure - its got unusuals and crates and all that jazz, so its basically team fortress 2 for boring people. be prepared for a steep learning curve, lots of abuse and a vocabulary full of words that will make your friends cringe. you got ganked son. enjoy your 10 copies of this game.",1

"if youre looking for a reason to commit time to dota 2  if youre actually reading this review for advice and a critical opinion, rather than to see what score im going to give the most popular game on steam  then, first up, thanks for being here. second, i want you to consider what it means when two grown men accidentally lather each other in regenerative goop. its gamings equivalent of holding a door open for somebody who is already reaching to hold the door open for you: a synchronicity of kindness that speaks to a deeper shared understanding of the situation both people are in. dota is a game where you can say the words are you thinking what im thinking? and be reliably assured that the person on the other end of your voip connection actually is. it might have the systems and bearing of a videogame, but dota shares the social impetus of a sport. its single environment isnt a map, its a pitch.",2
"^ just look at my recorded time, it says everything. :)",4

"this game takes so much time out of my life. i love it.",1
"alright, well i lied. after i actually did take the time to learn the game, i find it incredibly addicting and extraordinarily enjoyable. this is significantly harder than league is so if youre coming from that background, be warned. i highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone.",3

"very nice game, helps to learn english, russian and some other languages fast. the victory in the match requires very good teamplay",3
"this game is not for people who have less than average control over keyboard and mouse. you would need prior experience with relatively complex games, strategic thinking and perseverence. the learning curve is steep and this game is very demanding for the new players, the community at large is unforgiving and brutal if you are making mistakes as the mistakes you make would affect everybody in your team causing your team to lose. you cannot quit mid-game and the game can go for a long time and the result may not be known till the very end. all this can easily put off many people, but those who pass this rite of passage would enjoy the same things that you hated as a newbie.",3
"as the moba genre began to rise to the spotlight of the gaming community. i decided to give it a try. i first tried league of legends, but was yelled at for being a noob and rage quitted. i thought this kind of behavior was counter-productive, because a gaming commmunity should be supportive of noobs....because even the gaming legends start as noobs as some point in their career. so i got frustrated, and didnt touch mobas for a while. however, im in deep love in valve and everything they do, so when i heard about dota, i got interested. when i completed the tutorial, and finally joined a game, everyone was helpful and willing to assist a noob to a very complicated and intricate genre. i still suck, as i play off a kind of beginners intinct and not off of a knowledge of the game. however, dota, with its compelling art style, helpful community, and a touch of gaben, blew lol out of the water for me.",1

"such an amazing game team co-operation is important and again amazing and addictive game",1
"this is one of my best game, because the essence of dota 2 is how you play with other players and how your mind works as a team. the game works is that five man team versus another five man team you gonna cooperate with your teammates the five of you will assume role team that will help making the team win, there is ten role and one of those will be your role then all of you finish the most important thing is..... had fun! :d",3
"team up with a bunch of friends or solo queue if youre forever alone. play against bots or go pubbing with people in your region or people from all around the world! whichever you choose, the game will be filled with fun, stress and a lot of giggles. overall an addictive game that you will keep on playing...",3

"i avoided mobas for so long, you know. i really did. barring a short and entirely disagreeable experience with the original defense of the ancients map for warcraft 3, and a brief stint playing demigod (which i thoroughly enjoyed, all the while failing to notice it pretty much was defense of the ancients) i hadnt touched this genre at all. heroes of newerth? nope. league of legends? nah. dota 2? good grief, no. there were plenty of reasons for this. first, my initial experience with warcraft 3s dota map really was that bad. second, moba communities have a rather strong reputation for being full of complete cockhandles, and i dont deal well with destructive criticism. third, im not a huge fan of most pure multiplayer games; i tend to prefer playing solo where i can. it did not appear to be the game for me...",3
"this game is so addictive because of its graphics <3",2
"dota 2 is by far the best moba i have played to date!",2
"there are many reasons why dota 2 is an excellent game. for starters, it is a free-to-play game where you may play friends, random, or bots online. there are so many items to use as you head into the game, and just as many custom armors and extensions for your hero(s). i recommend this game for its excellent updates and imagination. i love this game. you will get hooked when you start playing.",1
"dota 2 is chess for people with a strategic and impatient disposition. it focuses on strategy, if you rush into it without proper thought and planning there is a very slim chance of success. but that does not make it slow paced, quite the opposite. even if are mindlessly whacking away on some neutral creeps in the jungle you can feel the energy in the air. the only problem i have with it is the community. entering youre first match is the quickest and most effective way of destroying your soul. the chat is almost always filled with the words stupid noob whenever you check it, and im not going to get in to the low-priority matches *makes gaging sound*. apart from that, it is one of the best moabs i have ever had the fortune to come across. check mate.",1
"dota 2 is all about intensity and team work. you master this game you master professional life.",3

"played a week and a half ago, 85 hours already logged. if i didnt have college or work - i would have no life. 10/10 would waste my life on dota 2.",2

"come on guys, play dota now and stop drug abuse, its fun to play and you earn a lot of money in here!",1
"you should not expect to have fun your first day playing...but theres method to this madness. in short, dota 2 is a deeply layered construct of systems, and to survive you need to understand every single one and how they interact with one another.dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. its an achievement owed to uncompromising depth, a ridiculously generous free-to-play model, and the great features developer valve has built up around it.",5

"started out playing dota on the old wc3 engine and i played that for 7+ years before i shifted into dota 2 with the beta. dota 2 offers much more than the original wc3 version in terms of graphics and gameplay, as the old engines hero and skill interactions were hampered by limitations (dota allstars was just a custom map). cosmetics, tournaments, and streaming are all seamlessly integrated; and are constantly being improved at the behest of the community. the game is a bit hard to get into at first, but after you have the basics down, youll play for an innumerable amount of time. adding friends into the mix for crazy strategies and plays increases the replayability and enjoyment of the game to another level. one of the best games. ever.",3
"this game is freaking awesome so if u like strategy games i recommend u play this",1
"leavers every game, unbalanced items and unexplaned bursts of damage, denial of creeps and heroes, and a terrible announcer from the first counter-strike. not to mention the sluggish and floating feel this game has to offer. 10/10",1
"everytime something is about to happen in real life, i always say to myself, glhf (good luck, have fun). this games community has helped me motivate myself in real life. if it wasnt for that acronym, i would be having more worries and stress over simple things. two dota 2 games (not necessarily every day) a day is a good dosage of having fun and keeping up with your social life. ive been playing this game since it came out 2011 and thats where the 2000+hrs came. i wont say i didnt get hooked. i did, cause i had nothing to do in summers when i was still schooling, but now im a busy man and this is like where i vent my frustrations. 9/10. gl hf!",5

"i woke up today and that  dota 2 just started to randomly update without my permission. phreak if u see this please fix ur good damn cheap  game",1
"i totally recommend this game to anyone it is a great game and very addictive what i found was it was easy to learn and understand how to work the controls so any newcomer can play but also is very hard to keep you on the edge of your seat. i would change 2 things and many people will agree so if you are looking at this dota 2 makers ;) we would love for you to be able to let us zoom out so we can see more as it is a pain and really hard to keep eyes on your character without dying and also please make it so you can choose for the camera to follow your player so we dont have to do that but overall amazing game but they are the only cons. great game",1

"ive just recently started playing dota 2. my friends always said that it was addicting and i always thought otherwise. i mean, what can be so addicting about a game. i thought that killing and dying is never really that fun. then i just kind of got bored and after 2 games i got hooked! i now understand how fun it is. addicting even. the graphics are nice. the response of heroes are great. the skills are appropriate for each hero. im just glad that i opened up to dota 2",1
"all the noobs who come from lol rate this game as pointless and confusing. however dota2 is a great moba full of strategy and an ever evolving metagame which is part of why it is fun, it also has reat tutorials for newer players to get used to last-hittings and denys.",1

"dota 2 , one of the best free games out there on the net. its really fun once you get to play it better. its also really fustrating when youre the worst player of your team, oh the pressure they put on you is unfathomable. really good game + its free, so why not try it right? ruined my life , so why not ruin yours ? makes perfect sense !",1
"this is a great game, the graphics are good, the sound atmospheric, the game play is clean and fun, and the heros are enjoyable and at some moments funny. however the game lacks in some area, some heros are far better then others when you play on a public server, i.e. (sniper, riki, and bloodseeker) just to name a few, all these heros can be countered easily, but with an incompetant team theyll become gods on the battlefield, also the tutorial teaches bad habits i.e. (only teaching you how to fight in the middle lane, poor hero selection, and no team building tutorial). altogether this game is great, it is outstanding how open ended the battles can be, every game is different, and youre never left unsatisfied. i give this game a 9/10",2

"this game may have its ups and downs but in all its an amazing game that has made my life easier. one way is that i learned the new wonderful language of russian, although the only word i know so far is , im sure it will help me get a job later in life. just calling my would be boss a  in russian would deffinatly increase my chances of getting said job.",3

"dota 2 does many things right. with free-2-play attitude, a vast selection of over 100 playable heroes and a massive fanbase, its easy to see why dota 2 is one of the fastest growing communities in gaming. however, not all is fine and dandy. the game punishes the slightest mistake with characters becoming unkillable and downright overpowered. take for example bloodseeker, if he gets even one kill he can dominate a game. new players are funneled into playing these easy or overpowered heroes making the game unenjoyable for the other players. while *t does happen, the game is still an enjoyable experience provided that the super-strong characters (that definently need a nerf) are kept under wraps by repeatedly killing them or the arent selected in the game youre playing. i would recommend it just dont expect it to a breeze.",1
"the learning curve is pretty steep. im pretty awful at this game, like lower than garbage. however, once you learn to ignore, the foul-mothed, often racist, and child-like flamers, good times are somewhat possible. i do actually enjoy this game though. its probably stockholm syndrome or something now that i think about it.",1

"very nice game, must play for mmo fans and others as well.superb collection of heroes and great graphics as well.",3
"its a really great game, and although one may suck at it like i do, its always fun to play with your friends (and throw the game sometimes just to make them mad :d)",1
"great game if you want to ruin friendships and get really mad at russians.",3
"great game, free to play.... addictive and can be flooded with mixed gameplay as its 5v5 if you play pvp but there is also the option to play against bots if you dont want to get into those hair ripping anger moments when you get matched with a terrible team! but i have also made some great friends through this game and for that alone makes it a 9/10 for me because thats what gaming is about not just winning.",4
"when you start playing dota 2, you soon begin to realize that its a black hole. the money in your steam wallet will slowly dwindle away, and youll suddenly have 20 of the same item in your inventory and a receipt for hundreds of chests. not even light can escape the black hole of dota 2. dota 2 is love, dota 2 is life. 10/10 would recommend.",1
"one of the best games in existance, but also one of the hardest. it isnt all about reaction timing or how many kills you get, but whether you can use your mind to outplay your opponent and kill the throne. if you persevere, you will get through the raging moments and be rewarded with a sense of accomplishment. but, there is always more to learn. the ability to work as a team is needed (obviously), but people underestimate what a team that supports eachother can really do. if you are up for the challenge then i strongly recommend this game. it isnt too much micro, depending on your hero, which there are 107 different ones to choose from.",4

"amazing game. dunno what i would do without dota 2 in my free time.",5
"i am an avid league of legends player that has switched to dota, and i have to say i couldnt be happier. i like the client tons better, the items that you can find, prices are reasonable (instead of the $25 skins). i would definately recommend this game.",1

"this is a nice game thats action packed. very fun and their is strategy involved. alot of characters to choose from and learn each with their own individual powers.",2
"dota 2 is a great moba game, and certainly did not fail to impress me with its traditional game style, and bounty of heroes (playable characters) to choose from! absolutely 100% recommend!",1
"insanely good!!! for the people that doesnt have this game you should have it. it takes skills to play this game for the ones that like a challenge i recommend this game so much. i love it so much. play it now!!!!!!!!!! 1000/1",2

"dota is so free its funny (russian people everywhere)",1
"gameplay: 10/10 community: 1/10 strong mental is required otherwise youre broken",1
"while it can take awhile to get the hang of this game, as it has a steep learning curve, it is extremely rewarding when it starts to click. its a challenging game that is fun to play with friends. its not always going to be sunshine and roses, but it will keep you playing due to the variety of heroes and people that you will meet. also, what impresses me the most about this game is how balanced it is. there is absolutely no way for someone to purchase an item with real money that will gain them an advantage in the game. all of the items you can buy are purely cosmetic. and the heroes are all quite balanced, and can all be countered. highly recommend this fun game! dont be discouraged if it doesnt click right away, itll get better. :)",1
"fantastic. for the times where life isnt sad enough already, and you feel a brief sliver of positivity or joy enter your mind...there will always be dota to fix that. must play.",4
"just have patience for the brutal learning curve. once you get past that, its very rewarding and fun! just find people to play with who are your skill level, dont always play solo queue. you need to win sometimes!",2
"i dont always play pubs but when i do, i prefer a five man. please play with your friends responibly. stay salty my friends.",2
"it will consume your life entirely, setting you back at least one year, condition you to feel anger towards other cultures when you hear someone speaking a different language, and, cause you to spend a lot of money on making your heroes fancier. it wont let you have a relaxing game when you have down time, let you enjoy any other game ever again, nor let you feel good about yourself. youll have dreams of going pro, youll claim mmr doesnt matter, and then youll realize youre a terrible 3k scrub. but youll be okay with that, go mid and feed. 10/10, would fall into addiction and be consumed again.",5
"although the new meta and 6.83 patches seem to be catching up as features from heroes of newerth, dota2, is still the moba king.",1
"asked my friends to play with me. they were to busy. cried. 10/10 would play again.",1
"this game destroyed a piece of my life . but still i love it <3",4
"dota is a game which helps to improve ur hand-eye coordination n ur concentration. i like very much dota then any oyher games!!!!!",1
"incredibly addicting. the gameplay itself is fun and engaging. it is played with a team of 5 characters with unique sets of skills and abilities versus another group. it is definitely a team effort to win the game. a single match would take about 40 to 60 minutes. customization of some aspects of the game adds another spice to the in-game play. characters costume sets, items, screensvers and skins and other dlcs which can be bought or traded at the steam market would keep the avid player own the characters. over all the game is exciting and fun. i give it 10 out of 10.",1
"this game is kinda 8/8 but i dont know much im only 6k... so here is a ham sandwich recipe; spread homemade mayonnaise on a thick slice of crusty white or rye bread. top with bibb lettuce, sliced tomato, thick slices of leftover ham, a few dill pickle slices and sliced cheddar cheese. spread whole-grain mustard on another slice of bread, then close the sandwich.",3
"good game the best i known and the longest i played ^_^",3
"played this game so much it started ruining my life. i had to pry my video card out of my computer and smash it with a hammer so i would stop playing it. do not play this game if you value your personal life.",2
"very good game a few bad things, terrible teams sometimes and so many updates, but best game ever",2
"7/10 dota 2. a bit over-rated, and extremely over-hyped during its release. if youve never had the privilege of getting sucked into a moba game for an over-extended period of time. take your chances with this free-to-play, valve-owned, cash-cow giant. and if i may recommend the best moba...its heroes of newerth.",1
"brilliant game to play with friends only if you know what you are doing",1
"this is a good strategy game and it has many set costumes. different than dota 1.",2
"besst game ever!.. not really but its free woohoo steam achievment for posting a review",1
"excellent game. a real free to play where no one has any advantages over another. the learning curve is steep as there are many heroes to choose from and knowledge of them is essential to perform well, but the in-game tutorial and matchmaking allows for a gradual progression based on your performance. the online resources are amazing: guides for build and strategy, stream of pro player almost every day on various website (joindota, twitch, etc.) and looking at them play helps improve your own gameplay. its an intricate game full of detaisl which you discover game after game. it might be easier to learn the game with friends!",4

"this game. this game is evil. not like a normal going to murder you family evil, but an evil along the lines of, your entire library is now pointless because everything else seems less entertaining that dota 2. avoid at all costs if you wish to enjoy the entirety of your steam library.",3
"8/10 does have its problems like having people from other countries every other game! i would say good game but i still like dota 1 patch a lot better than this one. play it have fun gg",3

"i love this game,the only reason i hate it is because all the noob pinoys -,-",2
"approaching 2100 hours played...wow. while i do completely agree with the reviews that talk about how bad the community is, i have to say my experience of dota on the whole has been very enjoyable. the mute option is great, i insta-mute anyone talking crap. admittedly dota has an incredibly high learning curve, and you will often find high level players playing on noob accounts so even the early matches for new players can be brutal. if you can push through the first couple of hundred hours of games ;) and ignore the torrent of expletives thrown your way when you let the team down!; you will find dota 2 to be a: competitive, intense, challenging, and completely engaging experience.",4
"the most challenging and interesting moba game ever.",1
"fun and interesting game where it test your mentality, co-operation and awareness.",3
"best moba ever!! a little difficult to learn for newcomers, but its tutorial is pretty good!!",2

"the single greatest human accomplishment in the history of the world.",2

"this game is awesome minus the russians and mexicans in your preferred language of english. people always hate on some heroes and items but the game is well balanced and all the heroes can counter eachother. i recommend this game and oull spend hours playing it.",3
"one of the top competitive games around with a dedicated fan base that numbers in the millions. once your hooked its not something you can easily put down. sure the game may have a steep learning curve with a somewhat unforgiving community but once your winning team fights, thats when the game truly takes off. and the items and cosmetics are just a extra perk to keep you playing, and best of all, its free!",4
"this game is simply amazing! never get bored no matter how many times i play.",2

"bawls. better then lol as far as sophistication and maturity of the community.",3
"its competitive, frustating and rewarding. train the  out of with bots first, win them easily then come to online gameplay. people will scream at you, don`t listen to them. just keep playing to get better.",5
"the toxicity and animosity of the players in this game is horrible. people who kill you on sight in rust are nicer. people will be  even if you are winning. everything you do will be wrong. you will see an exclamation mark ping a million times and have no idea what is going on because even though you are playing on us server no one else speaks english. you will be called names, you will hear mariachi music, and see jajajajaja every other game. but you will never stop playing... dota is life.",3
"awesome game.. once you go play you can never stop playing",3

"90% of your team mates will be brazillian, or russian, and will ruin the game for you. enjoy yourself. wax chests and other .",1
"since i am the master of dota 2 and embody the very essence of a gaming god, i feel i am qualified, if not overly adequate to take up the position of rating a game as highly acclaimed as dota 2, defense of the aliens 2. although many gam3r nerds think that dota 2 isnt the best game, thats just simply not true. i strongly disagree with the sentiments of these subpar gamers and i advise that you convert them to dota 2 as quickly as possible. so, many of your friends might be playing tf2, cod of duty, battlefield, wow, or some other weeaboo garbage, and they may be thinking that those are the best games the world has to offer. lol, wrong!, you should exclaim with great, pompous disbelief. as your friends look at you, confused as to why you are making a scene in the middle of a chinese restaurant, you will know, oh yes you will know that dota 2 is the best game in the world.",1

"new update is great! ive never been able to get less credit for matches than ever. go d/cing!!! 420/10",2
"for those who have played a moba game, i recommend dota 2. however its not fully perfect yet. language wise it is a mess. even if you pick english as your choice. you will get games with russians, brazilians, mexicans, and etc from time to time and there is really nothing you can do about until it is fixed. game play wise its a bit slower pace then heroes of newerth, but much faster then league of legends and equally as competitive.",4

"if i was to rate this i would rate it a 5/10 due to the mean players. and if you want to test out how hard ppl are if you are a noob. they say go back to bots. your bad. and some characters are all over powered and take no skill to use them. they give you no demonstration on attacks and it takes forever to use all the characters. i would say if you wanna play this go play league of legends. i would rate that a 9/10. the people are more friendly and you use teamwork in it.",1
"ive played a lot starcraft like games and i really enjoy dota 2. it is by far one of the best developed mods that has a great community, and its free!",1

"dota 2 is many things to many people: its a great way to kill an afternoon with friends; its a spectator sport platform with its own item-betting scene; its a hobby; its a profession, and a way to make a living. it isnt perfect and likely never will be, as each update tends to fix bugs and introduce new ones, and the tutorial could certainly use some work. however, with zero cost to play and one of the highest skill ceilings of any game ive ever encountered, dota 2 is a modern multiplayer masterpiece.",4
"i recommend this game it very fun to play and you can choose between many different heroes which is fun",1

"trial by fire. straight up. youre going to learn exceptions to the rule by being killed by them, and its going to happen a lot. dota is the most brutal learning curve of any game ive ever played. sometimes in a well-done fashion, sometimes not. there are few games where i can honestly say that at 300 hours you have barely any true idea what youre doing. amazingly complex game! tons of fun, especially with friends. not a casually oriented game at all, but enormously entertaining to play and watch. no grind, no microtransactions that affect gameplay in any way. no outside advantages, no premade skills. everything happens in game and you need to be quick on your feet. try it out! just be warned that properly trying it out will take hundreds of hours. relax, youre doing fine.",3

"its an amazing game - technically outstanding, showing all of valves usual polish and attention to detail, especially in the all-important multiplayer aspects. the continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. its hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. it took me a long time to warm up to, but im helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. if you can spare the time - play it.",2

"best moba in my opinion. although the game is not fully done yet, but it is alive due to great updates almost every day. the balance between heroes is very good, skill matters also. but the game vs real players, not bots, is very hard on my opinion and needs to be balanced, so professional players will not play with newbies. i recommend it to everyone, who like moba games and good graphics, friendly interface and cooperating.",1
"great game! the learning curve is however very steep, and you will probably end up losing a lot of your first games (as you get flamed by your teammates). but as you get better, youll quite enjoy it. by far the best moba experience you can have.",3

"can you describe the pure war? you can find out from this game.. best game eva!!",1
"hello guys! just a short review of this game: there are literally 3 main facts to describe this game: it is amazing, exciting and supplies you with lot of fun! i never played a game that requires more skill, teamplay, and strategy at once than dota 2. playing dota is accompanied by a non-stopable learning curve; that means you get better over the whole time. bit by bit you gain experience, how to play your hero effectively, how to communicate with your team mates to defeat the enemies! and that it is! teamwork is the main proceeding in that game! and for this reasons it makes such a big fun! in the average a battle is 45 minutes long. one battle demands your full attention, as well as concentration: choose the right character, fight well and cooparate with your mates! try it out, i totally recommend that amazing game!",1
"the game is just brilliant, but the community is awful. for example im playing ursa and 1 other guy sniper, the other 3 guys are just standing in base and waiting for the game to end. and they are calling me noob because the enemy team is jumping on me 4vs1 so i cant defeat them all. and at the end of the game (we lost) these guys are calling gg and easy.. for nothing, they didnt do anything but to just feed and staying in base. i really like the game but the trollers/kids is making it really tough...",1

"dota 2 is incredibly fun, although it may not seem so when youre sitting through that awfully slow paced tutorial, and your first few games may seem overwhelming. tough it out, its worth it. once you learn to play a hero or two and you know a couple items to go with those heroes, youll do fine. dota will show you that the only thing you were missing in your life is being screamed at by people in russian/porteguese despite you already make it clear that you only speak english. pro tip: no, playing on us servers does not solve this problem, apparently every russian/portuguese speaking person decided to play on us servers despite the awful ping and they dont know the mainstream language here.",1
"for me dota 1.0 wil be always better, dont know why, dota 2.0 is not the same.. but it still pretty good :)",1
"dota 2 adds a great deal of complexity to the moba genre. its balance tenet is: everything goes. there is no character that is underpowered; in fact, theyre all overpowered in their own way. the game places a great burden of knowledge over whoever tries it out. be sure to stick to co-op games for starters. the tutorial may prepare you slightly, but the game as a whole is a lot more complex than other mobas on the market. oh, and the saying it aint over till its over applies here. you cant be sure youre winning until the radiant/dire goes down. lots of rooms for comebacks in here, but the game is far more snowbally than other mobas.",1

"dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably wont suit you if youre looking to play casually. theres a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. but once you start to learn its secrets, theres a wild and exciting variety of play here thats unmatched, even by its peers. its a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. the fact that its completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isnt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. may the best team win.",2

"i played a few games. everyone told me i was a noob and should kill myself. our teams lost and everyone blamed me. this is my favorite game. 10/10",1
"1,587 hours on record for a reason. this game is more competitive and less childish than my previous game and train wreck of a dota-like accectable choice league of legends. yes the dota 2 community is rough but that is how it has been since dota on wc3. harder than usual to walk into and get going at first because of the vast knowledge of the game but replays can easily fix that in a day. overall great game and once again,  league of legends.",4

"if you look past all of the occasional angry russians/brazilians, youll learn to love it and eventually become a mindless tool whos purpose is to buy sets for heroes you never play and craft your inventory to death. 10/10 like skyrim with an overhead view",2
"this game will turn you into a racist, antisocial and angry person. 10/10 would recommend.",4
"good game, but if all the heroes will be here, this game will be really good.",1
"one of my most enjoyed games of all time ! a great strategy game for the ones willing to learn. no matter, on what level you are, youll be learning something new everytime you play this. its my first strategy game, but i still like this alot. there are a variety of heroes available, each having his own strengths and weaknesses. id suggest sniper for the beginners but never forget to",1
"best game. if you are into mobas then this is the game for you. even if you arent directly into games of the type you will probably enjoy playing this. not to mention the fact that it is free. free. free. no cost. $0. seriously. no joke. buy it today. or, dont buy it, because its free.",1
"the game is great, except that the game rapidly snowballs into an unwinnable position if you get off to a bad start, and they brutally punish you if you leave before the game is over. even if its the 20 minute mark, your team has died 40 times, and your opponents are all untouched, you just have to pretend youre still playing until your opponents decide to end it. which theyll often hesitate to do, opting instead to spend 30+ more minutes taunting and toying with you.",1

"best moba ive tried so far! very good balance between heroes",1
"very cool and good game uses all senses and helps to improve analytical decisions",3
"there is only one word that can describe this game: amazing! dota is the ultimate moba experience offering a large variety of well balanced heroes, suitable for any kind of player. every match has different teams that require different tactics to defeat. i like it how valve isnt greedy, as every cosmetic item in the game can be obtained by simply playing it. actually, the best items in the game can be obtained like this, considering that the shop offerst mostly uncommon items, that are available for a limited period. the only thing i dislike about this game is that sometimes people take it too seriously and forget to enjoy it. if you liked this review then feel free to give me free stuff.",3
"if you are gay, you will enjoy this game and its wonderful community. dotafag for life.",3
"expect no less from this game, you will find that this game extremely fun.",5
"great game, but it has the biggest learning curve of any game ive played. if you have some friends who know how to play it, have them teach you. if you dont like it, it was free anyway :0",1

"from an avid league player, its a bit hard to get into and understand at first. but once you get your main role going and start to learn the heros you can play it can get pretty fun. until you meet viper... /rage about one of his passives is a slow every auto attack compared to league it has a lot less skill shots and more lock ons. however there is still a lot of skill to be had at this game, not runes or masteries, denying, and losing some gold upon death. just make sure you dont spam your spells. your mana pool is very low and mana regen is little to nothing early game. a very different game with not a lot to compare to, but theyre both equally fun in their own way.",1

"looking to cut yourself off from the real world? life getting too boring for you? or are you just simply finding for a way to throw your dull life away? look no further, this game is the game for you. this game promises you hours of fun on end. you fight in a team to claim victory over the enemy teams ancient, hence the title defence of the ancients. some heroes are easily grasped, making it easy for beginners to learn the basics. once you start getting the hang of things and master the basics, there are a hundred other heroes to learn and master. personally, this game has ruined my life. with about 400 hours of gameplay, my grades have dropped, i have no time to hang out with friends anymore, my family hates me because im always in my room, you name it, im probably there right now. but ive never been happier in my life. girlfriend? sorry, i dont know what that is.",2

"spent all my free time on this game. ez game ez life! highly recommended",5
"greatest game i have ever played. it helps build teamwork and cooperation while at the same time playing with friends or random people you have never seen or heard of. you get lag spikes every now and then and the common trolls and new players.",2
"the most frustrating game of all time. this game will give you the feeling success, failure and regret. while at the same time, it will fuel the furious need to take another game, in hope that the teammates that you will play with, will have a higher intelligence quotient than the average programmed bots. in all, you will end up with doubt, begin to play as bad as the newbeginners, and end up in matchmaking unfairness. i recommend this game highly, if you have bdsm fetish or if you would like to play a multiplayer game in order to experience in-game injustice. and remember, no matter how bad a game was, always write a gg wp, because it is really that great.",1
"ive been playing dota for 7 years!! i really love this game .. i will marry dota someday lol",2

"dota2 is a very good game,recommended for you who like game with rts,moba genre !",2
"this was awsome! it seemed we were on a weaker balance but with nice tactics and good timing of pushing and defending we were able to take out the game. players are somehow a bit too extravagant on using this sensitive word noob when they believe the other player failed to comply of what he had wished. however, blaming comes naturally in a game for winning and losing. at least no other bad words came out. it was a good one generally. cheers,",1

(i have played bf 3, bf 4, every dead island, a lot of strategic games and wow etc... i also played lol, but dota ... dota 2 is more difficult than lol, lol is for kids who want kill everything and destroy everything, but dota is more strategic and just it is more about how can you plan assaults, how you can farming...) dota is about cooperate, but lol is also about that, than why play dota? play it if you want challenge and a lots of hour of fun. its amyzing guys play it! :-)",2

"originally a warcraft 3 mod, this highly influential arena style game has inspired many spin offs including the acclaimed league of legends. unlike league of legends however, you can control all 112 heroes when you buy the game, and there is no pay to win features at all; all bonus items are purely cosmetic and for fun. the community can even create content that can be acquired in game! the only shortcoming to dota is that it will be a little more difficult to pick up compared to league of legends. given the chance however, dota2 will prove to be a much more balanced and skill-oriented experience, with meaningful item and ability selection and a more dynamic gold farming game which both provide superior short and long term strategic gameplay. try the one that started it all, you wont be disappointed!",1

"a very fun game with a ridiculously good f2p model. (basically, you can get any item you want through random drops, or from trading with other players.) it is a very complicated game however, much harder than its counterpart league of legends. pros -many heroes -all heroes are unlocked at the start -very precise balancing -a lot of different strategies and ideas -very large community (most popular game on steam) -very little issues, even on my barely-gaming rig cons -complicated, and it takes a while to learn all the mechanics -tutorial can be a little vague or dense -one player can ruin a whole game (inherent of all games in this genre) -extremely hostile or crude community -lacks any form on region lock, and the report system is barely functional this game functions very well, and truly deserves its crown of the most popular game on steam. long live dota! 4.5/5 9/10",2

"after years of waiting, fans of the league of legends franchise have finally gotten what theyve been waiting for: league of legends 3: the fall of demacia. in this thrilling conclusion to the loved league of legends trilogy, riot games have yet again shaken the moba genre to its core. in this game, the player returns to playing in three dimensions, rather than two like in league of legends 2. throughout the game, riot has expertly woven in fps and rpg segments that add a change of pace to the players adventure. as league of legends 3: the fall of demacia has simply too many new features to be covered in my lowly review, i highly recommend that the reader purchases this game. i give this game a 11.5/12.",1
"this is the game ull never stop playing if u just try 1 time.",1

"i like getting people mad and dota 2 is a good game for it",1
"the game is easy. all you do is load up and select which server you want to play on, brazil or russia. warning this game makes you incredibly racist against any person who has any connection whatsoever to russia, the phillipines, or brazil. other than that its a great way to ruin your life forever. but once you start playing you wont care anymore. 10/10 would play again.",2

"this game is fantastic for player vs. player combat and strategic tactical action.",2
"first review.. so dota2, where to begin. firstly, it is a fantastic game, which community is growing rapidly. with the up coming ti4, there really isnt a greater time to join the game. the range of heros is a good amount, not too many that it would be impossible for someone from the team of 5 for there to be an unused hero. the one thing that lets the game down is new players. now im not saying new players are all bad and should stop playing the game. i think we (experienced players) need to help them, maybe have an academy option of some sort meaning new players are able to be coached by experienced players before they enter match making. this is what i did when i began playing the game a few years ago and something i have done in turn teaching new players. that would be my only advice to new players learn from experienced team mates. if your friendly and dont ignore what they tell you they wont get angry.",2

"this game is absolutely best. i have never played a game like this. just play it.",5
"dota 2, where teamwork is laughable and everyone is pinoy. 99/10",3
"f**ked up matchmaking yet very addictive, piece of  game ruining your lief",2
"what makes this game awesome is that each game is never the same. with such a large selection of heroes, items and straregies, it continues to keep you on your toes. dota 2 is all about team work and finding combinations that will work well together and there is nothing like that feeling you get when your team pulls of an amazing combo move that wipes out all your enemies. dont take the game to likely either as the scales may turn at anytime which makes for even more fun.",1

"well, i used not to enjoy mobas at all, the first moba i tried it was dota 2 because (valve games are always awesome, every single one of them) but because also, i heard good things about it, so for beginers in this kind of game its really hard to learn the basics, but once you learn you just want to play more and more and always try different heroes, tatics and such. so all the time i spent on it, it was well worth it. the only problem is that begginers tend to have a really bad matchmaking stats, and you find leavers, etc etc. but for people who are on the same level as me or better, its great. so why not give it a try?:)",2
"dota 2 is amazing game with strategy and thinking and if you wont top play free game take dota 2 without thinking its great game",1

"this game improved so much since it was released on the beta. there are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as dota 1. i know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in dota 2 and i think it will help new comers. i know some people who play lol might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. its like comparing cod and battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, i think bot of them are good) give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. try it out, its free and badass!",1
"i like the whole game itself (dota 2) because we all know that we started as noobs on dota 1. here, we can practice and learn much faster than the previous game. the game will guide you throughout its contents. but the only problem in this game is that there are thousands of players from around the world that do not know how to respect other people.",1
"the most addicting thing in the world. i dont know what sort of masochistical urge is making us play this game over and over again. overall 10/10!",4

"best game to ever grace the mobarena, just thinking about it throws my throbbing erection to farther, inhuman heights",1
"amazing game. truly, i mean it. so pure is its reflection of its players and their teamwork that it reminds you every game just how  most of the world is on a fundamental level. dota could make even saint teresa a racist after just a couple hours.",1
"an awesome game and the battles are always different, its just awesome, the more they add then the more it is awesome",1
"well dota2 is fun, its about teamwork and not to mention you get to bond with your friends!",2
"one of the best multiplayer online battle arena game; its gameplay focuses on combat in a three-dimensional environment, presented from an oblique high-angle perspective. what i liked on this game is that this is played in discrete matches involving two five-player teams, each of which occupies a stronghold at a corner of the map. each stronghold contains a building called the ancient, which the opposite team must destroy to win the match. each player controls a hero character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory.",1

"continuing in the footsteps of dota. this game will beat (if not already) all other moba games for sure.and the idea of keeping it completly free while getting a lot of profit with cosmetic items is brilliant. constant updates and balance changes keep the higher ranked players from getting borred. keep up the good work.",3

"i totally recommend this game to anyone it is a great game and very addictive what i found was it was easy to learn and understand how to work the controls so any newcomer can play but also is very hard to keep you on the edge of your seat. i would change 2 things and many people will agree so if you are looking at this dota 2 makers ;) we would love for you to be able to let us zoom out so we can see more as it is a pain and really hard to keep eyes on your character without dying and also please make it so you can choose for the camera to follow your player so we dont have to do that but overall amazing game but they are the only cons. great game",1

"when i hear the match found sound i get a boner. this game has shown me things no other game or human being has before. this game is essential to my thrice-daily spank sessions; the female heroes (windranger, drow ranger, crystal maiden, etc.) all wear very sultry clothing which adds to my erotic fantasy. highly recommended i cant go a day without this",5
"this game is gonna suck out the life in you. its like youre selling your soul to the devil, except youre selling it to dota. its not like you need a soul anyway.",4
"so far its a really good game love the animation and the similarty to wow",1
"never gave this type of a game a chance because of the harsh learning curve. dont make my mistake... jump in and deal with a few games of other players yelling at you. it is worth it once you figure it out.",1

"this game sucked the life out of me.. i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!",4
"way way way more depth than league of legend (lol), steeper learning curve, higher skill cap and alot more balancing / fair play. has some similarities to hon but overall feels like a really different game. i love both but dota 2 feels more competitive and has a bit more interesting heroes + the balancing is better (except riki). i would recommend this game if youre into something that requires you to actually think and use your brain unlike lol. i personally prefer hon out of all the mobas but that might just be cause i started with it, dota 2 comes close as second. 9/10",2
"very good in terms of gameplay. the graphics are on moderate scale which i think is a good thing sisnce not everyone could have high-end specs... the games in costant development and new patches come out quite often. however, the patching and issue solving problems still exist with valve. i would rate the game as 8.7/10",3
"nice game... have many heros.. every time new experience to play this game (y)",2
"i realy love to play dota....so i hope that this 2nd chance is gona bring me there!",3

"surprisingly great game for only having one map! it doesnt seem to get boring because depending on the players in your particular game the game experience changes everytime. there are lots of unique characters to choose from and items galore. i dont normally play games like this but it has become my number one game on the linux platform and have over 100 hours logged in the past two months. its a must have game period. enjoy!",1

"you get to meet and be cursed at by people from exotic lands!",2
"the game itself, is fun, graphics are interesting gameplay mechanics are simple and easy to understand at low skill levels, but complicated and take a lot of time to figure out at harder ones, the game was overaly enjoyable, but the complexivity of items and the gery of players make it.... meh. i dont know a lot about dota 2 ,but this is the imppresion i got from all the time i have played. if a friend of mine hadnt told me the real name i would think dota would stand for den of tryhard hats. of course, i havent played much, but this is the imppresion i got when i started: overaly enjoyable, but unless you have enough friends for a full team avalble at all times, dont bother.",1

"this is a very nice game. two thumbs up!! earthshaker",2
"dota 2 is a moba game which is the so called sequel to the warcraft iii mod dota. surprising both old and new players alike as to how good it is compared to others or to its predecessor. dota 2 is a game which is utterly repetitive, who am i kidding? same map, same items, same heroes every single time but i never got bored or got sick of it, more like this is the reason i play it so much, to be better at the same map, using the same items and heroes at every other fight. (i play it weekly for about 8 hours, yeah 8 is my favorite #) all in all a great moba game, maybe the best. better graphics than its competitors and definitely more balanced in terms of both heroes and items.",1

"seriously, ive gone from paying heroes of newrth to league of legends to dota and the only game ive stuck to playing constantly out of the three is dota. i find it easier than hon but more challenging than league. i have no major glitches like i did when i played league and i love all the heroes that can be played. ive gotten quite a few of my friends to either pick dota 2 back up or to start playing it. like any other game you run into a few rude players but otherwise the community is great. i highy recommend this to anyone looking for a game to play like league or hon!",1

"great game with alot of choices tough i recomend finding friends to play it with as the community can be quite aggressive and also there seems to be quite a large number of players that do not care in language search preference seeing despite having it set to only english i see russian, german and all sort of languages in chat but if you can come over the two points i mentioned before and manage to learn game mechanics and also other things such as what roles and heroes you like this is a really nice game to put your time into",3

"sometimes a headache, always training noobs, getting ganked when its least expected, those cheap characters (you know which ones i am talking about,) and half of your team quiting most of the time when they get pwned for acting crazy. 10/10 game. would recommend to anyone... welcome to the end of your life, and say goodbye to the sun.",1
"best game for make a newfriend make a laugh and make me happy everytime i playing this game",1
"after 6 years of dota, here are my thoughts on dota 2 mmr is broken as  skill gap between players is as big as valves profits made from tf2 hats matchmaking is horrible even in rankeds. (got matched up with someone with ~100 hours, fed 3/17 as riki) at least two russians guaranteed on your team on euw. eu pubs are even worse, dont get me started on them. uninstalled. also 6.82. ew. ew. ew. ewwww.",1
"10/10 this game has taken 220 social life hours away from me",1
"a good moba but the community is a let down from time to time. i found the learning curve quite steep so beginners will find this painful to play until they have played at least 10 games+",1

"this game is the reason why mmorpgs are not that much of a hit anymore.",3
"as someone who had never played the original dota for warcraft 3 and had only played league of legends prior to the release of dota 2, i can safely say its worth the switch. the game was a little daunting at first to get learn but valve offer plenty of ways to learn, such as their tutorial system or bot match, even better now they added the in-game user guide menu which makes everything so much easier. there is a huge selection of heroes to pick from, each unique and fun to play including roles i wouldnt normally touch such as support, i honestly dont mind it in this game because its fun. every aspect of this game seems to be done really well, and it doesnt seem like valve is stopping on the updates anytime soon. the only negative thing i can say about this game is the community, but theses days if you play online you can expect that in any game.",4
"a must play for anyone. from a large pool of unique heroes you play as one who possesses unique abilities to be used in tandem with the rest of your team in order to out-maneuver the opposing team. my first moba was lol, and i have permanently made the switch to dota 2 after weighing the pros and cons, and have never looked back. with the talented people at valve continuing to produce and develop this game, i am absolutely certain this will be a revered classic for many years to come.",1
"amazing! best game ever next to elder scrolls! get it now!",3
"save yourself while you still have a life. run for it.",2
"this game is play much by myself, but i feel it lacks in abillites and champion roles in the sense that it really doesnt have much varity in how you build your champ/hero as a build can work in just about every situtation. this my seem like a major nark on the game, but id say its rather good besides that one part. it has good graphics and a fairly good champ/hero pool. i would say try this out if youre content on not play lol and games like this, but if youre open to the moba lifestyle try lol first honestly. 3.5 out of 5 stars for gameplay. 4.5 out of 5 stars for pc controls",1
"a truly free to play game with a learning cliff. hard as hell, but equally rewarding. definetly prefer over league of legends.",1
"the only strategy game for me! lots of fun and nerves (sometimes). it will kill all of your time and you won`t regret. :)",4

"decent at times, awfully frustrating at others. the life of dota 2",2
"take the time to learn how to play, and you will be richly rewarded. no hats, unfortunately.",1
"dota 2 has easily become the best moba out at the moment, fast paced action with a mixture of easy to learn characters and hard to master ones aswell, constant updates with great game modes. if your looking for a moba thats easy to get into this is the game for you.",4
"causes anxiety problems, low self esteem, tourettes syndrome, mood swings, bipolar disorder, breakdown of relationships, raging erections, racism. would definitely recommend.",5
"wery good game for people who likes team work and meeting new people every match.",1

"challenging game with great art. requires mass strategy. i love it. highly addictive.",3
"pretty nice game and this is one of the main reasons why i created my steam account, best part of this game is that you could kill a donkey and your enemy team would probably report you for doing that.",3
"it is the best of games, it is the worst of games. there hasnt be a game in recent years that is equally likely to make you swear at the screen and idiotic teammates, as it is to make you smile and laugh when stuff goes well. i guarantee every game will produce emotion, even if some of those are better left unfelt. just dont punish the hardware youre playing on, its not to blame. and the first couple dozen games you play, you will hate it. and your team will hate you. and youll be told to delete dota and kill yourself. and because youre persistent and dont take crap from random morons on the internet, you will ignore them and get better at the game purely out of spite. its a great game. let the other players hatered fuel your desire to improve, and you will get better.",2

"if youre looking for a reason to commit time to dota 2  if youre actually reading this review for advice and a critical opinion, rather than to see what score im going to give the most popular game on steam  then, first up, thanks for being here. second, i want you to consider what it means when two grown men accidentally lather each other in regenerative goop. its gamings equivalent of holding a door open for somebody who is already reaching to hold the door open for you: a synchronicity of kindness that speaks to a deeper shared understanding of the situation both people are in. dota is a game where you can say the words are you thinking what im thinking? and be reliably assured that the person on the other end of your voip connection actually is. it might have the systems and bearing of a videogame, but dota shares the social impetus of a sport. its single environment isnt a map, its a pitch.",5
"i played league of legends for 2 years before finally switching to dota 2. it is better in basically every way. huge learning curve (im still a total noob after 250+ games) but almost always fun. the amount of possible plays you can make with various heroes/items is basically infinite. the best pvp game in many years.",3
"this game.... where do i even start. this game has consumed, no, devoured into its abyss more than a thousand hours of my life. thats like watching youre favorite tv show (without ads) for close to 3000 episodes. i would rather kill myself rather than watch 3000 episodes of tv. after all these countless hours exploring the gaping void of what seems to be, as some would call, fun, in dota 2, i have learned a few things: 1. if someone picks void, lycan or naga, leave immidiately. do not pass go, do not collect 200 gold. 2. do not attempt to understand russia, russian people, culture, or anything associated with the words , blyat, id inahui, etc. 3. this game will destroy your ing life still better than lol dan outa dan - john wins",2
"one of the best free games ive played.part(not all) of the community is perty toxic but then again each game has its own bad players. overall its a sweet moba game to play and i do recommend giving it a try.",1
"dota 2, a free to play strategy game wherein players team up and battle with other teams. this is so great, they improve so much the old dota in warcraft frozen throne, and they also add items that can freely customize your favorite heroes. great marketing strategy, live long dota 2!",1

"this game improved so much since it was released on the beta. there are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as dota 1. i know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in dota 2 and i think it will help new comers. i know some people who play lol might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. its like comparing cod and battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, i think bot of them are good) give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. try it out, its free and badass!",4
"dota 2 is not a game, it is a sport and should be played a such.",5
"best game in my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2
"dota 2 is a great game. its very tactical. youve the choice of over dozens of heroes. everybody will find his own special one, for every different playstyle. its free to play and the ingame shop is absolutly fair and you need no items from this shop. all items are pure cosmetic. if you want to play this game for free, you have to know a person with free copies of this game. the alternative is to buy this game in the steam store. if you buy this game, youll get some special items for the game. but join a steam group for dota to find guys with free copies.",1
"great game, very strategic. i like that you can play bots, and they did a really good job with the a.i. on the bots. lots of custimization. a real free game but is worth buying.",1

"this game maps is similar like lol since patch 6.82 6.82a changing the gameplay significantly, from farming to win became to kill the streak to win. but i think its ok now since 6.82b patch released changing the game plays to normal, the composition of formula exp and gold is stable now.",1
"excellent gaming strategy. one of the best rpgs available.",2
"best  simulator! okay i recommended doto, now where are my rarez?",3
"dota 2 is, in my eyes, the best game ever made. if it werent for the overbearing ignorance of the people that play this game, that thrive only on making others angry with said ignorance. this game could have been so much more. that being said, i recommend you get a few of your friends together to play with you. if you can get a group of 3-5 people to play this with. there is no better game. win or lose, my friends and i have a blast every game. showing off our skilled plays and laughing at each others blunders. unfortunately if you are a lone gamer, you will end up with that same type of person in your group often. that one guy that cant play to have fun. his idea of fun is to have the whole team verbally abusing someone for a single mistake for an entire hour long game. that being said, i would give this game a 9/10. the one point deduction due to the moba community being a bunch of *ssholes.",4

"welcome to dota 2, you suck. (remember to brush up on the  skills you filthy  :p)",1
"the good: fun, addicting, strategic, teamwork, dominating, pub stomping, competitive play, daily tournaments and non advantage giving item shop (cosmetic only). the bad: match making in the skill level bracket can seem to be a bit broken at times. one bad player can ruin the match. players that disconnect and abandon in 5 minutes. occaisonal 3-5 minute wait on a match. other thoughts: i love dota 2 in the strategic gameplay. after all it is a moba and a strategy game at best so it requires a lot of patience and a lot of good timing, skill, and also great efficient teamwork. thank you valve for bringing us such an amazing game!",1

"excellent although a black hole that sucks in all of your free time. great game though. get it.",2
"probably my most played game ever and surely 1 of the best (if not the best). very addicting, great gameplay, competitive game too (with ranking), hard to learn and hard to master :), and...free. if youre not looking to play over 100 hours dont even start playing it because by then youll probably not even know half of the heroes and items. would give it 98/100 ( why not 100? often long queuing)",5
"recommended if you like lol, or if you like moba. great game by valve. 80% good community (south americans are the worst). nice trade system, where you can customize your hero as you want for free (trade items for items) or you can always buy with real money your favorite sets (though they are expensive usually)",3

"i recommend this game because you really need some skills like teamplay / lasthitting / denying etc. its a very enjoyable game which you can play with friends. the trading system can also be very nice there. this game often calls out many updates, so if youre wondering if this game has events then well ofcourse! for those who havent played it yet and really need a new game, try this one. (games usually take 30+ minutes.)",2

"itll kill your life take up all your time and ruin all family relations. 10/10",1
"as you might know dota 2 is a moba game, but despite the others games i think dota is better. you may ask why ? , the answer is simple : you can customise heroes for free and as you want, you can choose your favourite hud and announcer.now about graphics,they are really good even in low quality and imagine if in low quality are that good think how good they can be at high quality.dota has a darker concept for the heroes.and at last the gameplay,well,most of moba players are saying that is harder.i found it really easy once you learn the items and how that hero is supposed to go.maybe i found it easier because is a more strategic game than the other games.i can say only this except dota 2 ive played 4 other mobas and the most ive enjoyed is dota 2. i dont force you to play and like this game ,but i hope you will try at least to play a while and enjoy your play. good luck & have fun !",1
"this game is really something lots of adventures and tactics it was superb awesome",1
"this game has not got much to it on paper; 2 teams with a base each with 3 ways in defended by evenly placed towers. however, it is still playable and addictive with loads of characters and item combinations across teams each game is different and lasts about 30-40 mins. it started as a warcraft 3 mod so expect some familiar concepts. it is going to be free to play at some point so when it is i would at least give it a go you can also buy cosmetic items but nothing to give an advantage over the moaning cheapskates ;-)",1
"one of the best games ever - good graphics and wide hero selection.",1
"a fun game that never gets old even on the same map 9/10",1
"if you liked the original dota then youll like this. play nice with others!",3

"valve corporation is a nice corporation and all rights reserved. i enjoy playing your games",2
"i cannot tell you how much i love this game. one of the best thing s about it is its versitility: wanna play a casual game for 5 mins? sure play 1v1 mid lane practice, or a limited heros match. wanna play and extreamly complicated and intense game with 9 other players for 30-60 mins? go play a 5v5 all pick ranked match, or a random death match. if you are willing to study the inerworkings of the game it can be even more fun. youll also meet lots of new freinds! ^_^ and on top of all that its free. f-r-e-e, how could you turn such a great game down?",1
"one of the most in depth and fun games to hit the web, a daunting character pool with new additions keeps the game alive and fresh. it has a steep learning curve that you never can escape, but that keeps the fun flowing!",3

"dota 2 in a nutshell: quits game cause of personal buisness (put in low tier matchmaking) team is reporting you for no reason (put in low tier matchmaking) doesnt want to commend player for doing nothing (put in low tier matchmaking) so in conclusion 10/10 would dota again,24/7 low tier matchmaking #420w33devvvrryduy",1
"one of the best, if most complicated games i have ever played.",4
"an awesome game for people who are tired of games that rely mostly on grinding and farming for hours to become the best player. this game introduces you to a new perspective where skill and team play is what the game needs to win matches. it never gets boring and alot of heroes to choose from. 10/10",3

"awesome free 2 play game... love how steam supports it.",1
"wasnt sure what to think about this game when alex introduced it to me. i found it hard to believe that there were league and championships dedicated to play this let alone the hype behind it, though that could be my doupts due to its link with blizzard. its very fun and here valve are just laughing at the bank with the game as people loved the origonal so much. in this case, you might as well just give your money to valve, its making that much. very fun rpg, yet hard to explain. you get to pick a character, level him/her/it up and the objective is to destroy the enemy base. each base creates small creatures called creeps and you gain gold for xp by killing creeps and destroying towers. in this case the creeps are red-shirts, running into battle and no real loss when they die. you can download it for free, spectator a match and see what you think. what do you have to lose?",1
"superior graphics compared to other arts games. gameplay almost the same as in dota with improved comunication between players, key configurations, disconnect protection, etc.. always fun to play!",1

"yes i recommend this game for u all to play this game",5
"everyone ever should play dota 2. strategy and action win",2
"dota 2 is one of the single most genius games i have ever played. it might not be as adrenaline-fuelling as a top fps, or as popular as other games on the market at the moment, but it is simply brilliant. dota 2 uses all of your tactical mind, and takes huge amount of skill to outwit your opponents. best free game on the market.",1
"after playing quite a bit of league of legends, i decided to finally give dota 2 a fair shake, and... well, i think i like it. there are some frustrations in transitioning from lols mechanics, especially when it comes to tower/creep aggro (very different strategy than lol) and overall champion strength, but the more i stick with it, the easier it is to avoid blindly falling prey to these things. i like that all the champions are free, with the ability to pay for non-effective, aesthetic customizations, not to mention the integration with steam workshop, to potentially get your own mods in the game. i still favor lol, but there is a lot to like here, and i look forward to spending more time learning the depths of this game.",1

"if you want really bad qualifactions (unless of course youre studying russian), this is the game for you! it ceratinly worked for me",2

"only fun to play with friends if you win and/or dont care about your match numbers being at a good ratio of win to loss. *obligitory russia mention*",2
"i play lol and dota 2. its like being in two different relationships. lol takes me to all the nice resturants, gets me all the expensive jewelry, and even vaction weekends with her parents. dota lures me over at 3 am telling me youre the only one for me honey, only to be the same old bi**hy s**t who whips me around. but i still let dota f*** me anyways, because in a sort of twisted way i secretly like it. shes wild in bed, and i like it when she pegs me with her high heel and drops a digit.",1
"i played this character called io and realized taht diz game design was meant to not actually fight teh enemy teem but instad to go and wisp round them pretending to ult and moba stuff, but its k cuz we one cuz pudge made a play and then killed some team guy but then the tower killed him, i tried to save him but moba . then i went to moba then i got a play and saved him from tower. wrong i died cuzz i was a wisp that aprarently thnks its a light source for the games shifty graphics look and feelz. when the game was over i got some item called chest of the gaben item of monetary value but turns out i needed teh keys of teh dota moba hat party 2 and then i cried, 10/10 -game informrrrr 9/10 - gaim st0p wow/10 - doge review",1

"very nice game, helps to learn english, russian and some other languages fast. the victory in the match requires very good teamplay",3
"this game is not for people who have less than average control over keyboard and mouse. you would need prior experience with relatively complex games, strategic thinking and perseverence. the learning curve is steep and this game is very demanding for the new players, the community at large is unforgiving and brutal if you are making mistakes as the mistakes you make would affect everybody in your team causing your team to lose. you cannot quit mid-game and the game can go for a long time and the result may not be known till the very end. all this can easily put off many people, but those who pass this rite of passage would enjoy the same things that you hated as a newbie.",3
"as the moba genre began to rise to the spotlight of the gaming community. i decided to give it a try. i first tried league of legends, but was yelled at for being a noob and rage quitted. i thought this kind of behavior was counter-productive, because a gaming commmunity should be supportive of noobs....because even the gaming legends start as noobs as some point in their career. so i got frustrated, and didnt touch mobas for a while. however, im in deep love in valve and everything they do, so when i heard about dota, i got interested. when i completed the tutorial, and finally joined a game, everyone was helpful and willing to assist a noob to a very complicated and intricate genre. i still suck, as i play off a kind of beginners intinct and not off of a knowledge of the game. however, dota, with its compelling art style, helpful community, and a touch of gaben, blew lol out of the water for me.",1

"awesome game, but has a very huge learning curve. which means you have to play a lot of games just to learn the ropes. if you are looking for campaigns or binge campaign mode gaming, this game is not for you. if you are looking for fps games that end in 10 mins, this game is also not for you. if you are looking for 30 mins - 1 hour real time strategy game, this game is for you.",3

"i absolutely love dota 2 and would reccoment it to any serious gamer espedcially fans of warcraft three dota and other multiplayer online battle arena (moba) games like league of legends or heroes of newerth (blatent ripoff of dota). of course valve and steam make the game easy to run and the community is fantastic. 5 out of 5 stars.",2

"never go into a dota 2 match with the mindset that youre going to win. still a fun game though.",4
"this kind of games is not my cup of tea, in spite of that i like dota more and more. why? game is not about stupid clicking, how i thought, but if you want to win, you have to strategize and combine special abilities of 5 unique heroes. so if you are not a team player, the game is not for you. the graphics is really nice, but there are some negatives too. the tutorial is very tacky and discourages players from playing more than helps them. the game is very hard and chaotic for newbies. but if you understand to the game a bit, youll have a great fun. mainly with a couple of friends. moreover the game is free to play, so the conclusion is that i recommend dota 2.",1

"what can i say about dota 2 that hasnt been said before, it is one of the most mechanically complex games you could possibly find around. it has a extremely high skill ceiling and takes a lot of effort from you to learn and not be a burden on your team. you will get hate from the community until you become capable and if you do decide to dive in prepare yourself for some harsh words until you settle in but compering this game to league of legends like most others do, it is more complex and fulfilling then league will ever be but its not for the faint of heart. but if you do stick with it and a few mates it will be hands down one of the best times you could ever have.",3

"feel like committing suicide some time soon?, speak a strong russian accent?, like to be very bad at games and then blame it on other people?, or perhaps you just like to play games and troll people untill they commit suicide themselves. well if so, this is your game.",2
"pretty solid game, makes league look like complete monkey . the only problem with this game is that the russians and hispanics dont know how to pick there own server so nine times out of ten you get that one dumb  who doesnt speak english on your team.",1
"nice to play the dota.. hope can add some new graphic. ty",2
"like being yelled at? like yelling at people? this game is perfect, 10/10.",1
"ever wanted to be shouted at in a language you dont know? get dota 2.",3
"as a dota 2 fan and an avid player of lol, i can say that the debate between which is better is moot. they are completely different playstyles and both have their own merits that make each game extremely addictive and enjoyable. dota 2 is exactly what us dota fans wanted it to be since back in the wc3 days. the community and the developers have made gameplay near perfection and the rest of the game system just keeps getting better as it evolves. i highlly recommend this game and theres no reason not to try it out, its free!",1
"this game is my life. my life is this game. friends and family dont matter, dota 2 comes first. this is not just a review but also a story of my entire life as life is complete with this game.",1
"this game is my hobby, my passion, my love and this is awesome game... <3 dota2",1
"this game is the best. you will enjoy playing this game. i love this sow much.",3
"hands down best game i ever played.it is so much fun,specially if you are playing with friends and it never gets old.",4
"much better than lol in so many ways for example the item system in dota is way better than the skin system in lol because you dont have to play in order to get some nice items and in lol u will have to invest money in order to get skins, so thats a big reason why i love this game more than lol. another reason is that i love graphics and since the graphics in dota are really sexy i find this a better game already (xd). but without comparing i really love the game because its so strategic and fun in many ways and im addicted to it. i think this game will atleast give me a couple 100 to maybe a 1000 hours of fun! so if youre thinking about downloading the game.. just click that green button already c;",1
"as a dota addict, i love/hate this game so much. i love it because i jajajajajajaja csm report team noob love the challenge it brings with every match. i hate it because it consumes so much of my  blyat time and the community is really horrible. if you just started to hijo de  noob  madre play dota then prepare yourself for a storm of insults coming your way, people will trashtalk you and be mean to you, ignore them, you will have so much jajajajajjaja fun in this game you wont even care about the community, youll find friends and  madre este meepo es una  enjoy the game eventually. have no wards noob team jaja report omg this tiny fun and good luck!",4
"want to play videogame with your friends? leave this game while you can. recommend.",3
"ive fully switched over to dota 2 from playing league of legends for 6 years. i have to say i never spent a dime on league, and have only been playing dota 2 for three weeks and spent roughly $50. although it is quite different when compared to lol, in terms of difficulty, i say its much more fun playing unfair bots with friends. the community is also great.",1
"very good game, bunch of heroes to play with, but a very bad community.",4
"this game is a , always in  teams, would rage again 10/10",3
"have u ever dream? its a dream itself. full of despair and regret. but its all for u. u can earn respect by ur teammates, moreover an envy form the other team. you can be god. do ur best now. ure the one who can make this. u must shout yolo and do everything. as i always say hit or miss.",1
"best game but sets are so expensive for some country",2
"dont play dota unless youre prepared to be patient and bare the insults of angry teammates. get through that and its one of the best games youll play",2
"dota 2. not very much to say . just - the best moba out there !!!!!!!!",3
"really fun game. it might take you awhile to get to a decent playing ability more so than most games, but when you do and get some good friends to play with its amazing.",2
"love this game its hard to play at first then your addicted to it !!!",2
"this game is incredibly fun and addictive my favorite moba 10/10",2
"would definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to learn russian and/or portuguese.",4
"an rts with a twist...... you control 1 unit, who is that unit? your own hero from a selection of 100+! the creeps are autimated and the goal is simple..... destroy the ancient. the ancient is the teams core, destroy the ancient and win! pros: fun once you get the hang of it tones of hero selections every hero no matter how insignifigant can make a difference cons: hard to learn 8/10",1
"i play this game so much that its making me distant to my girlfriend, she hates this game, its taking me away. now we only talk when dota 2 is down, which is never :d this game never goes down. help. please.",1
"wanna play this well say goodbye to reality, you will never leave the computer. its free so why not play this awsome game. goodbye gotta play some more",2
"dota 2 is a moba that stays true to the original used map settings game from world craft 3, but with a lot more polish. this game is very well produced with content that is constantly updating to keep the players entertained. no other moba game is worth your time.",2
"very good, absolutely perfect games, the real games who need teamwork, so?? dont miss it, grab ur friend and play with them together!!",3
"this is a great game, nice to play.. many player play this game.. good job dota2",2
"i great game, that makes you play on groups and incentive coopeartion beetween pals",4
"a 6 or 7 line review just wont do this game justice. dota 2s learning curve is pretty steep but once you learn the basics, which can take 5 to 15 matches, its rewarding experience thats all about teamwork and playing your role correctly. dota 2s social features are cutting edge and designed for great casual, hardcore and competitive play. the controls are tight and responsive while dedicated servers on multiple locations allow for almost no noticeable latency. its free to play but people wont use their wallets for tactical advantage because all items are purely cosmetic. really impressive game and my personal game of the year 2013.",2
"best game over here in steam.. cool strategy game... and the best thing its still on updating,, widh to see a lot of more cool stufs in this game.",3
"i recommende this game for players like me who feeds everyday and calls teamates noob for blaming me gahahahahaa...",3
"best game eva. neeed more game like this from valve xd",2
"nice game for gamers. nice graphics and overall quality= great",1
"fun game, really enjoy it and the visual upgrades over original. have some issues with osx performance, but no issues at all, would really recommend.",1
"it is an amazing game but there are two very negative points about it. one of them, and the most prominant one, is the lack of optimization for the mac version. the mac version, simply put, sucks. it does not do justice that this version is so incredibly buggy on the osx operating system. plus, when moving the camera on the top part of the display when in full screen on osx, the game glitches as it is invoking the status bar.",1
"its dota 2, what youll be expierencing: noob  feeder usuck iprodota nowards",3
"it is like stepping on a nail, getting tetanus, dying, having a robot ai berate you, respawing again and instantly getting killed becuase you didnt have the right item or hero... or intellect to prevent the death. so basically league with more mechanics.",1
"awesomeeeee , wohooo. though there is still non offline thing to play lan",2
"its amazing you should at least try it i garenty youll love it",2
"its good game. a good game with a great graphics. and is free to play",2
"it is . rip in peace tf2. i love you forever tf2 dont play because tf2 is better",1
"dota 2... well this is a brilliant game and mmp with low needs fors  computers. its hard to fully understand the game and figure iout key tricks to dota 2 characters but if you hate stategy this game is not for you and it takes a while to be a good dota player as you can see from my playing time im quite good and still finding new characters",2
"kinda good game but if you are not playing in the us servers then you will have mostly worse games, well... depending on your matchmaking level some community members dont know how to select languages that they accually speak, for example: i only choose english language, then some russian people choose russian language+english language> accept game> start arguing with people that say: please dont matchmake in english language if you cant accually speak english. valve should fix this by making some language quiz that you have to do before you can even start queueing anyways, i love this game, cheers!",2
"i honestly didnt think id like this game, but its so good that you should at least give it a try. and even if you suck at first (and you will) keep playing cause its so fun.",5
"dota 2 is most importantly a free game, so the only thing you lose by trying it is time and some bandwidth. dota 2 not only is a game, but is the best language learning tool. i learned fluent russian, portugese, and spanish in only a few games! its better and cheaper than rosetta stone, and uses fun games to teach! i reccomend this to everyone. edit: its dangerous to go alone, take this.",1
"i dont really like these kind of games mostly because i suck at them. i think if i were better at it i might like it. ive been told its alot like league of legends so if you like that youll probably like this. rating: 4/10",1
"avoid this game at all costs holy  its the biggest timesink in the world you will lose your life to it; and not even in a good way, in a wow way, like that episode of south park where they all get fat and sit in their basement playing wow. except with dota. the game plays you man, the game plays you.",3
"a nice a very interesting game. hope that there are more new updates in this game. like it a lot.",1
"help me!!! i was playing but then suddenly it froze then it shuts down when i try to sign in to steam again all my game files are gone and it says i need to install it again pls help me.",3
"the best moba of all time. the history behind this game is, well, insane. icefrog, the mysterious legend. league of legends sprouting basically from the first version. the teams in the esports scene. dota 2 lounge, for commited betters of esports dota 2 teams. trading cards. enjoying the hours upon hours spent with friends met just dominating every match that you can. the thrill of playing new heroes and somehow feeling as if the same map is always filled with new challenges. this is a game that you just cant debate about. this is probably the best game i have played besides counter strike. another winner for valve.",5
"i really like playing dota 2 because of meeting nice players but sometimes have harsh players/trashtalkers",1
"nice. i wud give 4.9/5 to this game. really really awesome if you compare it to dota / warcraft iii :d",2
"dont ever play this game. quit dota, ya nub skrub!",1
"kinda reminds me of league of legends. it is different from league of legends though. for example, there are many more classes / heroes to pick in this game and less waiting time too (or am i just lucky?)",1
"amazing game ever..long lasting and always be fun..",2
"dota 2 is cool, a game with a strategic mode it helps you to be strategized and think more about the game. a game that is always logic there no is no bad in this game this is game is more cooler because it is not just popular but this is the game which you can understand all the strategic and logical works of your life.",2
"dota 2 is a very good game. dota 2 is the best of all games i ever played.",1
"great game one of the best game ever thumbs-up and adddictive",2
"very nice adaptation of dota from warcraft, more heroes to be added soon please :)",2
"beware of russians. dont underestimate the power of ancient apparition. if you see 5 people approaching with chilling touch, run.",2
"ive spent over 9000 hours on the original dota, and even though dota 2 is very similar and extremely fun to play, the lack of heros is a turn off for me. not only that, but the game is highly addictive and can pretty much ruin your life if you cant controll your will to play this 24x7x365.",1
"this game is not just a game, this game can be the way of life",1
"its simple a great game, once you learn to play you will not stop ;d",4
"played the original dota for wc3 and then got into dota 2 since the beta, wicked game and endless paths of exploration into the many different heroes and item builds.",1
"a dynamic system to entertain the mind, train your brain/memory, enjoy great pvp and develop leadership, teamwork, foresight, calculation and prediction skills. a varied cast of characters each with their own skill set and a wide range of items to help with customization of the way you want to play. an interesting community ranging from great, co-operative players and impressive enemies, to the lowest gamer quality which require you to develop patience and restraint. if you consider picking this game up, remember, there is a high learning curve, therefore you must be prepared to fall and rise again in the never-ending battle between the dire and the radiant. good luck, have fun",2
"if you like the moba genre, youll love this game. just remember kids, play with friends, or else it sucks.",1
"almost perfect until theyve launched all of the heroes 9/10 graphics 9/10 audio 9/10 gameplay 10/10 sheeps, frogs, flying chickens 11/10  and a hundred percent chance of ruining your life, and abs :v",1
"started getting into mobas and its a very fun game to check out",1
"nice game, but the matchmaking is pretty bad like most games of this type. still i enjoy playing it.",1
"i started to play dota 2 few months back. i couldnt play any other games! its so addictive!",1
"addictive game that can be play with groups of friends.",4
"i have played the first dota for wc3 back in the day and love the way it has grown. the visual upgrades to the small changes in enviroment and the consistant rate at which the game is updated and talked about really makes me feel great, loving the game myself and wanting nothing more than this upward growth.",1
"really really great game, but please please dont even bother to come if u dont have time & effort to put on thsi game. think about this game like a school class. u need to learn every aspect of it and it will take time to learn only the basics so please be aware of that. there will be rage moments now and there, because u will usually get matched with people under ur skil level, fortunatly, thats the only downside this game has.",3
"if you like wc3 dota you would like this too. its a bit different but youll learn it fast. :)",1
"honestly there is a massive learning curve for the new players, but valve is constantly adding features to make the game and its concepts as accessible to the public as possible. the fact that it is free leaves it all up to the player to decide whether the game is for them; nothing is stopping you from trying it out. but for those who are already into this genre of gaming, im not going to sugarcoat our community, there are positives and negatives to every aspect of social interaction in this game. you prefer what you prefer, but the game is stellar for me.",3
"nice moba game you have to put alot of thoughts to it and the most important is your team you will also be building up your skills to teamwork i really reccomend this game if you want to play start playing with bots or get some help from someone who is playing it, else you can be called noob and all sorts of bad stuff just cause you are new and someone might also say go delete dota, dont do that, just play with some friends and have a good time playing it :d good luck see you in the dota 2 community",3
"i was voted most valuable player in matchmaking by a european who left the game 10 minutes in with no punishment. feed, trash talk your teammates while alive, dying, dead, and respawning. be a bigger gangster than pretty boy floyd with zero consequences! 10/10",1
"spoiler alert!!! addictive game that will steal your soul!!! proceed with caution!!!",2
"better than lol-- lol is just like the worst. there is no kawaii desu~~in lol. just . tons of . large and bouncy, in every woman. and in every picture. boobs. i mean,  are alright, but the gameplay is  as hell. but there are . just sayin...",1
"dota 2 is very fun and free, i give you the positive & negative positive - its very fun, you have a wide selection of characters, tons of items & weapons, the combinations to create a weapon or item is outstanding, it has pratice matches, you also gain battle points after you win, it makes you think and addicting.... negative - there is only 1 stage you can play, you are forced to play online with ungrateful people, and you have to pay for items & weapons with your real money when you are at the menu screen...... would i recommend this game, yes",1
"its very simple you see. you download this game immediately, and try it out! it has endless hours of enjoyment and even holds many intriguing elements ranging from inner techniques, diologue and even a very wide range of heroes that will almost gurantee a proper fit for each player that dwells in this amazing experience. its very unique and very competitive, making the skill cap and challenge of the game endless. download immediately.",5
"really good game, i could never get into it but i can see the apeal and the updates are amazing, a well looked after game !",1
"moba cant get any better than this! play it, youre missing on lifes greatest moments if you dont xd",2

"get it... you might learn some russian while playing :)",3
"i love this game..it free and can play with other people..",1
"nice game. i love the graphics, sistem. it have big diffrent from dota",2
"i love this game. but please fix the rank match making. a lot of noobies though.",2
"dota 2 is brought to us at a time when the dominating moba (league of legends) thrives and beats it in numbers of users etc. but dota 2 brings variety to the table as it is a very pretty game with different mechanics and gameplay, if you do play league of legends this is probably the next best thing and shouldnt be left in the shadow, when released the game will be played maybe not as much a league of legends but there is definatley a strong community which willl show on release. i am happy to be part of the beta as it refreshing to play but a can be hard to master!",1
"one of the best game ive ever played... ull never get bored of playing even though its the same map every time, ull get different taste in every single match~",3
"no matter how many times i quit this game, i always come back. playing since dota 1. almost 8 years. hard to learn, but still the best game ever.",5
"very awesome game. addicting and you cant get enough.",5
"dota 2 is difficult at most but it is also a fun filled action. totally recommended! :)",1
"oh my god guys . best game ever . better play this  :))))",1
"i recommend this game 100%. the best of all steam.",2
"best game ive ever played, you get hooked and dont want to quit, a bit of advise dont give up even if you lose the game, it only gets better. as you can see hours of gameplay and still going strong :d just dont feel intimadated by others yes the first few games you might lose and think to yourself why am i playing when i always lose. but the table will turn and when you start winning or have epic battles and your heart is pounding wether you are gunna win or not, thats when you realise that you love his game, truely awesome game. warning!!! highly addictive. have food and drink to hand and make sure you dont forget about people around you ( which you probably will ) :d",4
"i strongly recommend this game. its freaking awesome. and ofcourse its free. you will not regret by playing this game.",4
"hard to learn, but worth every second youre playing it. free 2 play has never catched you for such a long time.",5
"this game is the greatest thing since sliced bread!",1
"this game is the game of my life. this game is the best of the best.",4
"dota 2 is the best online game i have ever played. i will recommand it to my friends.",1
"endless hours of fun with quite a learning curve in the beginning, luckily bots are available for new players",2
"pinnacle of moba masterpiece. the king of all mobas",3
"really fun u should get it so we can play together!!",1
"dota 2 has awesome graphics and the gameplay is amazing. highly recommended this game. great job valve.",1
"well its a good mmorpg game. best thing is heroes dont get nerf every now and then. nice graphics and inventory items. ty blizzard for making this game.",2
"best game for non-casuals. deep gameplay. good graphics. 10/10 best solo player game.",2
"this game is very time consuming but worth the time in every way. a great moba game for moba lovers.",2
"recommended game, already played since ti1 till now",1
"pros: awesome game. you never get bored of it. cons: it takes time to learn.",1
"700+ hours logged. game is really hard, some pople are jerks, etc but the game is so rewarding.",2
"this gameis very awesome.. you can make money from this game by selling ur inventory items and trading",3
"all you can say about dota is that its genius game. it was, it is and it will always be the most balanced and interesting game in the world. it has all things that dota allstars lacked. no need to say more, just try it. and the core of your life gonna be put there.",2
"highly addictive moba based off warcraft 3 and massively updated by valve. the game play is very well tuned with balance updates pretty regularly. the patches are worth looking forward and the free-to-play model is brilliant. that said, this game has one of the worst gaming communities i have ever been a part of. utterly shocking behaviour almost every game by at least one player. this game painfully needs a ban list to avoid being with these people more than once. bring friends for the best experience.",3
"so far best moba game ive played, hardcore and not very newbie friendly",3
"for me it is like a daily routine to play and compete against players across the world. not just we share our views but also our intellects collide on the same battlefield to determine the wave of glory for teams playing each round. sometimes we win but we loose which really makes to see deep in our hearts where we need the fear to be controlled and our reflexes on time through the game any time any place. at last it made us a way better than we happen to be in our previous game. understanding and reasoning the events of game is the most key factor if u really need to make best out of your effort. this game really changed us more than just one way.",5
"not just a game for fun. but this game need teamwork, inovation, great instict and creativity",4
"worlds best game ever :* :* my fav game dota2 :) i recommend my friends to play dota2 leave all other games this game never ever make you bor",3

"has a giant learning curve which can be softened by watching professional games. very fun with friends and 100% free to play. the only downside is losing a lot of time to it",3
"10/10. created by gaben. has gandalf. animal friendly: contains bats, dragons, horses, bears. no co2 emission. this game has been approved by me.",1
"best game i played in a long time! and its for free!!",2
"stop reading this summary, ya fool! play some dota 2 kid!",2
"hard to get yous to at first but laer becomes a very funny and addicting game",2
"dota 2 is a very complex game, so if you want to play it you have to invest a lot of time, but dont give up. my experice with this game is pretty long (since warcraft 3 tft) and i think if you want to play a game like this play dota 2 and not lol (little sister of dota) or similar games. one big disadvantage of the game is that its super hard to learn how to play. but i play this game often and i like how icefrog maked a very very good sequel what he created as a funmap of warcraft 3 so if you want a game that require skill, team play and a good overview its the best game on the market.",3
"this game destroyed my hope in humanity!!! must play!!!",1
"this game is totally awesome! no doubt. the only problem is because of its too awesomeness, unexpected number of new bloods come into this games which makes the game a bit laggy occassionally, nevertheless, they can come up with a solution. kudos volvo and your partners in making this game. not to mention the dota 1 in blizzard ^^.",3
"dota 2 is very much better than legend of league in many ways. it was able to host tournament, associated with steam, friends, etc. its just that its an unique game or even more special. it give me more efforts to continue playing because its too fun. able to practice with bots for private even able to invite your friends to practice with bots. have a team to create like guild or clan. have different rules for the game or to create game. always meet different players with different personality that might be interesting to know what different human made of. build teamwork, communicate, and stuff like that. oh and it have so many characters to use and it have different items for character like skins or others. background changes. hud skins. everything it have. ever if you need something, its always there (; play dota 2!",2
"dotta 2 is the game for youi if you are one of thos egamer poeples that gplay games lilke loeagy legends its a fukn fun y game ereallyl and if you ev er play te game slike super mario bros and ddid thet super mariuo bross jump then you might be fit for thsi exrtewme gameing experuience. mario btioher iouyt",1

"probably one of the best skill-focused team-based games around. youve got nothing to lose besides your sanity and self-respect.",1
"instantly become a multilinguist--learn chinese, russian, and portuguese with the help of this game.",2
"one of the few games you can simultaneously love and hate. probably one of the most satisfying and infuriating games of all time",3
"dota 2 is a competitive fun moba that has a steep learning curve but rewards the player for getting better. i highly reconmend it.",3
"dota 2 has a bit of a learning curve but is lots of fun to enjoy with friends. its free, give it a try!",1
"fun times. no matchmaking currently so most games are usually one sided. if youre new, do the training, play against bots, and read some guides before jumping in.",3
"awesome game, easy to pick up and lots of fun , having a whale of a time getting used to it",1
"delete it as soon as you can for your own good, if you have a glimpse of whats going on there",1
"dota 2 is a great game. it is the happy ground where basketball meets chess.",1
"game is prone to cause headaches and cause severe anger and frustration many non-english speaking russians and tacos mingle within the english speaking community and make communication hard game focuses on team-play and 9/10 in pub games you will almost always find someone who may only communicate with beeps, boops and a bell. 11/9 i would play this game more if there were less non-english speakers",3
"nice game, easy gameplay, and low spec computer can play it..",2
"im ernie dingo. you might know me from channel 7s getaway. play dota 2. trust me, im aboriginal.",1
"i really like the game, but i couldnt find the stupid cake.",3
"awesome game if you have awesome friends to play with.",5
"just started playing this game, must say this is addictive. i have already been trying to get friends to play it too!",1
"make sure to put english as your wanted language and go on eu west to meet the most classy russian people in the world ; serious note one of the best games ive ever played and the only i feel compelled to make sure i play",2
"this game will break you, one match at a time. 10/10",2
"great game for those who like to play moba genre. recommended to all.",1
"a game you play to experience to joys of multiculturalism and spectate the behaviors of people from developing third world countries.",4
"very good free to play game. it has a very high learning curve so be prepared to spend many hours being beaten before you start beating",3
"amazing moba, fun with friends, great time, and a rage fest.",2
"1,587 hours on record for a reason. this game is more competitive and less childish than my previous game and train wreck of a dota-like accectable choice league of legends. yes the dota 2 community is rough but that is how it has been since dota on wc3. harder than usual to walk into and get going at first because of the vast knowledge of the game but replays can easily fix that in a day. overall great game and once again,  league of legends.",4
"its fun, really addictive, strategic, tho the first two missions are annoying the games great",1
"awesome game for the people with good reaction and nice attitude.",5
"its awesome you all should try this. its worse than drugs, it destroys your life 1 game at a time.",4
"play this to get endless rage and sleepless nights",2
"dota is a competitive game of action and strategy, played both professionally and casually by millions of passionate fans worldwide. players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes, forming two teams of five",3
"this is the ultimate moba happenning right now. with ti3 out the way who knows what theyll add next? techies? i hope its techies. my personal wants for heroes aside. this game takes moba and kicks it up the , becoming more and more amazing with every update. the difficulty curve can be perpindicular at times but the friendly community is always happy to help you out in your quest to be the best! just watch out for the russians, peace",3
"great game. already spent over 700 hours playing it. worth it. (its for free!) :p",4
"its free, its cool, its fun, enjoy it. heard its good.         valvethank u",3
"a game i genuinely cant quit. ignoring the great gameplay and visuals aside, this is one of my favorite e-sports to follow.",1
"love this game, great upgrade from the original. they are building on it instead of changing, i believe valve has gone in the right direction to keep old players here and also bring new ones in. also thumbs up on it being free.",1
"well its a nice game remember old times at warcraft iii this is a very nice game with a great community players",4
"this game is released with the russian rage virus, aside from that best game ever, 100% guaranteed to destroy your social life, would not recommend.",2

"decent game with lots of potential, but also lots of room for improvement.",1
"this is the most amazing game i ever played! dota2 rocks m/",2
"addictive, but certainly not for those who dont know how to work with others. communication is key, as well as being able to shrug off a loss and carry on.",5
"the latest effort in making a full-fledged game out of a warcraft iii mod. dota 2 places you and up to 9 other people in an arena like environment where a never ending war between good and evil is taking place. after choosing around 100 heroes (with more coming) and dozens upon dozens of items to help give your hero the edge, the game does not stop giving you something to strive for, whether it be mastering the latest hero release, or finding the perfect build for your role of choice. install as soon as humanly possible.",3
"great free to play model. one of the best dota clones out there.",2
"extraordinary continuous improvement of the original dota. beautiful graphics, very fluid play and best of all, noob friendly. anyone can pickup the game and learn the basics, the item formulas and dig in with more seasoned players to keep learning. this game is an endles variaty of possibilities. even though there is just one map, the hero / item combinations are ludicrously flexible and variad to have a very different experience each time you play. oh, and the best part of this game, is with no doubt all the focus on teamplay and cooperation, game finder and team building tools (even with live coaching!) this is freakin awesom!",1
"great game sometimes only ruined by the volatile community that is moba games. at least valve tries to correct that with reporting players and commendations.",2

"when i started this game i hated it, but then tryed it again a while after, and i got used to it it is a very fun game and i really recommend it to players who like strategy games. i give it a 10/10",1
"with the amount of fans of the original dota (defense of the ancients) i can say you will have around 1-2 mins of waiting time which is not as bad as the csgo waiting time which takes close to 20-25 mins.dota is a moba (multiplayer online battle arena) its a mixed of rts but you only use 1 hero.if you are a fan of fast paced strategic rts-like gameplay then i would highly recommend this game.if you are really want to start of this game i would suggest learning the curves by playing with bots before playing online with other players.the community for the game is around the level of being really good to being really bad,meaning some people are just really big s while there are also really awesome players to play with..i would also suggest playing with some friends and play in a party..its alot better..i hope you guys the best :) i would give this game a thumbs up!",3
"what can i say... dota ..not only dota2.. its a strategy game after all. its not limited to using a skill on one or two..or five enemy heroes.. but to know when and how to use it.. plus, the items suggestion are not always applicable. each item has its role..and against different enemy. overall, the game is for those with a little imagination. as for the graphics.. pretty much outstanding.. always getting improved.",5

"this game is ing garbage, there is a reason it is being sold for 2 cents on the steam community market, the gameplay is bugged to , the graphics are total garbage, the community is worse then ing cod. while i played i could here two ing ers on the mic having anal sex in monkey talk and i couldnt mute them because this  game wouldnt allow it. league of legends is so much better. dota 2 devs, get on riots level",1
"the shop can be a bit confusing but in time i am sure that all will have a greter understanding",1
"2 teams of 5 players battle it out to destroy the other teams towers and base. choose from a massive array of characters each with its own unique abilities. great game, addictive, difficult to master but well worth the effort. free to play makes it a game everyone should try.",5
"its a growing sport that can only get bigger and bigger.",4
"this game is intensely fun. everyone should play this!",1
"this game is free. not even  you. no runes, no grind, no . yes, game is hard. but dota 2 was built for both the casual and the hardcore player. also, you can watch other peoples games, which has 10 times the quality of twitch, but still sucks because it lacks the power of twitch chat. kappa there are only three rules. 1. do not die 2. song name is always darude -sandstorm 3. there is no third rule. download it.",2

"dota 2 a game where a total of 10 players, divided into groups of 5 play and try to outwit or outplay the opposing team. communication is a must, rather than individual and technical skill in higher play. practice makes perfect in this game. also has good traders in the market",2
"i like this game but i need free money on my wallet :p",1
"dota2 is a very good game,recommended for you who like game with rts,moba genre !",2

"easily one of the best mobas on the market if not the best. steep learning curve, demanding mechanics and complex strategies makes this game hard to master, but when and if you so happen to get better it evolves into a real competitive experience that you will just love.",1
"the most popular game on steam. way better than the competition.",1
"i have to say that... i rather play pokemon any day of the year.",1
"dota 2 is a game that is made due to the amount of  flooding league of legends. it is an autistic turn based game where the main goal is to run out of cards fastest. there are many champs or as dota 2 likes to call them heroes. other than the fact that it is pay to win it is run on the half-life engine which is really amazing seems though the game developers were monkeys. there are some side quests you can do like stealing children and selling drugs my main hero is a ork warrior i am lvl 69. do i reccomend this game you may ask well it depends whether or not you want hiv/aids",1
"dota 2 - a game of strategic chess like moves, an all encompassing battle for momentum between two teams. whos ancient will be left standing?",2
"one of the best moba, advanced mechacics, every game is different from the previous game, all heroes are free.",4
"i like this game `cause it make mmo more competitive and challenging between the players. the diversity of heroes and their abilities (in addition to the players) influences absolutely everything and will never be a game like another.",4
"game has turned to crap, needs work to make it better but valve dont seem to listen, there low prority  needs the axe, people with internet issues or so forth get punished for impatient people not waiting on reconnect, no surrender option so need to wait whole length of game for the same result while you wait for s to destroy everything long after you have already claimed gg and asked them to finish quick, random draft picking need altering, radiant pick 1st, then 2 picks dire then need to go 1 pick, 1 pick to make it more even otherwise you have it pick onesided still, some characters are still way to overpowered, i could keep going on but its just making me hate this game even more",3
"start playing today, a game were you spend most of your time saying, what the ing hell? but thats not all, start from now on to understand what real racism means, not only will you hate the russians, but soon youll hate yourself too? why? because when you play it, youll realise. oh you think thats it? no there is more. this game will not only make you hate everyone else in the world, but it will also make you - anti social - actually racist - rage (more often) - be a gigantic  fag. in other words, this game is f**king awesome. but thats not all just to dota, because in the end, it all concludes to one point. welcome to dota, now gtfo.",2
"this game is more fun than a busload of cheerleaders.",4
"dota 2 is hard, but theres a huge reward for those who commit. on the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) defense of the ancients modification for warcraft iii, now transferred into valves source engine. the games punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but its worth sticking the hours in: success in dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.",3
"dota is an addictive game. cant stop play it. someone stop me plz.",4
"ing game..always got scold..but fun is achieved with friends",3
"this game has augmented my view of the human race. what i mean to say by that is i didnt ask for this. ... jk lol. what i really mean to say is ! !  !   !",2
"if your willing to learn and go in knowing your going to have to take the time to get better due to its steep learning curve dota 2 i an amazingly satisfying and addictive game guarranteed to have you comming back for more. i would recomend going in with a mentor but if not the game has modes implemented into it to help newer players get to gerips with the game., also with the ability to create bot and games only for you and freinds you should have no trouble learning the game. with a large variety of heroes to pick from all available as soon as you enter the game there is thousands of hours of gameplay waiting for you in what is the most fair ree to play model in a gae ever purchasing only items for heroes for bragging rights and no stat benefit their is no reason for anyone that owns steam to not pick up and try dota 2 for themselves.",4
"pretty good moba in my opinion. free to play, which is good because otherwise i probably would not have gotten into the realm of mobas in the first place. the learning curve can be pretty daunting at first, so i would recommend that you get a friend to help you learn the basics. 9/10 pros: solid multiplayer, large character selection, fun rpg elements, gameplay never gets boring cons: steeper learning curve, will need to learn jargon",1
"its very entertaining.....keep going on dota2....",3
"learned to speak russian and piss everyone in my team off pretending to be russian=lifetime of low priority",2

"definitely recommended. ive spent countless hours lost in the pixels of the dota world, moving along 3 lanes, through lush jungles, a long river and the pit of big , humongous and sweet-deprived keeper of the aegis. its great to play with friends and to rib each other constantly, but also extremely rewarding playing with random strangers in pubs. your own individual skill, micro prowess and language prose come second to your abilities to communicate effectively with teammates and also co-operation as well as co-ordination. game and map awareness comes after many a pub-thrashing received, but it all adds up to the experience garnered. also, you get to learn many languages of the world by its most basic form, and the form i truly feel is the right way to go about learning a language, curse words and the way they laugh. always a good time =d",2
"i like dota 2 i am lagging a little but it is a interesting game and i recommend it to you.stop read this and go play dota2 ;)",1
"cool game, free to play and dont even have to spend money to compete",1
"this game is very addicting to play. if you have friends who play this, then the game can be even more entertaining. if you dont like playing against other people then go to a private bot match and play against bots and you can even increase the difficulty to make it harder. i recommend this game to everybody man. such a great game.",2
"amazingly immersive and complex rts moba. play at your own risk: this game will devour your soul.",5
"highly addictive, like an unhealthy drug. will destroy lives.",2

"sweet game. i really like it a lot. its almost like a religion to me. you mad bro?",2
"if youre a fan of mobas or are just looking for a new style of game you should check this game out. its similar to league of legends (but please dont try to compare the two on chats because it causes arguments). i play this a lot and i quite enjoy it. i feel its a little better with friends, but you can play it alone just fine, find a match and choose your hero and wreck some riki s.",1
"im a 2 years old league of legends player and i have to admit that dota 2 is have something better than lol. it is a great game without imbalanced, no heroes are too strong or too weak, and it is fun too play, even though the open chest keys is kind of frustrating sometime.",2

"this game is probaly one of the best games iv ever played its very worth for free to play and there is no pay to win, i give this game a 10 out of 10 this game is very fun but at times can make u rage",2
"absolutely amazing game. its a hard game to get familiar to, but once you know a bit of the basics, its great to play. i recommend playing it with friends in a 5stack for the best experience.",3
"awsome game. best to play with friends. -> strategic play it !",1
"its just a nice game and always there is somthing new so ppl can never get boring from this game!",1
"lots of addicting fun! game is simple to be decent, difficult to master! dont throw away this game if you struggle at first, there is a steep learning curve and given the price, you cant beat the value in this game.",1

"447 hours into dota, couldve been spent knitting, 10/10",3
"icefrog and valves brainchild, a mix of the classic dota-allstars map we all know and love backed by valves awesome source engine. this game will get you hooked in a couple of sessions, where each game is intensely packed with strategy and action. i guarantee youll keep coming back for more! with its steep learning curve it will take you hours on end to fully grasp what the game is all about, and thats what makes it so addictive, but once you learn the tools of the trade its going to be worth it.",3

"dota 2...its like crack, except worse for your health and sanity.",2
"awesome game, very addictive though. say goodbye to your social life.",5
"this game is definately worth the price: free. the community is friendly and willing to teach if youre new to the genre. if youve played any rts game in the past ten years, youll be able to figure this game out pretty easily. with around 100 heroes and counting, this game has a great deal of variety and will always be challenging. unlike many free to play games, this games micro-transaction model is aesthetic only. there are no huge powerups or big weapons or purchases of in-game currency that will give the payer an edge over others. this game is very much the antithesis of the pay-to-win model.",1
"awesome game, keeps you playing once you have got the mechanics and how the team game works.",4
"this is my first review,usually i dont write reviews but this game forced me to write one.this game is one of the best games i have ever played,with more then 70 heroes and almost 8 types of game modes this game is one of the best,even better then team fortress 2.the effects,the blood almost everything is their.game is better then i had expected it to be.the store is also great allowing players to buy sets and other things.huds are cool almost 20+ huds are there. recommended",1

"i am addicted to this game,just like how i was addicted to tf2 before,very.",3
"really entertaining game with tons of characters. you might run into your average player who was spoiled when growing up and whines when no one listen to his commands. you also have to get pass the noob insert player name here rants. good bit of players will speak russian, spanish, and portuguese. you might have a chance to understand them but in the end only having your face yelled at for misunderstanding an order from the auto-captain; which is the spoiled kid who you hate.",1
"one needs to be somewhat fond of moba games to really like dota 2, but if you do, this game is for you. now that its free it is just extra awesome. the graphics are great and the gameplay is awesome. no game is the same. a warning though: new players will be scolded for dying and the learning curve is pretty harsh. but once you understand the game pretty well it becomes one of the most awesome games youll ever play.",2

"amazing game. distracts me of troubles everywhere and anytime.",2
"excellent game. after playing the first (and best) dota, lol, hon and a few other mobas, i found this one to be the best. not only is it the incredible graphics, intense gameplay or the classic feel of old dota, but the online gameplay is incredible. the only problem i had with this game was the amount of updates and the fact that other countries choose to play where they will not be best, such as russians playing in the south african server, not that i am complaining, that is just my opinion. pros: - excellent gameplay - great graphics - classic feel - simple use - kept old dotas characters, gameplay and items cons: - not a great matchmaking system - 5-10minutes inbetween matches - too many updates - updates are too large all round: a great game which i have been addicted to for the past month.",1

"dota 2 is very much better than legend of league in many ways. it was able to host tournament, associated with steam, friends, etc. its just that its an unique game or even more special. it give me more efforts to continue playing because its too fun. able to practice with bots for private even able to invite your friends to practice with bots. have a team to create like guild or clan. have different rules for the game or to create game. always meet different players with different personality that might be interesting to know what different human made of. build teamwork, communicate, and stuff like that. oh and it have so many characters to use and it have different items for character like skins or others. background changes. hud skins. everything it have. ever if you need something, its always there (; play dota 2!",2

"this game needs more hats. until more are implemented i will stick with team fortress 2. the ultimate hat simulator.",1
"dota 2 has a really steep learning curve if you arent familiar with other tower defense style games, which is discouraging initially. however it becomes very addicting once youve learned the vast system of items and characters that give the game great depth and replay value. i highly recommend playing cooperatively with experienced friends as it is a very team oriented play scenario and it will help you find your niche. there are so many characters and ways to play each of them that there is somebody for every personality. one drawback is that there is only one map, which gets monotonous. it is a very well devised map, however! share",5

"this game is so great. needed the combination of strategy, teamworks, skills, and solo ability. its make the game so interesting. besides that the hero pool is so many and every heroes have different skills that we must understand and mastered before we use a hero. knowledge is important to play this game not only righ clicking the enemy but also using your intelegent for make enemys team down without cause losing the teammates.",1

"dota 2 is the most amazing game i ever played so guys just do play it also enjoy the game",1
"dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably wont suit you if youre looking to play casually. theres a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. but once you start to learn its secrets, theres a wild and exciting variety of play here thats unmatched, even by its peers. its a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. the fact that its completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isnt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. may the best team win.",2
"this is such an amazing game that i thought i should tell you (anyone who does not own this game) that you need it in your life! this game is a moba style game, with over a hundred heroes to choose from! now, why are you reading my review and not downloading dota 2 right now?!?!?!?!??",1

"have fun, dont get mad when your teammates make mistakes.",2
"dota 2 is a fun and energetic game. there is a diverse roster of heroes to choose from that each have there own unique abilities so youll never get bored. you can buy character sets, announcers, hud skins, couriers, and loading screens to customize the way you want your game to look. it is difficult when you are new to it, but youll eventually get the hang of it. i recommend this game to almost anyone in the steam community, and the good thing is....its free!!!",3
"addictive games, should be played for anyone who love strategic games",1
"dota 2 is simply the best game ever in the world. valve has done a really great job.",3
"dota 2 is a bad game and it sucks really. the players are mostly noob. dota 2 depends on the strength of heroes not on the skills of the ones who played it. even the matchamaking system is imbalanced. everytime i play dota 2 its like my team is 40% and the enemy is 60%. which is really imbalance. also dota 2 has a very bad impact based on item cosmetics. here in our poor country this became a huge issue. i hope they ban dota 2 in the philippines",1
"if you are new to mobas.... go to league of legends to get your foot in the waters, because this game is hardcore and complex. put in simple this is high risk/ high reward. fail 2 or three times, the match favors the other team. there will be frustrating moments, but after you past the learning curve, this game is very addicting. only watch the pro plays on youtube after you already get a feel of what dota is about, and you will be amazed at the things the pro players are able to pull off.",2
"do you want a divorce? because this is how you get a divorce.",1

"this game takes a lot of time to learn it, but is fun from day one.",2
"this game... , its almost like they invented this instead of timetravel. its insanly addictive, and time just flys by, but dam is it a good game. try not be daunted by going into it blind, there are pleanty of guids and build suggestions for new players to get the jist of the game, but there is always something new to learn , which isint a bad thing as it keeps the game fresh. oh and free? hell yes i recommend it",1

"it very awesome i like it a lot and also the features one of my best gamers",2

"if you want to play something casual and free. dont play this game. it will take your soul and give you a shell of who you were before you played. 10/10 would recommend.",3
"dota 2 is one of the most spectacular and intense games of all time.",3
"team fortress 2 hats crossed with mobas with a sprinkle of valve magic... this is why gaben sleeps on a bed of my money. and i regret nothing.",1
"great game and surprisingly addictive. takes a while to learn but can be a new and wonderful expireience with friends",3
"i never think dota come out from warcrafts map and become a great game. i personally like sand king because my birthday month is scorpion.",1
"blatant chinese rip-off of the all-time classic: league of legends. they added a bunch of homogay pixie mechanics to seem deep and to attract casuals who want to feel cool. they also copied a bunch of champions and ruined them completely. ashe is now blue or purple or something, malphite turned into a non-manly moeblob, and alistar became some gay midget ninja who is always ing invisible and wont leave me alone and keeps throwing pink smoke at me. holy  stop stabbing me. buuut, despite its flaws, its a decent game. ill stop being buttflustered once i can start carrying people like i can in the original superior game.",1
"wonderful game. great graphics and scenery overall. it has a unique type of strategy to it, and a great community (kill-stealing really doesnt matter because its a team game) unlike league of legends on the other hand. ugh. rate: 10/10 bananas hexoar.",1
"this game improved so much since it was released on the beta. there are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as dota 1. i know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in dota 2 and i think it will help new comers. i know some people who play lol might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. its like comparing cod and battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, i think bot of them are good) give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. try it out, its free and badass!",4
"this game is awesome! you will love this game once you tried it. feel the joy of playing this game and battle other players. this game will determine whose strategist and teamwork better. i love this game very much..",4
"great game, very strategic. i like that you can play bots, and they did a really good job with the a.i. on the bots. lots of custimization. a real free game but is worth buying.",1
"it is a very nice game but can you fix the match making because of some troling players :3",1
"ive wasted all my money on a free to play. 10/10 would bang.",3
"start playing today, a game were you spend most of your time saying, what the ing hell? but thats not all, start from now on to understand what real racism means, not only will you hate the russians, but soon youll hate yourself too? why? because when you play it, youll realise. oh you think thats it? no there is more. this game will not only make you hate everyone else in the world, but it will also make you - anti social - actually racist - rage (more often) - be a gigantic  fag. in other words, this game is f**king awesome. but thats not all just to dota, because in the end, it all concludes to one point. welcome to dota, now gtfo.",2
"this game is more fun than a busload of cheerleaders.",4
"dota 2 is hard, but theres a huge reward for those who commit. on the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) defense of the ancients modification for warcraft iii, now transferred into valves source engine. the games punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but its worth sticking the hours in: success in dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.",3
"dota is an addictive game. cant stop play it. someone stop me plz.",4
"ing game..always got scold..but fun is achieved with friends",3
"its very entertaining.....keep going on dota2....",3

"c y k a c y k a  s u k a >c y k a illuminati confirmed",3
"fun game, but has a huge learning curve. would advise to watch videos to learn the basics (see purges youtube channel). also, community can be toxic at times",2
"the real e-sports game. it makes you sweat, im not joking.",2
"an excellent sequal. it has the same fantastic gameplay mechanics as the first with some welcomed new features. whilst the same basic story line might not be so captivating second time round it packs some great new sub plots and some hilariouse new characters. there was never a dull moment. i would recomend portal 2 to anyone who enjoyed the the first portal aka everyone who has every played portal! thankyou valve for such an enthralling sequal.",1
"dont play this game unless youre okay with losing days of your life",2
"a good twist on a mmo mostly focused on strategy. this game is playable by a wide range of players due to its different playing style for each character. whether you are a supporter role for a team or the leader or the pusher. all of them offer unique gameplay styles. the objective though rather simple is rather hard to achieve in fact and can lead you to racking your brains to think of the best way to destroy the enemies base. this game forges camarderie among players as each player in the team have to work with each other and support each other with the different skillsets they each have. i strongly recommend you trying this game for a classic game twisted into something fresh and renewed, its worth a try and most certainly will find a playing style in there to suit you.",1

"do you smoke crack cocaine? have you ever considered smoking crack cocaine? do you enjoy long hours spent inside and alone? if any of these questions resonate with you, then perhaps dota2 is the game for you. the game has an extremely high skill cap and takes years to begin understanding the fundamental concepts and mechanics. the competitive play is intense and rewarding. if you plan on having any additonal hobbies, vocational activities, or love interests. please consider severing all ties before installing. you wil hurt the ones you love.",3
"just as expected, dota 2 is just like the original dota mod. would recommend 10/10",1

"this game is like league of legends a lot similar since theyre both moba games , its just a game where you should play both , lol and dota 2 and decide which is your type/style of game, for a starter i recomend league of legends , for a more experienced player i recommend dota 2 because it gives you items you can sell on steam market and get steam moneys (steam wallet cash) and its just harder",1

"im still dipping my toe in this game. after 45 hours of playing, i still feel like a noob. this game requires a lot of commitment, and the learning slope is deep! but once you get the basics, its completely worth it. the game is like chess with a team. the hero you choose has a few skills, and determines what you bring to the table. then, for the next 15-35 minutes, and you and your team working together to beat up the other team. play the tutorial. personally, i played it just to learn how to watch the live-steams!",1

"i would like to say some things to valve. you see valve you changed alot of things in dota 2 , and there are some cool things and bad things . the good things are;bounty rune,the new model for shadow fiend,and the fountains. now the bad thing is that you changed a s*** lot of things which are bad . for example;riki,bloodseeker,techies,the map,e.t.c. but the most bad thing you did wrong is changing the map! why? i will tell you why valve . now in dota 2 there are many ganking heroes in the game like; pudge with his hook, sand king with his ulti+blink dagger, e.t.c.... my best friend deleted dota 2 because of this , and according to my chart , many dota 2 gamers have deleted dota 2 for good. think about what i said valve. commend me , add me , and like this comment . this is za afro and i love you all! p.s valve theres one more thing i would like to say to you , i love you too (no homo guys) goodbye!",1

"dota 2 is by far the hardest to learn game i have ever played. however, it is one of the most fun. if youre new to dota, and you want to get better, you have three options: 1. practice bot games over and over using a ton of guides and such until you can consistantly beat unfair bots no problem. 2. play a ton of games with more experienced friends (this way is the most fun). make sure that theyre close friends, because they will teach you, but if you dont listen to them and keep dying or buying bad items or whatever, theyll hate playing with you. so listen to your teachers! 3. play games on your own and try your best, and end up being yelled at by four different people at the same time (9 if youre lucky). but if you get through the learning phase, this game becomes amazing. its an awesome strategic game to play with friends. youll win some and youll lose some, but its free and fun, so what the heck.",1

"i like dota 2 because i play for fun. and i appreciate other players.",5
"this game brings online game to a whole new level. a game within 30~60 sometimes it might be longer but still, it requires a lot of communicate, teamwork, skills. there will be top players that affect the team fight but most important of the game is to  the enemy team down to the hell",4
"excellent game, only ruined by the moments when i get teamed up with newbies/throwers/leavers. overall 9/10.",2
"this is a game that is relatively straight-forward play, but takes a long time to master. the community is , especially if your a n00b, but if u play well with others, or just play well in general, youll have a blast. also, you cant be stupid and play this game well. you need a sense of cause and effect, and a sense of strategy. i would suggest playing with bots for a while, then once youve got the hang of things, public matches is a good idea.",2
"this game has taught me so much things that ill never forget : 1- the only good russians are always on the enemy side. 2- that the whole dota community would defend ukraine against russia. 3- that brazilians dont only suck in football, but in dota2 too. 4- in low priority games, your whole team is always full of hard carries. 5- that excuse in which a feeder blames lag is overused. 6- oh 2 russians in my team ? gg wp every single time. good game, taught me how to swear in russian !",2

"very good, many servers worldwide, russians on every server. learn russian today and and have fun!",2
"if you want to play a moba game other then league of legends, then you should wait no longer. dota 2 is an excellent moba game with alot of exciting events. unlike league of legends you can play every hero in dota 2 without paying for it. you dont have to buy any hero. you can collect cosmetic items for your hero in dota 2. you are eligible to find items after you finished a game. you can find items like chests, couriers, hero gear/weapons and much more. there is also a ingame shop where you can buy cosmetic items, but this is optional.",3

"i started playing heroes of newerth and i enjoyed it very much! alot of my competitive friends left and went to play dota. i eventually ended up doing so too. i cant describe how happy i am with the move. dota 2 is by far the best of its kind. scratch league, scratch hon, scratch and of them other copy cat wannabes and make the switch today. updates all the time, new models all the time, the orginal frog who created this presents is in lead with valve. theres no reason not to switch. stop being a follower and become a leader!",3

"playing dota 2 is like being on a soccer team made up of monkeys. while youre playing against a team made up of 5 ronaldos.",3
"its one of the most tactial and addictive games ever.",4
"it is a great strategic game. rather than a relaxing game, it is a rather tense and exciting one. better than volleyball.",1
"dota is like chess except there is only 5 peices and you are one of them. it takes a very long time to really get good at the game, and you will probably get mad, and have people get mad at you because this game is multiplayer and that is what happens in multiplayer games.",4
"this game right, you got trees in it and all that and its just so much fun. theres a hero, i think hes called the spell creator, and he can do a create a spell! oooo oh oh and theres a hero called tiny but let me assure you, hes actually quite large :3",2
"i started play dota 2 because i wanted to try out a moba and at the time, i was a happy guy who loved pc games like hearthstone and sc2. i then started getting better and better playing with teamates that are complete trash report thhese fools wtf does cyk a mean stop feeding when i have some friends over for a drink they think i have problems why dota have to do this to me. i now speak russian and i communicate well with my peruvians brethren jajajajajaja 10/10 would cy ka",2
"its just amazing, thats really all there is to say. and if you really want proof, just look at all the players, globally. and dont even get me started on the level of competition in this gem of a ing free to play game, does a grand prize pool of a little over 2 million* mean anything to anyone? thanks a lot valve for making me feel guilty, i aint worthy to play this. oh and thanks blizzard! youll always be top tier. *and now with the international 4 the prize pool is over 9 million. go ing figure.",5
"this game was there for me when i needed to waste time and vent out. definitely worth wasting your life on.",1

"literally best moba 10/10 anno domini 2k are you even trying riot?",2
"i liked this game.. socialized, and make you think twice to not doing selfish :)",2
"behind the scenes the game plays out really well if you dont take into account the mad russians who are constantly acting as if they are the game itself, or the new players who dont know anything regarding how not to land into enemy hands. other than that mild seperation of fun and anguish, the game itself is fun and worthwhile to play and spend some quality time killing other people on a cyber world.",2
"dota 2 is like roulette, you can add a bullet for every russian teammate.",3
"this game can be super fun; however, it can also be the worst experience of a lifetime as well. i usually only play it if i have four other friends to queue with. that said, if you want to have a life, dont download this game. its so time consuming and will require you to devote so much time and effort. also, its way better than league of legends.",2
"great game but this is a game where there is serious lifers who get annoyed for something as simple as not following a build guide in a normal (unranked) game, so if u like tactical, fantasy based, pointnclick strategy games and at the same time making sad lifers mentaly rage, this is the game for u",1
"so challenging when there are no stupid players in game. but still, thumbs up!",3
"great tactical game, makes me think what item would suit my situation best.",1
"best game ever 100 000 000 peoples play that game :d",1

"l.o.l has nothing against this uprising in dota 2 not hating on league but dota has this feel mobas just wont be able to improve on or make similar to. i stopped playing this game recently but my interests to it have drwan me back. with the game becoming bigger and bigger its setting a new margain for the guys behind dota 2 but i feel what the community wants incorporated in the game willl be seen even though i feel the game is spot on for a moba( even though i havent played hero of the storms yet :p), but in other words nothing is better then f2p so go and try this game you will not regret it!",1

"worst fps game ive ever played. 11/10 fedora = 0 swag = 0 i recommend it over skyrim, but stickman rpg is still better.",2
"awesome game, but has a very huge learning curve. which means you have to play a lot of games just to learn the ropes. if you are looking for campaigns or binge campaign mode gaming, this game is not for you. if you are looking for fps games that end in 10 mins, this game is also not for you. if you are looking for 30 mins - 1 hour real time strategy game, this game is for you.",3
"love is like playing dota, easy to begin, hard to end. so when you fall in love, choose a hero that is willing to fight with you untill the end. x)",2
"personally, i really enjoy playing this game for the most part. aside from the constant foreign rage and everyone blaming each other for mistakes, this is a really fun team game. sure, it takes a long time to figure out what each hero does and what counters what, but once you get to that point it becomes a fantastic game to play with friends. it really shows how well you can adapt to certain situations or communicate with your team to be effective and win the game.",3
"a very tough game to master, yet with experience and sheer patience you will spend many an hour enjoying this game. the beauty lies with the how every new dota 2 game you undertake will be competely unique from the last.",1
"i like dota 2 because it so fun and my dislike is there so many trashtalk and newbee player",2

"i am addicted to this game,just like how i was addicted to tf2 before,very.",3
"really entertaining game with tons of characters. you might run into your average player who was spoiled when growing up and whines when no one listen to his commands. you also have to get pass the noob insert player name here rants. good bit of players will speak russian, spanish, and portuguese. you might have a chance to understand them but in the end only having your face yelled at for misunderstanding an order from the auto-captain; which is the spoiled kid who you hate.",1
"one needs to be somewhat fond of moba games to really like dota 2, but if you do, this game is for you. now that its free it is just extra awesome. the graphics are great and the gameplay is awesome. no game is the same. a warning though: new players will be scolded for dying and the learning curve is pretty harsh. but once you understand the game pretty well it becomes one of the most awesome games youll ever play.",2

"play it, play it now! 6.80 will blow!!!! best game since wow, nothing got me hooked so much...",1
"dota 2 is a game about social criticism. there are many different valuable classes needed to survive the coming battles, but of course, everyone is tempted to just opt for the top 1%. if there is indeed a working class, it will nearly starve, barely able to afford even basic necessities like boots, in order to sustain the greed of the upper class. there is, of course, a middle class, which is basically just failing to keep up with the upper class while scared  to end up like the lower class. all of this is happening in the vanguard of a great big war that is allegedly happening because the two factions like different tree colors, but its really to make more money to buy more stuff that allows you to wage more war to make more money. the emulated class system is supported by severe language barriers and the game does a good job of making you hate even your closest friends, eventually. 10/10.",4

"amazing! best game ever next to elder scrolls! get it now!",3
"save yourself while you still have a life. run for it.",2
"this game is play much by myself, but i feel it lacks in abillites and champion roles in the sense that it really doesnt have much varity in how you build your champ/hero as a build can work in just about every situtation. this my seem like a major nark on the game, but id say its rather good besides that one part. it has good graphics and a fairly good champ/hero pool. i would say try this out if youre content on not play lol and games like this, but if youre open to the moba lifestyle try lol first honestly. 3.5 out of 5 stars for gameplay. 4.5 out of 5 stars for pc controls",1

"this game has given me sleepless nights. i tend to play a hero and learn about its skills and practice on how to master the appropriate strategy. sometimes i fail because i let my guard down but it is still part of the game. the online concept of dota 2 is better since i get a chance to play with everybody. the all hero challenge is the best feature i think since i have to play all characters to complete the cycle. please fix all bugs on this challenge so we may be able to proceed and enjoy the game.",1
"i have more than 500+ hours of playing in my previous account and now i current have 100+ hours playing in this account. definitely a great game. the community is one of the best, if not the best. :)",1

"been a long standing dota 1 player from past 8 years and i must say valve did amazing job in making the dota 2,the transition for dota 1 players to dota 2 isnt that hard and dota 2 just got better without losing any amazing elements of the original dota kudos valve.",5

"the best moba just got a better sequel. recommended for everyone who has ever tried and liked mobas.",2

"outstanding game that addicting its player. like my own brand of heroin.",2
"normally i would reccomend this game as i have played it for a long time. however it is now simply unplayable. screen constantly freezes and crashes even when using a high end pc and updated drivers. i have researched how to fix this problem and i have literally tried everything and nothing helps. a lot of people experience this problem online and the valve tech support is nonexistent and useless. for more than a year i tried to give this game a chance as i used to love playing it, but with lack of consideration towards a great number players including myself i feel it is a waste of money and time until it is fixed. here is a link to my thread and another related to this issue on the developer page. please valve pay attention to your players and actually fix your product.",1
"7/10 - game and community are great. if you are a newbie, play against bots. commmunity isnt noob friendly :( it became a huge turn off for me. the learning curve, compared to lol, is steep and youll be spending a lot of time learning the many champions in the game as well as game dynamics. give it a shot, you may end up enjoying it!",1
"me i never knew there were these many russians in the world.",1
"this game is fantastic, i mean i play this game almost everyday i have had this game for a month and already have 274 hours in it. and my friends have even more. i liked how this isnt a pay to win game, you can get items to make your person look better or cooler. but the items dont have any benifet so everyone can play the same people at anytime, and dota 2 is a fair fight. in short i love dota 2",1
"amazing rts, but needs character customization really badly, though new single or double lane maps would be kewl too.",1
"this is the best game made in some time. it will take you a lot of time to get good, and its difficult, but damnit, is it good.",4

"wanna play this well say goodbye to reality, you will never leave the computer. its free so why not play this awsome game. goodbye gotta play some more",2
"dota 2 is a moba that stays true to the original used map settings game from world craft 3, but with a lot more polish. this game is very well produced with content that is constantly updating to keep the players entertained. no other moba game is worth your time.",2
"the most addictive game ive ever played in my life. the infinite possibilities of every single game, depending on very minute decisions juxtaposes it so much to our real lives. although the learning curve is too steep, once you give about a week for it, the mechanisms in the game are clear to you. definitely recommended.",4
"dota 2: murder an ancient dragon who was just chillin in his lair, and steal his cheese! kill russians on every server, from us west to australia! feel good about yourself for five seconds when you win, before raging just half an hour later! free to play now! (with only the added cost of your life and sanity) rated all ages for: friendly fire. a really, really bad community animal cruelty",2
"i am a professional dota 2 player with 6000 mmr. i am the best brewmaster in na. in season 3 i was ranked as the best teemo player in brazil. i highly reccommend dota 2 however do not play unless you main brewmaster or invoker. all the other heros suck! i dont even know why they are in the game! if you happen to main urgot please uninstall.",1
"this game is wonderful and i love to play dota 2 :). i prefer if every of my friend can start playing dota 2 because online games are very amazing.",2
"i enjoyed most of the time playing the game, but most people play it for being competative, where as i just try to play it for fun. i would personaly recomend it. the only annoying part would be people from foriegn countries for some reason decide to connect to your area server. ex: russian connecting to u.s. server or a person who decides that they want to connect to a server halfway across the world. though i like it when there is a coopertive team who are there just to have fun.",2
"very addictive game. but i would say this though, the dota 2 community is getting worse from time to time. more abuse player on dota 2. talking trash, do trash, keep feeding and stuff like that. its kinda annoying. but this game 10 out of 10 !! best game ever !! :d",2
"played it for 20 hours, i just got my first angry russian guy saying  11/10 would go io again",1
"great game, good community. recommend to any moba fan.",1

"awesome game can spend hours plaing it at end.......nice graphics.......one of my all time favourites",2
"this game will consume your life. if you have priorities or dreams or goals, stay far away.",5
"i can teach if you are willing to learn. its an epic moba. i played dota on warcraft 3 for around 4 years & loved it",2
"this game is amazing. its like crack, but more addictive. the honest truth is that like many mobas it takes a little getting used to. if you play bots, or have a friend that will help you through the learning phase, its learning curve isnt that bad. i recommend this to anyone who likes having one game that makes them unreasonably happy, and the very next game makes them suicidal. 10/10 i will play this til they make dota 3.",1
"have you ever been a relationship youre so happy youre a part of it? then come to dota, here in dota we encourage: blaming, swearing, hating people of other cultures. the best way to find out how far is too far with your girlfriend.",2
"recommended if you like lol, or if you like moba. great game by valve. 80% good community (south americans are the worst). nice trade system, where you can customize your hero as you want for free (trade items for items) or you can always buy with real money your favorite sets (though they are expensive usually)",3
"one of the most widely played games worldwide. awesome improvement on dota 1",1
"an awesome game for people who like competitive mobas. takes time to learn, but it gives a lot of enjoyable times.",4
"good game. thanks valve for the linux compatibility",2
"the objective of the game is to pick natures prophet and end the match with the highest gold per minute. if youve done that, you win every time. all hail the quota. bestgameever",1
"this is an excellent game for those with sleep issues. just get yourself all cozy, play a game of dota 2 and youll fall asleep before you know it! highly recommended!",1
"game is good, but steam servers now have a lot of issues",1
"awesome game, way better than lol and hon, this the original",3
"kind of like league of legends but with more people calling me a  at the end game",2
"one of the best moba games in the world. and lol ist for noobs !!",1
"great game, definitely recommend it to people that enjoyed playing dota 1. the transition is quite easy and the ability to customize in the market makes it very worth while.",3
"this game is madness,its happening so start downloading it for new users.",2
"this game, well it is more than that, most people play game to have fun. but dota is more than that, it is an expierence, momments get insanly tense and make you want to scream in rage, or they will make you so happy you want to jump through the screen and hug that other players. dota leads to the most hilaries and rage inducing expierences you will have.",1
"a little challenging for a non-strategic gamer, but fun to play overall.",1
"its really a awesome game! never expect to get addicted!",3
"i was kind of skeptical at first cuz the game was free, but i am so glad i downloaded it! it is one of the most addictive games i play! i give this game a 10 out of 10! cheers",1

"awesome game been playing it for a long time, you definitely have to get it :)",2
"awesome game, excellent graphics and gameplay. tricky to learn at first but more in depth than lol. high class game would reccomend for anyone who enjoys real time strategy.",1
"a complex game that features many heroes for all play styles. this game relies on heavy teamwork and has a skill curve. if you manage to survive the curve youll find an addicting game with an improving community.",3
"one of the best games off steam and valve. takes mental and physical abilities to succeed, but once you get the hang of it, the game is really fun. just remember to not feed the other team.",2
"dota 2 is a low pace mobas at the beginning of the game, and progresses on to a faster pace haveing you know that you can get killed by a riki at anytime. there are many charaters of dota 2. over 75 acutally, then these 75 are split into three groups. intelligent(s), strengh(s),and aglilty(s). you can either pick top lane, middle lane, or bottom lane. top lane is know as the hard lane aka try not to day at all lane. middle is a fast lane that you fight for (your lane) but you can a exp/gold adventage, then bottem lane. you then have the easy lane to get away from a gank or can pull a camp and have the enemy closer to your tower. overall i think i can give the game a 9.5 out of 10",1
"fun, plenty of characters to pick, strategies and so on. but... id like to file a bug report thats going to require a (almost) full wipe. the community. fix it valve, plos.",1
"really amazing detail. i enjoy watching every single particle effect, animation, texture, lighting, everything about the aesthetics of this game is awesome. the gameplay is fluid and the heroes feel alive with all the voice acting involved. so far my favorite game in the genre.",3
"moba cant get any better than this! play it, youre missing on lifes greatest moments if you dont xd",2
"if your blood seeks wars, history, heroes and sacrifice, this is the game for you.",1
"get it... you might learn some russian while playing :)",3
"why are you reading this? this game is free for heavens sakes!! just download it, spend 76hrs practicing against bots, watch 23hrs of youtube tutorials, get beaten to a pulp by the community, and youre ready to have a motherloving blast!! unless you hate mobas, in which case just go play planetside or teamfortress or something. i dont care. final score: 7 bug patches /  wizard",1
"i recommend this game if you enjoy friendship ending arguments on a nightly basis!",5
"no matter how many times i quit this game, i always come back. playing since dota 1. almost 8 years. hard to learn, but still the best game ever.",5
"very awesome game. addicting and you cant get enough.",5
"awesome game. stimulates my brain. highly recommended. best game of this lifetime.",2
"dota 2 is a good game i like the update really pretty nice :)",2
"want to learn new languages? want to have your self esteem  on? want something to sink your time into? if so, this is the game for you. a lot of -talking. 10/10 best game ever.",3
"this game is amazing but the only downfall i see is takes some time getting into it, i have clocked more than 1000 hours on dota and im still loving the game and learning new things i recommend getting a few friends and downloading this free game :d",3
"this is a moba like league of legends excpet much harder, but once you get to know the game and get decent, it gets really fun to play.",2
"play a few more games with me and my friends and if u still dont like it then ok",1
"i became racist after playing dota. kill all pinoys!",3

"can i know whats the problem im facing? its like im always dc from all the matches",1
"from warcraft 3 dota to steam dota 2, about 10years i have been playing dota...i just never quit this game!",3
"do you find russians screaming , , i will kill you funny or arousing? then you are in luck! this is definitely the game just for you. but other than the occasional russian death threats you will find yourself in one of the worst game communities in the world. which happens to be in one of the most adicting and entertaining games of all time.",1
"pros: awesome game. you never get bored of it. cons: it takes time to learn.",1
"this is my first review for dota 2. well, i am a fans of dota since warcraft time. that time i was like getting harassed by my friends because i cant play it well lol. well im not saying that im a pro player right now, but at least im on my learning curve. dota 2 is a strategy game, it requires teamwork, and of course experience to dominate the game. as many people have said, dotas learning curve is very deep. its often to find even pro player being harassed and called a noob by other players in the game. that shows how harsh this game is lol. i recommend this for you guys, as this game can deliver thrill, excitement, and of course neverending stress lol. happy rampage!",1
"gaming crack cocaine with an awful community full of raging kids. worth some time invested as its a whole load of fun if you can get past the chat insults and get some farm...last hit dem creeps yo!",4
"game that you shouldve play more than 10000 hours :p",1
"all you can say about dota is that its genius game. it was, it is and it will always be the most balanced and interesting game in the world. it has all things that dota allstars lacked. no need to say more, just try it. and the core of your life gonna be put there.",2
"highly addictive moba based off warcraft 3 and massively updated by valve. the game play is very well tuned with balance updates pretty regularly. the patches are worth looking forward and the free-to-play model is brilliant. that said, this game has one of the worst gaming communities i have ever been a part of. utterly shocking behaviour almost every game by at least one player. this game painfully needs a ban list to avoid being with these people more than once. bring friends for the best experience.",3
"so far best moba game ive played, hardcore and not very newbie friendly",3
"for me it is like a daily routine to play and compete against players across the world. not just we share our views but also our intellects collide on the same battlefield to determine the wave of glory for teams playing each round. sometimes we win but we loose which really makes to see deep in our hearts where we need the fear to be controlled and our reflexes on time through the game any time any place. at last it made us a way better than we happen to be in our previous game. understanding and reasoning the events of game is the most key factor if u really need to make best out of your effort. this game really changed us more than just one way.",5
"not just a game for fun. but this game need teamwork, inovation, great instict and creativity",4
"hands down the best moba game :) it can be very frustrating and punishing for newbies to get into but it is well worth the effort loads of fun to be had with friends well done to icefrog and valve on this masterpiece",2
"if youre a veteran moba player, dota2 shouldnt be unknown to you. it is the best one out there after all. but if youre new to the genre, dota 2 is the most beginner friendly moba as of right now. it offers practise spacing from walking around, to buying items, to last-hit creeps and destroy towers. when youve learned the basics, you can practise against bots. you can play either with bots or with actual players to practise playing with a team.",3
"most addictive game for me... just awesome... bit complivated to play, bt that add more fun to it... must play game",4
"best moba style game, in my opinion, but if i keep getting matches with all these ing mexicans and russians; thatll change.",2
"this game has a wicked learning curve, but it is well worth your time to learn. although it is similar to league of legends, dota 2s variables have a lot more impact on the game, and i feel this greatly enhances the gameplay to a point beyond where other moba games have reached. 10/10 would bang.",1
"the strongest addiction are cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, and dota...",2
"the best boma out there. a complete revump of the old dota with which we all learned the genre, with great graphics, all our favorite characters from the original and a fast pace gaming experience. the great community also helps a lot in your first steps in comparison with other games of the same genre/type.",1
"interesting game, nice to refresh some of your russian language knowlege",1
"nice game, make you use your head, graphics are awsome... can have items categorized so its easy for noobs to understand the different items......",3
"very cool game...its like...playing gta but with power...btw..those terrain is awesome....the map are freakin cool...i think im playing my life in da game sometime2...best game ever....feel wasted spending whole money to game name aqw,lol,and freakin other  game....i should findout this game like 2 years ago..n i will be awesome",1
"i would certainly recommend this game! although it has a high learning curve because of the many item and hero builds, it is a very team-oriented game where communication and coordination matters the most. be warned though, it is a very addictive game and you will sink many hours into it!",3
"the one game on steam that ive spent the most time on. and you should spend a lot of time on it too. like seriously, download this now if you havent already. im not even kidding man.",4
"its not bad kinda strategy multiplayer rpg unfortunantly the game is plagued with balance issues some characters are over powered while some are just plain useless but valve are working on these issues and im sure in due time they will make it right. alot of fun with friends but again dont expect an easy ride the bot difficulty can be quite hit and miss most of the time its tough and this is one of those games that require all your team members to communicate and help where needed",5
"nice game, nice fps, nice player attitude :) good game guys, come on play now",3
"even that i brought this to just get items to turn into tf2 items this is quite fun. it might be hard to play because its 3rd person but it has lots and lots of characters. 9/10",1
"i like dota because of his heroes is nice and i like strategy with teamwork game.",2
"people who arent from north america that queue on either us east or us west, regardless of skill level, need to be permanently banned from playing on those servers.",3

"very nice game, fun but has a steep learning curve",2
"just try it. theres nothing to lose as long as you already hate people.",2
"this game is like lol but much more better an mature !!!!!!!! :)",1
"wonderful game (when the servers are up/when there are no: russians, brazilians, peruvians on your team/when nobody picks sniper, riki, or pudge/when the god damned servers work) recommended.",3
"i am new when it comes to this style of game but after the steep learning curve i am starting to get it. my son loves the game so thats why i tried it. i like the concept and the community seems to be a pretty positive one. quite a change from some of the fps games i play where you are lucky to not get insulted by children let alone adults.",1
"best moba ive ever been able to play. no pay4win, no constant ks flame, just pure pleasure.",2
"this game is awesome, it reminds me so much of league of legends and some of the aspects are better then lol. i think this game is really fun and perfect for being free.",1
"a really good game. i recommend only if you like team games and you are ready to take one for the team.",3
"hands down better than league. if you are new i highly recommend watching pyrion flaxs youtube videos.",3
"very nice game. it requires alot of stategy and teamwork to win however very satisfying. it will cause many moments of anger so be careful and enjoy!",2
"there;s still some bugs in it.. but i recommend its a good game",1

"preper fer teh scery men to tern arond when da gem startz, itz a troll gem.",1
"wew, its an good game if you want to try hard, try it if you can!",2
"want a friendly community who accepts mistakes? want a team that speaks your language? go play an inferior game. want a game that is as rewarding as it is frustrating that is more in-depth and strategic than anything in the genre. this is your game. 10/10 would recommend to the serious gamers, not those who want a chill/laid back game. also you can kill donkeys.",1
"fun game, once you find your hero. experimenting with each type is good, and just playing an ai battle with a few friends is a good way to pass the time.",1

"dota 2 is a real-time strategy game as known as moba (multiplayer-online-battle-arena) youll need a teamwork to play this game. every game is the same map with different strategy. it is also the best languages learning game. im playing on the sea server and i learned about 5 languages like pinoy, indo, malay, chinese, korean, and sometimes russian. imagine when youre trying to pay attention on the game but the chat log is full of their languages. especially russian  always appeared on the chat log. it means bltch as well. this game has the mute system which im f*ckin love it. it helps me solve these problems. -remember no english. of course if youre new to this game, youll get a lot of blames. no place for newbs. #fukingbadcommunity but just chill and keep playing, ignore those who trashtalks. youll have a great time playing this game. #bestmoba ruined my life 11/10",5

"i would recommend this game for anyone that has patience. dota 2 requires a large time investment to get fully into the game, not to mention matches take your entire attention to pull your team to victory. after playing dota 1 for quite some time, i am happy to have moved on to the second installment. i do not like how the community is in game though. there is no need for name calling and intentional griefing which probably is due to the mental development of the team itself. unless you have a full party of 5 people, this game should be played with a grain of salt.",2
"i dont even know which option to choose for this review, that i recommend this game or not. seriously, this game cost me my life, my girlfriend that never existed, and step by step it will cost me my job. so if you dont have a life, i highly recommend this game for you, if you actually have a life, dont even try to think about downloading this game, youll lost everything for free. as for myself, this game bring out a horrible side of me that i never knew it existed. and of course, not much of a friendly community, but this game is very fun and too much addictive.",2

"started out playing dota on the old wc3 engine and i played that for 7+ years before i shifted into dota 2 with the beta. dota 2 offers much more than the original wc3 version in terms of graphics and gameplay, as the old engines hero and skill interactions were hampered by limitations (dota allstars was just a custom map). cosmetics, tournaments, and streaming are all seamlessly integrated; and are constantly being improved at the behest of the community. the game is a bit hard to get into at first, but after you have the basics down, youll play for an innumerable amount of time. adding friends into the mix for crazy strategies and plays increases the replayability and enjoyment of the game to another level. one of the best games. ever.",3
"awesome game! if you tried it once and you dont like it, go home your drunk! if you like it and never played it before, play the tutorial, play alone vs bots, play with players vs bots and when you have played a few hours then try normal matchmaking. and always keep in mind, stay away from these russians....",3

"its an amazing game - technically outstanding, showing all of valves usual polish and attention to detail, especially in the all-important multiplayer aspects. the continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. its hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. it took me a long time to warm up to, but im helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. if you can spare the time - play it.",2
"ive always played it since wc3 ~5.80 nothing else to describe.",2
"best moba ive ever played, ruined by broken matchmaking and absence of different game modes. + amazing visuals + very smooth gameplay + item drops + great hero designs. + hardcore team play. - outright broken matchmaking system will drive you nuts. - there is only one map, one game mode. there are some different hero-picking drafts thats all. - the worst community ever. very toxic, there is at least one troll, feeder or leaver in every match. - sometimes too punishing, and so damn less rewarding. - very addicting. give it a try if you didnt already, but dont let it get to you, it will drain your sanity away. 6/10 edit: get back to check the game out, see if anything changed. nope. and i just realised that the developers are as lasy as ****. community is doing all the work and developers get to lay down and get rich for not releasing any content update.",2

"dota 2 is a fun, strategy game that some may find hard, or boring. out of other mobas dota delivers, but only after youve learned the game. for new players, the tutorial doesnt teach much and may actually confuse you. if you have friends that also play, it will make game more fun, as there a many different game styles.",3

"if you have the patience to learn the game it can be fun. be prepared to lose regardless of skill because some games are not winnable. better with friends.",4
"ive played strategies mostly. moba is a different type of game, where you have less to worry about but you have other people to worry for, and coordinate with them. in rts games you are in control of everything and your opponent is in in control of everything. but here, you have to worry about 4 teammates and 5 opponents. what i like about is is the wide range of heroes to choose and the various ways you can play them, which makes the possibilities limitless. unlike lol which i have played for a bit, the graphics are less cartoony and the game rewards skill (denying and not feeding) and punishes you for bad play (enemies snowballing, losing towers, feeding etc.) the only thing i dont like are games taking 40 minutes on average. an sc2 game would take 15-30 mins.",2
"at first this game is challenging but when you get good taste of it you will get better faster",3

"i used to play dota. i still do, but i used to, too.",1
"what i like most is the graphics and the effects which made the game more interesting to play. what i dislike is the items that they are selling that are only limited to selected countries which is quiet unfair to other countries. however over all i would recommend others to play the game since it is a great game and very entertaining",2

"if youre looking for a reason to commit time to dota 2  if youre actually reading this review for advice and a critical opinion, rather than to see what score im going to give the most popular game on steam  then, first up, thanks for being here. second, i want you to consider what it means when two grown men accidentally lather each other in regenerative goop. its gamings equivalent of holding a door open for somebody who is already reaching to hold the door open for you: a synchronicity of kindness that speaks to a deeper shared understanding of the situation both people are in. dota is a game where you can say the words are you thinking what im thinking? and be reliably assured that the person on the other end of your voip connection actually is. it might have the systems and bearing of a videogame, but dota shares the social impetus of a sport. its single environment isnt a map, its a pitch.",2

"really awesome game dota 2, and you can make money from this game....",2
"imo, if youre thinking about league or dota, dota. ill give the score, but beneath that will be reasons dotas better than the next moba youll try to pick up. dota2-9/10 pros: -every hero is free, so no real money needed. (except skins) no real money to buy that good champ you want -good community -much more rewarding for a skilled player. its not that other mobas are *easy* but more towards the idea of them taking less focus. -better graphics and particles (imo, because some can reason that their bad) -voice chat, allowing skilled party members to quickly say what they need to say rather than typing -very balanced. everything is weak against something else. cons: -laggy, at times. -occasionaly youll find a toxic player. (very rude) -much harder to git gud at, due to high experience needed. - oh yeah, and some people stay on the wrong server, despite being spanish, brazillian, russian",1

"my favorite game to play. its free to play and very fun for being free to play. its a competitive game though and is not suited for the casual gamer. i recommend this game to anybody who has had experience with rts or other mobas.",3

"this game...... so hard to describe. do not recommend.",1
"do you play league? are you sick of all the pugs and nobody will play with you? trade up and get an invite to dota2! the voices are amazing, the graphics, while beta, are very polished whily not stressing most machines, and the gameplay is an order of magnitude deeper in surprising ways. it is also the least-forgiving moba around (aside from wc3 dota, which has a more hardcore following and wc3-engine bugs). welome to dota, you suck. i know i do.",4
"incredibly fun game. challenging and the skill levels have a wide range but the match making sorts most of the better players from the inexperienced ones so that it is still challenging at all levels you play at.",2
"a great pvp game that offers some of the most intriguing and nuanced team combat around.",3
"better than league of legends. a game where you need to have pro skill to win.",1
"i like when playing and not disconect but if playing then disconect,like a  disturb very2 disturbing me but i like so much about dota 2",2
"dota 2 adds a great deal of complexity to the moba genre. its balance tenet is: everything goes. there is no character that is underpowered; in fact, theyre all overpowered in their own way. the game places a great burden of knowledge over whoever tries it out. be sure to stick to co-op games for starters. the tutorial may prepare you slightly, but the game as a whole is a lot more complex than other mobas on the market. oh, and the saying it aint over till its over applies here. you cant be sure youre winning until the radiant/dire goes down. lots of rooms for comebacks in here, but the game is far more snowbally than other mobas.",1
"if you dont have this game. youre really missing out. not only is it free but its a very good game! its currently my favorite and its very popular. give it a try and learn it. it took some time for me to learn it and now i love it!",1

"very great game and take note its free! waiting for other heros to be released. very much excited!",2
"seriously, ive gone from paying heroes of newrth to league of legends to dota and the only game ive stuck to playing constantly out of the three is dota. i find it easier than hon but more challenging than league. i have no major glitches like i did when i played league and i love all the heroes that can be played. ive gotten quite a few of my friends to either pick dota 2 back up or to start playing it. like any other game you run into a few rude players but otherwise the community is great. i highy recommend this to anyone looking for a game to play like league or hon!",1
"well made game. do you have 4 other friends to consistantly play with? no? dont bother with this one then.",1

"this game is ruining my life. on the bright side i learned some russian and spanish. 9/10",2
"this game will soon become extremely predictable. lets say you have all the necessary components to make a team and then you have one rando on your team that hasnt picked yet. all you need is a support to make it complete, well guess what?! he is going to pick pudge and win you the game. dont worry jajajaja is a good sign. if you dont know what that means you will soon know. good luck out there kid.",4
"dota 2 is a really addictive moba. while i still love playing league of legends, i also love playing dota 2. dota 2 is more of a challenge then league of legends, which makes dota a really fun game to experiment with and have fun on.",1
"the best team game experience / strategy game you can find in the industry ... dota simply combines all the great ideas into one competitive match . many games try to copy dota 2s mechanism and playstyle but they fail by a long shot..",2

"this is not a game. this is life. o.o this is very addictive and life goes around it. you just think only of dota.....dota.....dota.....dota...................",3
"all right, same as everyone here: hard game, very nob unfriendly, highly addicting, full of russians. did i mention that is hard to master and that people are going to kill you for every mistake? on the other hand you have a free to play game that rewards the efforts put in learning everything. starting with the jargon (carry, creep, pusher, warding, ganking, bot, solo lane, going rosh, ,...). try it, dive in it, forget life.",2
"i really like how dota 2 is getting the free to play model right.",1
"toxic ranked match making. 10/10 would queue again.",3
". 10/10 would report u for feed again. i think this game has made me partially more russian. i can understand a lot of russian as well as spanish and i can read chinese like no other. i call this path in dota... the  blyat technique. you gather as much knowledge of the three languages then proceed to say 4 things. omg mid  blyat i have 100% win rate with this technique. if you liked political simulator ur going to love this game",4
"best way how to learn foreign languagues just queve to russia west and your language knowledge will be much wider in a few minutes, this game causes seizures, low self esteem, uncontrollable rage, questioning of worlds existance and the most important thing teamwork. p.s. most used words in dota: , davai, blyat, jebat tvoji mamu, pierdolok, kopula (chronosphere) and mid or feed 10/10 asari would play commander shepard out, i should go.",3
"colorful and interesting game, it has a plenty of heroes to explore and same with gear for them, it will ge a good time taker for few days, but then you will get to tacticks and if you enjoy this genre games you will go for scores, if not most likely you will play something else.",1
"its is a very good game with good balancing and intersting abilities, but as you probaly read before, you can compare the communitie with a waste bin. people will just scream at you when you do someting wrong and leave the game after that and dont forget the famous mid or feed strategy. communication in this game is hard, the game does it good at that point, but then the russians and arabians or whatever show up when you clearly clicked eu-west and that you want to meet up with english people instead of other language. so yeah, game is perfectly with regulary updates and interesting events, but the communitie really needs to get better (i mean a lot better) or valve should just link english people with real english people and auto search for the best server instead of choosing the server. i would say 9.5/10 for the game (nothing is perfect) and 2/10 for the communitie (sometimes you meet a nice person)",2
"i like it because dota1 is boring now so i play dota 2 cuz its awesome",1

"its an amazing game - technically outstanding, showing all of valves usual polish and attention to detail, especially in the all-important multiplayer aspects. the continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. its hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. it took me a long time to warm up to, but im helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. if you can spare the time - play it.",2

"dota2 so far is the best game i ever played, highly recommended for gamers",3
"awsome game with nice team players and best action ever",4
"i think people who gush over this game do so because its not league of legends. this often strikes me as being the same as the person who plays say the secret world and bashes those that play world of warcraft. where world of warcraft is accessible, easy and enjoyable for the masses, secret world is deep, complex and very rewarding to those who really enjoy the minutae of figuring out how to get the most out of an mmo. dota 2 is the game you play when you dont want to the hand-holding, comfortable ease that league of legends has brought to the moba world. i found dota 2 to be overly awkward, and not particularly rewarding. but for those in the mood for the more hardcore experience, this is where to be, i just wont be there with you.",1

"awesome strategy game .. easily one of my favourites no doubt about that :)",2
"spending a year learning to shuffle a gaggle of fantasy heroes up dotas teetering stack of rules and game mechanics will do that to you: weve developed a secret language of our own, one that runs parallel to the talk of creeps and lanes and farm and rax common to everyone who plays the game. whack a ward on the donkletron im going to stick one up their jungle is a sentence i can say out loud and be completely understood by at least those three people. for some reason, theres also a lot of singing involved. its a lot like being a sailor.",1

"possibly one of the most interesting games in my steam library, dota 2 is an enjoyable game to play with friends online and meet new people in the online matches. after the recent success of the internations 2014 by raising a whopping prize pool of over ten million dollars. this serves as an incentive for new players at the possibility to winning a share of the prize pool if theyre good at the game. one will require the ability to quickly respond to the situation as the actions of your teammates and enemies are completely random. i suggest this game to anyone who wants an enjoyable experience thats more complicated than the similar game league of legends. i find both games equally fun and enjoyable however dota is ultimately the more superior game between the two. ~samuraizheng",2

"i love the strategy and crazy amount of customization. very fun alone or with friends.",1
"terrible game. the tutorial was so boring that i didnt even bother finishing it. though, i wasnt too excited at what await me after the tutorial either, as ive heard this is one of the most unforgiving and anti-noob communities out there. i dont understand how that yields people 1000s of hours.",1
"good game and addictive. when techies will be realese?",4
"i like this game because of the graphics. it so fun i love playing dota because when im playing dota im so happy =)",1
"dota 2 is like an abusive relationship you invest hours of your life into it even though you know youre gonna get ed at, you feel like nobody ever considers your opinion, and you get really really depressed sometimes after while. its still sorta worth it, kinda... speaking of relationships dont ask me about any and how i can compare this game and an abusive relationship, because ive been spending all my time on this stupid game with my stupid friends. i mean you stil get some pleasure out of it, right?",4
"i, for one, dislike the chinese more than i do the russkies. but seeing as how i capitalize their names, i suppose i dont dislike them that much. also, dota2 needs to be revamped in a dangerous, paradigm breaking way. thats the only way it can compete with da new crazuh blizzard moba with all that ghost ships and battle trolls.",1
"it is a good real time strategy game and worth of playing.",1
"one of the most addicting games i have ever played...",2

"really great game ! cool ! fun to play with friends",2
"dota 2 is even far more better than his elder brother - dota 1 with great game play and services, along with a big market for you to trade and earn benefit. however, since the day it became free to play, more and more  players has been joining the community and spoil it. i lost some love with it, but still, dota 2 is the best game with the best community i have ever played",3

"great competitive game to play with your friends. promotes strategy, team work and is very fun to play",4
"if you value your irl social contacts and your life outside of your room, dont pick up dota. it is perhaps the most engaging and exciting game ever created.",2
"alright so unlike most people who dont recommend dota 2, i just legitametely did not like the game, though i understand how others would. dota 2 has similar gameplay to planescape torment, a game which i played for story aspects. i couldnt even get through the tutorial without feeling bored and unprogressive. in fact, the more i played the tutorial the less i understood. now i dont play many multiplayer games but from my experience the gameplay of dota 2 does not match its purpose, so if your like me, who enjoys games where you can see clear progression, you enjoy becoming stronger and stronger and are a fan of the wasd keys, i do not suggest it. 3.5/10",1
"very well done, if you loved wc3 dota, you will love this! addicting and infuriating, but still...",4

"apparently, there is a hot spider lady in it 10/10",1
"definitely reccomend playing this game even if you dont like games like league of legends etc. i dont like those games but this is awesome. play the turtorial as it is very helpful, it may take up 30 mins of your time before an actual game but its definitiely worth it",1
"dreadfully overhyped and overrated. i seriously fail to see the appeal. it seems uninteresting to say the least; just trying to reinvent the wheel by the looks of things. if it aint broke, dont fix it. just play league of legends or something if youre in to this kind of thing (which im not, so pardon the bias if youre detecting any).",1
"good game to play.. well surely it make u addicted to this game but.. i will surely make my son play it who know gamers will be the better job in the future. ti4 already give u 10million usd..so next year? who know right",4

"a very addicting and fun game to play with friends! a game where you can meet new friends and enhance your communication and teamwork skills. good gameplay and graphics, good effects and animations.",1
"a nice and fun free-to-play game. recommended if you have thick enough skin to handle one of the gaming worlds worst community though.",1
"very fun its hard in the beginning but if you played some games its really fun to play for all the new players i shall recommend to first play versus bots or else if you go online you get hate and maybe get reported also you need time for this game 1 game is about 30-45 minutes if you dont have that time and leave the game you come in low priority that means you wont get any items or experience and first need to do 6 games in low priority to get out of it. goodluck!",2
"each match of dota 2 is independent and involves two teams, both containing five players and each occupying a stronghold at either end of the map. located in each stronghold is a building called the ancient; to win, a team must destroy the enemys ancient. each player controls a hero character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory. overall, this game is a very intense and full of war occurrences, spell caster, magic and physical damage, even the absolutely stunning built-up for every each heroes. this game, dota 2, is the best multi-player game available on the market yet...!",2
"great competitve game better moba then most and its fun and easy to enjoy",2
"dota 2 is a fun and energetic game. there is a diverse roster of heroes to choose from that each have there own unique abilities so youll never get bored. you can buy character sets, announcers, hud skins, couriers, and loading screens to customize the way you want your game to look. it is difficult when you are new to it, but youll eventually get the hang of it. i recommend this game to almost anyone in the steam community, and the good thing is....its free!!!",3
"addictive games, should be played for anyone who love strategic games",1
"dota 2 is simply the best game ever in the world. valve has done a really great job.",3
"dota 2 is a bad game and it sucks really. the players are mostly noob. dota 2 depends on the strength of heroes not on the skills of the ones who played it. even the matchamaking system is imbalanced. everytime i play dota 2 its like my team is 40% and the enemy is 60%. which is really imbalance. also dota 2 has a very bad impact based on item cosmetics. here in our poor country this became a huge issue. i hope they ban dota 2 in the philippines",1
"if you are new to mobas.... go to league of legends to get your foot in the waters, because this game is hardcore and complex. put in simple this is high risk/ high reward. fail 2 or three times, the match favors the other team. there will be frustrating moments, but after you past the learning curve, this game is very addicting. only watch the pro plays on youtube after you already get a feel of what dota is about, and you will be amazed at the things the pro players are able to pull off.",2
"this game ruined gaming for me, all i play now is dota. who needs 120 other games. also, this game will make you hate russians 11/10 goty every year",3

"love this game.....................................<3",1
"warning: dota 2 causes crack-like addiction; including increased heart rate, serious rage, unstoppable laughter and inability to call it a night after a  defeat. when playing alongside a great and coordinated team vs a great enemy team, it doesnt get much more intense or fun. if you havent started playing yet, find some friends who already do and get on the train.",1
"you might laugh, you might cry. russians will invade and peruvians will try to take over. you will question your sanity but you will never be in any really trouble. at the end of the day its like being in an abusive relationship with a great deity that gives you the best s of your life.",4
"well, i think its a good game. i reccomend to all gamers to try it! and of course enjoy it too!",1
"best game ever. from the gameplay to the graphics, effects, and community(except russians) but its playable :d. tottaly recomend dota !",2
"its an amazing game - technically outstanding, showing all of valves usual polish and attention to detail, especially in the all-important multiplayer aspects. the continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. its hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. it took me a long time to warm up to, but im helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. if you can spare the time - play it.",1
"well, since i had several keys for this game i decided to give a few to some friends before installing a copy of my own. upon installing i joined a game, and i was welcomed by many, many friendly russians. these young soviets helped me learn the basics of this wondrous, innovative experience. here is some of of the advice they gave me plz stop playing wat  r u doing i  ur mather an excellent game with an equally excellent community",1

"some words about dota 2, it`s a game, which can take a lot of your free time, and usually you won`t be worried that you played 13 hours in 2 day. you have to try this, you`ll sure be entertained, whoever you are (even if you`re troll c:). dota 2 is new begining of moba games, you can play it for free, and if you`ll go to professional scene, you`ll even earn some money. just in case, worldwides tournament the international has more than 1.000.000$ as prize fund each year, can`t say if it is going to be 4th international, but i hope so.",4

"id recomend this game cuz this is good strategy game",3
"best real-time strategy game, millions of players, what can you ask for?",2
"gameplays just like dota 1 but this one has better features like matchmaking!",2
"dota 2 at first doesnt seem like one of the best games but once you get into it and get some hours on the clock playing, youll notice how you can endlessly enjoy the game. the bonus to that is that there are no cheaters and people that might ruin the game for you. the game mechanics are designed well although some heroes/champions are over powerered if you master them over other ones. the in-game purchases have nothing to do with player performance, you can buy skins or rather clothes for them making you stand out but dont improve your skills or anything. overall i rate the game 8/10. -1 for some heroes over powered. -1 for the dota 2 network being a problem.",2
"dota is better than league of shiites. them damned sunni took that game over and they suck.",5

"the most owesome game!! best game ever..we feel like hero when play this game..hahaha",3
"before playing dota 2 i knew nothing about dota or league of legends, so everything i know i learned in dota 2. the game is very, very deep and complex, it took me 400 hours to get the basics, 700 to understand the item builds and 1000 to play it reasonably well. the amount of hero combinations make this game almost impossible to get tired of. its definitely not pay2win, it has good graphics and valve updates it constantly. if you dont know how to play this game, i recommend to mute everyone at the start of every match, so you dont get pissed off. also try playing with bots to learn. coment me",3
"very good remake of the original dota warcraft iii for the orignal dota lovers it is the rebirth of the saga. if you are a lol player your deffently familiar with the moba play style but you will have a harder time getting used to this because this game is alot harder and is alot more punishing for playing bad. one bad teamfight can bring the entier game down. i recommend teaming up with couple of friends and go together trough the learning rollercoaster curve",4

"dota 2 is like driving a car. (they have similar intensity) you have to look at minimap like wing mirrors you have to look at chat like looking rear-view mirror the more intense game becomes, is like the more you drive into big city or complex places in rush hours the less you know about what each hero can do or how the game play, is like not knowing roads/streets or even shortcuts ****if you dont care about winning (zero percent), then it is like you driving a trashy car and crash to other cars and you simply run away. (you just might got caught)***** the game is full of possibilty and it is well balanced. but its just that most people just like to driving to some same places rather than the rest of the places because its easier reach the destination without stress.",2

"this game is much better than the warcraft mod dota 1 sequel. many improvements had been added. rare bugs, and sometimes a bit too laggy. its always up-to-date so to speak. a good environment because you get to play with other countries as well. unlike dota 1, you can only play at your country because connections are limited. graphics is awesome, the hero designs are cool, the music gave me goosebumps. but what bothers me is the end-game drop items that an individual gets, it should be improved, like increase the chance of getting an item, and fix the servers especially in sea. overall, i truly love this game. because it requires a lot of teamwork and communication in order to win. for me this is the best free-to-play game on steam.",3

"pros: requires strategy obviously needs teamwork to win makes you think for others rather than yourself awesome hero customizations and skins easy ui and hotkeys for your convenience requires technique and precision of skill execution (unlike similar games) cons: not for the greedy player lacks old and new heroes from dota soloists will have a hard time playing around the map gives you the habit of overspending because of awesome items public pairings are very random, you either pair up with noobs or quitters or maybe dendi or singsing themselves. overall, its a great game. a chip o the old block from dota 1(duhhh) they need to add more awesome items and customization for heroes. same goes with the selection; no frost wyvern, arc warden, and other upcoming heroes who-knows icefrog and the others will put.",3

"strategic battle arena gameplay that will push your mind and teamwork to the limit",3
"this is a good game. for a moba type of game, i think it works very well. firstly the gameplay is sufficiently complicated such that items and abilities do not always have to follow the standard path, many aspects of the game is situational. at the same time, the game is fun and relies heavily on strategising and execution. playing online is great as it is a real test of skill and strategy. it must be noted however, that the online community tends to be unfriendly at times (as with most online games, especially this type). the customization of the heroes in game is a nice touch and i like it. especially since it helps ensure that this game is totally f2p.",2

"this game improved so much since it was released on the beta. there are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as dota 1. i know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in dota 2 and i think it will help new comers. i know some people who play lol might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. its like comparing cod and battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, i think bot of them are good) give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. try it out, its free and badass!",1

"nice game, even easier with the buying guide implemented, but the feeling is different from warcraft dota.",1
"tough learning curve because youll likely play with some pros that have been playing dota since patch 0.000001 and your team will likely consist of people that understand enough english to insult you but not enough to be of any use in team fights or other strat stuff. huehuehue. get a solid team to play with and its much better. also practice against ais for like a month before stepping foot into a person vs person game.",1

"this game is tons of fun and you can play it with friends or alone and it will still be fun. this is a more advanced moba then say league of legends, but still very simular to other mobas. so if you have played other mobas before you should really consider playing this one.",3
"dota 2 is a challenging game, and i have watched many of the friends i have tried to get to play ragequit, saying its too hard!. even so, my personal experience has been a great one. the graphics are very fine, giving you a breath-taking, beautiful world to conduct battle in every time. the combot is fast-paced and well tuned, giving you 100+ characters with abilities that are well designed and feature very well done animation. one downside of dota matchmaking is that you often get teamed with people who dont speak your language, making team-coordination harder in pub matches, but matchmaking is very fast. a game best played with friends, dota is an awesome moba that will draw your attention continuosly after the first game. graphics- 9/10 gameplay- 9/10 matchmaking 7/10 overall- 8/10",3

"what shall i say its dota but i think some minor things coud be changed! seems to be little bit laggy on linux and not as hardware friendly as hon but better balanced!",1

"it used to be a nice game before it became popular...",3
"cool game although the higher your level the lower drop rates for items would be.the graphics are really good and beautiful..i must say this game is far more better than league of legends as most of the heroes in there is imbalanced..i mean mostly every hero in that game can 1shot you..and also league of legends doesnt have any trading systems and its graphics really sucks...recently i traded with someone..it went well at first but when we were gonna trade..he cancelled it and as result ive been scammed,but its not a problem the item is only worth 0.01usd. better luck next time for scammers like him!thats all..good luck to the devs! :d",2

"been here for a long time, free and awesome gameplay..",1
"this game is so ing tokhmi . league of legends is far better than this",1
"i like getting people mad and dota 2 is a good game for it",1
"the game is easy. all you do is load up and select which server you want to play on, brazil or russia. warning this game makes you incredibly racist against any person who has any connection whatsoever to russia, the phillipines, or brazil. other than that its a great way to ruin your life forever. but once you start playing you wont care anymore. 10/10 would play again.",2
"best rage simulator 2006-2014. comes with many side effects :d",4
"i originally got this game because my friends wanted me to play it. i sucked at it really bad, and i never saw the fun. but after spending a little more time on it, and acutally being able to kill people, i got myself addicted. if you get this game, it may be confusing at first, but will get really fun.",1
"honestly i cant escape this game....its so addictive yet so fun. from the 100+ hero pool and different ways to play each hero there is no doubt in my mind that everyone should own this game(plus its free so if you dont like it un install it :p).. 11/10 wp dota...wp",2
"nice game, bit of a learning curve but its fun nonetheless. being 5v5 brings balance to the game, though there are some op heroes, its understandable as there is a lot of heroes,lots of skills and items.",1

"this game is too hardcore for me, ill stick to lol.",1
"i recently downloaded dota 2 and it have been very enjoyable so far. i also injoy the game pace and tactics.",1
"an excellent game. it has a very steep learning curve for new players but with patience and practice the new player will reap many rewards. victories are as gratifying as defeats are frustrating. beware of the community, they can get bitter very quickly when a mistake is made. on the other hand, when you do well they may congratulate you. all the best of luck. youll need it against me.",2

"bascially tf2 but with no guns. wasted about 100 and gave it to gaben 10/10",1
"it is a good game,but it is way too hard to level up",1
"i have spent 1000 hours playing with a team of friends screaming and yelling and raging and raving about innumerable plays and moments that words fail to describe. this is not an easy game. when you try it you will run head first into a brick wall of knowledge. it will be a brutal task to learn to play the 100+ heroes, familiarize yourself with the items, and understand how everything interacts. you will need patience, determination, and the humility to admit your own mistakes and seek out greater knowledge in order to triumph. but there are no games deeper or more rewarding than this. and its free. have at it.",2

"just because you played league doesnt mean youre gonna grasp this game with ease. get ready to suck....badly.",1
"do you have too much time on your hands? do you want to rage? well then dota2 is for you! not only does it waste your life and possibly make you flunk school, you get to learn russian and meet pinoys! enter the fascinating world off chasing donkeys, meeting brainless russians who say  blyat and kappa all day long. oh, i forgot the brazillians, they are pretty  too. so enter the world of dota2 and sell your life today!",2
"if your into multiplayer games ( moba , mmorpg ) . then this game is mostly suited for you . enjoy your time with the game :) /* not a real expert just another commentater */",1

"you havent played dota 2 yet? well, what are you waiting for? click that damn install button. i could go on forever talking about how amazing this game is, but i simply dont have the time. so what i will say, is that you cannot have steam, and not play, or at least try this game.",3
"this game made me ejaculate so violently and explosively that i blacked out, waking up two weeks later with my house being robbed and my body being stripped down completely bare. the only thing the robbers didnt take was my computer, so i dragged my crusty, naked body over to my desk and started playing dota again.",3

"447 hours into dota, couldve been spent knitting, 10/10",3
"icefrog and valves brainchild, a mix of the classic dota-allstars map we all know and love backed by valves awesome source engine. this game will get you hooked in a couple of sessions, where each game is intensely packed with strategy and action. i guarantee youll keep coming back for more! with its steep learning curve it will take you hours on end to fully grasp what the game is all about, and thats what makes it so addictive, but once you learn the tools of the trade its going to be worth it.",3
"dota2 is a standalone version of the popular warcraft 3 mod dota. it challenges players on a level that few games are able.",1
"warcraft 3s dota has evolved into a actual time consuming game and valve made dota 2??? how can i handle all the goodness of this game",3
"do you know what meth is? dota 2 is the exact same thing you come out losing teeth, paying people for things you dont need, seemingly twitch for no reason whatsoever, and you become racist to every living thing ever created... yup that sums up dota 2 in a nutshell. have fun playing guys.",2
"makes your brain work fast than ever cause youd had to think how win the game :p",3
"dota 2 is a fun amazing easy to pick up and play moba with amazing rich cast of charachters abilitys lore and voice acting. and its f#cking fun! had lots of fun! 9.8/10",1

"yeah! it`s a great game so need more desing and more graphics work",2
"this game has changed my life! when i first started, i was just a insecure, feeding support. but now! now i am an overbearing, demanding carry. this has transfered over to my real life as well. after i had gone over the hump of being a insecure support to a demanding carry, my life has gone so much easier. my boss was like how come you didnt get this done? and im just like, shut up! you cant talk to me! im awesome and it is your fault that i didnt get it done. well, i was fired, but it was fine with me, cause then i had more time to play dota. and dont even get me started on relationships.",1

"dire tide 2014 if u dont do this ice frog i realy leave this game *********************************************************************************************************",3
"from an avid league player, its a bit hard to get into and understand at first. but once you get your main role going and start to learn the heros you can play it can get pretty fun. until you meet viper... /rage about one of his passives is a slow every auto attack compared to league it has a lot less skill shots and more lock ons. however there is still a lot of skill to be had at this game, not runes or masteries, denying, and losing some gold upon death. just make sure you dont spam your spells. your mana pool is very low and mana regen is little to nothing early game. a very different game with not a lot to compare to, but theyre both equally fun in their own way.",1
"if you like to have , low self esteem ,getting shouted on, crying , and right clicking than this is game is for you",3
"please fix it,,, its hard to loggin with another computer,, why that?",3
"the ablity draft mode is sucks ! why must pick with a line??",1
"looking to cut yourself off from the real world? life getting too boring for you? or are you just simply finding for a way to throw your dull life away? look no further, this game is the game for you. this game promises you hours of fun on end. you fight in a team to claim victory over the enemy teams ancient, hence the title defence of the ancients. some heroes are easily grasped, making it easy for beginners to learn the basics. once you start getting the hang of things and master the basics, there are a hundred other heroes to learn and master. personally, this game has ruined my life. with about 400 hours of gameplay, my grades have dropped, i have no time to hang out with friends anymore, my family hates me because im always in my room, you name it, im probably there right now. but ive never been happier in my life. girlfriend? sorry, i dont know what that is.",2
"if u have not played dota2 then u have played nothing till now :d",3
"its awesome.,!!! .,it is my favorite game in online",2
"i charge into battle as a knight and stab a few creeps and i turn into a dragon.then i get shot by sniper a few times and die before i knew where the sniper was.10/10~ign you cant find this in any other game!",1
"dota (defence of the ancients) a game of strategy. this game revolves around one team trying to destroy another teams ancient (to do that players must destroy towers in corresponding order). the game consists of 107 heroes currently (there are still 5 more heroes to be developed; 112 heroes, just incase you forgot how to math) this game is also free, so why not give it a try?! (ofcourse there is a shop in which you buy vanities for heroes, loading screens, renaming tools and various items)",1
"this game is amazing and its way better than lol. it is aweosme sfgetegsgf get it",2
"spent all my free time on this game. ez game ez life! highly recommended",5

"really fun and competitve game.play if you want to be a racisist and/or you love russia. heres an example: me:stun now!! the russian:  me:ing russians.",3
"what you think you do in dota 2: - meet friendly people - learn new heroes - have fun what you actually do in dota 2: - get screamed at - sworn at - play with the only hero you are confident and comfortable with - people saying  uninstall you ing russian  - or ahahaha putangina (god damned pinoys) - feed in the game - not have fun - learn a new hero and suck at it - pick up a dagon to get kills for self-confidence and trashtalking - denying the aegis when your team has the lead - last but not least, learn new languages 10/10",4
"i had always been a supporter of dota ever since dota 5.84c was launched on blizzard. the best game ever.",3
"i like everything in this game but there is something in dota2lounge i dont like its the rep thing some of those who have high rep can easily -rep those people they dislike",1
"about 90% of games have people not playing their roles, 80% have disconnections/leavers and about 50% have feeders or otherwise deliberate game sabotagers. this leaves 1% of all games actually being enjoyed as they should be. most of the game is rote learning of the map, heros, items and recipes and tactics. communication and timing are key with almost no strategy involved. pubs rarely have any communication if they even speak your language. lots of bugs, devs rather add emoticons than fix basic gameplay issues.",3
"it will be really addicitive if u dont control ur self.",3
"who hasnt played a moba in their life even if just one game. dota 2 takes that to next level with graphics and gameplay strategies and the punishment of even dying once :p. this is truly the real moba experience in my opinion, it has all elements needed to make you keep coming back to it and in my case i have bought soo many other games but i still just keep coming back to dota 2 and atleast make sure to play one game per day.",1
"dota 2 is my favorite game that i have ever played. this moba has so many heroes to choose from but i would like to see a balance is the heroes.",1
"we win, we lose, we laugh, we cry, we f*c* those  up, we defend for the team, we attack their f**kin tower, we deny our freakin tower... whatever we are, we still play dota 2! *dont play if you have wc, okay?",2
"if you want to lose everything in your life, this game is for you!",1
"my life for this game.. i really love it..!!!! this is a very very good game!!!!",1
"the best moba game avalible right now. lol is a much more relaxed gameplay and dota has much more going on in game. this isnt good or bad, i think its just playstyle. however dota is made by icefrog and valve, some of the greatest developers together. you also have to admit dota has a better interface than lol. riot games doesnt have much reputation other than lol, and i trust valve. great rts we have here on steam. thanks.",2
"recommending to people who want to break friendships and hearts. this game is a savage manifestation of everything that is evil and spiteful.",1
"this was awsome! it seemed we were on a weaker balance but with nice tactics and good timing of pushing and defending we were able to take out the game. players are somehow a bit too extravagant on using this sensitive word noob when they believe the other player failed to comply of what he had wished. however, blaming comes naturally in a game for winning and losing. at least no other bad words came out. it was a good one generally. cheers,",1
"the best moba steam has to offer. this is how all f2p games should be like. no compromise on gaming experience",1
"very sexy i tell you! dota 2 is probably the most widely played multiplayer game online due to a reason. and that reason is that dota 2 is sexy. fullstop.",2

"you will never be good at this game, you will merely be less bad. it is fun trying to be less bad though.",4
"competitive gaming like dota2 is good for players like us and me :)",1
"this is a great game but sometimes i meet many rude and noob player otherwise some or them also quite friendly , anyway dota 2 still a very nice game hope this game will more be like by other ^^",1

"this game is so awesome. a game of tactics and strategy. best game ive ever played in my life.",2
"a game that is easy to begin playing,but hard to master dota 2 is the perfect example of what makes moba games fun. endless gamemode updates and hero changes keep the game fresh for the old players,and exciting for the new. perfect blend of rts + rpg gameplay. i recommend playing with a friend. (or 4,if you have them)",5
"its a very cometative game which pits you against 5 heroes. you must work with your teammates to overcome such odds, though youll likely fail the first couple of times.",2
"very good game with a lot of feature.. item set good graphic.",4
"cool game, a bit of multiple elements. some strategy, strong micromanagement, teamplay makes and breaks the games. with an element of rpg. and its free!! what more u need? get in here!!",3
"welcome to dota 2, the game is officially publish to play, i play this game since beta. i like this game.",3
"the good thing is that the legacy of dota was preserved, but the things that needed improvements were fixed.",4
"dota 2 is a learning game. its a game about how good you are relatively. everyone is terrible at dota, (you cant help it) all that matter is how good you are, relative to how good your enemy is. i like dota because it keeps me saying stuff like wait, that can happen? and oh, thats how that works. on a daily baisis. theres always more to learn. the complexity of this game is so deep that you cant possibly expect to know all there is to know. you will never come across the same scenario twice, maybe the same team oor enemy team, but never the same items, gold skill levels, couldowns, mana and health levels etc. the point is, dota 2 is a game that you play to have fun and just because youre not as good as youd like to be doesnt mean youre not good at dota. ~thank you three lane highway for insight into what kind of a game dota 2 really is.~",1
"an awesome game to play with friends and as its more competetive now a days its even better to go pro and show the world how good you or your team is...........must play !!",1
"dota 2 is a strategic game that helps me to ease my boredom everyday i recommend this to other gamers to play this game",2
"awesome game, very fun to play especially with some friends.",1
"highly enjoyable, very team oriented. good way to spend 30-45 minutes. every game is different.",1
"this game has absolutely destroyed my eyesight and my social life. now when i go out, i utter random russian words such as  and blyat at passing strangers, meaning i can no longer go out to the mall with my friends without offending people. also, playing with pinoys has taught me that the majority of them always say bobo and that the sea server is full of ignorant s. apart from that, this game is fantastatic, and id recommend it to anyone willing to die a sad and lonely death",2
"800+ hours and i still suck 10/10 would rage again",2
"ruined my life and my friendship with other people , definitely recommended 99999/10",4

"playing it for 5 years.. still takes my nerves as day 1! definitely reccomend!",4
"its very fun playing with strategy and cooperate with teammate. team communication plays a huge role in order to win the game. this can definitely train your reaction time and instant decision skills where anything could happen to your in-game hero anytime. it also teaches how to counter a specific hero pick and item bought which can brought into real life senario.",3
"its unconventional, non-violent subject matter and gameplay also skilfully and confidently prove that not all games need an attack button to be enjoyable and interesting -- and given the growing sense of weariness a lot of us have been feeling with super-violent experiences, thats something that should be celebrated.",2
"love the game so addictive. mostly friendly people on there a few idiots but thats to be expected all in all really good",1
"if you are planing on having kids and spending time with them, and your wife dont download this game, i repeat do not download this game. this game ruined my life. i was a kid going to school having good grades playing basketball, living healthy life. one day my friend says do you play dota 2? i ask whats that, and he says its a very cool game. so i tryed it and i liked it. three years ago i first played this game and now i m still on to it..i just regret the thing there is not german people, bcuz i study german at school. i allready speak russian, spanish, polish. those 3 nations will get you so mad you wont believe how mad you are. so as i said..i m just stuck with this game so i worned you. dota 2 in heart !!!",1
"this game is awesome. you may hate it to start off, but i know from experience that in this game, everyones in the same can of beans- everyone starts off without knowing what the f**k there meant to be doing. took me 25 games until the game started telling me i was godlike. as in, before that i was awful. play it. you know you dont want to. but once you start... theres no going back.",1

"dota 2 is a moba game and is a continuing of map defence of the ancients on wciii tft",3

"one of the best multiplayer online battle arena game; its gameplay focuses on combat in a three-dimensional environment, presented from an oblique high-angle perspective. what i liked on this game is that this is played in discrete matches involving two five-player teams, each of which occupies a stronghold at a corner of the map. each stronghold contains a building called the ancient, which the opposite team must destroy to win the match. each player controls a hero character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory.",1

"dota 2 is in a strong place right now. its rewarding and sociable like few other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. the next few months will be crucial: its currently the best expression of valves progressive attitude towards players, and if it can continue on that track it describes a future for online gaming that is far more hopeful than the one were used to. thats the big picture, however. for me, dota 2 will continue to be about the friends that i learned to play it with, the ones ive made through playing it, and that ceaseless, pointless singing.",4

"( out of 10 dogs prefer pooping in a hat to be eatne by a bear.",1
"the game can be played at any skill level but the beauty is that at higher levels there is so much depth that no two games are ever alike. the only issue is that it is difficult to improve without having someone (friendly) better than you who will actively call out your mistakes; in dota 2, ignorance is not bliss.",1

"dota 2 is for certain the best moba game on the market. completely free to play, with all heroes unlocked from the start. plenty of patches have changed how characters work, added different events, and added more heroes to play with; making it a great package for the price of... well nothing! if you are new to mobas; dota 2 may be a hard game to get into due to the high learning curve. do not have that discourage you however, as plenty of hours are waiting to be taken by this fantastic game.",1

"dota 2 is the first moba game i played. good graphics,good game meta and also very strategic . overall a very good game, just that in sea server the connection was not very stable. ive experienced many times that in the end of a winning game my line disconnected, and the enemy team did not pause for fair play(it was a party of 5). resulting a lost when we reconnect, downgrades our game experienced deeply. will be great if valve could make an autopause if found the whole team disconnected. so that it would be fair.",1

"brilliant game, made even more amazing with your friends co-operation however, there is one bad side. although this game is shockingly awsome, there is a bad point to it. there are some items that are incredibly rare and un-attainable unless you are willing to pay a good 30/50 for them. for example the treasure of the emerald dragon that came out recently was only out for an hour and the items within it are amazing but are beyond comprehension and youd have to sell an unusual of tf2 in order to obtain it. its a fun game in itself, however im just a bit peeved that the developers would make it so impossible for fans to gain the cooler items they love and how some treasures are hidden from the public eye. download the game, love it for what it is and sell your soul to it; then realise you cant obtain the beautiful items you would like :)",2

"its a purgatory simulator based on the existential novel no exit, in which you are trapped in a game with 9 other people who hate you. you spend your time killing the same enemies, who spawn every 30 seconds for all eternity, until you have amassed an arbitrary amount of gold/items with which you kill the other team. the worst 2 players in the game are blamed for every mistake made and ridiculed without mercy, while the player with the highest kill/death ratio (often times not the best player) calls you a  for a 60 minute duration. its a really nice game and i highly recommend it.",3

"with a  community, you might be thinking, why should i get this game if it has the potential to be a lol clone with a bad community. but to you i say, do some research and youll find dota to be the grandfather of some of the best moba games. i like the game because it gives gamers more of a competitive challenge.",1
"im beginning to dislike dota. the new bloom festival has lots of bugs. my friends and i have been waiting for over 2 hours and we couldnt get a match in the 10 mins that you have to find a year beast brawl. network it bad. even in the same region i had 1000ms ping. x( update 1: i have uninstalled dota 2. update 2: this link describes the things i felt while playing new bloom accurately.",2

"dota 2 is one of the most rewarding games you will ever play... that is only if you play well against the opposition wether it is bots or humans doing well can depend on multiple factors such as teamplay and soloplay. i would reccomend doing a couple of bot matches before jumping into online as the people you are with can be quite hostile if you screw up to many times. i would reccomend dota 2 to anyone looking for a fun challenging game that rewards you for every correct move. 10/10",1

"unbalanced. developers keep goin on making the common heroes with cosmetics, meanwhile there are still heroes who doesnt get any cosmetics.",2
"this is a well done game i must say. i didnt expect the community to be so competetive and the gameplay intense. 9/10",1
"really cluncky, and has some serious balance issues. the only advantage of this game over other mobas is the community, however the community can only do so much. the mechanics and the whole low prio system dont do anything for it. i really with they would improve the movement in the game, perhaps by implementing a system like another moba league of legends. over all i would say its worth a play, considering that it is on steam and the chances are you mates will be playing it, but i do believe its possition on steam, and the whole nostalgia thing gives this game more popularity than it deserves. 4.5/10 worth a play, but not the greatest game. 6.5/10 if your playing with firends.",1

"most addictive competivite strategy game out there. love what theyve done in terms of updating dota to a more modern, smoother feeling game.",3
"originally a warcraft 3 mod, this highly influential arena style game has inspired many spin offs including the acclaimed league of legends. unlike league of legends however, you can control all 112 heroes when you buy the game, and there is no pay to win features at all; all bonus items are purely cosmetic and for fun. the community can even create content that can be acquired in game! the only shortcoming to dota is that it will be a little more difficult to pick up compared to league of legends. given the chance however, dota2 will prove to be a much more balanced and skill-oriented experience, with meaningful item and ability selection and a more dynamic gold farming game which both provide superior short and long term strategic gameplay. try the one that started it all, you wont be disappointed!",1

"trial by fire. straight up. youre going to learn exceptions to the rule by being killed by them, and its going to happen a lot. dota is the most brutal learning curve of any game ive ever played. sometimes in a well-done fashion, sometimes not. there are few games where i can honestly say that at 300 hours you have barely any true idea what youre doing. amazingly complex game! tons of fun, especially with friends. not a casually oriented game at all, but enormously entertaining to play and watch. no grind, no microtransactions that affect gameplay in any way. no outside advantages, no premade skills. everything happens in game and you need to be quick on your feet. try it out! just be warned that properly trying it out will take hundreds of hours. relax, youre doing fine.",3

"approaching 2100 hours played...wow. while i do completely agree with the reviews that talk about how bad the community is, i have to say my experience of dota on the whole has been very enjoyable. the mute option is great, i insta-mute anyone talking crap. admittedly dota has an incredibly high learning curve, and you will often find high level players playing on noob accounts so even the early matches for new players can be brutal. if you can push through the first couple of hundred hours of games ;) and ignore the torrent of expletives thrown your way when you let the team down!; you will find dota 2 to be a: competitive, intense, challenging, and completely engaging experience.",4

"dota 2 isnt easy, its not a game where a simple tutorial would be enough. you need to apply yourself and have the will to get better. its a game of mastery, no matter how skilled you are you will always learn something in it. it isnt about how quick you are, but how much you know. its the same map, every game but what happens in it is always differnet. it literally never gets boring.",5

"they say its not about winning. their right. and hopefully others know this too so what your getting into is fun. its not as much of a social game as it is an arena figther. but should be more social. + easy to pick up + microtransactions are legit and wont destroy your wallet + strategy develops with slow learning curve + flying donkeys - disconnections in early-level-gamers makes games redundant sometimes - thats all i can think of. didnt fully get into the game, but i;ve seen enough. and heard enough. and read up on it enough to safely say as a free game, its just as addictive as counter strike (also by valve), and it is easy to pick up and play when your low. it might turn into crack. but theres a focus group for that.",1

"this is one of the most popular games of all time because this is not just a game. friendship, e-sport, respect, motivation, life, teamwork, skill, experience, responsibility, cultures and so many other can be found in this three lanes battle of 10 heroes. in dota 2 everything is in balance. dota 2 is free to play and you dont need money to buy heroes. there is a lot of customizations but they have no effect in game. you cannot pay to win. so, you may ask what does a hero truly need to get the victory... that is for you to decide. i have been playing dota since 2008. but i am not a pro, i am just a fan. thank you icefrog you are amazing. and thank you gabe.",4

"this is very high quality game. graphics are very detailed and good. but still, you can play on low quality and enjoy. the thing about this game is, that while starting , you wait too much time : match searching and player waiting. players often fail to connect. second thing, if you like rpg games, the fact that someone can be first and take the hero that you like, want will be terrible. and to be short, if you dont have enough free time to spend (40 min-1hour) on match, dont start it, if you leave , you wll recieve abandon and ruin your teams game (butin reality no one knows is it ruining or helping , couse in late game, money is everything and your money will be spreaded between your teammates). so yea you should try this game if you like competition and sometimes rage :)",1

"what makes dota 2 such a fun and enjoyable game? well ask yourself this. is it fun to go around the map ganking people that dont know how to play, yet they are playing heros such as viper, phantom assasin, or bloodseeker? then this game is for you. having such a wonderful map to play on that clearly has time and effort put into it, just makes it a +1. having access to 109 (as of now) characters at your finger tips is great. there are so many heros to practice at and find the one that is just right for you. rather then dropping $45 on riot points which you can then waste to get a champion that you dont even like. i would over all say this game is a solid. 0/10",2

"way way way more depth than league of legend (lol), steeper learning curve, higher skill cap and alot more balancing / fair play. has some similarities to hon but overall feels like a really different game. i love both but dota 2 feels more competitive and has a bit more interesting heroes + the balancing is better (except riki). i would recommend this game if youre into something that requires you to actually think and use your brain unlike lol. i personally prefer hon out of all the mobas but that might just be cause i started with it, dota 2 comes close as second. 9/10",2

"an excellent moba, and theres little wonder that its the most popular game on steam at the moment. the fact that the 100+ heroes are unlocked off the start means that theres plenty of gameplay variety even if the actual modes are a bit lacking, and the amount of depth is pretty staggering. saying that, the community is absolutely wretched, and undoubtably the worst part of the game. this is the type of game where the more sensitive among us will want to turn off voice and text chat in order to enjoy some hassle-free fun. the free-to-play model is perhaps the best in the industry, even better than tf2s, and you can play the entire game without spending a cent and not feel restricted in any way compared to a paying player. truly a mastercraft in just about every regard.",1
"dota 2 is a unique moba game that is for me a balanced game that some other mobas are not that balanced and it also changes its game depending on the changelog or nerfs that for me will not bore me to play it for a long time and the matchmaking in ranked is also helping us to change our playstyles depending on you mmr that will help you to be a better player as you go to ranked and i would really recommend it because dota 2 is a good game and it will be a waste if some people dont know about dota 2.",3

"as such, you should not expect to have fun your first day playing... or even your first week. that sounds like a cardinal sin of gaming, but theres method to this madness. in short, dota 2 is a deeply layered construct of systems, and to survive you need to understand every single one and how they interact with one another. everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own ai units to deny the enemy experience points and gold theyd get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of complex abilities like bloodseekers rupture (which deals",2

"a unique and epic follow-up to the old and infamous dota, that not only lives up to a really long-built reputation, but surpasses its predecessor in every possible way. riskier, faster, stronger, more rewarding, frustrating at times, but funnier nonetheless. and maybe what tends to be in the eyes of the gamer a flaw and a massive drawback, might perhaps and personally be the games greatest characteristic that will only keep reinventing itself viciously in terms of endless gaming; its very hard to learn, considering that after taking years for one to accustom themselves in every dirty, tricky and veteran way of dota 2, they might have a long way ahead in order to truly master it. but, can this really happen? -",3

"this game will beat the living crap out of you when you start. but if you give it time, it becomes one great game for you to play over and over again. all the heroes are free to play to begin with so youll find a character that fits your playstyle. there are plenty of tactics and items for you so you will not get the same experience. there are also the cosmetics that cn make your characters unique. you can buy them, or you can play matches and earn them by completing them. it is a game that will be addictive but it is good none the less.",3

"it is an amazing game but there are two very negative points about it. one of them, and the most prominant one, is the lack of optimization for the mac version. the mac version, simply put, sucks. it does not do justice that this version is so incredibly buggy on the osx operating system. plus, when moving the camera on the top part of the display when in full screen on osx, the game glitches as it is invoking the status bar.",1

"with so many mobas out there. which one is the best? well i cant answer that question for you, but i can tell you how great this game is. first off, this game has a steep learning curve, so if you prefer mindless action games, then this isnt for you. once you get past the learning curve however, thats when things start to get really fun. dive in to this action packed game as you battle other people across 3 lanes in a team based enviroment. there is literally next to no grinding in this game, everyone starts at level 1 in each game, so the only real question is, how far are you willing to go to become the best? watch other people play with in the in-built game viewer, and study a libary of heroes as you progressively become better. dont worry about people calling you a noob when you first play, because they were also noobs once! just ignore them and enjoy the rest of the game.",1

"showed me russians are  ,impolite,trolls. 10/10 would bang again.",2
"incredibly addicting. the gameplay itself is fun and engaging. it is played with a team of 5 characters with unique sets of skills and abilities versus another group. it is definitely a team effort to win the game. a single match would take about 40 to 60 minutes. customization of some aspects of the game adds another spice to the in-game play. characters costume sets, items, screensvers and skins and other dlcs which can be bought or traded at the steam market would keep the avid player own the characters. over all the game is exciting and fun. i give it 10 out of 10.",1

"are you peaceful, calm and collected? do you like to shy away from anger? do you want to become a more assertive, more aggressive person? well dota 2 teaches you a unique skillset, one that allows you to speak to foreingors in a more assertive manner. it allows you to be aggressive towards players that need a little guidance, and most of all, it is a more statistically viable option for inducing a stroke than having children is! yay for anger issues!!",4

"i recommend it to everybody in the world of this game",1
"this is no game - this is an addiction. its a very tough game which provides new stuff to learn even after 2.000 hours of playing it. though its very hard to get into game mechanics, it is a necessary thing to do a decent job in this game. but its absolutely worth it! dota offers so many intensive moments and chances to turn everything around, matches which are obviously lost or won... despite that, ive met some nice and precious people which i never want to miss again.",3
"hard beginning, forcing you to learn, if you survive the starting phase you will love it",3
"ive been a lover of dota since the allstar days. used to take extreme pride in my .wc3 dota files...had quite a few. let me tell you people that ive played a lot of games and this is the only one that makes my heart pound out of my chest. not every match of dota 2 spikes my adrenaline but when it does happen it makes all the hard times way more than worth it. this game is not for the weak. it is for those who will stop at nothing to achieve victory. this aspect extendes beyond the 1010001001s right into the human psyche.",2
"this game is good .. strategic and good for learning good english.... this game is fun and good to play tho :d!!",2

"the free tool to learn languages such as: spanish,russian and german!",1
"this game is so great and addictive! but lots of noobs and peenoise. >.<",1
"in my opinion, invoker is the most entertaining hero in dota 2! he is also the most complex hero and has one of the highest potential skill cap. play invoker if you have enough patience and will to learn this masterful hero!",4

"i love dota! dota 2 aswell! very good game, soo many techniques on how to play your own build and soo much more!",3
"fun and full of magic and wonders to discover. this is the grand sequel of dota 1, meaning that it is well improved in all aspects. it is a great way to kill time and socialize. yet new player may face hard times due to the fact that there are people out there that cuss alot. still... my guild and i love this game. yes, thumbs up.",2

"i have a freind that just moved from russia he says that people who speak english are invading their servers...",1
"i dont see why people say that this game makes you hate russians. it has only made me prejudiced against tiny imp-like creatures with permanent invisibility, bloated corpses with hooks and chains, and immortal blood elves that send meteors from halfway across the map. 10/10 would have my head pwned again edit windranger is my waifu. nobody can have her. new edit nevermind, phantom assassin is my waifu now",1

"this game have best purposes, such as thinking how to work well as team and how to win every match which played with good strategy",3
"millions of people play dota 2 everyday. dont you want to know why its so popular? play it yourself to understand :)",3
"defense of the ancients 2 (dota 2) is by far one of the best games you can play, especially if you enjoyed league of legends. the difference between the latter game and the former (aside from the obvious, such as developer), is the fact that dota 2 reinvents the game and innovates it by giving it the valve touch. not only are the heroes (the equivalent of champions in lol) all fun to play and the other players fun to play with, but the system of commendation, reporting, leveling, and item acquirance are all unique and effectively made. overall, this is an amazing game to play and once you try it out (and you undoubtedly will try it out at some point), youll be glad you did.",1
"dota 2 is many things to many people: its a great way to kill an afternoon with friends; its a spectator sport platform with its own item-betting scene; its a hobby; its a profession, and a way to make a living. it isnt perfect and likely never will be, as each update tends to fix bugs and introduce new ones, and the tutorial could certainly use some work. however, with zero cost to play and one of the highest skill ceilings of any game ive ever encountered, dota 2 is a modern multiplayer masterpiece.",1
"love this game the hero skills & items....theres nothing to dislike:)",3
"i love this game more than i love anyone..the best ing game ever!",1
"this is is so awesome cant take away your boredom.",2
"awesome game. highly recommend. pros: - constantly changing - regular balancing updates - highly strategic cons: - sucks away my soul",1
"initially, i really dont know about this moba game even in the previous form (dota 1), but when my friend played this game in my house, i became interested with this game so i download it my self and started to play it. you know what? now i got addicted in this game. lol *btw i wrote this review in order to complete my badges lol",2

"its a good game , where i can relax after school :d",3
"i dont like it when people put dead animals in games not cool bethesda",1
"you havent lived until you have played a proper moba. and dota is the place to start.",1
"i had a girlfriend and money before this game. aside from that , the game is different from all the other free to play games. you get to choose from a huge amount of heroes and set your own way of playing. on top of a hero you use items to furthure adavance your hero. matches can be 5v5 or 1v1 and you can even do bot matches if you hate human interactions. pros ~hero pool ~abilites ~combat ~bots are actual not horrible cons ~not many different maps ~hard to learn ~fast paced ~cannot pause it overall 8/10 worth the price . free of course.",1
"the game can be played at any skill level but the beauty is that at higher levels there is so much depth that no two games are ever alike. the only issue is that it is difficult to improve without having someone (friendly) better than you who will actively call out your mistakes; in dota 2, ignorance is not bliss.",1
"hands down the most tactical and rewarding multiplayer experience ive ever had. however, that comes at the cost of a steep learning curve, going from beginner baby mode tutorials to you have died 20 times and your whole team is calling you homophobic slurs. playing a few tutorials and bot matches, however, should prepare you to be an asset to your team and fully enjoy the game.",1
"this game is addicting that is all peaceim going to play it now",2
"good game if you need reflections and yyou like moba games. in the begining its hard to learn but fun to play",1
"this is an awesome game that uses alot of strategy. why do i say so its because you a playing against people around the continent and you do not know them therefore you wouldnt know how incredible they are or even useless. thumbs up!!!",2
"i super liked this game coz 50% life steal hahahaha!",2
"great game, if you dont mind being pummeled into the ground for the first 100 or so hours.",1
"dota 2 is a perfect moba game it is easy to learn but hard to master, updates are comming in regulary and everything is fine about the except its community, players feed on purpose cause the dont get mid lane or because nobody bought a courier or because someone took their hero, the player gets reported and banned and he just makes another account and plays again! 10/10 for game 1/10 for players",1
"i play this game on a casual basis and enjoy it. while i like lol, i highly prefer this. i dont know what it is, but i prefer the artstyle, the heroes and he pace. id recommend this game and also tell you to use the guide option of the game.",1
"can be a bit difficult to get to learn, but if you put the time into learnnig then it is brilliant. espacially when you have a team of friends to play with as tactics play a huge part in winning.",1

"such game! much rage! very skill! wow! -games aight,graphics are legit you can run it without a need of a powerful pc,hero pool is like wow! by the time you master all of them youll also learn russian if on eu and brazillian if on us and some ching chong on sea oh and youll hear a few bogans on australia.in short: -common rage quits -low p 4 life -very team play -wow -best russian dictionary ever!",3
"this is honest rating of doatblo 2. first, metagame is like cat have mexican food and  all over you white carpet. second, speaking of mexican food! there are 99.9999999999999999% of player are mexican from south america who will come into north america server to play! they are dog!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! third! do not buy this game it is pure !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1

"this is a really fun moba game that keeps you satisfied, and it never gets boring, no matter what you do.",1
"this game is great,it just needs good teamwork with team.lovely. a+++",1
"dota2 is hard to pick up, it has quite the learning curve. completing the tutorial will not get you ready for online play, and like any team based game youll get a lot of negative feedback from your team mates just for being new. dont let this discourage you! everyone started fresh at some point, take it with a grain of salt. there are over a hundred heros to choose from. i recommend playing a few games, seeing who does well and what you like about that here, then looking for other heros to start playing with. there are great hero tutorials all over the internet, if you have your eye on someone, check out a video of a pro playing them. itll help you understand what makes that hero great. dota2 is a great game, and ive met some really cool people in my short time playing. practice makes perfect, and this game is no exception.",2
"i never understood why i keep playing this game... dislike it if you disliked it, like it if you liked it... diskiked it?- still logging in and play the game hahaha.. liked it?- keep on playing the game hehehe....",4
">picks chen >spam test of faith >rage insues >reported to hell >0 k 20 d >gg wp 10/10 its ok",1
"dota 2 is by far the hardest to learn game i have ever played. however, it is one of the most fun. if youre new to dota, and you want to get better, you have three options: 1. practice bot games over and over using a ton of guides and such until you can consistantly beat unfair bots no problem. 2. play a ton of games with more experienced friends (this way is the most fun). make sure that theyre close friends, because they will teach you, but if you dont listen to them and keep dying or buying bad items or whatever, theyll hate playing with you. so listen to your teachers! 3. play games on your own and try your best, and end up being yelled at by four different people at the same time (9 if youre lucky). but if you get through the learning phase, this game becomes amazing. its an awesome strategic game to play with friends. youll win some and youll lose some, but its free and fun, so what the heck.",1
"this game is awesome in all aspect and makes me want to play it more and more hands down to its creators and all the persons behind this awesome game !",1
"ruined my life. 10/10. i dont support so go to hell you prick.",3
"ive been playing dota 1 for 3 years and dota 2 for one year, it hasnt bored me yet and i dont think it ever will. the near infinite possiblities and options mean the game is always fresh.",1
"i love this game it relived my stress.. i play this game every day , every morning i wake up , after eating .. it become part of my life and i want to learn more about this game",3
"this game is sick! i am one of those guys who really doesnt like rpgs/mmorpgs or mobas. at first, i was like bored and so on. but after you understand the basics of this game and after you play more than 30 hours, dota 2 will get more interesting! definetly recommending this game to people, who arent really interested in this video game genre. download it now! you wont regret it :) 8/10 i gave 8/10, because there are some community members from a certain country who can destroy you mood :(",1
"a good game to play when you feel like you just want to punch somebody in the face :d",1
"dota 2 is a very good game, if you can control yourself and don`t get addicted, great game.",2
"no matter what server you pick, there are always russians.",2
"i really like this game! it has a good teamwork aspect, and the fact that there are so many different types of characters allows for everybody to have a perfect one. its also really great that its free! i definately recomend this game, its very fun and a good thing to play if you only have an hour or so. (although if its a good match it can go on for a looong time)",1
"one of the most addictive games ive played, at first you rage at the game because its a very difficult game to play. but a spark flys and you absoloutly love it!. only flaw at the time of this recommendation is that the report system is a bit...rough... but please bare in mind this is still only a beta and things will improve!! if you want a team based game this game if for you! each hero has their own strength and weaknesses, there are different roles, carry, support, nuker are to name just a few of the many skill builds that you can choose on one of the heroes you may pick. i would give this 9.5/10 because of the trolls that you encounter in game, who report you for not talking russian on and english speaking server.",4
"dota 2 is one of those games that gets better every time i play it. even though its played on the same map every time, every game is still different one way or another. there are over 100 heroes to play as, which makes the game incredibly complex. ive put about 100 hours in to dota 2, and i still have no idea what half of them do. some focus on healing, others focus on beating the crap out of everything. its a fun and frustrating game, but mostly fun. it has a giant learning curve, so prepare to put alot of time into this one. the game is excellent. (9/10 or 90%)",1
"best realtime strategic moba game! endless posibilities and the only limitation is the player. 10/10",1
"looking for fun game, good community, finite awesome items, tactical and teamwork communication, and business with the others. try this awesome multiplayer online battle arena [moba]!",2
"when i played this game i realized three things: 1. edward was a vampire. 2. jacob was an lycan. 3.sand king is da best. when sand king drops the bass, the world becomes a new place. 10/10, would drop bass again. edit: this is the actual review: dotes is a game of pure hatred and competition, but the occasional one game where your team snatches victory from the jaws of defeat is what keeps everyone going. oh, and learning to play invoker and meepo, they keep us going too. although i do really hate the lack of fun, the competition is a joy in itself.",2
"it is a fun game if you can handle the community. just like most moba games best played with friends however",1
"this game teaches you fundamental life skills such as laziness, fear of going outside, anger, and last but not least, racism. /10 would recommend",1
"dota can be described in two words fun and annoying. dota is a game that not only helps you with your team work but also gets you closer to your friends as you work together to win the match. although that might seem cool dota is also a stressful game that when you screw up everybody on the server screams at you calling you noob etc. trust me this will happen. i rate dota 2 a: 9/10 this game is a masterpiece",1
"this is the best game for me. regardless of what other says. so please, let us play against bot even when we are offline, just like before. it is a great past time to train/harness our tactics and build up skills during practices.",4
"this game is the best since its first release on the firest version of dota",1
"other players who keeps on saying gg in an early game and those players whos throwing and spoiling the game and think theyre pro. put tank in a mall  sohai but overall its the best game yet.",2

"when i was updating dota 2, my pc was forcely shut down due to technical problems. and when i opened my steam after technical problems were solved, my dota 2 was uninstalled and it wasnt a problem to me cause i was in a good mood and had a long patience. so i re-installed dota 2, and whenever i pause the download in order to shutdown my pc for some work to do, i thought that the amount of data installed (ex.2.5gb) would remain but after i turned on my pc and checked resumed the download of my dota 2. the amount of data installed went down to mb and i was frustated to this, and my point is that is there a problem in the steam and i want to know why my dota 2 was uninstalled without doing it manually (ex. through control panel, etc.)",1

(although if its a good match it can go on for a looong time)",1
"one of the most addictive games ive played, at first you rage at the game because its a very difficult game to play. but a spark flys and you absoloutly love it!. only flaw at the time of this recommendation is that the report system is a bit...rough... but please bare in mind this is still only a beta and things will improve!! if you want a team based game this game if for you! each hero has their own strength and weaknesses, there are different roles, carry, support, nuker are to name just a few of the many skill builds that you can choose on one of the heroes you may pick. i would give this 9.5/10 because of the trolls that you encounter in game, who report you for not talking russian on and english speaking server.",4

"cold, harsh, unforgiving, abusive, and immensely rewarding. these are a few of the words you could use to describe dota 2s community and gameplay. dont come in expecting to be coddled by the veterans of this moba. its trial by fire, sink or swim, live or die, but what the game lacks in a compassionate backing it more than makes up for in the satisfaction of utterly outplaying the opposing team or coming together at the end to pull off an underdog victory!",3

"its such a team game, at times can be the most fun ive had since mw2 back in jr. high and other times it can be the most brutally antagonizing game ever, very love-hate, but all in all its a great game, can be a little addictive and a bit of a home wrecker at times, and when it says free to play it truly is free to play, though to stand out in the community you can make in game purchases that will change the default model of your selected hero... great community, though sometimes it can match you up with people who cannot speak the same language as you for in most cases us servers are a better choice for those closer to the borders of the us ie canada and mexico. and if you plan to have a decently ranked 5 man team you better practice cause next thing you know your matched up with a 5 man korean team that will make you regret ever inviting the 4th or 5th player.",2

"very confusing even if you think you know a bit about mobas from playing league of legends. not recommended for people with no patience. i think this game is more complex and league of legends even if it feels a little less responsive. definitely a higher skill ceiling as well. fun if you can get into it, frustrating and anger-inducing if you cant.",1
"you constantly learn new stuff about this game. infuriating at times, but rewarding in the end. amazing depth and many different ways to be successful, teamplay and playing with thought are very important though. extremely few games have as much depth as this game has.",4

"played it only a little but i can say its a good game with wonderful community. you can queue anywhere in the world, for example, mother russia, east russia, west russia, united states of russia, down under russia and asia. you can easily get to know many russians and their beautiful language through vocal interaction with some of the smartest russians youll ever meet in your life. .",4
"i dont recommend if youre stupid and dont understand that getting killed by the enemy is bad. also, when someone says shut the  up, they dont expect you to start singing in ing russian while you get your friend to scream harder! trust me, its not fun to deal with people like that.",1

"dota 2 is truly a game for skilled players and takes true dedication and practice.. dota 2 is a game where you have two teams, dire and whatever that other thing is, and a large array of characters and gear.. the only problem about gear is that you need it to suit your kind of character, an example would be that mages require wisdom and archers need agility! i played this game a fair bit, so i have lets say, moderate skills.. im a big range guy. but anyways back to the point. dota 2 is wonderful for a f2p game, and can really bring out the inner gamer in you. along with its entertaining feel, it can unlock a land of oppurtunities such as the championships.. this game deserves a whopping 9.5/10 which trasnlates to a gold in my rating system..",1
"once you get enough practice youll want more and more. pushing your self more and more for every game, finding new strategies, perfecting your heroes. all of this makes to a perfect moba giving you endless hours of fun.",1

"i have a few hours and im still learning how to deal with the s that lurk in the world of dota.",3
"dota 2 is possibly one of the best game valve has made based on the original dota mod from warcraft iii: frozen throne. many balance changes, including item drops, events, and even cool stuff to collect. you know your heroes well, use them to keep the distinction against your foes and bring their ancient down, either raidiant or dire. i like to play this again and now i do it. i reccommend this to anyone who played dota before or any rts/rpg player who wants to take the challenge. 10/10 from neil, almost 3 years steam veteran",1
"great for playing with friends, bore several times but then becomes a habit win or lose, the important thing is the fun",4

"yes, i recommend this game to my relative & my friend. this game full of strategy, thats need people to think, strategies, create a teamwork to a victory. just like reality life, if we want to achieve our goal, we cant do it alone. we need teammate, teamwork to achieve the goal. same with dota 2, its create teamwork, close the relationship, prove the strength of relationship, trust & doubt. one thing that i dislike is, dont too addicted to game, you can spend gaming around 2-3 hours. spend another quality hour with your family, your parent, your wife, your kids too. overall, i recommend this game to reduce your stress, dont push yourself if you are about to lose a game.. dont worry, its just a game. no people will blame you.. cheers to all dota 2 gamers.. :)",1

"as a player of league of legends, dota 2 really surprised in a positive way. for a long time, id never heard of dota, but id been playing lol for a long time. at first, i didnt think it would be worth my time. i mean, im already playing league right? but i was wrong. dota 2 and lol are both good games in their own game. there are things i like better about lol, and there are things i like better about dota 2. overall, no matter what you prefer, dota 2 at least deserves your chance with all the supportive people playing it already.",1

"this is one of the most popular games of all time because this is not just a game. friendship, e-sport, respect, motivation, life, teamwork, skill, experience, responsibility, cultures and so many other can be found in this three lanes battle of 10 heroes. in dota 2 everything is in balance. dota 2 is free to play and you dont need money to buy heroes. there is a lot of customizations but they have no effect in game. you cannot pay to win. so, you may ask what does a hero truly need to get the victory... that is for you to decide. i have been playing dota since 2008. but i am not a pro, i am just a fan. thank you icefrog you are amazing. and thank you gabe.",4

"the place you learn to love russians and make new, happy friendships.",2
"dota 2 popped my moba cherry, and what an experience its been. at first i was skeptical, there is only one map, one objective for every game. but the vast array of heros, items and builds open up a world of possibility, add this to the four other team members you have to be able to work effectively with and it can give hours (338 and counting) of enjoyment, frustration and everything in between as you work towards knocking down the enemy ancient and the hope for reward. for the chance of better team play, try ranked. the games will be harder, but the reward of a higher mmr makes people more willing to work together (or innundate your chat box with colourful slurs).",1
"i have never played mobas, so i was very confused when there did not pop up some kind of tutorial or something (in such a game!?). so i just joined a (random?) game and went into full rage mode within seconds. looks like it is not newbie-friendly. never again, thank god it was free.",1

"i just wanna suggest a little adjustment here, and i think the staff and members of this game will take my suggestion in order to promote a better community and a more proper treating towards the players. the only suggestion i would like to give is that, make the game learn how to differentiate blackout or brown-out from abandoning because players gets low priorities for extremely poor reason, and now those players who have low prios would keep on having low prios if the blackout is rotational and comes in unexpectedly, and because of this, many players are having discomfort and depression towards the events because they cant join in the game because of the blasted low-prios of no valid reasons. please, if you see this, you may now start improving the community and the system of low-priority. thanks. btw, great game.",1

"i have had so many good and bad times playing dota 2. i met the best friends ever and made mortal enemies of total strangers. i lerned to rise and fall, to bask in the glory of victory, and lingered in the shadow of defeat. yes it is just a game but it is a game that challenges your mental apptitude and stamina:it is ever changing and evolving. timing and teamwork are crucial is this game. i hope you had as much fun as i did. i am not sure i have ever been sad to move on from a game: it was a pleasure and a pain to play with you all you random random people. dota 2 will always hold a special place in my heart. ad-v op gg no re valve pls nerf.",4

"a very addictive game that will take over your life with its incredibly fun playstyle",2
"i have to admit its a pretty fun game, after playing it for a while, it really does feel like most of the heroes are completely unbalanced. if youre going against an experienced team or even higher difficulty bots, youre bound to struggle and get frustrated. im kind of on and off with this game, but i uninstalled and really dont feel like playing again. new players are going to find this game hard to play, especially when matched with more experienced players, it takes time to even figure out what to do most of the game after starting and before ending. everyone should at least try it!",1

"at first i thought that mobas in general were terrible, i played the dota 2 tutorial and played ten matches then uninstalled the game. i really didnt like playing the game because every time i played i was shouted at and put in low priority. about a year later after my friends insisted that i play i started afresh and managed to quickly find my feet and dota 2 is now one of my favourite all time games. the steep learning curve makes dota 2 hard to get into but after you start understanding tactics and mastering characters it becomes an amazing game. the hundreds of characters, items, playstyles, etc. make every game fresh and exciting. if you manage to make your way out of the (noob/pinoy) bracket of players then suddenly the game opens up with possibilities and becomes one of the best games that i have ever played. it will keep you entertained for years and years.",1
"for anyone wanting to play this game, prepare for it to suck your soul away!(in a good sense.) the gameplay is addictive and no two matches are the same. however, the gameplay is diffrent from most games in the sense of the stratagy and the skills of your hero. essentially, theres two teams of 5 heros in the game, and the battle out in 3 lanes, im not going to explain these terms, as thats something you should see for yourself, or reasearch for yourself if you want to know more. 10/10: game of the year all day everyday.",1
"i hate this game so much. it has taken my life away from me. i lost everything, my home, my family, my friends do not get hooked to this game. i am very depressed and wish someone could kill me. 10/10 would not play this game.",5

"the basketball equivalent of esports, with a company behind it that owns the dominating distribution platform for video games. the same company which happened to snag up the original creator of dota, and granting him a golden shower of two dollar bills. what could go wrong? the tutorial is an embrassasment at worse, and at best a testament to the fact that its hard to get in to this game. frankly given the sh*t tutorial, mindset of your average player (including players frequently triggering teammates to spite them) and the learning cliff of this game, im amazed this game isnt exculsively played by a tiny majority of unhinged players.",3

"i like that it`s addictive , that every game has its own style, that you have to play and know every single hero`s spells and items and that once / year you find nice ppl to play with.",4
"best described as super chess in space there is a bit of a learning curve if youve never played dota or a dota-clone. once you get over it though, you realize how beautiful the teamwork, heroes, and items all combine to make this a great game of wits.",5
"this game is simply one of the masterpiece of our era. this game require you a lot of time- in order to play rightly. do not play this game if you have lack of will, because to be honest the community is not that good. and some of them usually blame even if they dont play good. but trust me once you get friends, this game is one of the greatest game that combine strategy, synchronization, and also providing amazing gaming experience at the same time. if you like a game that asking you to act spontaneously in real time while demanding for strategies at the same time. this game is made for you. 10/10 for me. never get enough since 6 year ago, since the defense of the ancient:allstars era :)",3

"good game , it involves strategy, teamwork , and experience . actually dota2 is just a improved version of dota1 with better graphics . it also one of the most recognized game in the world. the most important thing is the game is f2p(free to play), and theres no p2w(pay to win) elements. its all about skills the important thing to play dota is you need to keep up with the current meta and playstyle, since theres a lot of changes every update , make sure you read the changelog after every updates",4

"this is very high quality game. graphics are very detailed and good. but still, you can play on low quality and enjoy. the thing about this game is, that while starting , you wait too much time : match searching and player waiting. players often fail to connect. second thing, if you like rpg games, the fact that someone can be first and take the hero that you like, want will be terrible. and to be short, if you dont have enough free time to spend (40 min-1hour) on match, dont start it, if you leave , you wll recieve abandon and ruin your teams game (butin reality no one knows is it ruining or helping , couse in late game, money is everything and your money will be spreaded between your teammates). so yea you should try this game if you like competition and sometimes rage :)",1

"worst game, would not play over 3k hours of it or base my steam profile around it.",4
"awesome moba game that its prior version sparked the growth of mobas in general. dota was a mod for warcraft 3 and soon became a major reason for the purchase of that game. dota 2 is a standalone that has better graphics and is still being updated with new heroes from the old game and with new game modes. it is fun for new people to try out since there is a tutorial system that teaches you the basics of the game. plus they also added a coaching system where you can directly talk with your coach during a game to learn things from them. very awesome game and it is free to play, so good reason to try out. graphics: 9 - awesome graphics especially going from the original mod sound: 9 - great sound gameplay: 9.5 - great gameplay, need so much awareness story: no story",2

"this is an awesome game but the new update keeps the game from crashing everytime i open it. i suggest valve to pls fix this bug. i really want to play it.",2
"well, great game. most of valve games are good games. but you should learn the russian language, because at least on europe servers 9 out of 10 players are usualy russians and wont or cant speak any other language. this problem is known to valve for years now, but valve loves the russians, no money but they count as players you know ;)",3

"the greatest competitive game of action and strategy that ive ever played !! and the best way to ruin your real social life",2
"the game is free so yeah, what can you lose? it can be fun to play but it can be horrible sometimes. and yea that depends on a lot of things. communication is the key and if u play casually you will find out that in most games no one speaks in your team. just pinging and commands. or they start speaking in some foreign language ( blyet) and that will not help at all. in the ranked games its a little bit better. the learning phase can be long but if you have some experiences with other mobas it wont be that tough. basically the game itself has no problems if you ask me. the problem is with the community of the game.",3
"played a bit of dota once and it was kind of boring. it taught me all about multicultural diversity, and then made me hate everything and everyone about that race. i now refer to every one of my friends as  and constantly throw blyat into sentences. this game is social suicide. i havent played much, but holy crap its horrible. 10/10.",1

"this is a good game, however i dont like the concept of being paired with noobs. it totally ruins the game, you play with people that is not in the same skill level and you tend to lose more than to win most of your games. you should change the way how your system finds a match for an individual it should be people who win will be paired with people who win, and those who lose alot play amongst themselves. i cant believe that when you go solo match there are people who are in a party? whats that about? i believe that you can never learn common sense, you are born with that talent. you should hire developers that have common sense if you want this game of yours appreciated by dota2 and non dota2 players. most likely if non dota2 players find the enviroment in that kind of manner i believe that this game will be undisputedly number 1 in rtsgaming",3

"smooth gameplay for a moba, easy to learn, you play the same map over and over, but each time it feels completely different as different combinaions of ally and enemy heros makes each match unique and fun. unfortunately, the game has one downfall: it is way too addictive and most matches last one hour long :/ so it is easy to waste days playing dota 2, but it is worth it :p",2
"best game ever. trust me, you will never get bored out of this one.",1
"having played the original dota i was a bit sceptic about this release. before i played it i thought it looks a bit too glossy. but now, around 40 games later, i must say that the feel is very similar and even the gameplay itself is nearly the same - but better looking and easier to handle. i find it hard to go back, and of this i was pretty sure i would. whoever developed this should be proud of themselves. an old great game just got a new suit!",2

"the most engrossing game i have ever played. i started playing the game thinking that i probably wouldnt like it and would stop after a game or two. 300+ hours later here i am, still improving and still learning all the subtleties of the game that only experience can give you. a very steep learning curve requires you to play several games before you can even get the basic mechanics down, not to mention the hours it will take to learn the nuances of all the heroes and items, and how they interact with each other. once you can get past the initial wall, it is a game that can be played for hours on end, and doesnt seem to have an end in sight, as its gameplay seemingly will carry on years into the future. plus its free, so why not?",1
"aaaah, this game, remember when my brother suggested it to me. i said yeah why not. ive been playing since last year, the game is awesome, it has changed a lot since i started playing it, if you have or havent ever played a moba before. dota is an awesome option, a great game to jump in and enjoy.",3

"too many peruvians and dont know what server their supposed to play on",2
"the game is a arts (action real time strategy) and the game is free of charge considering that it costed alot to make, the dlc isnt overpowered as it is only to customize character design. once you get the basic fundamentals of the game down, its up to practice to decide how good you are, but in all cases its definately a fun game which should cost you about 20 dollars but is free of charge, another great game by valve. 8.5/10",3

(no preference on either game, i think bot of them are good) give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. try it out, its free and badass!",2

"it is ing boring. slow gameplay which i was tired of after 2hrs of tutorials, a stupid inventory system, microtransactions are always rubbed in your face and, at least in tutorials storylines i could have written in the 2nd grade. and then the artstyle! stolen from... wait, oh right! every second game on the market. added to that is the permanent download, as the game just keeps getiing bigger and bigger and more overfilled with  you have to pay for. it is boring and just a cash grab. go play something else, there are good f2p games out there. it took a lot of my time to download and is wasting 10gb of hard drive space.",1

"a very enjoyable game. however. the community itself is borderline tolerable at their best. they are mostly a bunch of angry and impatient teens that think their good. ive been doing my placement matches lately and for the first time i had to mute my whole team because i accidentally stole a kill (whilst i was the only one who died less than 4 times) and they wouldnt stop claiming i was trying to throw the game. i have no idea what im doing and the standard these people are way too high especially since they normally cant do it themselves. also i play support so naturally im the only one. if you want to play, play with at least 1 friend, it will help if you can tolerate at least 1 person in your game tl:dr: dota is fun but full of s. bring a friend",1
"dota 2 might seem complicatied at first but after playing a few game its really seemed easy. i highly suggest you get this game. you will never regret it!",2
"this game is good but too many trash talker.................if they trash talk they are a ing  always remember that",2
"many people argue about wether dota 2 is better or league of legends. i play both (dota more) and i wouldnt say dota is better. there are many differences between the games and the main one is strategy. in league of legends vision is required and map awareness is essential however in dota, position matters a lot more than lol. since the 4th minute on, in dota everybody is ganking around the place and tp supports are coming in to survive ganks. in lol it is a lot simpler. farm, kill, push mid. in dota you have to think, constantly watch the map, counter draft, counter build, position yourself and rotate correspondingly. in lol there are many lacking features such as, vision obstruction (hills and trees) missing, diverse range of active items and ability types. if you want a simple, just play game go for lol, but you are a a strategic player and look for osmething that truly tests your skill id recommend dota 2.",1

"at first i thought that mobas in general were terrible, i played the dota 2 tutorial and played ten matches then uninstalled the game. i really didnt like playing the game because every time i played i was shouted at and put in low priority. about a year later after my friends insisted that i play i started afresh and managed to quickly find my feet and dota 2 is now one of my favourite all time games. the steep learning curve makes dota 2 hard to get into but after you start understanding tactics and mastering characters it becomes an amazing game. the hundreds of characters, items, playstyles, etc. make every game fresh and exciting. if you manage to make your way out of the (noob/pinoy) bracket of players then suddenly the game opens up with possibilities and becomes one of the best games that i have ever played. it will keep you entertained for years and years.",1

"the game is okay, but i am naturally a reflexive gamer, not a strategy gamer. so in an fps gamers point of view, this game is fun but gets boring really quick. takes a long time to get to the action, but the action barely lasts 10 seconds (unless you have a tp scroll or whatever its called). variety of characters is good. but i find that one map gets really boring. some might disagree with what i say. heck, a lot of people will disagree with what i say, especially considering the kind of community this game has. majority of them are uncooperative, unhospitable, or trolls. all in all, good game, just doesnt really catch my interest, and horrible community. this game is only fun if you have friends to play with.",1

"this is a good game, however i dont like the concept of being paired with noobs. it totally ruins the game, you play with people that is not in the same skill level and you tend to lose more than to win most of your games. you should change the way how your system finds a match for an individual it should be people who win will be paired with people who win, and those who lose alot play amongst themselves. i cant believe that when you go solo match there are people who are in a party? whats that about? i believe that you can never learn common sense, you are born with that talent. you should hire developers that have common sense if you want this game of yours appreciated by dota2 and non dota2 players. most likely if non dota2 players find the enviroment in that kind of manner i believe that this game will be undisputedly number 1 in rtsgaming",3
