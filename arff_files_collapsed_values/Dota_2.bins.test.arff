"aaaah, this game, remember when my brother suggested it to me. i said yeah why not. ive been playing since last year, the game is awesome, it has changed a lot since i started playing it, if you have or havent ever played a moba before. dota is an awesome option, a great game to jump in and enjoy.",3
"7/10 dota 2. a bit over-rated, and extremely over-hyped during its release. if youve never had the privilege of getting sucked into a moba game for an over-extended period of time. take your chances with this free-to-play, valve-owned, cash-cow giant. and if i may recommend the best moba...its heroes of newerth.",1
"really awesome dudes try it its pretty nice for the extra credit :d.",2
"pretty much the best thing to hit the world since spandex. #yogapants . most definitely reccomended for anyone who likes these type of games",4
"hated hearing about it at first, but a good game when you play it. better than that over rated piece of crap league of legends.",3
"the best free language learner tool available on steam, and its free. i learned russian, spanish, and polish for the cheap price of nothing. this shit is tighter than rosetta stone.",2
"hard to get used to the basics, but if you persevere you will be rewarded with the best team game. youll even think this is better than sex. although the community could be annoying sometimes.",3
"great game if you have time to invest into learning the game. the game allows you to think critically and rewards you for smart gameplay.",3
"while fun once you give it time it is definitely not for people who cannot wade through a steep learning curve or new comers crossing over from other popular moba games.",1
"excellent rosetta stone alternative. already exchanging recipes with my babushka 10/10",3
"icefrog and valves brainchild, a mix of the classic dota-allstars map we all know and love backed by valves awesome source engine. this game will get you hooked in a couple of sessions, where each game is intensely packed with strategy and action. i guarantee youll keep coming back for more! with its steep learning curve it will take you hours on end to fully grasp what the game is all about, and thats what makes it so addictive, but once you learn the tools of the trade its going to be worth it.",3
"its like trying to stick to a work routine except people keep yelling at you and messing up your desk.",3
"this game is really good and well graphics to and to easy games so download it and play",4
"awesome game! it keeps me from getting bored and playing with russians is awesome!!! heavily breathing to mic, dj mic, raging, feeding, afk. capabilities of playing with russians",1
"got yelled at in russian,learned some russain, found out my mother is a , found out that i am an imbecille and that i like  and that also i should kill myself. all in one match. 11/10 best game ever , would buy if it wasnt free",1
"you might see this  installed in my friends list and go wow, you really have a moba installed? no i dont you ing weebs. i dont play this nerd  so just stop right in your  tracks if you were gonna ask me to help you get some  360 noskill points or climb out of your cardboard-cloud-9-tier whatever that you dorks do. i wont have that . i installed this dot a game because some disgusting ski-mask-wearing cockbiting chuckle put a gun to my head and said if i didnt install it then he would suicide bomb every bald eagle. we all know i dont  around when it comes to the greatest symbol of freedom on earth so i installed this dumb spaz  before punching that  in the throat and breaking his  neck and promptly washing my hard drive in bleach. because corporal jace stryker once told me i dont negotiate with cyber terrorists and i dont either god dammit. #semperfidelis",1
"its a nice and challenging game. i like the cosmetics a lot. good work valve! its my primary game!",4

"forget rosetta stone, learn russian here for free! - /10",4
"i used to be an adventurer like you until i started playing dota...",1
"this is a game which has taken hundreds of hours out of many peoples lives. it is a strtergy gae where, from a birds eye view you will fight the enemy team seeking to destroy their ancient/base. i would recommend it for anyon who likes stratergy games and doesnt hate people. if you want a truely amazing game, for free, this is for you.",2
"never before have i had such a profound hatred for other human beings. you cant leave. ive tried, and will most likely try again soon. mostly what this game has taught me is this- i am a racist bigot. everyone i know is a racist bigot. even the peruvians and russians are racist bigots. everyone is stupid. teamwork, like sleep, is a false promise. dont queue in groups of people less than 5 never go alone. seriously its that important. you will not have fun. angsty narcissistic 10 year olds exist everywhere. everyone is a noob. even you. dont delude yourself. search your feelings, you know it to be true. run.",2
"i like playing dota2 with other people from other nations. but i just dont like those who throws the game bc of you know, blah blah blah . but i still want and like to play dota2 :d",2
"great game, a lot of fun to play with your friends. has a steep learning curve. would recommend 10/10",3
"game is called defence of the ancients where team never defends, always push, and your mid lane is always mexican. techies/10",2
"this game focuses on the diverse relationships between different cultures and nationalities in a way that no other game can can. after playing dota 2, you should understand the following: - every other country is a  - if you dont speak english youre a  - if you speak english youre a  - your country is a  after you understand these concepts you should fully realize the complex nature of this game and learn to hate 99% of the worlds population. 8/10 better than lol",2
"not for the faint of heart. but as you learn, the game gets more challenging and interesting. dont listen to other people. never. especially trolls. have fun!",3
"i dont like this game at all. this game is too hard. this f@#king game, man.. this f@#king game.. i dont like this f@#king game anymore, this is the worst f@#king game ive played in my entire life. i would like to switch games now.  - sing sing in dota 2 - sing sing gets bashed",3
"dota 2 (defence of the ancients) is an online battle arena video game, it requires strategy, concentration and determination for the whole team to win a game. the only problem is it relies way too much on your teamwork. to win a game you have to destroy the opponents ancient after you level up and become powerful. killing the enemy heroes levels you up faster and gives you more gold than the creeps. because of the teamwork thing i would rate it 9/10, but yes i seriously recommend this game to everyone because it is addictive and really fun.",2
"love love love love this game, thanks for my friend always play with me. fast respon from valve make this game so good",4
"this game allows you to exert your knowledge and understanding of layered mechanics (and exceptions of those game mechanisms) onto randomly-selected regional people without their permission or interest. heated debates can lead to forged alliances to achieve that common goal or end into displaced frustration projected onto others to substitute ones own failures and inabilities to execute ones characters (heroes) qualities. on the other hand, this game allows one to create hero build guides as a pretense to be productive with his/her vexation as well as to fruitlessly raise the standard of expected knowledge of the game through item and ability walkthroughs in hopes that those one encounters in the future, rely on these indirect, serviced suggestion(s).",3
"just another  moba to be honest, games so boring and dull i spent over half my hours afk or alt tabbed or when the computer is on. i wouldnt bother with it.",3
"it started with an innocent how to play video. then a few more matches. then a few more. and then a blur and i suddenly have 139 hours logged in a months time. i think i am starting to look like lifestealer from all the time i have spent slouched over playing this game. 10/10 would play again",1
"based on satisfaction i would give this game(dota2) a 10/10..",2
"when im spend 1.5k hours on this perfect game, i need do overiew. more than 100 characters, with different cords forced to play dota 2 huge amount of time . and about him i do not regret ! tnx volve, and fix f * ckin mmr!",3
"good game wannabe; not fun; slow; ugly, no reason to play this",1
"free to play made me feel unworthy to even play this game.",2
"nice game all heroes are broken like any other mobas :)",1
"very good game playerbase is a bit... tough very addciting yet rage inducing.",2
"nice and beautiful game... strategy game and team work..",2
"i speak fillipino fluently after 2 weeks of playing it. 20/10.",1
"dota 2 is very good game that you must try playing! enjoy!",3
"the basketball equivalent of esports, with a company behind it that owns the dominating distribution platform for video games. the same company which happened to snag up the original creator of dota, and granting him a golden shower of two dollar bills. what could go wrong? the tutorial is an embrassasment at worse, and at best a testament to the fact that its hard to get in to this game. frankly given the sh*t tutorial, mindset of your average player (including players frequently triggering teammates to spite them) and the learning cliff of this game, im amazed this game isnt exculsively played by a tiny majority of unhinged players.",3
"i have an good laf with my fave buds wen playin dots 2. we do well we kill the rosan. gg. wr.",1
"two asian guys decided to stop playing and bought 20 animal couriers which they then sent into battle to die. 10/10",1
"pick it up(download dota) take me back home, yeah(buy tp when u get out of base nab!) there is nothing fair in this world(pa crits 15%, yeah sure!) there is nothing safe in this world(rikimaru safe farm, slardar blink/bash) and theres nothing sure in this world(nevermore 1100gpm) and theres nothing pure in this world(rotundjere heartstopper huskar likes) look for something left in this world(jungle creeps says: what?) start again(looking for match with high priority) come on, its a nice day for a round of dotka before drink shots of vodka --billy & pac",3
"best game ever! ive only been playing for a few months and i love it already. great gameplay, pretty good graphics, and almost all my steam friends i met off this game. really friendly community. and you may think it will be repetitive, but it definitely isnt. every game has different people. different heroes to work with. different heroes to fight against. and there are 108 different heroes to choose from. my favourite is sniper. if you love this game then join my group, ninja skilled ronins, or read my guide (and rate up), sniper (tips and builds).",1
"a big portion of my nerve system died while palying this game. i no longer can express human emotions. my friends abandoned me as i fail to laugh at their joke or show i feel them when they share some tragic news. i am working on a application that can modify my photo with my emotionless face to a state i am really at. most likely i will make billions, as kristen stewart is already on the project, so are many other famous actors (mark wahlberg, channing tatum and so on). i would recommend this game, as even if a part of you dies.... new part is always being born! sometimes new part might require a straight jacket.",2
"i cant stop playing please help please help me jk you cant stop playing too",2
"made me want to club seals in rage, 10/10 best fps",2
"great game! tons of fun to burn time and fantastic at forging friendships. 12/10 would play",3
"this game... , its almost like they invented this instead of timetravel. its insanly addictive, and time just flys by, but dam is it a good game. try not be daunted by going into it blind, there are pleanty of guids and build suggestions for new players to get the jist of the game, but there is always something new to learn , which isint a bad thing as it keeps the game fresh. oh and free? hell yes i recommend it",1
"dota2 is perfect game for team fight, dota single pulse (0.0) (-.-) ( ) -e >>>>>>>>> hook >>>>>>>>>> /|",2
"a very competitive game... you only play on 1 map though.. but you wont get bored with tons of playable heroes..",5
"if you want to spend counterless hours just raging at your teammates and carrying people this is the game for you",1
"way too much information overload for me. confusing inerface, and half the time i dont know whats going on or what i am suppose to be doing. did not enjoy this - and im afraid we cannot endorse this confusing fantasy.",1
"honestly there is a massive learning curve for the new players, but valve is constantly adding features to make the game and its concepts as accessible to the public as possible. the fact that it is free leaves it all up to the player to decide whether the game is for them; nothing is stopping you from trying it out. but for those who are already into this genre of gaming, im not going to sugarcoat our community, there are positives and negatives to every aspect of social interaction in this game. you prefer what you prefer, but the game is stellar for me.",3
"the game itself is something wonderful. i who have only started by playing dota 2 and not any of the other forebears such as lol, hon or the original dota, must say that i love this type of strategy game. the heroes are rather amazing to play with the vast variety and the dynamic gameplay is brilliant. granted there are some problems with the amount of updates required that do screw up the gameplay at times, dota 2 is by far one of the best games in my opinion.",4
"i avoided mobas for so long, you know. i really did. barring a short and entirely disagreeable experience with the original defense of the ancients map for warcraft 3, and a brief stint playing demigod (which i thoroughly enjoyed, all the while failing to notice it pretty much was defense of the ancients) i hadnt touched this genre at all. heroes of newerth? nope. league of legends? nah. dota 2? good grief, no. there were plenty of reasons for this. first, my initial experience with warcraft 3s dota map really was that bad. second, moba communities have a rather strong reputation for being full of complete cockhandles, and i dont deal well with destructive criticism. third, im not a huge fan of most pure multiplayer games; i tend to prefer playing solo where i can. it did not appear to be the game for me...",3
"dota 2 is the best game i ever played in my life. the taught me so much. like patience, teamwork, never give up, think creative and so on. i recommend this game to be played by every people in the world. this game so much fun and sometimes it cannot be describe by words. u need to try by urself. :)",3
"best game ever ! its really addictive and fun to play , cant get bored of it . it demands both team play and individual skills , which make the game very unique and enjoyable ! i really recommend playing this game , but beware because youll need to have an organised team structure to thrive .",1
"dota is like a big black hole,the more u move on,the more it sucks u in it. by the way...... full of russains -_________-",3
"fun to play with friends... until you loose all of them because they are either n00bs that sux, or maybe its because you never go out anymore...who knows but who cares when you have 109 perfect friends ;)",2
"normally i would reccomend this game as i have played it for a long time. however it is now simply unplayable. screen constantly freezes and crashes even when using a high end pc and updated drivers. i have researched how to fix this problem and i have literally tried everything and nothing helps. a lot of people experience this problem online and the valve tech support is nonexistent and useless. for more than a year i tried to give this game a chance as i used to love playing it, but with lack of consideration towards a great number players including myself i feel it is a waste of money and time until it is fixed. here is a link to my thread and another related to this issue on the developer page. please valve pay attention to your players and actually fix your product.",1

"this game is truly amazing! best suits for any age,, :d",5
"really great game ! cool ! fun to play with friends",2
"excellent game play, well balanced and incredibly fun. cash items do not affect gameplay and are only for aesthtic purposes only. everyone has an equal chance of getting items of differing rarity. very good, definitely recommended and much better compared to league of legends in my opinion",1
"u valve...u always gimme me some noobs in team and then ban me for everything.. u all",4
"so far i have put in over 20 hours with dota2 and the first few were frustrating trying to figure out what to build how to play against other heroes etc. as a long term lol player i wanted a new challenge and i have got it in dota2. its a challenge and its going to take a long time to learn how to play and play against the pool of heroes but i feel so far this is worth it. there are a lot of differences from what im used to and i feel like a noob to the genre again. the only thing i dont like so far is i appear to see a lot of afks and lots of 4v5 either for my team or the other team.",1
"this game is really good i recommend all of you to try this game out! youll have lots of fun playing dota 2!",5
"very good game and u dont have to buy your self up. thumbs up for this awesome game! and its also free so download it now! trade me! <3",2

"dota 2 is the newest part of the wizard-em-up genre, with league of legends leading the helm. you work together with a band of peruvian warriors to defeat the kotka tribe and their leader clan_iraq. will you survive?",2
"just copying league of legends, do not buy unless you suck eggs, like squidward. still recommend tho",1
"if youre a fan of mobas or are just looking for a new style of game you should check this game out. its similar to league of legends (but please dont try to compare the two on chats because it causes arguments). i play this a lot and i quite enjoy it. i feel its a little better with friends, but you can play it alone just fine, find a match and choose your hero and wreck some riki s.",1

"can dota 2 be played on the mac osx without crashing and the right click problem?",1
"this game, well it is more than that, most people play game to have fun. but dota is more than that, it is an expierence, momments get insanly tense and make you want to scream in rage, or they will make you so happy you want to jump through the screen and hug that other players. dota leads to the most hilaries and rage inducing expierences you will have.",1
"this game is totally awesome, id love to play this game",1
"my favorite game to play. its free to play and very fun for being free to play. its a competitive game though and is not suited for the casual gamer. i recommend this game to anybody who has had experience with rts or other mobas.",3

"despite the unforgiving community, the steep learning curve and the amount of time needed to start to know what youre doing, its probably the best and most addictive online game out there. try it with an open mind and youll be surprised...",2
"this game is for pro players only .. we need to train hard and work hard :d glhf !",1
"it takes a while to get in to, but once youre in, you will never get out. a great game once you know the basics and has a huge range of what you can do to get better at in the game, it is very deep. the back stories of the heros are very interesting and it is very good on the game mechanics side, and the story side. some heros are however quite fustrating to play against, but it seems that vale and the developers are still definitely updatimg the game and trying to make everything balanced. also i have never tried dotas competitor leauge of ledgends so i cannot say wether i think it is better.",1
"i watched tv and had some chinese food and then i had a heart attack 10/10 - ign",1
"dota is better than lol and any lol players cant deny.",2

"i think the dota 2 is very good game. nice design and a lot of heroes to play.",2
"its an amazing game - technically outstanding, showing all of valves usual polish and attention to detail, especially in the all-important multiplayer aspects. the continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. its hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. im helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. if you can spare the time - play it. :)",3

"dota 2 is a great game. i love it but its not for everyone. dont take this the wrong way because its awesome but you shouldnt play this if you dont want to get screamed at or scream yourself. everyone in dota thinks that they know best and some times they do but if you screw up just once (because once is all it takes to loose in dota) they will tear you a new one before you can apologize. repentence for this treatment you are given a great moba which is sooooo much better than lol. you actually have to work as a team and everyone matters. the game is won and lost by your very actions. its great and competitive and super fun. it looks nice and runs nice, it just takes some practice to get good at. once you are good or atleast reasonable you can just sit back and enjoy (im not saying you wont rage at noobs or your own mistakes). 15/15 acing it everyday. thats dota 2!",1

"now its for sale or something. just ask anyone on steam they probably have 10 invites to give you if isnt for sale/free/public. who ing knows. this games not that great, they should rename this game endless struggle to convince eastern europeans to be teamplayers. or or or whats worse than suicide? waiting a game out you already lost for 30 more minutes. or or or, rts for weenies. or or or we think youre too dumb to know how to use control groupings so we made it default disabled in your menu. if you didnt understand what control groupings are, then this game is probably not for you, you filthy casual. 1 fiflthy casual out of 2",1

"its very good i have not played sooo long only 400 something hours on this but i like it when you start trie sniper and watch purge alot it helps guys overall never played dota 1 but dota 2 is certanly the  trie it out your life cannot be more fullfilled",2
"dota 2 is the sequel to the popular warcraft iii mod known as dota. it is very well crafted and improves the gameplay from orginal modification in the source engine. gameplay mechanics are solid and is very difficult, it requires to be attentive at all times. positioning is key throughout due to the very long stun times and high damage output by every hero at a certain point in the game. dota 2s graphics are much improved from the original warcraft iii modification in the warcraft engine respectivly and shows great colours and lighting on the map and characters. unfortunatley due to its difficult nature and very large learning curb and tends to push back a large amount of players. my recommendation is to start with a group of friends in bot matchs, and play every single hero at least once to figure out their abilities. then play the game online where everyone is an idiot or russian. glhf",2

"dota 2 is the most competitive fun you can have without buying a game this year.",2
"for me it is like a daily routine to play and compete against players across the world. not just we share our views but also our intellects collide on the same battlefield to determine the wave of glory for teams playing each round. sometimes we win but we loose which really makes to see deep in our hearts where we need the fear to be controlled and our reflexes on time through the game any time any place. at last it made us a way better than we happen to be in our previous game. understanding and reasoning the events of game is the most key factor if u really need to make best out of your effort. this game really changed us more than just one way.",5

"dota2 is a standalone version of the popular warcraft 3 mod dota. it challenges players on a level that few games are able.",1
"dota 2 popped my moba cherry, and what an experience its been. at first i was skeptical, there is only one map, one objective for every game. but the vast array of heros, items and builds open up a world of possibility, add this to the four other team members you have to be able to work effectively with and it can give hours (338 and counting) of enjoyment, frustration and everything in between as you work towards knocking down the enemy ancient and the hope for reward. for the chance of better team play, try ranked. the games will be harder, but the reward of a higher mmr makes people more willing to work together (or innundate your chat box with colourful slurs).",1
"this kind of games is not my cup of tea, in spite of that i like dota more and more. why? game is not about stupid clicking, how i thought, but if you want to win, you have to strategize and combine special abilities of 5 unique heroes. so if you are not a team player, the game is not for you. the graphics is really nice, but there are some negatives too. the tutorial is very tacky and discourages players from playing more than helps them. the game is very hard and chaotic for newbies. but if you understand to the game a bit, youll have a great fun. mainly with a couple of friends. moreover the game is free to play, so the conclusion is that i recommend dota 2.",1
"moba game most perfect. support the creative community make the items they want",2

"the game itself, is fun, graphics are interesting gameplay mechanics are simple and easy to understand at low skill levels, but complicated and take a lot of time to figure out at harder ones, the game was overaly enjoyable, but the complexivity of items and the gery of players make it.... meh. i dont know a lot about dota 2 ,but this is the imppresion i got from all the time i have played. if a friend of mine hadnt told me the real name i would think dota would stand for den of tryhard hats. of course, i havent played much, but this is the imppresion i got when i started: overaly enjoyable, but unless you have enough friends for a full team avalble at all times, dont bother.",1

"i avoided mobas for so long, you know. i really did. barring a short and entirely disagreeable experience with the original defense of the ancients map for warcraft 3, and a brief stint playing demigod (which i thoroughly enjoyed, all the while failing to notice it pretty much was defense of the ancients) i hadnt touched this genre at all. heroes of newerth? nope. league of legends? nah. dota 2? good grief, no. there were plenty of reasons for this. first, my initial experience with warcraft 3s dota map really was that bad. second, moba communities have a rather strong reputation for being full of complete cockhandles, and i dont deal well with destructive criticism. third, im not a huge fan of most pure multiplayer games; i tend to prefer playing solo where i can. it did not appear to be the game for me...",3

"be prepared to lose all your time and only talk about the game 10/10",4
"its fun, after you get used to it. it hurts at the start but it gets better the deeper you go in. dota 2 is basically anal. there are alot of servers availible which include:russia, and other servers that are filled with russians. you will experience noobs sometimes, such as the infamous pudge jungle. but its fiiine, lycan didnt need the jungle anyways am i right? tldr: a dont be lazy, read the damn thing.",4
"an interesting proposition. unlike most games, this is the gift that keeps on giving. over the lifetime of dota 2 many additions have been made, and many continue to come along. dota 2 is based on an old warcraft mod, and on a weekly and monthly basis, valve continues to update and add features to the game. aside from being a lucrative scene for competitive gamers, it also has a steep learning curve and endless combinations as far as team compisitons go. if you arent the kind of person who likes to play versus other players, the game allows you to play cooperatively against bots. and to further add to the lifespan of the game, the developers release festive events every 3-5 months to add something extra for players to do. as the game is free to play, this game can potentially net you some gains in the form of the marketable items you recieve for playing.",2
"nice moba game you have to put alot of thoughts to it and the most important is your team you will also be building up your skills to teamwork i really reccomend this game if you want to play start playing with bots or get some help from someone who is playing it, else you can be called noob and all sorts of bad stuff just cause you are new and someone might also say go delete dota, dont do that, just play with some friends and have a good time playing it :d good luck see you in the dota 2 community",3

"this is the worst game i have ever played in my life. i cant stand a second playing this game because its graphics are garbage and i rather die than play with all the losers with no life on this game. this map is repetative and is really starting to get stupid. the creators must have half a brain to think people would even like this game at all due to how bad it is and how much they want you to pay to buy a stupid item in the shop. i rather buy hello kitty island adventure than buy these worthless pathetic items in the shop that do nothing at all. suicide sounds more fun than this game.",4

"pretty good moba in my opinion. free to play, which is good because otherwise i probably would not have gotten into the realm of mobas in the first place. the learning curve can be pretty daunting at first, so i would recommend that you get a friend to help you learn the basics. 9/10 pros: solid multiplayer, large character selection, fun rpg elements, gameplay never gets boring cons: steeper learning curve, will need to learn jargon",1

"brilliant game, nothing like tf2 as well, cause you dont have to pay for hats, but for cosmetics ( though fair enough you can earn them as well ) anyway, i love this game, the devs are always on top of bug fixes, gamebreaking, and not so gamebreaking a-like, and they definatally try their best to make this game run as smooth as possible, and block all threads about people who hate russians, ( which btw are stupid threads, and pointless, as one they are rude, and two they really need to use the searchbar as there are millilons of threads like theirs all over the place. )",1

"the game is great, except that the game rapidly snowballs into an unwinnable position if you get off to a bad start, and they brutally punish you if you leave before the game is over. even if its the 20 minute mark, your team has died 40 times, and your opponents are all untouched, you just have to pretend youre still playing until your opponents decide to end it. which theyll often hesitate to do, opting instead to spend 30+ more minutes taunting and toying with you.",1

"highly addictive moba based off warcraft 3 and massively updated by valve. the game play is very well tuned with balance updates pretty regularly. the patches are worth looking forward and the free-to-play model is brilliant. that said, this game has one of the worst gaming communities i have ever been a part of. utterly shocking behaviour almost every game by at least one player. this game painfully needs a ban list to avoid being with these people more than once. bring friends for the best experience.",3

"dota 2 is the spiritual sequel to the warcraft iii custom map, defense of the ancients. i would describe it as a modern 5v5 version of chess that requires fast thinking and twitch reflexes. the game has a steep learning curve which may scare away casual players who are looking for a more mainstream experience (lol) but the learning is part of the fun because it never stops, the are more than a hundred heroes to choose from and the experience evolves with every patch. the game is completely free to play but you may purchase cosmetic items for your favorite heroes from the dota store or the community market.",3

"this game is not for people who have less than average control over keyboard and mouse. you would need prior experience with relatively complex games, strategic thinking and perseverence. the learning curve is steep and this game is very demanding for the new players, the community at large is unforgiving and brutal if you are making mistakes as the mistakes you make would affect everybody in your team causing your team to lose. you cannot quit mid-game and the game can go for a long time and the result may not be known till the very end. all this can easily put off many people, but those who pass this rite of passage would enjoy the same things that you hated as a newbie.",3

"dota 2 is a real-time strategy game as known as moba (multiplayer-online-battle-arena) youll need a teamwork to play this game. every game is the same map with different strategy. it is also the best languages learning game. im playing on the sea server and i learned about 5 languages like pinoy, indo, malay, chinese, korean, and sometimes russian. imagine when youre trying to pay attention on the game but the chat log is full of their languages. especially russian  always appeared on the chat log. it means bltch as well. this game has the mute system which im f*ckin love it. it helps me solve these problems. -remember no english. of course if youre new to this game, youll get a lot of blames. no place for newbs. #fukingbadcommunity but just chill and keep playing, ignore those who trashtalks. youll have a great time playing this game. #bestmoba ruined my life 11/10",5

"dota 2 is a great example on how to take a tired and true formula and update just enough of it to feel fresh while still retaining everything that made it fun,frustrating,choatic,absurd, and just insanely fun. i absoulutely recommend this game i havent stop playing since its original iteration as a warcraft 3 frozen throne map mod to the juggernaut it has become. without this game we would never have hon, lol, infinite crisis, and other arts games that have come into existence. the game can be incredibly unforgiving, confusing and unbearingly difficult in the beggining, but patience and perserverance will pay off in huge dividends. do yourself a favor and play because this is free to play arts games done right!",4

"dota. dota. dota, dota, dota dota dota dota. what do you know about dota? i know that its the best competitive teamplay game in existance. fun may or may not be found there, but once you get good, sure as hell you will have satisfaction from outplaying these pesky queen of pain and invoker with your earth spirit or rampaging through the enemy team in chronosphere as a void who was allowed to farm for a little too long. you will have fun sometimes. you will get mad. you will get mad a lot. and youll love it. 11/10 would sell my soul for.",5

"my first moba game. very difficult, and very competitive. easily the worst part of this game is the community. however, your performance does impact your teams performance, so be sure to watch some videos, play some bot games, and ask some questions before you play matchmaking, or you will definitely jarate off your entire team. theres a very nice hero selection, so you have a lot of choices. it now just needs more maps ;) (im no map purist)",2
"lot of patience, thinking, cooperating, teamplay and of course, killing enemy - this is dota2. if u are a fan of moba games u will enjoy this title. i enjoyed it much better than lol because the graphics is much better (source engine ftw :d) and its really ftp game. u dont have to pay for skins, its totally free trading items and build your favourite set. so, dont wait and download it because its worth it!",2

"dota is easy to get into and you can lose hours playing the game. the game is very fun to play with your friends or have a match online. dota does not disappoint and it has a very large community that is friendly to new players. its a great free to play that everybody should check out.",1

"this game is great! - it ruined my social life. - i now abuse russians ive known for years irl. - anybody whos better than you is a basement dweller. - anybody worse than you is from south america. - possibly the worst community in gaming after lol. - bad graphics and controls, 10/10 - ign i have spent too long on this game, and im by no means the worst offender. i wish i could get those hours and money back. overall, this game is the cancer of steam. 10/10.",1
"great mp game, but first, learn how to play if u dont want everybody to jump on you",2
"addictive game in the right scenarios. i dont recomend playing solo as you will get nothing but peopel who dont speak english and throw the game away by dieing repeatedly. ive put over 400 hours into the game and the constant spanish and people leaving games makes it almost unplayable. im seriously considering quitting",2
"this is the absolute best free language learning tool on the internet. learn from languages such a russian, spanish, portuguese, and if youre lucky, english. learn from real native speakers. 10/10 would recommend",1
"free to play game working with the original moba game and improving all the time. try it and you may just fall in love.",2
"dota 2 is truly a game for skilled players and takes true dedication and practice.. dota 2 is a game where you have two teams, dire and whatever that other thing is, and a large array of characters and gear.. the only problem about gear is that you need it to suit your kind of character, an example would be that mages require wisdom and archers need agility! i played this game a fair bit, so i have lets say, moderate skills.. im a big range guy. but anyways back to the point. dota 2 is wonderful for a f2p game, and can really bring out the inner gamer in you. along with its entertaining feel, it can unlock a land of oppurtunities such as the championships.. this game deserves a whopping 9.5/10 which trasnlates to a gold in my rating system..",1
"this is one of those games that will consume your life. no matter what you do once you start playing you will always see things that remind you of this game. it is a curse. you have been warned. 11/10",2
"if you play this game youll lose your life. dont do it.",2
"dont play dota unless youre prepared to be patient and bare the insults of angry teammates. get through that and its one of the best games youll play",2
"i recommend this game. i had been playing since dota1 came out.",4
"i like everything about this game. the only suggestion i would have is to make achievements, like 3 per hero.",1
"this game is ok. only 22 playable warriors, team death 8 v 8 is fun i guess, this is an okay fps lots of animals but yeah, you guys should try it, this game is very similar to bakugan battle brawlers (video game). also this game has a guest character, the guest character is james bond, tip: dont use his knife, it got nerfed in the recent free expansion.",3
"a place where you can meet jerks, get scolded, ragequit, etc. one of the best game of all time.",2

"one of the best games! very addictive! but with  hard disk like mine with 40 gb space this game is overload with updates! but never mind! this game is addictive as hell!",1
"doto is life. all praise the mighty volvo for the blessing they have bestowed upon our puny mortal souls. this is an amazing game; the level of balance for such a wide variety of playable heroes is beyond impressive. it has the steepest learning curve of any game ive ever played. if you are bored of games being too easy, play dota. learn russian. enjoyable the inevitable hatred that will consume your soul!",4
"the game in it slef is a team based strategy orientated one. two teams of 5 are agaisnt each other, with the aim of destroying the enemys base. if you like wit and reflex biased but still strategy based games, this is the one for you. adopting multiple charaters from the warcraft 3 offspring/mod dota this game now has the ability and played enough the stand on its own. enjoy!",2
"10/10 awesome game ^_^. when you play and selected a hero, it has a recommend item which is good for new players.",1

"nice gameplay, our strategy decides how the game will be ended, win or lose. every single move affects the whole game.",3
"this game is your best friend and worst enemy at the same time if you start playing it you cant leave anymore imagine your very personal hell",3
"dota 2 does many things right. with free-2-play attitude, a vast selection of over 100 playable heroes and a massive fanbase, its easy to see why dota 2 is one of the fastest growing communities in gaming. however, not all is fine and dandy. the game punishes the slightest mistake with characters becoming unkillable and downright overpowered. take for example bloodseeker, if he gets even one kill he can dominate a game. new players are funneled into playing these easy or overpowered heroes making the game unenjoyable for the other players. while *t does happen, the game is still an enjoyable experience provided that the super-strong characters (that definently need a nerf) are kept under wraps by repeatedly killing them or the arent selected in the game youre playing. i would recommend it just dont expect it to a breeze.",1
"would definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to learn russian and/or portuguese.",4
"you cant really complain when they hand you a masterpiece for free.",2

"my only problem is my fellow filipinos that always blame  to their teammates. just play the game. enjoy! all in all, dota 2 is one of the bestest games ever. more power, bros!",1
"the game is good. tightens something it was too much, like in every new game you have to download the knitted character and achieve new successes in pvp, but it does not worsen the feeling of contentment game :)",3
"my grandfather smoked his whole life. i was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, if you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.. tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. he gave it up immediately. three years later he died of lung cancer. it was really sad and destroyed me. my mother said to me- dont ever smoke. please dont put your family through what your grandfather put us through. i agreed. at 28, i have never touched a cigarette. i must say, i feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.",1
"really, truly an amazing game. after putting so much time in this game i have realised that i finally had lost faith in the human race and decided to rip my balls off. its a great game to learn foreign languages and such but not much else. unless you are a tryhard i would not suggest this game as the community is rude as hell. its pretty addictive as any other moba but by far not the best ive played. even if the community is less racist then hon and more mature then the community of lol, its pretty bad. the only way i am ever playing this game is with a group of friends.",1
"made me forget about my life, left me with no time for anything else, no room to do anything else, or the will to do anything else. almost completely ed up my life. also taught me some russian curse words. 10/10.",2

"this game is absolutely amazing, with a great mixture of depth and hilarious moments. one such example, is the fact that despite the games serious atmosphere, it has the funniest videos on youtube, like never go full agility and chaos dunk. i have really come to enjoy this game, having played almost 650 hrs on it. though i must say that some of your teammates in game are going to be s, and will report you for stupid reasons such as stealing kills or not listening. good luck and have fun :d",3
"if you rage quickly,i recomend getting a steel mouse and keyboard.",2
"this game is ing . you ers might as well move to brazil and russia.",3
"i couldnt really get into the game, dont enjoy these kinds of games. im assuming it takes a while to get into, but its very daunting for a new player in my opinion. unless you have previous experience or plenty of time to play, i dont really recommend it.",1
"pros: requires strategy obviously needs teamwork to win makes you think for others rather than yourself awesome hero customizations and skins easy ui and hotkeys for your convenience requires technique and precision of skill execution (unlike similar games) cons: not for the greedy player lacks old and new heroes from dota soloists will have a hard time playing around the map gives you the habit of overspending because of awesome items public pairings are very random, you either pair up with noobs or quitters or maybe dendi or singsing themselves. overall, its a great game. a chip o the old block from dota 1(duhhh) they need to add more awesome items and customization for heroes. same goes with the selection; no frost wyvern, arc warden, and other upcoming heroes who-knows icefrog and the others will put.",3

"its juggling coals while chewing on candy floss. its fencing with a midget whos actually really good at fencing. youve got a reach advantage, but hell punish you for every mistake. its transporting a house of cards from one end of the room to the other, all the while building it higher and higher. its dota, dude.",4
"i strongly recommend this game. its freaking awesome. and ofcourse its free. you will not regret by playing this game.",4
"game that you shouldve play more than 10000 hours :p",1
"this game has not got much to it on paper; 2 teams with a base each with 3 ways in defended by evenly placed towers. however, it is still playable and addictive with loads of characters and item combinations across teams each game is different and lasts about 30-40 mins. it started as a warcraft 3 mod so expect some familiar concepts. it is going to be free to play at some point so when it is i would at least give it a go you can also buy cosmetic items but nothing to give an advantage over the moaning cheapskates ;-)",1

"an amazingly deep game. community has the average number of s and such, but there are a lot of people who are passionate and happy to explain what to do next. this isnt a recommendation to check the game out, everyone should know about dota by now, but this is a recommendation to get past the first wall that scares many players away.",2

"good game , it involves strategy, teamwork , and experience . actually dota2 is just a improved version of dota1 with better graphics . it also one of the most recognized game in the world. the most important thing is the game is f2p(free to play), and theres no p2w(pay to win) elements. its all about skills the important thing to play dota is you need to keep up with the current meta and playstyle, since theres a lot of changes every update , make sure you read the changelog after every updates",4

"this game is play much by myself, but i feel it lacks in abillites and champion roles in the sense that it really doesnt have much varity in how you build your champ/hero as a build can work in just about every situtation. this my seem like a major nark on the game, but id say its rather good besides that one part. it has good graphics and a fairly good champ/hero pool. i would say try this out if youre content on not play lol and games like this, but if youre open to the moba lifestyle try lol first honestly. 3.5 out of 5 stars for gameplay. 4.5 out of 5 stars for pc controls",1

"i enjoyed most of the time playing the game, but most people play it for being competative, where as i just try to play it for fun. i would personaly recomend it. the only annoying part would be people from foriegn countries for some reason decide to connect to your area server. ex: russian connecting to u.s. server or a person who decides that they want to connect to a server halfway across the world. though i like it when there is a coopertive team who are there just to have fun.",2

"okay...the best game in the whold world !!!! period",2
"extremly rage inducing game, recommended only for ages 12-65. you will be able to learn every aspect of racism and realize what actually e- means within dota 2 i.e anyone below 3000 mmr is trash tier with a 2 inch  and their opinion is always invalid. dota 2 is also a pathway for you to be fluent in many different languages such as chineese, korean, thai, malay, russian and many others. the secret to climbing mmr is insta-locking the most broken hero in every game. overall 10/10 game, highly recommended.",2

"i havent played dota 2 for that long but i decided to say that i think it is a wonderful game that has been created in a way that is always challenging. it constantly requires you to try new strategies, create new skill combos and match new characters in order to win. playing against other contenders from across the world continuously increases your skill and makes every match interesting. this is definitely a game i would recommend to all.",2

"this is my first review for dota 2. well, i am a fans of dota since warcraft time. that time i was like getting harassed by my friends because i cant play it well lol. well im not saying that im a pro player right now, but at least im on my learning curve. dota 2 is a strategy game, it requires teamwork, and of course experience to dominate the game. as many people have said, dotas learning curve is very deep. its often to find even pro player being harassed and called a noob by other players in the game. that shows how harsh this game is lol. i recommend this for you guys, as this game can deliver thrill, excitement, and of course neverending stress lol. happy rampage!",1

"the best a-rts in the whole universe. the combination of more than 100 heroes in the same-old battlefield has created its own diversity.",1
"really outstanding game. definitely give it a try sometime. outstanding how they managed to make such a big and difficult game `easy`, try to dont get confused and fight through it. worth the time, practice by playing with friends, watching games on youtube(i really like purgegamers) or just watch a random pub. all of that is really instructive and helps you become a better player. ps: playing the tutorial really helps.",1
"i love this game,i only rate 5 star for this game you add item for troll(jahrakal) and disruptor,im begging please add item for them,for now i just rate 4 star...",1
"dota 2 is many things to many people: its a great way to kill an afternoon with friends; its a spectator sport platform with its own item-betting scene; its a hobby; its a profession, and a way to make a living. it isnt perfect and likely never will be, as each update tends to fix bugs and introduce new ones, and the tutorial could certainly use some work. however, with zero cost to play and one of the highest skill ceilings of any game ive ever encountered, dota 2 is a modern multiplayer masterpiece.",4

"dota two is a game of games. it is not for the faint of heart or the cheeky scrubs of the world. also if you are peruvian please stop playing on us west servers as you cause the game to lag and your lack of ability to communicate via english makes team work virtually impossible. good luck in your endevours to conquer the world of dota 2. also  viper and  everything he stands for",1
"dota 2 is by far the hardest to learn game i have ever played. however, it is one of the most fun. if youre new to dota, and you want to get better, you have three options: 1. practice bot games over and over using a ton of guides and such until you can consistantly beat unfair bots no problem. 2. play a ton of games with more experienced friends (this way is the most fun). make sure that theyre close friends, because they will teach you, but if you dont listen to them and keep dying or buying bad items or whatever, theyll hate playing with you. so listen to your teachers! 3. play games on your own and try your best, and end up being yelled at by four different people at the same time (9 if youre lucky). but if you get through the learning phase, this game becomes amazing. its an awesome strategic game to play with friends. youll win some and youll lose some, but its free and fun, so what the heck.",1

"dota 2 is even far more better than his elder brother - dota 1 with great game play and services, along with a big market for you to trade and earn benefit. however, since the day it became free to play, more and more  players has been joining the community and spoil it. i lost some love with it, but still, dota 2 is the best game with the best community i have ever played",3
"do you like mobas? enjoy league of legends or smite? well this game is, of coruse, another moba. however it is also the original moba. one of the things you may love or hate about dota is that there isnt really any sort on unfairness to new players beyond skill. if a person with 10,000 hours faces a player who has only 12 they have no different items, no different heroes, no different abilities. the veteran may have new aesthetic things but the only thing seperating them will be skill. if youre new to mobas i encourage you to try this one, they are very fun and are fortunately not pay to win.",2

"i will never be able to stop playing this addictive and tactical game. the fun never ends!",2
"if you love stratedgy and have the carisma and charm to manage pub team who has no clue what theyre doing this is probably a great game for you. if you play this game alone you will most probably suffer a long chain losses until someone decent at the game takes pity on you and invites you to their group, or you beg them to join yours. all noobs are not created equal, this game requires fast reflexes, attention to detail and mutlitasking. if suck at using a mouse and keyboard, dont even bother with this game, go back to cod or bf.",2

"takes a bit of getting used to even for someone who has played a bit of other dota style games. but after you put the effort in it gets easier and much more enjoyable. 10/10 would black hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooole again",2
"one of the best multiplayer online battle arena game; its gameplay focuses on combat in a three-dimensional environment, presented from an oblique high-angle perspective. what i liked on this game is that this is played in discrete matches involving two five-player teams, each of which occupies a stronghold at a corner of the map. each stronghold contains a building called the ancient, which the opposite team must destroy to win the match. each player controls a hero character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory.",1
"way way way more depth than league of legend (lol), steeper learning curve, higher skill cap and alot more balancing / fair play. has some similarities to hon but overall feels like a really different game. i love both but dota 2 feels more competitive and has a bit more interesting heroes + the balancing is better (except riki). i would recommend this game if youre into something that requires you to actually think and use your brain unlike lol. i personally prefer hon out of all the mobas but that might just be cause i started with it, dota 2 comes close as second. 9/10",2
"one of the truest remakes of all time, with amazing visuals and voice acting. to top it all of it has the fairest free to play buisness model of all time. the only downside is if you are matchmaking solo, you will more often then not end up with teammates who refuses to speak english, who yells at you or disconnects after dying repeatedly. recommended to play with friends, ideally 4. other then that, this is the greatesr moba i have ever played, with an awesome e-sports scene and is extremly satisfying once you learn about all the different heroes and techniques. there is absolutely no reason to not play this, unless being tactical isnt your type of thing.",3
"often i am asked what does a good game truly mean? hue much depends upon the game (lets say dota) will you be a tryhard? then we have heroes that are overpowered as  will you be a nooblord? then we can grant you matchmaking that puts you against even noobier players will you be wise? can you can pubstomp nooblords till their chocolatemilk explodes on their multiple chins what does a good game truly mean? that is for you to decide.... theres also a talking tree and a fat cockney who hooks people",2

"this game seems to be left 4 dead 2 with new name, buy very good",1
"cold, harsh, unforgiving, abusive, and immensely rewarding. these are a few of the words you could use to describe dota 2s community and gameplay. dont come in expecting to be coddled by the veterans of this moba. its trial by fire, sink or swim, live or die, but what the game lacks in a compassionate backing it more than makes up for in the satisfaction of utterly outplaying the opposing team or coming together at the end to pull off an underdog victory!",3
"before i didnt know this game i though it was noob game, but when i started to play this game my opinions very changed..this time its my favourite game.",1
"great game i first started because my friend was playing and didnt know how to play but i got started and now i add people and teach them to play other then that great game i love it play it ever day i highly recommend it no real bad glitchs or any glitches really everone is friendly and nice...!!!!!",2

"this is a perfect game for group of friends. it is also nice since you are able to compete with different people around the world.",3
"playing it every day. not so balanced, but still fun to play! recommending for people that like strategy type of games. huge events (the international, starladder etc.). if you will be that good in this game you can win huge prizes on that evetns with your team. 98/100",2

"i just wanna suggest a little adjustment here, and i think the staff and members of this game will take my suggestion in order to promote a better community and a more proper treating towards the players. the only suggestion i would like to give is that, make the game learn how to differentiate blackout or brown-out from abandoning because players gets low priorities for extremely poor reason, and now those players who have low prios would keep on having low prios if the blackout is rotational and comes in unexpectedly, and because of this, many players are having discomfort and depression towards the events because they cant join in the game because of the blasted low-prios of no valid reasons. please, if you see this, you may now start improving the community and the system of low-priority. thanks. btw, great game.",1

"are you peaceful, calm and collected? do you like to shy away from anger? do you want to become a more assertive, more aggressive person? well dota 2 teaches you a unique skillset, one that allows you to speak to foreingors in a more assertive manner. it allows you to be aggressive towards players that need a little guidance, and most of all, it is a more statistically viable option for inducing a stroke than having children is! yay for anger issues!!",4
"this game is like crack cocaine , its amazing , but when you stop using it for a while , you want to go back. if all the twelvies abusing you for instalocking pudge and screaming out im dondo i do what ever the f i want is bad trying losing 10 games in a row , and wanting to slash ur wrists -1/10 will play again",2
"a unique and epic follow-up to the old and infamous dota, that not only lives up to a really long-built reputation, but surpasses its predecessor in every possible way. riskier, faster, stronger, more rewarding, frustrating at times, but funnier nonetheless. and maybe what tends to be in the eyes of the gamer a flaw and a massive drawback, might perhaps and personally be the games greatest characteristic that will only keep reinventing itself viciously in terms of endless gaming; its very hard to learn, considering that after taking years for one to accustom themselves in every dirty, tricky and veteran way of dota 2, they might have a long way ahead in order to truly master it. but, can this really happen? -",3
"this is a game that surprised me. most of the game is just clicking with the mouse, right click to do this, left click to do that. it did require a bit of effort getting used to it. but it can be picked up easily. still getting to grips with the camera. and the lengthy matches means that you play for hours without realising it. this game probably will take up a lot of time in your life, so make sure you have many reasons to leave your computer screen.",1
"tough learning curve because youll likely play with some pros that have been playing dota since patch 0.000001 and your team will likely consist of people that understand enough english to insult you but not enough to be of any use in team fights or other strat stuff. huehuehue. get a solid team to play with and its much better. also practice against ais for like a month before stepping foot into a person vs person game.",1

"defense of the ancients 2 (dota 2) is by far one of the best games you can play, especially if you enjoyed league of legends. the difference between the latter game and the former (aside from the obvious, such as developer), is the fact that dota 2 reinvents the game and innovates it by giving it the valve touch. not only are the heroes (the equivalent of champions in lol) all fun to play and the other players fun to play with, but the system of commendation, reporting, leveling, and item acquirance are all unique and effectively made. overall, this is an amazing game to play and once you try it out (and you undoubtedly will try it out at some point), youll be glad you did.",1

"from an avid league player, its a bit hard to get into and understand at first. but once you get your main role going and start to learn the heros you can play it can get pretty fun. until you meet viper... /rage about one of his passives is a slow every auto attack compared to league it has a lot less skill shots and more lock ons. however there is still a lot of skill to be had at this game, not runes or masteries, denying, and losing some gold upon death. just make sure you dont spam your spells. your mana pool is very low and mana regen is little to nothing early game. a very different game with not a lot to compare to, but theyre both equally fun in their own way.",1

"one of the best esport games in history. a lot of people have problems with its steep learning curve. itll be hard for really long time to compete with veterans but its an esport game so thats what you should expect from games of this type. also prepare for flaming from russians. they think everyone know their language so they select all servers to communicate with wider range of people.",1

"this game has replaced the word noob with peruvian.",3
"my hours show that i have played a decent amount in this game, i am not going to lie this is very addicting. i came here after playing a bit of lol and i love dota 100x more than lol since dota is completely about skill since all heroes are availible from the start. lol has soo many micro transactions that its not fun anymore and the amount you have to spend for the top line champions is too much. dota 2 all in all is amazing, if you can get a few friends and make a 5 man team there is endless teamwork and fun! it will make you hate russians and want to slap the  out of asians and want to murder the family of little 5 year olds that  all the time but ignore it. dota 2 the only game where 5 year olds have fantasized about your mom and 20 year olds dont know how to spell. 10/10 farts",2
"if youre fond of blaming others for everything or uncomfortable with acknowledging the fact that there will always be someone better than you out there, this is not the game for you. if you like a constant challenge and youre capable of continual improvement than it comes highly recommended. the game itself is crazy fun and varied, the map is ridiculously intricate, and its all free-to-play without being pay-to-win! the matchmaking system on the other hand leaves a lot to be desired, ie. no region lock, solo-queue disadvantage, questionable balance methods, etc. the community really isnt as bad as everyone says, and the hero that you think is op is not. theres always more to learn, and thats what keeps me coming back.",5
"best game ive ever played :d takes a little while to learn to play and get good but its worth it.",3
"lets not beat abut the bush, this has o story line, its just random crap. i mean theres only one map? like what the  is up with that :o i mean some people are so stupid they dont even play it, they watch other people play it. and the graphics...lets just say the n64 has games with better graphics! all inall in its a waste of your pc memory, and it has so many bloody update all the ing time! its  just dont do it! if you play this game you are an oxygen thief and ruining the meaning of gaming now gtfo wilst you still can!",1

"more competitive then dota 1, but yet so hard to play. it was so hard for some players who were used to dota 1 mechanics to adapt to dota 2. abstract game, the camera is too close to the players, is just a pure chaos in a teamfight. dota 1 is better.",1

"good game. for lol players it is/will be more difficult and has more mechanics. the gamplay itself is great and smooth most of the time you can play any hero you want without having to buy them. easy controls fun game to play with friends you can buy customization items which is great...perfect game wow defense of the ancients (dota) --> lol --> dota clarification of what came first",2

"an excellent game. it has a very steep learning curve for new players but with patience and practice the new player will reap many rewards. victories are as gratifying as defeats are frustrating. beware of the community, they can get bitter very quickly when a mistake is made. on the other hand, when you do well they may congratulate you. all the best of luck. youll need it against me.",2

"league of flamers served no less as mere training for dota 2, which holds in my opinion the state of best moba/arts/asss (call it however you want) around. no need to pay for heroes or power-ups. no need to grind levels to be able to jungle. no need to pay for cosmetics, i can earn them while playing. and i can learn russian free of charge. the essence and magic of dota combined with the powerful source engine and wrapped up in an user-friendly package with valve quality finition. icing on the cake ? the only moba around playable offline. and bots arent exactly dummies.",2

"dota 2 is hard, but theres a huge reward for those who commit. on the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) defense of the ancients modification for warcraft iii, now transferred into valves source engine. the games punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but its worth sticking the hours in: success in dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.",3
"very interesting game, and make us forget about everything.",4

"if your willing to learn and go in knowing your going to have to take the time to get better due to its steep learning curve dota 2 i an amazingly satisfying and addictive game guarranteed to have you comming back for more. i would recomend going in with a mentor but if not the game has modes implemented into it to help newer players get to gerips with the game., also with the ability to create bot and games only for you and freinds you should have no trouble learning the game. with a large variety of heroes to pick from all available as soon as you enter the game there is thousands of hours of gameplay waiting for you in what is the most fair ree to play model in a gae ever purchasing only items for heroes for bragging rights and no stat benefit their is no reason for anyone that owns steam to not pick up and try dota 2 for themselves.",4

"mobas havent been my thing really. before i loved mmorpgs with a passion, until a friend of mine introduced dota. and well it was worth my time, i have been hooked ever since. i may have stopped for a while, but eventually youll come back to the game regardless of how good your current game is. 10/10",5

"behind the scenes the game plays out really well if you dont take into account the mad russians who are constantly acting as if they are the game itself, or the new players who dont know anything regarding how not to land into enemy hands. other than that mild seperation of fun and anguish, the game itself is fun and worthwhile to play and spend some quality time killing other people on a cyber world.",2

"dota 2 is hands down one of the greatest games of all time . it has a wonderful selection of heroes, the best map in any moba , and an incredible team that deilvers awesome updates and content on consistent basis. this games requires dedication and alot of hard work to become good at, but it is well worth it . this is the most rewarding game i have ever played , even more than most mmos can offer right now !",2
"it was nice i liked it. the graphics were awesome and so was the music and all. the beginning part explains it all. like how you can get items. also enjoyed being that sniper guy. i like the dragon knight the best though to be honest. however, i do not feel like just sitting here on my computer for hours trying to defeat someone or the computer. they had that dota 2 international championship for 3 days for a reason people. i also rage quit. no i was just getting angry at how long the battle was taking and how annoying it was to keep on dying with the healing potion or tree healer items just healed me for a little bit like maybe just 5 hp at a time. it was still a good game to play.",1

"this is a great game and i would recommend it. but also warn people that a large part of the community can be very harsh. they seem alot quicker to insult you then to help you. i enjoy the game, but the lack of support from the other players usually is what makes me over look this title and skip to something else.",1

"dota 2 is the best in the moba class. ive played lol, dota and some lesser known mobas and dota 2 is by far the best. in addition, it is f2p which is amazing. unlike lol or hon which require you to use a rotating hero list until you buy your own with real money or accumulate enough in-game currency to buy a single hero, dota 2 immediately gives you access to its entire library of heroes, for free. the only paid content are cosmetical items that do not change gameplay. graphics are great. gameplay is great. crashes are very minimal. its free.",1

"as you might know dota 2 is a moba game, but despite the others games i think dota is better. you may ask why ? , the answer is simple : you can customise heroes for free and as you want, you can choose your favourite hud and announcer.now about graphics,they are really good even in low quality and imagine if in low quality are that good think how good they can be at high quality.dota has a darker concept for the heroes.and at last the gameplay,well,most of moba players are saying that is harder.i found it really easy once you learn the items and how that hero is supposed to go.maybe i found it easier because is a more strategic game than the other games.i can say only this except dota 2 ive played 4 other mobas and the most ive enjoyed is dota 2. i dont force you to play and like this game ,but i hope you will try at least to play a while and enjoy your play. good luck & have fun !",1

"dota 2 isnt easy, its not a game where a simple tutorial would be enough. you need to apply yourself and have the will to get better. its a game of mastery, no matter how skilled you are you will always learn something in it. it isnt about how quick you are, but how much you know. its the same map, every game but what happens in it is always differnet. it literally never gets boring.",5
"this game is clearly a great game on the steam store and its free to play....what else can i say? sometimes online is smooth, depends on wifi connection and your opponents wifi too. the games not noob-friendly but you gotta get the hang of the damn game, they have something called practice and youtube guides. yeah id definetely freaking reccomend this game no matter what. its very addictive especially once you get the hang of it. my favorite characters are sven and zeus, theyre pretty good. i personally think ursa and sniper are overused, so you may wanna use some underused characters like death prophet! >:d have fun playing! if you see me online gimme a haiiiii ;d (note: im an average dota2 player. im not an expert nor a noob. you have been warned.) ;3",2

"best moba in my opinion. although the game is not fully done yet, but it is alive due to great updates almost every day. the balance between heroes is very good, skill matters also. but the game vs real players, not bots, is very hard on my opinion and needs to be balanced, so professional players will not play with newbies. i recommend it to everyone, who like moba games and good graphics, friendly interface and cooperating.",1
"one of the most epic games ever made, a total improvement from the original dota. equipments and couriers are also replaceable with our own ones to serve as a costume to make different heroes look better, what is even better is the trade feature that is added to the game, allowing players to take part in steam trading and learn about it but also lets players search and trade for their own wanted items! awesome game, great graphics, user friendly controls, its just awesome. although one bad thing is recently the dota 2 network has been having problems, so it is quite hard to not be able to play my favourite game.... 9/10",3
"its a really good game and i like very match but its community make it a worse place for people who want to enjoy ,its fun at first and very addictive and you will spend alot of time and maybe it will be your top priority to finish a match and not get abandon from the matches, i suggest it and best way to play dota is it for fun and be careful not to make it consume you",2

"this game is very inspiring! very fun and amusing. i reccommed this to you gamers!",1
"the games plot isnt really clear, but the way i see it is that it is obviously a game about the problem with rapid assimilation of cultures and how conservativism leads to massive xenophobia, causing a war between what i think is the texas-mexico border on the rio grande though for some reason its russians and peruvians instead overall it really is a great free singleplayer title that experiments with how much you did or did not slack off in foreign language courses in high school while testing how racist you are capable of being",3

"if youre looking for a reason to commit time to dota 2  if youre actually reading this review for advice and a critical opinion, rather than to see what score im going to give the most popular game on steam  then, first up, thanks for being here. second, i want you to consider what it means when two grown men accidentally lather each other in regenerative goop. its gamings equivalent of holding a door open for somebody who is already reaching to hold the door open for you: a synchronicity of kindness that speaks to a deeper shared understanding of the situation both people are in. dota is a game where you can say the words are you thinking what im thinking? and be reliably assured that the person on the other end of your voip connection actually is. it might have the systems and bearing of a videogame, but dota shares the social impetus of a sport. its single environment isnt a map, its a pitch.",5
"dota 2 is a fun and energetic game. there is a diverse roster of heroes to choose from that each have there own unique abilities so youll never get bored. you can buy character sets, announcers, hud skins, couriers, and loading screens to customize the way you want your game to look. it is difficult when you are new to it, but youll eventually get the hang of it. i recommend this game to almost anyone in the steam community, and the good thing is....its free!!!",3
"it is the best of games, it is the worst of games. there hasnt be a game in recent years that is equally likely to make you swear at the screen and idiotic teammates, as it is to make you smile and laugh when stuff goes well. i guarantee every game will produce emotion, even if some of those are better left unfelt. just dont punish the hardware youre playing on, its not to blame. and the first couple dozen games you play, you will hate it. and your team will hate you. and youll be told to delete dota and kill yourself. and because youre persistent and dont take crap from random morons on the internet, you will ignore them and get better at the game purely out of spite. its a great game. let the other players hatered fuel your desire to improve, and you will get better.",2
"just because you played league doesnt mean youre gonna grasp this game with ease. get ready to suck....badly.",1
"the original defense of the ancients, a custom map for warcraft iii, became an entire game considered to be a multiplayer masterpiece. it has inspired an entire genre of games from league of legends to smite. dota 2 can be experienced and enjoyed at multiple levels of ones time. the heavier you invest in this game, the more your reward would be.",2
"1/10 crap game wouldnt play. legue of lehendas is much better.",4
"ahhh.... dota 2. this game is severaly unbalanced since no matter how well you play, your team will always blame you for the loss. it is also insanely luck based because the team that gets most russians usually looses. a lot of functions in this game are completely broken as well. for example, even if you pick english in the language bar everyone still speaks russian. sometimes german or french, but never english. playing this game i had a few mental breakdowns and smashed three windows in total. it sometimes feels like my life is fading away and i imagine life in prison with a really musculine in-mate would provide the same level of . to sum up, this is game is ing terrible. 10/10 would recommend.",2

"clearly a poor attempt at marketing towards the lol consumers, this game copies every aspect of lol, along with adding crappy new elements such as killing your own minions and towers which is dumb, stupid donkeys (obvious videogamedunkey refrence towards lol players to better suit them) instead of recall, and is super hard. this game sucks because you automatically get every champion and they are all confusing other than sniper which has to be the most skilled champion in this copy cat of a game. do not play this game, play lol 11/10",3

"preper fer teh scery men to tern arond when da gem startz, itz a troll gem.",1
"this game is quite fun, indeed. yet the time it waists is impecable to any other game you will play. i tell everyone who plays this game to take moderatly long breaks (10-15 minute) in between games. for what this game has in store will make you a slave to its raw glory. it is fun, i will admit that, but nothing more. on the weekends i sit at my computer endlessly until about 2am then i go to sleep, the entire weekend please have a life dont play dota. -themail aka the mail man",2
"dota2 is so nice,i love dendi,resolution,and silent <3",2
"the learning curve is steep, but the game is good. really good. how good? how about... good enough to make you ask yourself questions like how important is dating really? or do i really need this job more than i need this win? good.",1
"i have played for about 120 hours and im still at the bottom of the learning curve. probably the best way to learn russian, brazilian, thai, and chinese. 69/10 would always play again",2

"actually f2p no bull crap that tries to make you pay for anything that makes you better in the game. the stuff that is paid for is all visual and really stunning. they even have some community made art that makes it to in game. this game is intensely competetive and is really well done.",1
"this is ing awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"this may be one of the best games i ever played. if you are new too the moba genre you will bennifit from some tutorials for nubs. you can find them on youtube. i say that because the learning curve is steep and unforgiving. but the payoff is huge. i hated the first 20 hours of my time on this game. but now i can honestly say it belongs in the pantheon of great games of all time.",2

"the difficulty spike is insanely high, but if you overcome it this game is very rewarding :d",1
"defense of the ancients 2 or dota 2 for short, is like being addicted to an extremely harmful substance. no matter how many times you queue for europe west and get russians. no matter how many times you get an insta-pick pudge going mid to feed. no matter how many times you see a bounty hunter build battlefury. youll keep coming back for that one taste of glory. its an extremely abusive relationship that is impossible to leave.",1
"dota is either fun or infuriating once you figure out what to do. dota destroys relationships with friends, makes you racist to nearly everyone that doesnt speak your language, makes you a terrible, intolerant person who insults people when barely provoked. if youre going to play dota, dont play it with good friends. play with friends you dont mind losing. thatll either make you super close or hate eachother. over 9000/10 get it now",2
"this game is the worst thing i ever played in my life. nothing but the worst community i ever seen people who last hit kill the creeps your attacking to steal your gold,and always steal your kills, and you will get targeted and people will cheatingly find you and kill you only, and there is no teamwork unless your playing with friends i do not recommend this game cause if you want anything to customize your characters the ing drop system is worst than tf2 basically saying buy if you want it. and the store ing really 200 or 300 dollars for a weapon or a head item. this is basically to drain you of your money and life. if you play this game your wasting your life.",1
"this game will make you hate every russian, spanish and portuguese you meet, it also cause paranoia, down syndrome, dysautonomia, yellow-nail syndrome and it  your friendship. also, you have a hero that gives cookies. best moba ever, 11/10 would buy, its gud srsly gg ff",2

"i warn you once. start playing this game and you will get addicted. the synergy between smooth gameplay, competivity and the ability to costumize your heros appearance is a dangerous swirl of digital pixels that keep you behind the screen of your computer. every game is diffrent, and you need to adjust. also, this game is great for beginners and proffesional players. valve is adding multiple gamemodes as we speak, and keeps improving the balance, adding new heroes and so on. dont forget to feed your cat. dota will take over your life.",5

"i dont have any idea why the noob russians must play in eu w or eu e when they have theyr own server",5
"originally a warcraft 3 mod, this highly influential arena style game has inspired many spin offs including the acclaimed league of legends. unlike league of legends however, you can control all 112 heroes when you buy the game, and there is no pay to win features at all; all bonus items are purely cosmetic and for fun. the community can even create content that can be acquired in game! the only shortcoming to dota is that it will be a little more difficult to pick up compared to league of legends. given the chance however, dota2 will prove to be a much more balanced and skill-oriented experience, with meaningful item and ability selection and a more dynamic gold farming game which both provide superior short and long term strategic gameplay. try the one that started it all, you wont be disappointed!",1
"this is the first arts game ive tried on steam,its way better then league of legends",4
"how does one simply describe dota 2 who knows but dont let the add fool you it is a moba better than lol and hon (in my opinion) it is just simply incredible with a fluent gameplay masses of diffrent players region chossing even language! the only left you seek is good gameplay and what do we have here something which ticks all the boxes there you have it dota 2...",3

"defence of the ancients is   finest multiplayer   . if you are        in to      .  .",2
"frankly and honestly !! dota 2 is awesome and great to play but one thing i disliked is about the steam wallet , i already add a minimum fund to my steam wallet and purchased a item on market , the thing i disliked is that you can`t withdraw your steam wallet money back to your paypal account or credit card , i think its unfair .. what will happen if i got a big steam wallet fund in the future by selling some items i get from a game that i played hard ? how can i withdraw my money to my paypal or credit card ?",3
"note : if you played dota 2 long enough then you must already know what im talking about. great game and require a lot of experience and knowledge to master. the strongest point about dota 2 is the teamwork witch is also the weak point at the same time. the matchmaking system is broken, in 9 out of 10 games youll find yourself playing with zero communication between teammates and doesnt matter what language preference you choose, you will always end up playing with players that doesnt speak english except words like : noob, f**** you, mid or feed... also while playing in solo queue, you will find yourself frequently playing against 4,5 man party. this will defensively will make the game balanced as you can see :) the game is totally invaded by kids and noobs and there is no support from valve.",5
"really like this game......from dota 1 until dota 2 thumbs up",2

"i can say that this game is kind a good. i really love it and i continue playing it. i think every gamer who like strategy and mmo rpg games will love this game. so many things to do and learn, so meany characters and items, so many item builds. however you can see a lot of awesome animations and effects. you can explore the map at day and night. also this game is not pay to win like other games, you just pay for character appearance ( if you would like ). i was a lol gamer but when i tryed dota 2 i thought that i left 5 years of playing kiddy game. this is an epic game with a lot of pvp and pve and tm ( teamwork). my rate is 10/10",1

"best cold war simulator ive played so far, youll be hating the russians in no time.",1
"well. like every other new and popular game that your friends force you into joining, dota2 is worth staying in. very heavy focus on team play, stunning graphics, massive hero/heroine selection, and the only thing you actually need to pay for is cosmetics. honestly, i dont care much for the flamewar between dota and lol. seriously, shut up already - its obvious dota 2 is better.",1
"this game took my virginity and never called me back",3
"game is so nice with stratgy n it is free to play..",4
"dota 2, a game where teamwork is key. this game is a moba where you work together with 4 others to destroy the other teams ancient, all while defending your own. when first getting in to this game, do the tutorial, it may be boring (really boring), but it teaches all the baisics. after 200 hours, i can say that this is one of the best games ive played and i hasnt gotten old yet",1
"10/10 got swore at in russian and portugese within the first 5 minutes, then decided this game was too hardcore for me. i would easily recommend this game to anybody that wants to feel like a worthless, bad video game player in 6 languages from sunday!",1

"we had two bags of tango, animal courier, five high-powered healing salves, a saltshaker half-full of dust of appearance, a whole galaxy of multi-colored wards... also, a quart of clarity, a case smoke of deceit, a bottle with a double damage rune, and two town portal scrolls. not that we needed all that for the dota, but once you get locked into a serious items collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. the only thing that really worried me was the bottle with a double damage rune. there is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man with the double damage, and i knew wed get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.",4
"giant spiders who will feast on your dead corpse? check. old baby butterfly shooting bubbles? affirmitive. rats thwacking you with shovels, old spiky grandpa who beats you in sports, walking clock that interrups you in every conversation (not an actual clock) and <type in name> spirits? why are you waiting? srsly. 8/10 because  mm!!!",3

"no quick scope, no jumping, no pot breaking, no one shotkill backstabbing? what kind of modern game is this? if i want to play a games with friends where everyone hates each other, id rather play mario kart. you can beat this game in 30 minutes to an hour, but a lot of people have over 1000 hours, they must really suck or something. thankfully its free, or else i wouldnt pay a single cent for this. and also i dont get why there are 107 characters. why cant there just be one ultimate character and just play it through? and ultimately, why am i forced to learn russian or portuguese in order to understand half of this game? 10/10, would not place any wards again.",1
"hello my name is joey and this is my dota (defense of the asians) 2 review doter two is a moba game whcih means that you are a battle solier that has to fite other battle soldier on a map teh map has three pathways or lanes and you have to kill the enemy asian with ur teame. the game was made by 3 autists in the summer of 2008 after playing boardd games and getting their positive results back, they wanted 2 make a game about autism and asians so they sstarted programming and got the disaster that is doter 2 personly i think the game is super super hard and its not balanced the sniper dude can instanltiy kill you but its fun when you kill an asian my final rating is 7/10 because bad but still good",1

"when i first started dota2 i was a little overwhelmed, as my first arts/moba game it was pretty complicated. i soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying. before i knew it, i was performing  and better. i stopped making silly  and  got vastly better at not  the enemy . for the  part, everyone ive met was very helpful and , there  the   however. as  - play dota2    ,  ,     .      !",3

"who hasnt played a moba in their life even if just one game. dota 2 takes that to next level with graphics and gameplay strategies and the punishment of even dying once :p. this is truly the real moba experience in my opinion, it has all elements needed to make you keep coming back to it and in my case i have bought soo many other games but i still just keep coming back to dota 2 and atleast make sure to play one game per day.",1
"this is a good game, however i dont like the concept of being paired with noobs. it totally ruins the game, you play with people that is not in the same skill level and you tend to lose more than to win most of your games. you should change the way how your system finds a match for an individual it should be people who win will be paired with people who win, and those who lose alot play amongst themselves. i cant believe that when you go solo match there are people who are in a party? whats that about? i believe that you can never learn common sense, you are born with that talent. you should hire developers that have common sense if you want this game of yours appreciated by dota2 and non dota2 players. most likely if non dota2 players find the enviroment in that kind of manner i believe that this game will be undisputedly number 1 in rtsgaming",3

"i dont generally recommend this game, because i dont think people would generally find it fun. the best way to try it though, would be with friends that are already very familiar with the game and would enjoy teaching you. if thats the case, give it a shot. if you want to play it solo however, be prepared for an abysmal time.",3
"very nice and addictive game. i recommend this game to my friends :)",1
"this game is not for people who have less than average control over keyboard and mouse. you would need prior experience with relatively complex games, strategic thinking and perseverence. the learning curve is steep and this game is very demanding for the new players, the community at large is unforgiving and brutal if you are making mistakes as the mistakes you make would affect everybody in your team causing your team to lose. you cannot quit mid-game and the game can go for a long time and the result may not be known till the very end. all this can easily put off many people, but those who pass this rite of passage would enjoy the same things that you hated as a newbie.",3

"dota 2 is one of those games that gets better every time i play it. even though its played on the same map every time, every game is still different one way or another. there are over 100 heroes to play as, which makes the game incredibly complex. ive put about 100 hours in to dota 2, and i still have no idea what half of them do. some focus on healing, others focus on beating the crap out of everything. its a fun and frustrating game, but mostly fun. it has a giant learning curve, so prepare to put alot of time into this one. the game is excellent. (9/10 or 90%)",1

"it is a very nice game but can you fix the match making because of some troling players :3",1
"what makes this game awesome is that each game is never the same. with such a large selection of heroes, items and straregies, it continues to keep you on your toes. dota 2 is all about team work and finding combinations that will work well together and there is nothing like that feeling you get when your team pulls of an amazing combo move that wipes out all your enemies. dont take the game to likely either as the scales may turn at anytime which makes for even more fun.",1

"the best free game ive ever played, and apparently designed by someone who actually knows how to implement both fun gameplay and microtransactions that dont feel like im going through psychological torture for not paying. im surprised it doesnt have more players.",1
"this game is going to take control of you, the graphics are among the best in mobas. the community is, well, not as good as you would want it to be, but if you have friends you can play with, it doesnt matter as much. there are over 120 heroes to choose from and after 100+ hours youll know all the things you need! everything is available to you from the start so you can quickly master a few heroes and play on all pick if you want to, or play on single draft for additional challenge. there are also 8 gamemodes and a lot of events are coming out for nearly every festival eg. christmas, halloween etc. overall, i recommend the game, its great. if you want to learn the basics go play on bots for a while with a guide. dota 2 gets a 9/10 from me just because of the community.",3

"causes anxiety problems, low self esteem, tourettes syndrome, mood swings, bipolar disorder, breakdown of relationships, raging erections, racism. would definitely recommend.",3
"dota 2 is a unique moba game that is for me a balanced game that some other mobas are not that balanced and it also changes its game depending on the changelog or nerfs that for me will not bore me to play it for a long time and the matchmaking in ranked is also helping us to change our playstyles depending on you mmr that will help you to be a better player as you go to ranked and i would really recommend it because dota 2 is a good game and it will be a waste if some people dont know about dota 2.",3

"this game is absolutely amazing, with a great mixture of depth and hilarious moments. one such example, is the fact that despite the games serious atmosphere, it has the funniest videos on youtube, like never go full agility and chaos dunk. i have really come to enjoy this game, having played almost 650 hrs on it. though i must say that some of your teammates in game are going to be s, and will report you for stupid reasons such as stealing kills or not listening. good luck and have fun :d",3

"dota 2 is a brilliant game; it takes teamwork and takes it to a whole new level. in dota 2, you fight in 5 v 5 matches and if you dont play a part in your team, you will lose! there are many characters (a bit too many for my taste) and many customizable features. but these customizable features are like the hats in tf2; they dont do anything but they look cool. speaking of tf2, the sniper character also makes various references to the sniper class in tf2. if you like league of legends or rts games then this is for you. if you are cod fanboy who cannot play different games without declaring that they are  then go and play some starcraft 2 you trogladite. 8/10",1

"dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably wont suit you if youre looking to play casually. theres a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. but once you start to learn its secrets, theres a wild and exciting variety of play here thats unmatched, even by its peers. its a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. the fact that its completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isnt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. may the best team win.",5

"1,587 hours on record for a reason. this game is more competitive and less childish than my previous game and train wreck of a dota-like accectable choice league of legends. yes the dota 2 community is rough but that is how it has been since dota on wc3. harder than usual to walk into and get going at first because of the vast knowledge of the game but replays can easily fix that in a day. overall great game and once again,  league of legends.",4
"kinda good game but if you are not playing in the us servers then you will have mostly worse games, well... depending on your matchmaking level some community members dont know how to select languages that they accually speak, for example: i only choose english language, then some russian people choose russian language+english language> accept game> start arguing with people that say: please dont matchmake in english language if you cant accually speak english. valve should fix this by making some language quiz that you have to do before you can even start queueing anyways, i love this game, cheers!",2
"dota 2 adds a great deal of complexity to the moba genre. its balance tenet is: everything goes. there is no character that is underpowered; in fact, theyre all overpowered in their own way. the game places a great burden of knowledge over whoever tries it out. be sure to stick to co-op games for starters. the tutorial may prepare you slightly, but the game as a whole is a lot more complex than other mobas on the market. oh, and the saying it aint over till its over applies here. you cant be sure youre winning until the radiant/dire goes down. lots of rooms for comebacks in here, but the game is far more snowbally than other mobas.",1

"dota 2 is a great game but those who are playing it for the 1st time..... warning : it requires time both to learn it and to play it. if you are too busy this game will probably be boring to you since it isnt a game that you can leave in between and complete the next day, it requires your whole attension for 1 hour almost to play one game . the game is much more fun to play with your friends (because you can scream at them for destroying a perfect game ,when you meet them again) because dota is a team game .",3
"if you love rts and want to cool off from war hammer or starcraft, why not play dota? you control 1 hero (at most 5 units.), a lot of depth, easy to learn hard to master and most important fun as hell. in my opinion takes lol by a long shot and the fact that ice frog and valve are behind this gives it credit alone. ive been playing the dota 2 test and this is my conclusion; on the sound nice ambiance and very engaging battle music, on the graphics the environment needs a bit of work but the hero aesthetics are great and on the mechanics... well i think its too early to say but seems on the right track. all in all a great and (again in my opinion) a must have game. score: visuals: 10/10 musichero vocals: 10/10 mechanics: 9.5/10 overall: 10/10",2

"this game... , its almost like they invented this instead of timetravel. its insanly addictive, and time just flys by, but dam is it a good game. try not be daunted by going into it blind, there are pleanty of guids and build suggestions for new players to get the jist of the game, but there is always something new to learn , which isint a bad thing as it keeps the game fresh. oh and free? hell yes i recommend it",1

"best game balanced graphics which is not irritating in the eye and the heroes look badass ;) lol",3
"to start with if youre thinking of playing dota2 its going to be rough when you start and its probably best to start with some friends, but when you get past that barrier youll never find another game to fill that void of dota2s moba experience. would totally recommend this to anyone thinking of playing just beast through the beginners block and ignore the flamers :)",2

"i was jungling chaos knight one afternoon, racking up the six figure kill spree when i had an epiphany. after about 3 matches youve seen it all- this is a painfully simple game that offers no challenge whatsoever. i have some suggestions to improve the gameplay at least twentyfold: 1. introduce a loadout screen and killstreak perks, such as uavs and ac-130s, to reward hardcore junglers such as myself. 2. have an in game marketplace, where in game gold can be purchased for bitcoins, at a ratio of 1:1. 3. increase number of players per team to 16 for epic battles.",1
"no matter how many times i play this game, i wont get bored :d",2
"its a good game download it :d note: not for childs xd",2
"brilliant game, made even more amazing with your friends co-operation however, there is one bad side. although this game is shockingly awsome, there is a bad point to it. there are some items that are incredibly rare and un-attainable unless you are willing to pay a good 30/50 for them. for example the treasure of the emerald dragon that came out recently was only out for an hour and the items within it are amazing but are beyond comprehension and youd have to sell an unusual of tf2 in order to obtain it. its a fun game in itself, however im just a bit peeved that the developers would make it so impossible for fans to gain the cooler items they love and how some treasures are hidden from the public eye. download the game, love it for what it is and sell your soul to it; then realise you cant obtain the beautiful items you would like :)",2
