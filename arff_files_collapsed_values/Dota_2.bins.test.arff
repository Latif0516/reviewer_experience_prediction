"this is a moba game, what else could i say about it? im pretty sure youve read a bunch of review upon dota before coming to this review. getting straight to the point that this game is probably worth playing if youre interested in facing people across the internet who are skilled in tactics and strategy against their opponents within a moba like world with a variety of different characters each with their different playstyles.",3
"this is the best game :d but i hate scammer ..until now steam cant take action about my item have been stolen by middleman !! rip for my item !",9

"dota 2 will be your new or next girlfriend. highly recommend.",6
"goodest game every made and u have so many frends 2",3
"first, all heroes are totally free so dota 2 is not a pay-to-win game. second, each round is really dynamic and active so the player can make their chance to win when theyre in a bad situation.",1
"a compelling game that allows casual gamers to engage on a more intellectual and active battlefield. fast paced, intense action await those who crave for tactical moba skirmishes! around a hundred heroes to choose from, and a million more to play with. great job valve!",10
"very beautiful game, im addicted. meepo is love. meepo is life.",3
"awesome game, great for co-op and competative play.",3

"its amazing strategy game for people who knows how to play using brains",7

"good game. helped me meet new people and make some friends.",3
"pretty good moba in my opinion. free to play, which is good because otherwise i probably would not have gotten into the realm of mobas in the first place. the learning curve can be pretty daunting at first, so i would recommend that you get a friend to help you learn the basics. 9/10 pros: solid multiplayer, large character selection, fun rpg elements, gameplay never gets boring cons: steeper learning curve, will need to learn jargon",1
"if you like ripping your  off this is the game for you. 10/10 ign",6

"this game isnt like call of duty at all. 0/5 stars, not worth the money.",3

"best game with bad community. do something to separe russians from humans please. or at least do something to auto-translate their language or aut-ban them (this is the best way to make this game better). i bet everybody hate that russians who play in your team and you say something and they will say something like fasfsdfs6afs sdfsdf sdfsad78f6s9a8f and you dont know what to do ... or when they have score 0-69 and you die once and they say you f***ing feeder , dayumm this is so bad , let them play with their russians and dont let us play with them please !",2
"new interface hero, hd graph, and so many event and item that make this game not so bored",9
"i am done with dota 2 after 1000+ hours. sold all my 200 euros worth items. community to toxic... game is great but the fact that is free makes it so... bad when i started they cursed me every game for being noob, later reported me for good games. so many friends of mine tried to scamm me, so little honest and nice people. i will miss them. i am 27 yrs old playing games since i was 12. never seen so unfriendly community, so much rage, so much toxic  in my life. saying this after 1000+ hours and a lot money invested in a free game means something.",3
"this is soo good, its far better than lol but not nearly as good as hon but still its awesome.",1
"do you know what meth is? dota 2 is the exact same thing you come out losing teeth, paying people for things you dont need, seemingly twitch for no reason whatsoever, and you become racist to every living thing ever created... yup that sums up dota 2 in a nutshell. have fun playing guys.",3

"dota 2, is personally my faveroute game on steam how i never get bored of it. 2 teams of five to push towers on 3 lanes and destroy the enemy ancient. with a massive pool of fun heros this just never gets boring. however, playing online with people if you ever make a small mistake people will rage on you like crazy. but after this downside i have had some of the biggest laugh i have had with my friends on this game. recomended.",6

"dota 2 is a great game! when you guys wanna win the round teanwork is needed. although sometimes we meet some noob teamates just bear it and lead them to the road of victory. lastly, personal skills is still needed xdd",1
"best moba in my opinion. although the game is not fully done yet, but it is alive due to great updates almost every day. the balance between heroes is very good, skill matters also. but the game vs real players, not bots, is very hard on my opinion and needs to be balanced, so professional players will not play with newbies. i recommend it to everyone, who like moba games and good graphics, friendly interface and cooperating.",2

"if you like league of legends and other games of that genre, i would recommend dota 2. i enjoy the gameplay and the graphics, especially fun to play with friends. plenty of items to get to customize your characters and plenty of other items too. game styles and all kinds of other things.",1
"im pretty sure all of my friends play it (caused this is where i met all of them lol) but this game is amazing! strategy is perfectly orchestrated into the captivating gameplay and perfect graphics, storyline is not key but there are hints and traces of it shot out at you through weapon flavor text and fanmade comics. all in all this game is great, and although it may seem that this game is kind of lame because you dont keep items after matches at first, that doesnt matterf after the first hour or so of gameplay.",8

"approaching 2100 hours played...wow. while i do completely agree with the reviews that talk about how bad the community is, i have to say my experience of dota on the whole has been very enjoyable. the mute option is great, i insta-mute anyone talking crap. admittedly dota has an incredibly high learning curve, and you will often find high level players playing on noob accounts so even the early matches for new players can be brutal. if you can push through the first couple of hundred hours of games ;) and ignore the torrent of expletives thrown your way when you let the team down!; you will find dota 2 to be a: competitive, intense, challenging, and completely engaging experience.",7
"once you get past the vertical wall of a difficulty spike, this game becomes one of the funnest things you can play for free.",3
"comment: good game, enticing for those intrigued by tactics and decision making. has a steep learning curve, however once over the initial bump the game sails smoothly. with over 500 hours there is still so much to learn and understand regarding gameplay and dynamics. ____________________________________________________________________________________ rating: 8.5/10 ____________________________________________________________________________________",4

"it seems like just a few days back, we started playing this game but now when i look back, time had been chasing us for years. kalimpong, our small cyber, that group, those moments and now when i try to remember at what point it all began i realise it had started a long time ago.",6
"nowhere near as cool as league of legends. i mean, you get all the heroes for free? what kind of stupid game designer implements that? also, this game is clearly a copy of lol. forget the fact that the original dota was made way before league of legends.",5
"a great game, the heroes offer a variety of ways to play and with the constant update a more equal matches",5
"worst addiction ever! ruined my life, i could have programmed myself new game for a time being on dota. u will meet some awesome people but those are minor in compare too nervous, low self esteem, hardcore, racist, disorderly, anorexic maniacs which outnumbers normal standards.",6

"the game teaches you many things such as team work, strategy, charecter build and russian. it causes you to be racsit towards any 1 who dont speak english, gets you angry when some one is playing as riki, drow ranger and sniper. side effects: hatered to russians, masive reduce in sleep hours, paranoia for pink smoke, anger and racsisem. 10/10 would buy if it was not free.",2

"this is no game - this is an addiction. its a very tough game which provides new stuff to learn even after 2.000 hours of playing it. though its very hard to get into game mechanics, it is a necessary thing to do a decent job in this game. but its absolutely worth it! dota offers so many intensive moments and chances to turn everything around, matches which are obviously lost or won... despite that, ive met some nice and precious people which i never want to miss again.",6

"only reason you arent playing this is because youre bad",1
"thank you for those who managed this game... it gaves a lot of fun to the people who is busy in working like me ^^",1
"its a great game. i highly recommend it because of the amount of variety. it gives you over 50.. no.. over 100 combinations of characters and items to use in battle. in dota 2 you rely both on strategy and strength, and in some cases, even teamwork. but there are some few drawbacks, for example, theres only 1 map and finding an online game in some regions takes several minutes. ( or at least, that is my case ). but still, the design of characters, effects and models, compared to the ones from dota 1, are fascinating. i really like the new heroes look. plus, its not like you really have to pay for useful weapons and items. you can buy things in-game, in map shops to strengthen your hero, and even your team. i really give this game a high ranking!",1

"litterally the best game ever, thats all i need to say",4
"each match of dota 2 is independent and involves two teams, both containing five players and each occupying a stronghold at either end of the map. located in each stronghold is a building called the ancient; to win, a team must destroy the enemys ancient. each player controls a hero character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory. overall, this game is a very intense and full of war occurrences, spell caster, magic and physical damage, even the absolutely stunning built-up for every each heroes. this game, dota 2, is the best multi-player game available on the market yet...!",3

"fake! its actuallly not a game, not even techies in it!",1
"a good twist on a mmo mostly focused on strategy. this game is playable by a wide range of players due to its different playing style for each character. whether you are a supporter role for a team or the leader or the pusher. all of them offer unique gameplay styles. the objective though rather simple is rather hard to achieve in fact and can lead you to racking your brains to think of the best way to destroy the enemies base. this game forges camarderie among players as each player in the team have to work with each other and support each other with the different skillsets they each have. i strongly recommend you trying this game for a classic game twisted into something fresh and renewed, its worth a try and most certainly will find a playing style in there to suit you.",1
"if you ever wanted to learn russian, then this game is totally the best one to learn basic russian and insults at one place. forget about school, get dota and play with cold-blooded russians, which doesnt shrink back to insult you because youre not playing good with a hero, which is in their opinion, the easiest hero in the whole game. well, the only thing is that you cannot understand them while theyre talking ingame, because theyre mainly talking russian. get yourself a dictionary and start learning russian there! its the best thing you can do. 10/10 would play it again.",5

"good game , it involves strategy, teamwork , and experience . actually dota2 is just a improved version of dota1 with better graphics . it also one of the most recognized game in the world. the most important thing is the game is f2p(free to play), and theres no p2w(pay to win) elements. its all about skills the important thing to play dota is you need to keep up with the current meta and playstyle, since theres a lot of changes every update , make sure you read the changelog after every updates",8

"great game with alot of choices tough i recomend finding friends to play it with as the community can be quite aggressive and also there seems to be quite a large number of players that do not care in language search preference seeing despite having it set to only english i see russian, german and all sort of languages in chat but if you can come over the two points i mentioned before and manage to learn game mechanics and also other things such as what roles and heroes you like this is a really nice game to put your time into",5
"i do not know what it is about this game that makes me spend so much time playing it. at first it was to beat my friend in our number or wins race, but yesterday i spent over twelve hours straight just playing offline bots matches. if i could figure out why i love this game so much i would better understand myself as a person, but it seems as if it was not meant to be since i now have a couple of hours invested in this game and nothing has been revealed. in any case i will keep playing, i will keep seaching, in the hopes that one day my review can explain to my family why i never leave my computer.",4

"dota 2 is awesome. i highly recommend playing this game with friends, its a lot funnier that way. you will learn to be a part of a team. it can be really good when you are stressed out, as it can easily distract you. there are also some bad things about it. for example, people rage and flame too much. the worst thing that can happen to you in dota is when all players in the game are flaming you. you will be come angrier when playing this game. dont get me wrong, there are people who play dota and dont flame or rage. finding these people can be hard, therefore i suggest playing with friends. dota can make you happy, you can have a good laugh while playing it. remember, if you are already angry and raging too much in the game, go make a pause and come back later.",4

"best to download it and start playing!!! its a addicting game, and very challenging. my advice for all players who want to win in this game is to have a good team that you can depend on. so best to create your own team than joining random players from other countries that you cant understand what their saying.",5
"this game can be super fun; however, it can also be the worst experience of a lifetime as well. i usually only play it if i have four other friends to queue with. that said, if you want to have a life, dont download this game. its so time consuming and will require you to devote so much time and effort. also, its way better than league of legends.",3

"i wouldnt recommend this game. after a huger then huge learning curve, you will log in, be online, and  up our matches, because you suck. after proving you suck, we will still have to play with your noob  for at least 30 mins. so you will get hated on. you will get reported, you will be in waiting queues forever. after about half a year you might grow some ing sense and skills to play decent, but i doubt it, and even then youd be no match compared to the ogs.. so, stick to css dude, go play tf2, have a nice portal experience or something... just keep away from this game, itll damage you beyond repair, and you will intoxicate our dota2 experience, and besides that, your just too dumb. now get lost. move!",2

"i want something new about this game.i hope it last for a decades.. :)",1
"best moba ive ever come across and trust me on this one guys lol is nothing as compared to dota or dota 2 . the voice acting is over thr top and is quite hillarious at time and though being a moba it looks beautifull and once u get a hang of it , it becomes quite addictive",3
"the first time i saw this game, my thought was that this game was lame but when i try its really fun and awesome. there are like 50 heroes that you can pick so you wouldnt get bored. every heroes have ultimate ability. for example, zeus can send a lightning strike to all of the opponents heroes. jaggernaut can jump and slice the opponents heroes to pieces. my rating: 10/10 please try this game. its good as . if you dont know how to play, please check the dota 2 wiki or watch at youtube.",1

"good game, but can you please make philippines a new server and separated them from se asia? so we will more enjoying this game :)",1
"dota 2 is a really addictive moba. while i still love playing league of legends, i also love playing dota 2. dota 2 is more of a challenge then league of legends, which makes dota a really fun game to experiment with and have fun on.",1

"one does not simply play zeus and not killsteal butt it still fun the only thing u have to deal with is everyone pushing accept and dealing with sniper",2
"strangely addictive after youve figure out one hero. alternatively frustrating and exhilirating. interesting events. nice when you have a team or bunch of friends but also good to play solo. love the hero items and effects. agonizing to play when the internet connection is bad or when you have abusive teammates. every game, even played with the same people, is different. infinite combinations of heroes, items, usage and player skills. takes some time to get the hang of any hero at first but some help always... helps... hahaha... =) enjoy!!",4
"play dota 2 to have awesome great gaming experience ever.",6
"if you are new to mobas.... go to league of legends to get your foot in the waters, because this game is hardcore and complex. put in simple this is high risk/ high reward. fail 2 or three times, the match favors the other team. there will be frustrating moments, but after you past the learning curve, this game is very addicting. only watch the pro plays on youtube after you already get a feel of what dota is about, and you will be amazed at the things the pro players are able to pull off.",4
"great game, it might be hard to get in to for non moba players but the game depth is great and it will bring hours of enjoment especially if you play with friends.",2
"better than league of legends and hon and smite because all those games has coppied dota then copied the sequel dota 2. dota 2 takes more skill then league of legends and dota 2 is much more complex and has many mechanics. no hero is op there is a counter to everything. 11/10 ruined my life 11/10 would ruin again 11/10 would review this again to say its better than league of legends anyday",4

"i started playing heroes of newerth and i enjoyed it very much! alot of my competitive friends left and went to play dota. i eventually ended up doing so too. i cant describe how happy i am with the move. dota 2 is by far the best of its kind. scratch league, scratch hon, scratch and of them other copy cat wannabes and make the switch today. updates all the time, new models all the time, the orginal frog who created this presents is in lead with valve. theres no reason not to switch. stop being a follower and become a leader!",5

"kinda sure that i dont have to introduce this game.... so, simply said, this game is brilliant! even a statisctics are proving it, dota 2 is most played game every day on steam... so if you like moba games, youre sick of lol, hots is too much simple and smite is too new and different, then just download it and youll see it by yourself.",1

"it was nice i liked it. the graphics were awesome and so was the music and all. the beginning part explains it all. like how you can get items. also enjoyed being that sniper guy. i like the dragon knight the best though to be honest. however, i do not feel like just sitting here on my computer for hours trying to defeat someone or the computer. they had that dota 2 international championship for 3 days for a reason people. i also rage quit. no i was just getting angry at how long the battle was taking and how annoying it was to keep on dying with the healing potion or tree healer items just healed me for a little bit like maybe just 5 hp at a time. it was still a good game to play.",1
"did not like it at first though it was slow and dumb and kept losing did not know why, then i won a game, and another and another. then i lost...... tried again, lost. tried again , won, top of the team, lost again ,won, disconnected, won lost won, won, won, maxed a character, got godlike!!!! im still playing, cant stop, win lose win win lose,  team, good team, what does this item do? and this? or this? hold back, push , work togeter, kill, push, kill. what the hell happened? , i love this game now.",1

"the game itself isnt bad. nice depth, decent character selections. the community is garbage. pure filth, the likes of which you wont find anywhere else that is not a moba(youll find it in other mobas, apparently the hellbound enjoy this type of product). the game keeps wanting me to try it. the playerbase keeps wanting me to abandon all hope in humanity. so.......if you really dont care about other people, this may be for you. if other players can ruin team based experiences for you, keep looking.",1

"this game has changed my life in ways only zeus can understand.",2

"good game and amazing game in the world ! and i love this game forever :d",5
"dota 2, a very frustrating game that forces you to play with and against other players. youll rely on your team to preform their selected roles, and then watch in horror as they completely ignore the game mechanics and just chase down kills, rarely successfully. you build in game items during the match to enhance your characters role and then hope and pray your team doesnt feed the opposition too much. team fights, normally 5v5, tend not to happen as you watch your fellow team members run to meet their fate and be a hero. sadly this ends up throwing the game and you lose. i would still recommend this game, purely for those few matches when the your whole teams synergy is in harmony, watch as the gold floods in, the towers crumble and the opposition blame each other for their loss.",6
"i love dota 2 is has a steep learning cruve i feel but is way more fun than a lot of moba style games.",3

"been playing dota since warcraft 3 days.. its definitely one of the greatest games of all time. its extremely fun to play, can be competitive in ranked games, or casual in ability draft messing around games. best part, its free to play! definitely a game for most gamers!",3
"icefrog and valves brainchild, a mix of the classic dota-allstars map we all know and love backed by valves awesome source engine. this game will get you hooked in a couple of sessions, where each game is intensely packed with strategy and action. i guarantee youll keep coming back for more! with its steep learning curve it will take you hours on end to fully grasp what the game is all about, and thats what makes it so addictive, but once you learn the tools of the trade its going to be worth it.",5
"not a good game for a first time players. not much else to say. unless you can deal with way too much pressure in the game, and dont give up after losing many games. then maybe you should play it. in the end, you would end up learning and stop losing it.. or playing.",1
"a must play for anyone. from a large pool of unique heroes you play as one who possesses unique abilities to be used in tandem with the rest of your team in order to out-maneuver the opposing team. my first moba was lol, and i have permanently made the switch to dota 2 after weighing the pros and cons, and have never looked back. with the talented people at valve continuing to produce and develop this game, i am absolutely certain this will be a revered classic for many years to come.",2

"if youre looking for a good, visually appealing and challenging game, perhaps you like league of legends a lot but youre looking for a new game? then this is for you. i personally like this a whole lot more than league. dota 2 has all of the things league of legends is missing, like couriers and a stash. its free and the costumizables are a huge bonus, just like in tf2 with all the hats. although it might be hard in the beginning, if you stick to it im sure youll find many hours of fun, and to add one last thing: its best played with friends!",3
"this is where i began my journey on the steam community",1
"this game is the greatest thing that happened to me. it takes 5-10hrs of my time everyday, i can say that playing dota 2 changed my life in a way that i kinda lost my social life but that good thing about it is i get to meet alot of new friends online. i dont know what will happen to my 2-3 years from now because im already wasted almost a year of my life. thanks dota2",1
"way way way more depth than league of legend (lol), steeper learning curve, higher skill cap and alot more balancing / fair play. has some similarities to hon but overall feels like a really different game. i love both but dota 2 feels more competitive and has a bit more interesting heroes + the balancing is better (except riki). i would recommend this game if youre into something that requires you to actually think and use your brain unlike lol. i personally prefer hon out of all the mobas but that might just be cause i started with it, dota 2 comes close as second. 9/10",4
"this game improved so much since it was released on the beta. there are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as dota 1. i know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in dota 2 and i think it will help new comers. i know some people who play lol might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. its like comparing cod and battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, i think bot of them are good) give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. try it out, its free and badass!",5

"just like snowy said  horrible game. hundreds of hours spent on playing on the same map, even with lots of heroes. after first 20-30 hours, ull start to be too agressive. after first 100 hours, ull split up with ur girl friend and u will play dota even more times per week. after 500 hours, ull  every mom u will meet. after 1000 hours... youre nobody. you got no friends, no girldfriend, no knowledge... everything u have is dota. do not play this game.",6
"this game is too hardcore for me, ill stick to lol.",2
"excellent game, recomend playing one character solidly to get used to the game and then branching out",2
"i have played the first dota for wc3 back in the day and love the way it has grown. the visual upgrades to the small changes in enviroment and the consistant rate at which the game is updated and talked about really makes me feel great, loving the game myself and wanting nothing more than this upward growth.",1

"the good: fun, addicting, strategic, teamwork, dominating, pub stomping, competitive play, daily tournaments and non advantage giving item shop (cosmetic only). the bad: match making in the skill level bracket can seem to be a bit broken at times. one bad player can ruin the match. players that disconnect and abandon in 5 minutes. occaisonal 3-5 minute wait on a match. other thoughts: i love dota 2 in the strategic gameplay. after all it is a moba and a strategy game at best so it requires a lot of patience and a lot of good timing, skill, and also great efficient teamwork. thank you valve for bringing us such an amazing game!",2
"teamwork, fast reaction, attention to details, this game has it all",3
"trial by fire. straight up. youre going to learn exceptions to the rule by being killed by them, and its going to happen a lot. dota is the most brutal learning curve of any game ive ever played. sometimes in a well-done fashion, sometimes not. there are few games where i can honestly say that at 300 hours you have barely any true idea what youre doing. amazingly complex game! tons of fun, especially with friends. not a casually oriented game at all, but enormously entertaining to play and watch. no grind, no microtransactions that affect gameplay in any way. no outside advantages, no premade skills. everything happens in game and you need to be quick on your feet. try it out! just be warned that properly trying it out will take hundreds of hours. relax, youre doing fine.",6

"so ive never been a fan of mobas, was just to lazy to learn how to play them until league came along. oh god, the good times ive had on league, slowly becoming better and better, but it slowly became a game that i loved to play buy also hated to play. the community was  as i had 5 players on the opposite team hatin on me, and then my own ing teammates hatin on me. so i made the switch to dota2 and i am totally satisfied. the game play is awesome, the champions are interesting and creative, its everything i love about a moba. personally i like it more than league now that ive played it for a while. pros: fun game, a good moba, creative heroes, good community, better than league ;) cons: some minor glitches that can be fixed quite easily and occur due to stupidity xd so yes, even to people who hate mobas, i recommend that you try and get to know how to play the game before you judge it.",1

"at first i thought that mobas in general were terrible, i played the dota 2 tutorial and played ten matches then uninstalled the game. i really didnt like playing the game because every time i played i was shouted at and put in low priority. about a year later after my friends insisted that i play i started afresh and managed to quickly find my feet and dota 2 is now one of my favourite all time games. the steep learning curve makes dota 2 hard to get into but after you start understanding tactics and mastering characters it becomes an amazing game. the hundreds of characters, items, playstyles, etc. make every game fresh and exciting. if you manage to make your way out of the (noob/pinoy) bracket of players then suddenly the game opens up with possibilities and becomes one of the best games that i have ever played. it will keep you entertained for years and years.",2
"this game just shows that anything is possible if you work hard alone because russians keep you down all the time",2

". 10/10 would report u for feed again. i think this game has made me partially more russian. i can understand a lot of russian as well as spanish and i can read chinese like no other. i call this path in dota... the  blyat technique. you gather as much knowledge of the three languages then proceed to say 4 things. omg mid  blyat i have 100% win rate with this technique. if you liked political simulator ur going to love this game",8

"official middle finger trainer, supported by team yka.",3
"really great game. introduced me to mobas. very addictive and a friendly and helpful community. little confusing at first but fun once you get used to it. fascinating graphics and crisp sounds. gameplay can feel repetitive but theres always an element of suspense. each player hero is unique and powerful and the user interface of the game is easy to understand. does not constantly bug you for micro-transactions which is great. only problem is that finding a match, even on my closest servers takes quite some time (3-4 mins.) loving the game otherwise. 9/10 - the best moba",1
"a very enjoyable moba game, with the detail that stood out the most being that you dont need to purchase characters like in others. there are plenty of heroes to choose from to keep the game interesting.",1

"dota is either fun or infuriating once you figure out what to do. dota destroys relationships with friends, makes you racist to nearly everyone that doesnt speak your language, makes you a terrible, intolerant person who insults people when barely provoked. if youre going to play dota, dont play it with good friends. play with friends you dont mind losing. thatll either make you super close or hate eachother. over 9000/10 get it now",4

"with the amount of fans of the original dota (defense of the ancients) i can say you will have around 1-2 mins of waiting time which is not as bad as the csgo waiting time which takes close to 20-25 mins.dota is a moba (multiplayer online battle arena) its a mixed of rts but you only use 1 hero.if you are a fan of fast paced strategic rts-like gameplay then i would highly recommend this game.if you are really want to start of this game i would suggest learning the curves by playing with bots before playing online with other players.the community for the game is around the level of being really good to being really bad,meaning some people are just really big s while there are also really awesome players to play with..i would also suggest playing with some friends and play in a party..its alot better..i hope you guys the best :) i would give this game a thumbs up!",5

"i avoided mobas for so long, you know. i really did. barring a short and entirely disagreeable experience with the original defense of the ancients map for warcraft 3, and a brief stint playing demigod (which i thoroughly enjoyed, all the while failing to notice it pretty much was defense of the ancients) i hadnt touched this genre at all. heroes of newerth? nope. league of legends? nah. dota 2? good grief, no. there were plenty of reasons for this. first, my initial experience with warcraft 3s dota map really was that bad. second, moba communities have a rather strong reputation for being full of complete cockhandles, and i dont deal well with destructive criticism. third, im not a huge fan of most pure multiplayer games; i tend to prefer playing solo where i can. it did not appear to be the game for me...",5
"great mp game, but first, learn how to play if u dont want everybody to jump on you",4

"one of the best free to play,moba games ever made!",4
"only the best game ever. if you want to play an aggravating game, with a ridiculously steep learning curve, that will probably ruin your life, and a community that speaks through cussing, this is for you. other than that, its a great game. newbies should always play meepo their first game.",3

"amazing game oppinion wise i think it is way better than lol.",4
"the toxicity and animosity of the players in this game is horrible. people who kill you on sight in rust are nicer. people will be  even if you are winning. everything you do will be wrong. you will see an exclamation mark ping a million times and have no idea what is going on because even though you are playing on us server no one else speaks english. you will be called names, you will hear mariachi music, and see jajajajaja every other game. but you will never stop playing... dota is life.",5
"for the low low price of your soul and entire social life in the trash, this game is sure to make you a racist, an , or both (or get your theoretical money back!). so, come now and experience 1 year before the divorce - simulator, also known as dota 2 and mother russia - the game. ***surgeon generals warning: this game is proven to give people social and moral cancer. user discretion is adviced.***",3

"i had a good time playing this game. every other review of this game says that it ruined the reviewers life and gave them, i quote, erectile disfunction, knowledge of many other languages, the ability to be massively racist and social anxiety disorder. no, this is not true. i played my first few games ,and whilst the community is appalling, managed to learn the basics. after a few more hours i had learnt to play fairly well and maintained my erectile functionality and friendships. also, it is a free game so give it a go. if you find an item, you can sell it for money. however, i will have to warn you that in many of your early games you will be matched with horrible people who will insult you and speak russian. ignore this, improve and help others.",1
"i like the game so much! i am addicted to the game! but i dont like the idea when someone is noob to play, reported by other player for playing noob! maybe he is a beginner, why blame it to him when the team is lossing.",6
"dis gaem is supr rip of league of lesbianz 0/10 wud recommend",5
"what can i say... dota ..not only dota2.. its a strategy game after all. its not limited to using a skill on one or two..or five enemy heroes.. but to know when and how to use it.. plus, the items suggestion are not always applicable. each item has its role..and against different enemy. overall, the game is for those with a little imagination. as for the graphics.. pretty much outstanding.. always getting improved.",9
"i recommend this game because you really need some skills like teamplay / lasthitting / denying etc. its a very enjoyable game which you can play with friends. the trading system can also be very nice there. this game often calls out many updates, so if youre wondering if this game has events then well ofcourse! for those who havent played it yet and really need a new game, try this one. (games usually take 30+ minutes.)",4

"my friends hated me after playing this game with them. 10/10",1
"dota 2 is hard, but theres a huge reward for those who commit. on the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) defense of the ancients modification for warcraft iii, now transferred into valves source engine. the games punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but its worth sticking the hours in: success in dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.",5
"virtual chess where the team is as good as its weakest player. 10/10.",8
"fantastic moba, my favourite, and perfect f2p model, you have full access to the game, the cash shop is only for cosmetic items. it has frequent meaningful updates and its the most balanced moba ive played, not to mention the graphics are good and its engine is very tweak-able, meaning youre going to be able to play the game on older systems, it runs on linux too.",3
"ok game spend little to no time playing it as its repetitive and boring #swagyolo",8
"dota2 lets you pick what servers you want to play in, but no matter what your playing with russians or hispanics. they will yell at you in broken english or in their home laungage, they well call you noob becuase its one of the only words they know. if you play dota2 you will grow to hate anyone that cant speak english. 11/10, would play again",2

"very fun, very time consuming. alot of new content. great game to have",4
"dota 2 is in a strong place right now. its rewarding and sociable like few other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. the next few months will be crucial: its currently the best expression of valves progressive attitude towards players, and if it can continue on that track it describes a future for online gaming that is far more hopeful than the one were used to. thats the big picture, however. for me, dota 2 will continue to be about the friends that i learned to play it with, the ones ive made through playing it, and that ceaseless, pointless singing.",8
"i love this game so much. i had tried lol before, and i didnt like it because you had to either pay, or unlock all of the heroes through play. dota gives me all of the heroes right off of the bat. plus its super fun :)",4

"learn to speak spanish, portugese, and russian 10/10 better than rosetta stone.",5
"im a 2 years old league of legends player and i have to admit that dota 2 is have something better than lol. it is a great game without imbalanced, no heroes are too strong or too weak, and it is fun too play, even though the open chest keys is kind of frustrating sometime.",4
"the only game that your team is english and your enemys are russains (always) and mepo is the best!",2
"dota 2 is very addictive game, dont tolerate it too much because your grades will get lower",2
"this game is so addictive because of its graphics <3",4
"the developers are really updating this game allot, and the recent changed they made show that they actually listen to the people playing this game. because of the constant updating and tweaks in heroes you can get suprised in every game with a reaction like: does that hero do new  now!? anyway the game is really fun to play especially with friends. the game has a good tactical depth to it and people finding new good combos everyday! if you like mobas this is the way to go.",7
"learning russian has never been more soul crushing",4
"well its got a brick wall as a learning curve, and a not very cohesive tutorial; i still cannot figure out how to jump. but once you finally start to get a grasp of the game you realize that the community is horrendous, not only will they yell at you but 20% of the time they wont even understand your language! overall all the non-game mechanics mechanics are stupidly terrible. 10/10",6

"the game resembles a world greater than the first game. besides its great graphic texture, it provides easy gameplay that would acknowledge new players to try the game. it gives a clearer universe that blooms a stunning visuality that makes a normal player make their experiences with the game. the simplicity of the game makes a player focus on the action decided. it doesnt make you stop playing it.",2
"best game ever! ive only been playing for a few months and i love it already. great gameplay, pretty good graphics, and almost all my steam friends i met off this game. really friendly community. and you may think it will be repetitive, but it definitely isnt. every game has different people. different heroes to work with. different heroes to fight against. and there are 108 different heroes to choose from. my favourite is sniper. if you love this game then join my group, ninja skilled ronins, or read my guide (and rate up), sniper (tips and builds).",1
"language professors hate this game! game designers have discovered a revolutionary new way to teach russian. learn how to speak russian in one day with this one weird trick!",4

"dota 2 is a highly strategic-teamwork-heavy game where the objective is to infilitrate the enemy base and destroy their ancient, but there are towers defending the base aswell as enemies. you must level up, gain gold and purchase items to upgrade your character to compete with the 5 players on the other team. there is a very very vaste variety of heroes to choose from, it is recommended that you play them all, to know their weaknesses, strengths and just for fun! its a little confusing at first, but its a blast once you get some friends to play with, a mic, and some practice. i highly recommend downloading this free game if you are looking for a strategic game that requires teamwork. if you have alot of free time, this game is great, because a single game can take 25 min to 1.5 hours!",3

"dota 2, a game where teamwork is key. this game is a moba where you work together with 4 others to destroy the other teams ancient, all while defending your own. when first getting in to this game, do the tutorial, it may be boring (really boring), but it teaches all the baisics. after 200 hours, i can say that this is one of the best games ive played and i hasnt gotten old yet",2
"one of the best mobas out there.played dota and now dota 2 is living up to their name.",2
"this is a finely crafted game of a war between two sides, me vs everyone else. from the start of the game i am introduced to people from all around the world, who think that i am a ing noob and do not know another word of english beyond that. even when playing with friends, they are immersed into the lore, and also call me a ing . the depth and immensity of the roleplaying experience is one for the ages. i would recommend this game to everyone who likes fantasy, roleplaying, action, and being yelled at in russian.",1
