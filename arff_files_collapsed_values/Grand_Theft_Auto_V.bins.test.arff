"one of the best games i have ever played. im in love with the gta. im in love with the gta. no recoil aks i got no recoil aks.",3
"must be nice for those who it runs great for. im stuck in windowed mode and after a hour nothing gives. change resolution, refresh rates, other suggestions online, and nothing. i have a $60 game i cant enjoy because its stuck in a  windowed mode... wish i could get a refund and move on. edit: using nvidia optimization fixed the windowed issue. however there are still sli issues. my fps will not cap or stay steady and my gpus stay around 60% usage. i can turn the graphics all to ultra or all to medium/high, nothing changes.",1
"but who wants to play gta v s/he need 4 gb graphic card for maximum graphic option. i have gtx 760 2 gb and 256 bit. i am playing mid. option which nvidia ex. gives me ideal option. you must play this game because thar are amasing new details and gameplays. enjoy to playing :d",2
"this version blows the console versions out of the water, great visuals and high framerates make this much more enjoyable then the next-gen versions. gta online works for the most part, it worked on day one and the only issue i have had it losing connection sometimes but it is only after being in a session for a few hours. i have had some crashing issues, three times in 35+ hours but this is before any patches have been released, im sure they will fix the crashes now that tons of error reports are being submitted. some people say the game will not start for them at all, i have been able to, luckily, play since the game lauched. a user on reddit posted a fix for my crashing and it was to disable v-sync, that seems to have fixed the problem. (i had horrible screen tearing so i now force with nvidia control panel) gtx 970 + 4670k, i get around 80-100 fps on very-high settings with msaa off.",4
"its gta what else you need to know? yeah its a good port, just buy this game its woth it. bye i am going to the stripclub in 60fps.",2
"pros- no roman bellic. looks great. skills/rpg system. low system requirements so i can run the game on pretty high graphics. edit: my online charaters no longer look like zebras. cons- no roman bellic. poor optimisation at lower graphics qualities. 1/5 of people who bought it cant play the game. edit: takes a ing year to load anything edit: sound sometimes ceases completely. edit: its impossible to stop single player from automatically loading if you leave the title screen for more than ten seconds. i leave the worst to last. no bowling with your fat, annoying eastern-european cousin. or a jamaican bloke. or a woman who inevitably betrays you. 2/10 will give better rating if roman bellic added",3
"the single player works for me but that is not why i purchased this game. i purchased this game with the intention of playing online with my friends. after 2 days of frustration and no help from rockstar, i chose to get a refund through steam. it would never let me play online and would only say cannot initiate communication with rockstar servers. i couldnt find a fix online. maybe they will fix it soon but i expected to be able to play on launch day. not worth my 60$.",2
"rocking my mind. really set the bar at another level.",1
"so i waited hours to download this game when it was done i put in my code and it said it was already in use some one please help me???",1
"this game is top-notch. worthy as a succesor and all the hype about it =ddd",2
"the game looks great, it feels great, the world is huge! but thats about it. there are very few side missions, the main missions are fun, but the map is so huge and there is so little to do that it leaves me empty. i dont recommend this to anyone, just about finished it at 40 hours, but i could have had it done earlier than that. you cant buy houses, there is pretty much no point in buying businesses at all. playing from australia, gta online sucks. i am always matched with people from the us and . so if im trying to shoot someone, or say, just drive around, half the time people are just clipping around me. oh i got this guy! no you dont, because he is a kilometre away now and youve just been shot in the head. sad, i had high hopes and gtaiv was great. heaps of missions and . in this you dont build anything with your characters. they dont actually go anywhere. they dont create empires or even take them down. sad. 5/10.",3
"the good - optimized really good for pc - first person mode works great with pc - finally back on the pc - no roman / bowling the bad - rockstar social club - first time play issue - some bugs after first play with interface",1
"very well optimized, even for old toaster setups. 1680x1050 with a gtx 660ti and a i7 920 cpu at the stock 2.6ghz has no issues maintaining 50-60fps in every area ive been to so far, most settings medium to high. there was some pretty glaring stutter at the auto graphics settings, but reducing soft shadow quality fixed it. population density is still nearly maxed out, and the world feels alive because of it. rockstar was wise to take their time with the pc release, they definitely didnt want a rehash of the gta 4 release fiasco. so if your specs are greater than mine listed above, you should have no issues running the game at high settings. its just as fun as it was the day i brought it home on the 360 - only this time its even better.",5
"you know how it says ive played 2 hours of this game well i havnt. just trying over and over again to launch the game, i bet the game is really good and i hope a update comes out soon that will let me play and if one does i will play for a real 2 hours then give it a true review. but until that time comes it will always be my 60$ copy of game launching simulator 2015. 10/10 would excessively launch again",1
"im not avaible to play this game cuz im not 18 yet...",1
"works better, looks better and plays better than i expected. i was able to transfer my online account from ps3 with no problems. everything is so polished and i didnt spot a single glitch anywhere in the graphics or in the gameplay. the only downside now is the memory-eating graphics options which are suggesting that i should get a job and buy a new gpu. no but really, the freedom over the graphics- and other settings is vast. i love it!",4
"lies. totally false advertising steam. where is the 3rd party drm notice like you do for eidos with uplay. requires social club login. rockstar took it off from gta4 why bring this back. why not have this stated in store valve? for shame!",3
"great sandbox game, works fine on older pcs and laptops, patch fixed all my problems with game",2
"only about 3 hours in but so far game is awesome, i was quite surprised to find the controls were set up very well for driving and shooting so smoothly, graphics are x10 better than the xbox, if you dont have this game you need to!",2
"im sure the game is awesome tho its up to 130gbs now..but due to auto lockin accounts n lack of rockstar support im now sitting here 28 hours later with the worlds stupidest support tech. litterally told me to log in and out of the account im locked out of.......",2
"if i start the launcher on my laptop , it will say : gta v launcher has stopped working. that kind of pissed me off. so if anyone has a solution to this problem, please notify me.",1
"unable to play 0/10 rockstar refused to refund or communicate",1
"this game is so incredibly broken, it blows my mind. the amount of troubleshooting that had to be done, just to run the game and the amount needed to keep the game running, is too much. i have a notebook thats more than capable of running this game and its not my fault that it isnt working. its broken!",3
"this is a great game. beautiful visuals, good story, fun online (when the servers are working). definitley reccomended.",2
"expensive game that wont launch, had it downloaded 4/13 after the release at 7pm est and the issue that many other players are having, has not been patched since rockstars big bonus.",1
"not so great. will not launch on pc unless i delete all the settings and game saves.",1
"gta online, hop in online, see quite a number of low level peps, says hi, dey be rude, trys to kill me with pistol, shoots back, says i rude 2 dem, wtf logic?!?!?!",2
"game is broken at lanch online keeps crashing major lag issues, single player grapthic issues dont buy untill they fix",4
"it took a long time for gta v to make it to pc, and an even longer time to install it on my pc, but a few space-making steam game uninstalls later and i was back in los santos, and it holds up even better than my rose-tinted goggles could ever see. with the sheer amount of settings available, it feels like gta v was here on the platfrom all along, and i cant wait to see the mods. i gave it a 10/10 back on the ps3 nearly two years ago, and its only gotten better since.",2
"ive played this game on the old gen consoles and the new gen consoles, and i have to say, the pc version is much better, both visually and game-play wise. if you have some money left over, want a really good story and addictive online gameplay, then buy this game... like right now, no questions, dont hesitate and you wont regret it.",3
"one of the cleanest pc ports ive seen in a while. gotta love that 60fps.",2
"what the actual  is up with swimming underwater in this game? this is literally the first time i have ever had to look up how to swim, even as a child to teach me to swim my mother just threw me in a pool and i picked it up in about 3 seconds. could they really have just not made wasd work like normal on the x axis then made shift and control move you on the y? the  did they make shift forward for?",3
"whatever patch was released killed my performance.. day 1 was playing with everything cranked to the max.. now whatever they have done to the game has killed my performance.. crazy menu ui stuttering same in game stutters whenever trying to pan my camera around.. not sure what they did but id like them to undo it.. and give me back my performance.. until then i wont touch this game",1
"worst launch ive seen yet, i cant even play the game i ve payed $60 for yet. i have to wait for rockstar to fix it. such a dumb error. i wonder what they are going to do to make up for all of us who cant even get passed the launcher. 1. it took 30 minutes to link social club to steam, because of a login error on their end. 2. finally got past that, now i cant get past the launcher, it crashes every time. 3. now we have to wait for who knows how long for a fix. this sucks rockstar!",1
"uterly amazing well worth the wait. looks awesome and runs great !!!!",3
"this... this is the grand theft auto we have been waiting for my fellow gamers. ever since i bought this on ps3 i have wondered what it would be like in first-person, and this is ecactly what i expected. even though i cant run it at its very best, even with normal settings this game looks and feels amazing. i can only hope that one day i will be able to experience this masterpiece on ultra settings, maybe even 4k. but for now, i will continue to enjoy this work of art any way possible. i highly recommend this game, especially if you have never played gta v prior to this pc version. if youre returning as i am from a previous system, welcome home.",3
"good game laggs ( i have amd raedom 7700 ) low fps low video memory ( no idea how to fix msg me ) i recommend the game, but check first if your computer handle the awesomeness.",5
"i can eat ps and qs in glorious 1080p 60fps now 10/10",2
"great game so far, makes you wish you got it 2 years ago. crashed incredibly fast sports car. stabbed a woman talking on her cell phone. bought some guns. had a shoot out with the cops. things were getting interesting. my cat hit the power button. 10/10 would cat again.",1
"as a massive fan of gta4, i have to rate this game 3/10, theres too much to do, i personally prefer games which have no content in them but still get 10/10 on sites like ign, this game confuses me as i have options on what to do, this is almost as bad as san andreas.",4
"graphics card goes to 75 degrees c if fans arent at 100% so i open up my pc and fire a high powered desk fan through it. bare in mind i live in ing scotland, what is this ?! although that pisses me off, i ing love this game my pc can run it at full settings, i downloaded it in just 2 hours and theres a bunch of low levels you can kill, which is great.",2
"review for gta v online from programmer and game designer perspective. - gta v online feels just as crappy as a singleplayer with simple networking slapped on top of it. nothing technically amazing with a sloppy game design. - loading screen and lobby waiting problems are much worse than in left4dead2. - your are forced to connect to open world and spawn in it every time you want to join a lobby, what takes a lot of time. - there is no open world, but only separate world instances with only up to 32 players. - bad community. everybody loves steamrolling noobs who dont know about enter passive mode button. why it isnt enabled by default for new players ? - learning curve, you will need somebody to hold your hand when you just start playing. - barely achieves high fps and playable game smoothness on notebooks with gt 750m videocard. verdict: kinda nice game to play when youve got nothing else to do. but i do not recommend playing it online alone without friends. if you are buying it just for online features - its not worth the money.",1
"this game has many issues even though it has been out for consel for like 2 years. i keep having issues with it crashing and not getting me into lobbies. honestly if you dont have a good computer just get it for the consel becuase that is probably the way to go",2
"i fell in love with a girl walking down main street. she was wearing a pink top and had just the cutest blond hair. i was really nervous about approaching her; what if she didnt even want to talk to me? when i finally built up the courage, i began walking towards her. well, it was actually more of a brisk walk, a run you might say, which turned out to be a mistake because i ended up knocking her into the street accidently. before i could apologize she got hit by a dump truck. i stole the truck and drove it into the ocean where i drowned, both in the water and in my grief. ill never forget you bernice~ 10/10 would reload save",1
"this is a beautiful pc port. if only they hadnt delayed it so much.",3
"this game is glitchy and slightly slow, it also wont work with amd overdrive which sucks... fix that and this game is perfect! error code err_gfx_d3d_init, none of my other games have this issue.",3
"meth heads banging, dogs having sex, ambulances rushing to a npcs aid only to leave that npc on the road only to be continually run over by othe npcs is only a fraction of what you can find in this game. not only is the main story engaging, but is rife with homages to decades of film and pop culture (including the garbage pop culture, which i love that rockstar does not hold back in making fun of). although i have not touched the online mode or the editor as of yet, i can only imagine at how much more they add to the gta experience. best gta yet, (although i do miss liberty city tunes), and may be the best game of 2015. i know its bene out of consoles for a couple yrs now, but as far as im concerned pc trumps all.",3
"i dont do a lot of review but to be honest, buy this game, i bought it on every consoles (xbox 360, one) and i bought it on pc, killed a cat, dont feel bad at all 10/10",2
"praise gaben it is here 2 years of waiting and it was worth it 10/10 pc master race confirmed",3
"my thanks to all the xbox360/ps3 alpha and xboxone/ps4 beta testers for the final ultimate pc version after 2 years ! works fine for me and hello mods...",2
"loading, loading, loading, loading.. for hours and hours.. not good enough..!",1
"if you dont have this game yet, i feel bad for you. its so much fun, i cant even put it into words. i mean, sure, it does crash every once in a while, but thatll hopefully be patched soon. then again, it is really rare and its barely a problem. again, if you dont have this game yet, you are missing out on a lot. buy this game.",3
"i started the game just fine but my friend had a problem about social club telling that it is bugging and that it is loading for 14 hours and it is not installed yet so rockstar is a b!tch releasing the game with a lot of bugs that half of the people cant play the game",1
"smooth play on a dual core successful! i didnt think shed work but she pulled through very well and i am more than satisfied until my quad build shows up. phenom ii x2 550 ftw! 10/10 would destroy simeons cars again.",3
"my first playing gta v on the first task. i accidentally killed guard -> mission failed i tried killing/running enemies -> dead driving by car -> got stuck racing the car -> lost on the last place running againts girl -> lost swiming -> drowned flying by plane -> damaged yoging -> hurting helicopter landing on the ground -> damaged oh man, i love this game.",2
"after 2 years of porting to pc, hopefuly its worth the wait.",1
"i had it for the xbox and it was like jesus and the pc is zeus",2
"the game runs smoothly and so well optimized, i have an average rig but i can play it on very high setting with 50+fps. r* done well to deliver best experience to gamers. imagine san andreas with fluid environment, interesting characters, amazing details and outrageous gameplay. what else matters? its gta v !! by the way, i sacrificed my masters degree for this game...10/10",5
"pros: excellent port. very well optimized. im probably going to enjoy playing it. cons: no hidden e3 settings. these should be standard after watch dogs popularized it. 9/10 taking a point away due to the lack of hidden e3 settings and the rage that would have followed which, could have led to hours of entertainment.",2
"woke up in the morning, opened gta thought i walked outside 10/10 - my social life is dead",4
"im having an low end rig and the game runs really smooth. indeed, i use the lowest settings and a quite low resolution, but i dont mind. the pc version is the best version indeed!",5
"servers are still horrendous. every gets kicked off of servers constantly, in the middle of jobs or just cruising. loading screens take forever all the time. i have 300/300 internet and these issues happen to many other people as well. until they fix their servers i would not recommend wasting your money on this game.",2
"when i load the game, it all loads fine until the launch pannel comes up. right before the game opens the launcher crashes. the game is unplayable",1
"i have never had a more pleasent gaming experiance ever then playing gta v. waited for the pc version to experiance the game and it was well worth it. rockstar really took the time to refine this game for the pc and it really paid off. flawless day one release!",5
"this comes with a whole package full of tv thats still better to watch and cheaper than your monthly cable/satellite bill. oh and game runs great!",2
"i couldnt enjoy this game on a console, but maybe its even better because i was familiarized for the first time with gta v on pc. the game is well optimized and polished, didnt notice many bugs yet, the graphics are stunning, even at medium settings. the gameplay is way more developed in comparison to gta iv and the story is promising to be very interesting. i dont regret any cent i spent for this game. totally worth it.",2
"works great and have very good graphics, i really enjoy this game",4
"went to a strip club, got kicked out. played with the dog instead. as the great warrior poet ice cube once said...if the day does not require an ak, it is good.",2
"flipped my truck down a hill after running down a deer then got a wanted level. 11/10 would roadkill again",2
"i didnt get killed the first time i met a player online. 10/10 pc has best community",4
"how do you screw up a game launcher!!!! i cant play cause i cant launch the game, this stuppid appcrash bs pops up and there is not fixing it, trsut me. i tried everything. i want to play with my freinds, laugh have fun, and be merry again. !!!!!!!!!!!!fix the launchyer god damn it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"lives up to the hype, and runs on a system under the minimum specs. solid 30fps on an i3 4130 dual core, 8 gigs of ram, and my dated gforce gtx 550 ti (on low/normal settings).",3
"first thing to do in gta v (pc): grab a prostitue. pay her and get rekt. when she leaves run her over. get moneyz $$$ back. 10/10 would get free prostitution again.",2
"best in series for sure. lots to explore, lots to do. possibilities in this game never ends but im having a problem that without disabling the graphic card, i cant run the game. after having run the game, i enable the graphic card then carry on. this has to be fixed as soon as possible.",2
"awesome game, way better than the console versions.",2
"i dont know what to say, because this is exactly what i wanted. ive happily clocked over 300hrs of gta v on console, and im happy to clock at least double that time on pc. everything about the pc version of gta v is a straight upgrade from any of the console versions. if you like grand theft auto games, this is a must have. edit: good god why did rockstar decide to release this game in the midst of final exams?",2
"i am not happy with the bug .. still can not solve it ... like purchasing a crashing game",2
"launcher ridiculo! jogo bugado! sistema de inicializao nao aceita as placas sli, nem nada! uma @$@$#@... rockstar games deletando os tpicos do forum de suporte, steam nao da um parecer!!! no fazem fix para solucionar! uma %$%#%#",1
"not had one issue with this game and the max settings are not too demanding! you know what gta is you dont need to be told! yes its worth getting on pc!",3
"first of all , this game is absolutley amazing . but, there are a few bugs ive found already (i have no clue if its only for me or for everyone) 1. no silencers show when the guns are used in a vehicle and neither is the sound effect correct (both in single player and in multiplayer) 2. in single player , once i boot the game up as michael and i spawn in a restaurant with his wife , the table they sit at seems to spawn twice , one being static and the other dynamic , and the tables start flipping out and flying all around the place - i actually got killed by this bug once ,being clobbered with one of those tables. i also have note about the aircraft controls , numpad 5 being the  pull nose up button got me killed a couple of times , ramming into buildings mashing the numpad 2 key thinking it should lift me up , i suggest it should be switched to numpad 2 like most games have ( yes i changed it in the key bindings menu , still ) .",3
"the best purchase of a game in my 15 year gaming history! nothing stands close to how well this game plays and to how much fun it is! well done rockstar!",4
"ing love this game :d very well optimised the only bad thing was that r* really took the  taking nearly 2 years to come on to pc! i mean come on i think r* made alot of money from it though most people have baught this game twice or three times now at 35+ but all in all very very amazing game highly recomend it to anyone the game runs at 60fps all the time at medium settings (1080p) on a bad pc my pc specs: i5 3330 nvidia gtx 640m 512mb vram (i overclock this :p by 30 mhz) 8gb ddr3 ram",2
"amazing game you can do evrythin,but loads are to long for everyone",2
"mmm hoew do you choose a server with more people in it",1
"great game. thats what i would be saying if i could actually log into the gta 5 online servers, but i cant, but other than that the game is great, i just want to actually play with my friends and other people online.",2
"as of now, have fun playing this on a laptop. some people crash on the social club screen when they launch the game. if youre lucky to get past that, your dedicated graphics card wont start the game up, but your intel graphics will. and that runs at less than 20 fps (surprisingly)",1
"this game is pretty good its beautiful and the graphics but there was a error that i came across gta 5 luancher has stopped working i havent fixed it",3
"a game i was hyped for, for a very long time! it came out well but im dissapointed after transfering my gta online character from xbox 360 to pc his appearence and traits were completely reset, also not to mention the insanely long amount of time it took to unpacked the game files! i will think about changing my review once my gta online character is fixed. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- update 4/17/2015 rockstar has never contacted me back.... my entitiy xf which i paid real life money for is gone online is horrible i regret ever buying this game on the xbox and pc. this was right before i was going to change my dislike to a recommended game... an hour later 4 more cars dissapeared from my garage",2
"the first thing i thought when i first spawned into the virtual city of los santos? well, i didnt really think anything! this game is so advanced, so detailed, and just so fun that it can last your for months, maybe even years! its basically a life simulator. want to arm wrestle? play tennis? race? rob a store? go mountain biking? i think you get the point. there are so many things about this game- it deserves to be the third most sold game in history! what are you waiting for? get it!",3
"garbage ing game. ive never seen a more piece  game in my life. i would rather drag my balls through 10 miles of glass and sand than play this garbage  piece of .",3
"once this game works out its issues with the launcher and fixes performance issues it will be an absolute masterpiece.",4
"rockstar didnt  up multiplayer this time, ofcourse im recomending it",4
"ignore the people who have weird names or bad pcs, this is good.",2
"why are you reading revieuws. scroll back up and click add to cart.",3
"i love the game. it works not as good as i anticipated but it still runs decently. key word, decently. on occasion i get the kick-in-the-balls fps drop while driving, incredible delayed input. im talking about it takes 7 seconds for a button press to register. but fair n all its a good port. im surprised a gtx260m can put up with the damn thing.",1
"do you recommend this game? i must say yes for the great game.",5
"fps rate is really well, even much more smooth than old gta4. rockstar did a good job !",4
"very good game online works great the grafics are real good iam running 4k noprobs at all.",1
"hands down this is one of the best games ever! the graphics are just stunning. i dont even have everything maxed and i love it still. make sure you update your graphics card else you could run into a few compatibility issues. definitely worth every penny and the wait. buy it now.",2
"cant even play the ing game. 10/10 - ign but srs i keep getting an error called err_gen_input_2",3
"the game is working perfect now ever science the patch. great game hold on i got to go do some hiest......",3
"no launch issues, great work with my not so good videocard, no freezes, excellent start, excellent missions, it was worth to wait, simpliest the main ing event of this spring. thank you rockstar!",3
"very much recommended if you want a non-stop fun time for pc. after a year and a half of console privledge, it has come to the pc! if you dont know about this game by now, youve probably been living under a rock.",4
"11/10 still great game after 100 hours ps3. and i survived the waiting time ^^ everyone knows this game is great, i mustnt tell you why! :d",2
"some bugs on heist, but gameplay is smooth. sexiest graphics ever.",2
"getting hit by a traffic light 10/10 would do a backflip again",3
"amazing. simply amazing. best game of the new millenium would be a good award for this.",1
"its grand theft auto 5, only with more features, better looking graphics and awesome optimization. sort of like the opposite of gta ivs port, you wont have much problem running this game and at a pretty solid 60fps too (or more if possible). the story is still one of the best ones written for a video game in my opinion and the world is so alive that it feels real (especially when playing in first person mode). this is being called the definitive version of gta v for a reason. its worth throwing down the full price even right now, even if you bought the game once or even twice, its just that good.",1
"ran into a dude on foot, he bumped into a cat that was walking buy. he got pissed at the cat and curb stomped it repeatedly while talking . 10/10",4
"this game does not work and alot of my friends are getting made and having the same porblom",1
"so i bought it from steam. game wouldnt even launch. 0/10",2
"amd fx-8320 ocd 4.1ghz. evga gtx 770 sc ocd 2gb. 8gb gskill sniper ram. everything is maxed out except advanced graphics and msaa off runs 60+fps most of the timed and looks so dam good ty rockstar",2
"pros: 1st person view, 4k los santos, trevor cons: i have to go to work tomorrow",2
"tried all fixes; the game does not start. hardware is over the recommended specifications. the most expensive desktop icon ive ever bought, but at least it comes with a free 61gb of useless data, just in case youre not enticed by the desktop icon alone. edit: completely uninstalling firewall fixed the issue. changed the recommendation to yes, even though this fix shouldnt be necessary to play the game. game itself is 10/10",4
"gta v is possibly my favourite ever game to be on pc. not only is it a massive improvment to the console versions, its also a great port unlike gta iv (errrghcghcg) recommended game to anyone who enjoys open world :)",2
"if youre reading this youre already going to buy the game, so just do it :d",2
"a day in the life of gta:online: 1. rob convenience store. 2. clerk pulls a gun and gets shot for his trouble. 3. lspd goes full dorner on me and i have to flee. 4. escape via submarine with the $1500 i got from the heist. 5. contemplate the meaning of it all while on the bottom of the sea. solid port and it runs amazingly well. remapping controls can be a bit daunting at first, but you only need to do it once. this is, without a doubt, the definitive version.",2
"awesome, awesome game. paid full price and got a full experience. 10/10, undoubtedly.",3
"oh baby that is one optimized port. also the game is really good. mods.",2
"gta v finally arrives on pc and im happy to say that rockstar has done an amazing job with the port. the game runs and looks great and is the definitive version. also included in the pc version is the video editor which i can already foresee taking hours and hours of my time.",3
"i cant play gta ol... it is always loading ol mode, why?",3
"i recomend only for the first person pov. players need to stop thinking every multiplayer game has to be like dayz, which includes killing people cause you have the ability to. higher level and more experienced players get better stuff and use that against newer players. not fun.",1
"got so many problems (infinite loading/ no response when clicking the launcher button) after hours of downloading and i couldnt even start the game now. the game has been delayed for so long and rockstar cant even fix these small issues. good job rockstar.",1
"bought the game, downloaded the game, launched the installer, waited for 30 minutes including watching the resource monitor, nothing happened, 59,99 eur for 3 hrs of my time to waste. you decide if your time is worth the money or not, this is not an actual game - only a corrupt installer.",2
"fantastic game, i played it for 6 hours and decided to get the refund for it. the reason? i already owned the ps3 version and decided that $60 wasnt worth the small amount of upgrades in this version, plus my computer cant run it with max graphics. when in about 4 years when it goes on sale for like $10 and i have a better pc, i will defintley buy this again. so if youre someone who already has this on ps3/xbox 360/ps4/xbox one then i recommend waiting for a much lower price, but if youve never experiences gta v before, then buy this, now, dont even wait for a sale, just spend that 60 dollars.",1

"holy balls, is this port good. essentially a mirror of the console versions, but with aa. brilliant gameplay, awesome graphics, wonderful and lovable characters, and a bit more realism. now, instead of in gta iv where your car could be a flaming husk and work just fine, vehicular damage actually effects performance. the only downside to the increased traffic and pedestrian activity is the downed car damage. maybe ramming an armored truck from the back at full speed in a sports car should do a bit more than a dent on the front. otherwise, i have no qualms. tl;dr: awesome. great succession to gta iv with a better story and likeable characters. graphics and gameplay are amazing and the cars actually work. 10/10 - ign",2

"right so this wont be a review of the content of the game but whether or not to buy it in its current state since we all know the game  rainbows anyway. i am not reccomending this game on the pc for the sole purpose of it having optimization issues i call it the stutter essentially whenever i run the game it could run fine for 30-mins or 1 minutes or for an hour its completly random but then the game has these stuttering fits almost like trying to start up a brocken down car and it works for 10 minutes at a time. just for anybody who is looking at this and about to type well maybe its your computer specs these are my specs- gtx660ti 8gb ram i5-2310 and 5981mb left for page file use. my setup is almost identical to that of the reccomended specs on the front page of the game if that doesnt give you warning whistles you might want to consolt your local cautious pharmasist. the stutter problem gets worse the more you play i have also searched it up online and it seems alot of players are having the same issue dont buy this game right now use your head like i didnt and wait until the game is more polished i say 5 or six patches have a good day everyone.",3

"notebook users take note! gta v does not support enduro(amd) or optimus(nvidia). this means that you wont be able to play the game with your dedicated gpus, only your integrated intel gpu will work. if you try to launch the game with your amd or nvidia gpu ill crash right away. looks like r* never heard of gaming notebooks before, maybe they shouldve delayed it a third time... !!!update for nvidia users!!! seems like the issue has been fixed for nvidia users. amd users are currently still unable to run it on their dedicated amd gpu though.",1

"this game is in full color. im not even kidding, not just the base colors but every combination of color you would expect. were talking everything from dark slate gray to hot pink folks. as if color wasnt enough, these geniuses found a way to include sound, like a lot of sounds. ever wanted to hear a footstep? the sound of glass bottle nudged by someone walking by? now you can hear it all! color and sound, this would be enough to make any game a winner but they didnt stop there. this game uses the alphabet and numbers. thats right, every letter your used to seeing in upper and lower case, numbers, and even punctuation. the amount of type in this game is stunning and youll spend all day reading to your hearts content. i think its pretty clear that we have the building blocks for an amazing game here so expect to be blown away by the experience.",2
"from what i experienced in the short time i was actually able to get this game to run(probably around a half hour total), i would rate this game 9/10. unfortunately this launch was a huge disappointment as 95% of the time the game refuses to even run, and the few times it did, crashes resulted randomly or even as a result of clicking on a different window and then clicking back on the game screen. i have opened a ticket with rockstar support and tried all of the fixes they and other people have recommended but nothing has worked. funny how they delayed the release again and again to ensure that the game is as polished as possible, and to make certain that both heists and the gta online experience are ready to roll out on day one for pc. well guess what rockstar? the game doesnt even run for a lot of us. im sure eventually this problem will be fixed on your end and then ill be able to forgive you but until then, i just want to warn anyone whos thinking about spending their hard earned money on this game that there is a significant chance the game wont even run, and so i would recommend waiting until rockstar has fixed this issue.",1
"if your like me and dont have much time to play games anymore. so when you do get chance to play you want to progress then this game is definitely not for you. i log on trying to get into online heists and for 40 minutes it keeps switching from loading screen to loading screen, because it seems to invite you to heists that are full so you get more loadiing screens. 40 minutes of loading screens has definitely put me off this game. in my opinion this is worst online game ive ever played. dont get me wrong its got brill storyline and amazing graphics but for online play its horrible. wasnt worth the wait at all. do not buy this game unless you are a kid that has a lot of time on their hands to wait around for these loading screens that you get too much of on this game.",1
"every time i opt out of the game to my other screen i cannot go back to gta, all i can hear is the sound but cannot re-open the window, have to restart the game. frequent crashes during heists and while online. game does not save even checking and double checking that the game says it saved before exiting. rock star needs to fix their peice of  game before releasing.",1
"oh boy , this game is good but couldnt enjoy it at first since i had the launcher crash issue but now that i fixed even if it took away all my hype before the launch still enjoying it . for those of you how might have the launcher crash problem i followed this simple steps ; 1. open : device manager ( search it in the start search toolbar ) 2. go to the displey adapters 3. disable you nvidia card ( disable dont unninstall tho ) 4. open gta v while you did the previous stept 5. when social club pop up just re-enable yout nvidia crad worked great for me ,was a bit sceptic tho at the begining but worth trying with all the issues it has some minor bugs ,launcher crashand social club issues this game is still solid 9.5/10",2
"best thing that ever happened to pc (besides the gtx titan x) :)",3
"we had to wait a long time to get the pc version, and so far it has worth it, the quality is amazing, im baffled that it runs so smoothly and well, the dev team really did a good job on the performance of the game. regarding gameplay the game is great, i love everything ive tried so far, shooting, driving, swimming (the undersea looks amazing), walking around, robbing and some more, i have yet to try flying and see what other surprises the game has, but even looking at the websites on the phone show the dedication put on this game. the story so far has got me hooked, the characters are great, each one with his unique personality and interesting relatives, theres little i can say because im barely starting the game (i didnt want to spoil myself all this years).",3
"one does not know true pain until theyve downloaded gta v at 600kb/s. 10/10 would download ag... nvm i wouldnt",4
"as of now rockstar has kept there promise of great version for pc and even though its insallation process takes a while, its all worth it once you get into this game.. people cant get mad over a install process its just going to take longer as we get into the future (for any game)..",2
"piece of crap. does not download properly, does not sign into social club at all. i have wasted two complete nights trying to get it work and when it finally did, the game crashed. thanks for the great support and the ripoff. actually sorry, i am getting my refund right now",1
"ive played the console versions of this game and it is fair to say that this is worth the wait. gameplay was great in both 3rd and 1st person mode (dont recommend first person if you have motion sickness), the cars didnt feel slippery, the campaign feels like sort of episodic (if i spelt that right) and the graphics were impressive. especially on the last gen versions of the game. 10/10 ps. be prepared to run into high level pr*cks going on a rampage in their tank on the online portion of the game",1
"excellence in one 60 gig package. runs at way more than 60fps, i know this because im having screen tearing issues. so to fix that, i turned on vsync. its gpu v-ram hungry so be sure to have a 4gb gpu if you want to run on max settings. i run high-very high mainly and my cpu is the amd fx-8350. my gpu is geforce gtx 760 2gb. it only eats up 1500megs of my v-ram with my settings. buy the hell out of this game! it really is excellent!",2

"story isnt great, neither the characters. the supposed irony and social comentary isnt there, dont believe people who says that. its a silly story, with lame supporting cast and bland main cast - excluding trevor, he grows on you. so far, the worst gta story and characters wise. but the best gta technically. its a beautiful game in every aspect and an exemplary port. rockstar did its homework this time: the game is an extraordinary port, really well optimized and ridiculously pretty graphics. even the physics improved in the porting process. gta v on pc is the ultimate experience for this game, believe me. san andreas state is the strongest character youll ever need for this game, followed by the beautifully accomplished vehicles of all sorts and amazing weather effects. oh, and theres the somewhat smooth online experience. if your pc falls between the minimum and recommended specs, just buy it. you wont regret.",3

"*pro tip, ignore the negative reviews that have 20+ hours of gameplay but their review states they are locked out of the game... by far the best game in the series. first person view mode is a great addition to an already fantastic game, crisp graphics and a video editor are just icing on the cake. story is good and improved from previous versions by having 3 main characters, all of which are introduced to eachother through some pretty funny circumstances. the multiplayer is top notch and considering it was a free update (from 360/ps3) its amazing rockstar has delivered as much as they did. heists improve the mp even further by giving you a team and multiple objectives to work towards a high payout. none of the previous gtaiv issues on pc are present and it really seems rockstar learned some valuable lessons from their previous release. i cant recommend this game enough.",2

"while i am still annoyed with rockstar and their numerous delays, this really is a fantastic game and worth the purchase. great dialog, great missions, the city is fantastic and the amount of stuff you can do is great and i look forward to trying online. my only real complaint is first person does not seem worth it. the guns do not work with iron sights and i do not see a distinct advantage to playing fp over 3rd person for much of anything except if you want more realistic pov for driving.",4

"game looks great and runs great. i dont know who the main character is...or if there even is one. i started off as some white guy....somewhere along the lines i became black. i fully suspect and look forward to becoming asian but hope driving performance wont degrade. maybe i will even swap gender. gameplay is fun so far. best gta i have played. have not tried online. so far i have learned to steal cars using a tow truck. run over aliens. understand car flight physixs. and am trying to learn my way around the massive map. optimization is amazing. i have 3 1080p monitors and get 60fps on high settings. i was not expecting this at all. single gtx 780.",1

"thanks rockstar, i paid 40 for a game that wont even give me an error message. this is the kind release from ea.",2
"in the past ive had my share of day one problems. but this time everything went butter smooth. so not everyone is having problems :-) first few missions have been a blast (just phoned the ceo of lifeinvader :). the mission feel is close to gta iv, but everything upgraded. not only the graphics, but also the way the missions can be played / story-line, imho. so if youre not running into installation problems and you liked gta iv, its totally worth it. the extra time they took to optimize the game, was worth it in my case.",1
"solid port! some issues here and there but pretty good.",4
"about freaking time! :d (i already finished the game... twice. but i am still so hyped to play it on pc!) ps. so far the game plays great! [edit: after playing it for some time the game suddenly starts stuttering, when that happens the game just becomes unplayable and you have to quit the game and re-launch it. as far as i know there isnt a fix yet.] [second edit: updating to the newest drivers fixed the stuttering for me, game is running smooth now.]",3
"very impressive port for pc, i would highly recommend it. if you dont have any friends who have it or will be getting it then i do not recommend it. i have had it on xbox 360 and the graphics and expierence is higher in an extreme. i suggest you use a controller, but it is not very nessecary.(just depends on prefernce.) plus mods will be coming out soon im sure, so that will be fun. before you start or buy this game i highly suggest updating your graphics to the newest version. i do not know what it is currently is for nvidia but for amd it is 15.4 beta on the amd website.",2

"first of all i would like to say thank you to console gamers for the beta and alpha testing the one title that always stands up to the hype. no disappointments except for, the obvious situation why it came 2 years late and tremendous loading times in online when lets say i join a job which is full or host quits or whatever happens and instead of only starting to load when criterias are met i wait around 30s for loading and then get an error msg and get dropped back to(hopefully) where i was",3
"good : - enyojment - almost everything in this game is awesome bad : - aiming is a joke ( even if i have 155 lvl and maximum stats its not that easy to aim) - skin bug in multiplayer",4
"this game had a few release day hiccups, but no where near as many as some games. the hiccups included some unpacking errors and some other bugs involving rockstars social club, however these are easily fixed or you just have to wait a ad longer to play the game. my initial impressions were; the graphics are amazing, lots of customizable options (key bindings, graphical settings ect), the game runs at a butery smooth 60 fps (even on a pentum cpu and a gtx 760 ftw) at mostly high - maximum settings. however i have experienced a few bugs, which prevented my car from moving, however this is the only bug i have encountered. pros; 1) graphics 2)runs on not to good hardware very well 3)60 fps 4)key bindings and lots of customization 5)high resolution and multi monitor support (4k - 3 monitors) cons; 1)release day hiccups (not a big deal) 2)a few bugs (not many though) so all in all this game is brilliant on the pc, i love it more than ever now and it looks amazing.",1

"well. i might would reccomend it... if i could open it. i have double-no triple checked for my windows account not being affected by the glitch making sure with extra windows-profiles. when i try to enter it simply doesnt open. it says im playing for like 10 seconds then stops. i have all drivers, requirements, etc. i wouldnt reccomend it until a later developement stage.",1
"surprisngly this game handles pretty well, even if you run it on low without updating your drivers. this game is far from a bad port, big improvement form gta iv.",3
"great port, i get 45-60 fps with a r9 280 and fx 6350, and im pretty sure everybody and their mother knows how good the gameplay is so no real need to go in depth on that, however im not feeling the censorship in online, saying words like uhh... someone that has a parrot on his neck and says arr will get you bannned unfortunately, and even with its m-rating it still feels the need to censor curse words for some reason.",3

"i have bought this game 3 times already. (the fact that i bought it 3 times must mean something) i currently own grand theft auto v for the xbox 360, xbox one, and pc. this game is one of the best games i have ever played. it runs amazing my rig. i highly recommend this game. pros:",1

"really fun game, but with my spec, core i5, geforce gt 750m and 8gb ram you might not enjoy the game so well. still, better than others tho",2
"this game is really good. first off the game is a little pricy but worth it in the end. runs great at max settings, yes it lags sometimes but other then that props to rockstar games and t2.",3
"after watching the positive pc port report video totalbiscuit made i figured gta v would be a great pick up, but unfortunately i ran into so many issues rightaway that i ended up requesting a refund which was still an option due to the other problems the game had. issues i had: - jerky/laggy mouse movement in the menu. changing vsync or mouse input didnt help. - settings didnt save after quitting the game and restarting - display calibration screen on every start - benchmark crashed to desktop after a 3 minute black screen - fps tied to sensitivity (not this crap again, sigh) i run a i7-4790k, 16 gb, r9 290x machine and from what i could see from my short experience, the actual framerate ingame is fine so performance seems ok otherwise. this is the first refund ive ever requested and im glad it was still an option. fully priced games, in this case even more, should always have an option for refunds to avoid these sorts of things. one thing steam could learn from origin. i hope they patch the game and fix all these issues because i am certain the underlying game is brilliant, but i just cant support it while theres so many problems before even getting to the actual playing part.",1
"i absolutely loved the game on gaystation 3, the only reason why i bought a gaystation was to play gta v and it was totally worth it (selling it now btw) and now i finally have this masterpiece on my 600 potato. it runs smooth at 30 fps at high and you dont need a 4000 pc to run this like most console peasants like to exeggrate their stuff. anyways, 60 is quit high for a game (imo) so if you can wait to buy this, wait for a sale or something. you really want to play this masterpiece to bad? go ahead and throw 60 at gaben fat  (jk, i love you <3). my overal rating would be 8.5/10 it just lacks some life, i mean, the city is almost empty and there barely isnt any traffic/pedestrians. rockstar should take an example from watch_dogs, the city if full of life!",3
"i just played for a bit, already played on xbox 360, but computer controls are wy better and easier, you get a whole new feel to the game.",2
"i almost played through the first mission, almost. the game itself is great, ive played it on console and knew i wanted it on pc when it came out. the second i get into a car my game lags until it freezes my computer. as soon as i try to shoot a gun? frozen computer. the game is literally unplayable, the almost 4 hours i have on record is 90% a frozen screen, the other 10% was updates. thanks rockstar, where do i get my $60?",1
"hands down without a doubt the best game released for a long time pc. the game is optimized extremely well and it is extremely fun. if you can run this game, its definitely worth the money.",3
"this game is actually less violent and has less bad drivers than los angeles. perfect casual fun. 10/10 works great for me : i7 3.8 boost, gtx 980m 8gb vram, 256 ssd, 16gb ram...laptop",2

"after playing for months on both playstation consoles i decided to check out the pc version. all versions console and pc are amazing but pc is a step ahead of everything else. after playing for about 15 minutes i can honestly say i will not play this on my ps4 anymore(not to take anything away from that version). the graphics, the controls, the load times, and the fps are all top notch. i transfered over my main character so i was the only level 90 in a lobby full of 3-5 level players haha. if you have a console version i highly recommend getting this version and transferring over your character.",1
"took me four days to get it working, but when i did, i was and wasnt disappointed. i was disappointed by the graphics and shadowing. the shadows for me at least, were pixelated and horrendous. the shadows went through typical textures and just was a massive turn-off. since there are so many shadows, its really hard to ignore them. they were so gross, i just had to stop playing. hoping that when i play it next, the game fixes itself. i know for sure my computer should be able to play it with ease. as it can play each other aaa game out there without breaking a sweat. but for some reason, gta v is just like lol,  you, suck my , i aint workin for you. the graphics, for me at least, were exactly like ps3/ps4, with no noticable difference. as the gta series is my favorite game series alive, i am going to recommend this. but, a lot of people have been having problems. so be wary when buying this game. you could  your pants on how amazing it is, or you could thrash your keyboard on how big of a waste of money it was.",1
"wont load on to my pc. seems to be lots of technical issues with it at the moment",1

"i played the game for a few hours now and all i can say is that i didnt have any problems yet. my character transfer worked, i didnt had any problems starting or playing the game, i can join gta online without any problems and my game didnt crash a singel time yet. also the game looks pretty nice and i dont have any lag while playing it. i only had these black stripes in gta online but i just had to update my video card drivers to fix it. im sorry for everyone who has problems with gta 5 but everything looks nice to me and i dont have any weak points currently ^^",2

"nowhere near as good as gta iv but still a great game regardless. longer review to come.",3
"this version of the game was worth the wait. all around amazing open world action with tons of content to enjoy, and incredibly well optimized. it scales nicely on high end hardware and uses sli quite well too.",4
"im not recommending this game at the moment. the game is just full of bugs and its optimized poorly. fps bounces between 25-65. so i wont recommend this. i hope that rockstar fixes this game because i like it but too many bugs.",1
"i went outside after playing gta v. the graphics were terrible.",3
"this is a huge upgrade from the console version. the graphics are sharper and the 60 fps makes it so much smoother to play.",1
"had to decrypt it for 2 hours.... 11/10 would decrypt again.",2
"amazing, they finally got gta right ... the high res textures and smooth gameplay is pretty impressive. as some gamers as mentioning, every now and then a frame stutter will happen for about 1 second when im driving really fast (not sure if thats a hd seek issue or something that just needs to be patched). my rating is 98/100 !!",4

"could play at launch, only had one unexplained crash. story mode is alright, multiplayer needs a bit of stability improvement, but graphics and average fps are top-notch. this is how pc games should be released instead of bullspit deadlines and moronic over-hype. just wish it would have come out sooner than waiting so long for two generations of consoles to beta-test.",4
"pros: great port from console, whats not to like? cons; loading takes ages, and it crashes 90% of the time. i know rockstar will get this figured out, but its still mildly annoying since i bought this game in january.",1

"after the complete mess up that was the launch day, i let 3 - 4 days pass hoping something would be done, and then it still gives me the code 2 error, so i reinstall, and it gets to the first screen that the game shows when starting up and then crashes, even in safe mode, and online mode, i had updated all drivers rebooted my pc, restarted steam several times, to no avail. definately the last time i pre order a game!",1
"ended the single player story without any crash. extremely smooth performance and great optimization. i average around 80+ fps at 1080p with everything on ultra (gtx 970 sli). looks great too. 10/10. no complaints here",5

"this game looks so much better on the pc then on the xbox 360 i played on while i was waiting for pc release. its all the little things that make this game amazing and the time and effort they spent on the story making the characters so great together and online isnt bad either. in my opinion its one of the best games ever made. i just wish there were more games like this one",3
"never had so much fun playing a male rottweiler banging another male dog (in one of franklins missions). onlines working well with all rookies laying around. graphics very optimised. still have stutter problems now and then. other than that......100/10 would always play this superior version.",3

"2 hour long, unskippable multiplayer tutorial and impossible flying controls made a really bad first impression. also, controller users have a horribly unfair advantage against keyboard users when it comes to racing. waited 5 months longer than i wanted to to get disapointment. *edit: looks like the fanboys are disliking. oh well, i have a right to an opinion",1

"i havent got into grand theft auto since san andreas. this one is far superior to all the others, more activities, a huge map and vast story. the characters are very interesting as well as humorous. my only complaint about the game was/is getting used to the aiming.",3
"it was a tad buggy at release, but theyve since patched that. connection issues? a vpn can clear those right up. gta5 is one of my top games of all time, but running this on pc full 1080p 60+ fps makes it a truly remarkable experience worth the wait (and loading times). i couldnt recommend this game more for someone who enjoys racers, shooters, massive online rpgs, or any combination. a++ rockstar youve done it again.",3
"unplayable. crashes with bluescreen all the time. 60 on .",1
"becomes a roadkill by insane civilians with panic issues... 10/10 would flip & fly in 1st person again. on serious note i would recommend this game to any gta fan, even on my  as pc i can play it on around 30 fps (isnt much but i can play it!), there are some issues with session disconnect etc but i assume its only during the first few days of launch of servers being overloaded and will be fixed soon as we go on, otherwise i havent encountered any issues yet & would defo recommend it as its nicely optimized for pc.",5
"this game is just perfect. the graphics are amazing, and with astounding performance. my pc shouldnt be able to run max settings under and circumstances yet somehow i can and keep a very stable 60+ framerate. this game is detailed beyond belief, the developers put in every single detail, no matter how small they are and it adds the nicest touch to the game, making it that much better. the first person mode was done brilliantly. they went to the largest extent possible, adding in great animations and a variety of options. the options for first person go beyond the extent of some other fps games, adding in things like head bob control, and an fov slider, which many of the modern military shooters today simply dont have. get this game, its worth well above $60. the build quality on everything in this game is just amazing. the developers obviously put a lot of hard work into the game, and you should support them.",2

"so i installed the game and like i have been waiting since release to play this on the pc. my nephew who is like 6 years old have this on his xbox 360. guess where was the first thing he took me to on this version? got my  a lapdance with full on naked . wow my nephew is something else. 10/10 will do a much more realistic and thorough review.",1
"can run flawlessly freeroaming at 60 fps, but whenever i try to aim a gun while driving a car during a mission the game crashes. i even tried running safe mode (lowest possible graphics @30 fps) in hopes that something would change, but alas, the problem remained. i am currently stuck on a mission where you ambush an armored car due to the games repeated crashing, to make matters worse. i can complete all of the gameplay without issue, but as the game switches from franklin in the getaway vehicle to micheal the game crashes. i know that this could easily be one of my favorite games of all time, but as it stands, this game is just about unplayable for me and the cause seems to be related to driving during missions. have no idea why.",1

"im very pleased with the port of this game, it runs well even on my -tier cpu. (fx-4100) the textures look great compared to the previous version i played on the last-generation consoles, even on the normal setting. the game has a very useful video memory gauge like the other rockstar ports which makes tweaking the options a cinch. i had no trouble transferring over my gta online character from the ps3 version, and the online so far hasnt given me any trouble in terms of connectivity. i did have some trouble with what seemed like mouse acceleration, and i was unable to find an option to disable it. but after changing from raw input to directinput it seems to be much better. all in all, id say it was worth the wait.",3
"i was thinking that you will need to have a better pc , but when i bought it my mind changed. the game requires not too much and not too a lot of your memory and speed etc etc. buy the game you will be very happy , many heists , interseting things.",1

"amazing improvement to the already great gta 5 for consoles. definitley worth picking up, although i am currently having some stuttering issues which i hope are fixed in a patch. other than that bug and a few other performance issues i recommend everyone reading this to buy the game.",3
"amazing graphics, good gameplay, works better with a controller",1
"this game is obviously fun and funny, it gives us what gta iv didnt and then some. now even though i recommand this game there are problems with it, one in particular which needs to be fixed asap. laptops with two graphics cards (usually an intel one and a deticated one from amd or nvidia) cannot currently run this game without a whackey workaround which doesnt always work. this needs to be something they fix in a week to two weeks time or else youll have a massive flood (which you already have so why would you want more?) of people who complain on steam, on their forums and to their costumer support that the game is broken and they want a refund.",1

"amazing so far, heists are hella fun! free-roam is general is excellent. even better on pc! maxed out looks outstanding! buy now or gtfo. :d",5
"i was so excited for this, like the hype was unreal, and it is good certainly, but unfortunately the game has so many issues right now that it severely hinders the experience. i have way over the suggested settings, and the game is supposedly perfectly optimized for my specs, but the game runs very very poorly, with unbearable lag spikes that make the game almost unplayable. it is ridiculous it took them this long and still both i and my friend with high end pcs can barely run it. rockstar, get it together, you more or less fixed the console versions and you better fix this.",2
"i cannot even play it because im stuck at rockstar games social club loading... tried to update drivers and all, verified game, but still it doesnt work.",1
"this is the best game in gta series. i think gta online is very great and singleplayer is just absolutely interesting. in long term, i think the game would be boring but very very long time :v. 10/10 sorry for bad grammarino",2
"lots of server connection problems. sucks. lost alot of time and in-game money because of this. but of course, you can spend more of your real money to solve that problem. works out great for rockstar i guess.",3
"i think that it is extremely sad for these giant aaa games to come out in such terrible condition, this should not be normal. the fact that i have to disable my video card to get the game to launch then reenable it is extremely sad. once i get in game the singleplayer is fantastic, however when i go online public lobbies are great and so are the jobs, however once i leave or quit a job i get stuck on a loading screen and the screen freezes while i get the same sound looped over again, whether it is a seagull or a gentle breeze. its very annoying and the fact that as of the time i am writing this review rockstar has not even issued a statement is extremely dissappointing,i will hopefully be able to change my review for this game once it is patched. i would recommend waiting to get this game until it is patched, until then i cannot give it a positive review.",2
"id like to recomend this game, but it is unstable as could be. running nvidias recommended settings i dont get a minute of play before the crash. running minimum settings ive managed about 5 a few times. i just cant recomend a game that i cant play due to crashes.",2

"2 years for nothing, cant even launch the game. waste of money and time.",1
"id never experienced such slow downloading speeds since everybody was downloading ios 8.... (and im on a 100mb connection). guess servers got pretty busy. game is awesome, i played the x360 version and have seen the ps4 from a friend, this certainly deserves a bow. looks stunning (playing it at very high settings). 60fps its a thrill. worth the wait!",3
"i loved this game on the 360. waited 2 years to get it on the pc and just to be disapointed. keeps telling me its limited to saved acounts and i cant play. please just fix this rediculous problem.",2
"worst launch ive seen yet, i cant even play the game i ve payed $60 for yet. i have to wait for rockstar to fix it. such a dumb error. i wonder what they are going to do to make up for all of us who cant even get passed the launcher. 1. it took 30 minutes to link social club to steam, because of a login error on their end. 2. finally got past that, now i cant get past the launcher, it crashes every time. 3. now we have to wait for who knows how long for a fix. this sucks rockstar!",1

"10/10 i played this game on x360, was already amazing. now on pc its so much more amazing :o super graphics! gameplay is awesome, i like the missions, lots of variation. heists are nice with the set up and choosing how to do it. online is very fun to play, killing each other or bullying people :3 heists and other missions/races are cool too!",2

"finally. rockstar did an excellent job optimizing this game. it looks and runs great on my nvidia 650m-bearing laptop. also its gtav.",1
"incredible game, according to a lot of people.. majority of my friends included. too bad i cant play it, because the game refuses to launch and theres no hotfixes or patches in sight. the hour ive spent with this game is staring at loading screens for social club. rockstar is silent, which doesnt really help the case. i am happy that they decided to extend the refund period at least because they sold me and a lot of people a broken game that doesnt even start.",3
"super awesome! last time i played was on the 360 but this is 200% better. graphics are so good.",1
"this game works fine with my msi gs70 laptop with 60fps and 1980x1080 settings. community is good everyone is a good guy in online no proplem pros -60fps -first person -all what u need is this game cons -whew bugs but i can handle it",2
"one of the best single player games i have every played. totally worth the wait. the highlights are the heists and the choices. buy it asap.",3
"best game ever. played it on xbox 360 and xbox one but pc version is on another level, it runs sooo smooth. thanks rockstar for letting me transfer my online progress from 360 to one and now from one to pc. strong buy recommendation.",3
"the wait was totally worth it. i found my definition of the word perfect in this game.",1

"the gta launcher stopes working,the programme closes.any suggestions on how to fix the problem?",2
"its an awesome game.. but i really really hate those qts minigame hacking stuff. why is this always in games? well i admit it, i suck at it.. but still.. is that really necessary? no its not. its just annoying with no fun factor at all!",3
"excellent graphics, attention to small details, awesome gameplay, all running optimized as smooth as butter! was worried about gta 4 killing off this great series, but gta v is here now to seriously revive it. still needs a rockstar social account to signup and play, but apart from that slight setup annoyance, well worth it.",1
"rocking my mind. really set the bar at another level.",1
"i have to say, the graphics are great, the gameplay is great, and everything else is just fantastic. obviously there are a few problems (not adding pc to the ifruit app, random bugs, etc) but a game this big has problems. thanks for actually adding it to pc after 2 years of waiting and delaying...",2
"you know i was really excited to finally play this game, even though the release date had been pushed back and pushed back i was really happy to preload it and play. i thought to myself, oh they must just be taking extra time to make sure it all works out! that is great! i am really glad someone cares about us pc gamers! but of course why ever have something good and just work when you release it when you can get someone to pay $60 for something that you know they wont refund because they of course want to actually play the game and just hope maybe someday that they might be able to play. it is really frustrating to me to buy into the hype when it is so obvious that we are just not cared about by big gaming corporations. if you make it work i will of course be happier but it doesnt change the fact that it shouldnt be an issue in the first place.",1
"gta v has finally made to pc. its fantastic and obviously the definitive version. but i wouldnt know that because the games launcher doesnt even start. also rockstar has mentioned any problems even though it has been 3 days. 10/10 great port- ign",1
"awsum work rockstar gameplay is smooth better graphics ^_^ it was worth waiting for this game feels lik heaven",1
"ehh, its ok... the work theyve done is great and is easily worth the game cost alone. however, craftsmanship aside, this is a bit better than gta4 technically speaking, but not better than gta3: san andreas immersion/story-wise. - its a bit of a cheap gimic for game makers to let users create their own content (movie mode). that was a novel idea back when minecraft came out... now its just lazy. - the missions feel cobbled together and the character switching requirement/feature causes immersion loss. - main characters are as deep as a kiddy pool, and supporting characters are mostly just annoying and not lovable. + trevor, however, was really well done! + graphics, controls, cars, city, diversity, engine, optimization are all cinima grade awesome. all in all, its fun to screw around gta2 style, but at $260-ish million development budget... they could have done considerably better. rockstar, if youre listening and think i should shut up or put up... deal... ill help you build gta6 :)",4
"great game. the main bad thing is that social club will lock you out if you get your password wrong a few times. thats what they should fix.",1
"download simulator 2015 is real. it updated a hour long after the release. but then it was great, not the online mode, because it wasnt accessible, but the rest was nice and looks good. i want more!",4
"simply the best game on this generation. no matter if its on pc or console. its so much fun to play this game, it never gets boring and you can do everything and anything! best gta ever, and probably the best game ever. you just must have it! theres no better time than this to use the word masterwork: rockstar did a colossal job creating a huge, visually stunning world chiseled in its finest details, populated by brilliant characters and with highly spectacular and varied gameplay. the city is spectaular and massive it would take solid days to explore, i just cant stress enough how amazing this game is, five years well spent i say",2
"wow, 60 frames solid, 1080+, hi cap multiplayer-perfectly optimized. musto buyo!!!10/10",2
"absolutly amazing game. worth the wait. launches fine for my computer.",2
"this is the best video game since sliced bread. this is the best bread since that toast i ate at waffle house last week. sometimes you are the cop, but this time.. you are the gun.",3
"didnt buy this game for the gameplay, bought it for the reggae music. 10/10 would reggae again.",2
"rockstar told us the pc-version would be the ultimate version and they were right. gta 5 on pc looks incredible and it works almost perfectly. sadly you might still encounter some bugs and glitches in gta online that you already saw on the consoles.",2
"spent an hour chasing around a woman and shooting out her tires and windows, simply because she owned a compact car. 11/10 would project again",2
"one of the best gta franchise i have played so far. its totally worth every penny for this game. plus, its also great to play with your friends to mess around in-game.",5
"thank you console people for beta testing our game! xd",1
"this game is awesome and the graphics omgosh!!!! this game was worth the wait get it now if you didnt get it",2
"this game 10/10 is better then the console version. the aiming, the community, the experience, just about everything. definately recommend this game to everyone/anyone wanting a fun online and first person shooter experience.",2
"this is a great game that i would strongly recomend to anyone who loves just cause, other gta instalments or even open world adventure/action games. it has a vast array of activities or missions from killing cops to doing yoga (as featured in one of the many trailers). although it may be fun, the many activities are kind of a selling point for the game and generally they give way to the imfamous ultra-violence typical to gta. basically, some of the games are used only to boast of the games size and people maily will ignore them. i strongly recomend that you read and compare the system requirements due to the fact that it is a very demanding game and that playing gta 5 in 600x800 with half a second delay is, while semi-playable, extremly disapointing and worth nowhere near the cost of the game. i would deffinetly recomend the game to any casual or extreme gamer as it is an all-round fun time (+ we pc gamers get to laugh at the console players trying to aim on controller!!!).",1
"havent seen since a long time such a large game beeing released so smooth in multiplayer. except the namebug. the game is fun and the community isnt that toxic atm and you can have fun with your friends. the best part, all dlc are included and they are not splitting up the community. great game, grate release! setting high standards for other major releases! would buy it again!",3
"game crashes at start and does not work. would not buy.",1
"crash after crash after crash after crash and you all know how the rest goes ;-)",1
"after multiple attempts to get the game to launch, i have decided to accept valves offer of a refund. issues affecting this decision: 1. no direct contact with support to remedy issues 2. rockstar support requires social club membership for 30 days before being allowed to post an issue 3. multiple workarounds published, none have been successful 4. rockstar social club accepted the steam activation code, then claimed no games activated on the profile. no means of requesting support on this issue 5. multiple hours spent downloading, redownloading, and verifying local game files. no success. i understand launch day issues, but for a game that has been in the top seller category on steam for weeks now to have such an issue, with no official instructions on how to make the product work; well i wont gamble on the process getting better. disappointed.",1
"everything runs fine, high / very high settings, 4x msaa 1080p@50/60fps with occasional drops below on an almost three years old gtx680 with 4gb gddr5. i had one crash so far, but nobodies perfect and the game saves constantly.",4
"account got locked because repeated failed login attemps.. what do i do? pls help",3
"right so this wont be a review of the content of the game but whether or not to buy it in its current state since we all know the game  rainbows anyway. i am not reccomending this game on the pc for the sole purpose of it having optimization issues i call it the stutter essentially whenever i run the game it could run fine for 30-mins or 1 minutes or for an hour its completly random but then the game has these stuttering fits almost like trying to start up a brocken down car and it works for 10 minutes at a time. just for anybody who is looking at this and about to type well maybe its your computer specs these are my specs- gtx660ti 8gb ram i5-2310 and 5981mb left for page file use. my setup is almost identical to that of the reccomended specs on the front page of the game if that doesnt give you warning whistles you might want to consolt your local cautious pharmasist. the stutter problem gets worse the more you play i have also searched it up online and it seems alot of players are having the same issue dont buy this game right now use your head like i didnt and wait until the game is more polished i say 5 or six patches have a good day everyone.",3
"its goood the singleplayer is kinda laggy but it aint to bad, its still playable ut there are some moderate bug issues and some lag. its fine though. update: i played about 10 hours of the mode yesterday and today and amloving it besides the lag so far. 9/10 the online isnt broken and its really fun though there is some bugs and lag! 9/10 there is a mjor problem though with slow reactions to the keyboard so be careful but besides that this game is great so far i havent tried heists but im expected to play it in about a week and i have a feeling i will be impressed so far its a 8/10",5
"single player: read someone elses, its been said a million times before. online: works great....",3
"it worth all the waiting time. great graphics, impressived perfomance, really 60fps. well done. well done rockstar!",2
"have been waiting for over a year to get this game on pc, ffs rockstar you let your pc fans down with that move! d: but the game i got after that painful year of waiting is worth every cent of 60 euro pre-purchase!!! i cant stop playing dis game! <3",4
"essentially improves everything gta iv failed at with much more content and updated: graphics, gameplay mechanics and a huge story.",1
"dont buy this game until its fixed, i have a r9 290x and a i5 3570k and the game runs like **** with fps drops and stuttering",4
"downloaded 70gb of game decrypted game unpacked game launched game game crashed twice because of low memory problems goes and buys another 8 gb of ram cant because canada computers closes at 7:30 pm buys tomorrow installs ram launches game graphics driver crashes launches again ??? profit! 11/10 would run out of ram again",1
"i really did like this game when there were things to do in the single player world. my biggest issue however, is lack of places to go. there is a huge city here, but you can not enter almost any of its buildings, where i understand this for most small buildings, there are large buildings that feel like they should have been enterable, such as the mall, certain sky scrapers. but really though the biggest one for me is that you can buy businesses like bars. but you can not enter them. its a great big city, but its an empty city.",3
"pre-purchased the game. pre-downloaded to 120gb ssd. on initial startup got a pop-up running out of disk space and cant start the game. 0/10 would not download 59gb again at 800kb/sec for 60. update: was forced to redownload after all in order get the minimum requirement 5 minutes clocked in steam counter to write up this review.",2
"i keep reading about people having issues with this game, i feel really lucky i did not have any issues....at least not on my laptop. my rog laptop is a mid-range pc with win 8.1, i7-4700hq, gtx-850m, 8gb ram and a 1tb 850 evo ssd, the game looks good and is buttery smooth with zero lag. i was afraid of shuddering like in watch_dogs but there is none. i only played an hour, but so far its a fun game.",2
"by all accounts a good, well optimized game. the ui, controls are fantastic. the graphic options and graphical quality is exceptional, especially for the performance i get on low-end hardware. they really put a lot of work into optimizing this and tweaking the engine to perfection. far more than any company has anything else released in years. that is, if it runs at all. theyre dragging their feet about fixing the myriad of issues which plague many players. at this time i do not recommend buying it with a 50% chance that itll just crash repeatedly, either during the intial launch of the launcher itself, or during gameplay.",3
"the only game i have that makes me realise that i need an(other) even better gpu.",2
"nice the graphics are wonderful! none problems so far",2
"well, it seems rockstar did a good port this time, unlike they did with gta iv. i`m having no issues so far. the game runs great on my mid-range pc, and it looks way better than it did on my ps3.",1
"love this game,seriously its great...if it works. how hard is it to get a game right on launch after its been delayed for what,3 months now? seriously dissappointed. cannot even launch it without crashing.",1

"i bought this game two days ago. and i have already used 17 hours in-game. it had no problems installing or downloading the 60gb and there is very few bugs. the online services works very well and i have already completed multiply heists. generally, this game deliveres what it promises. buy it 9/10",3

"its gta, you cant go wrong with it. one of the most critically acclaimed games of the modern gen has arrived on pc and in full force.",3
"fun game but the mobile app isnt updated and there is a glitch/screen tearing in bottom right corner for some reason. looks amazing!",3
"as far as nicknaming the game grand theft auto v pc: loading screen edition this game has some beautiful graphics when running with a gtx 970 4gb card. there are a few bugs here and there but thats expected like one of them mention previously, loading screen. sometimes it gets stuck or takes forever to go away. other than that the game is awesome and is worth the $60 i paid for.",4
"after a long wait and many delays, grand theft auto v has finally arrived onto steam. its a great game that you can mess around on, wreak havoc, break laws, obey laws, buy stuff, shoot stuff, blow stuff up, drive stuff, fly stuff, play with friends, and many, many, many more features. the graphics are amazing, and i especially like the motion blur added to the pc version. those with low fps (20 - 30) will be glad that motion blur is a thing. the gameplay is fantastic. i cant recommend another game as good as this one. the controls feel right, the movement feels right, everything feels right. the texturing is very detailed and so are the many small things in this game. not a single thing is left unpolished in all of san andreas. why are you still reading this review? go buy the game already. its worth the $60.",3
"did the prologue three times! but it was pretty so its ok! tl:dr this game is a lot of fun. now for online with all me buddies! heh heh",2
"yes indeed this game is so goood the 4k display too go to the strip club 70/69 ign rating",2

"completely reconmend this game although i have found i problem when signing on to your game and not registering your email it doesnt let you use the store if anyone has figured away around this please add me (i have registered my email now) but besides that i have found no other issues 100% perfect worth every penny",3
"great game just great, i find pleasure in killing as many players as i can in the free roam lobby.",3
"this is a kind of game you can always go back to.this is a kind of game you can play and feel like youre crontrolling a movie.this is a kind of game you can play as racer or fps.this is my kind of game",2

"story mode review pros +fantastic characters +huge gameworld filled with things to do and see +very customizable +tons of side missions +20 hours long of just main story +excellent gameplay cons -story is hit or miss especially the ending. -player choice is almost non-existent. the only times you ever get to choose are before heists. -heists blow . usually 30 minutes of prep time or more for uninspired, infinetly respawning enemy shooting gallaries. -missions are never emotionally satisfying. mixed side characters have little to no effect on the main story. controls on kb&m are ehh. game is really easy. 7/10 multiplayer review pros +custom characters +leveling system is very rewarding +apartments and vehicles give you a good reason to take part in a ton of different jobs. +there are a lot of ing jobs. like. so ing many. +free roam is fun as . cons -lag is pretty common. -insane loading time. 9/10 port report ill start by saying this port is not as good as many people have made it out to be. my specs are well above the recommended and my fps goes from 30-60 on a mix of normal and high settings. there are a ton of options to fiddle with and you can customize all of your controls.",3
"i already own this on two consoles (ps3/ps4) and now the pc version looking as well. i am looking forward to modding the crap out of it. its a great game and i think people get turned off the online too easily. long load times, the occasional lag, and spotty server connection dont always help the argument either. it is easy to get frustrated especially early on when it looks like there are only a few activities and youre getting constantly stomped by people with better toys in the open world. dont give up, steal cars and rob mini-marts. buy guns or cars to do missions or race, then property. dont get lured away from the goal by the icing (clothing, haircuts, tattoos, custom paint and neon kits on starter cars). id rather be the worst dressed guy killing your faces any day. as you level up more and more activities will unlock and if you put in the time and find a good crew (you might as well it gives more point to run with a crew anyways) this game is beyond fun.",1
"this game is amazing! the singleplayer is very dramatic/cinematic and has the feling of a movie about a group of thieves coming together to perform massive hiests. as for the multiplayer it feels like theyre trying to get you to buy shark cards as the online ultimatly feels like a huge grind but over all is still very fun and with the addition of hiests this gives the game a new feeling to it making players who have played the game for houndreds of hours to come back and play even more! so overall this game is worth buying the only thing i think needs changing is the grind in online. 11/10 ign 100% legit",2

"amazing pc port !! runs butter smooth @ 1920x1080 on my gtx 970 with almost all the bells and whistles turned on (and it does offer a huge variety of video options). the graphical fidelity is outstanding -esp. for an open world game. i am very happy they didnt dumb it down unlike so many other contemporary pc ports. beware of the ~ 60 gb download / hard disc space requirement though. the game also seems to be using up almost all of my 4096 mb video memory. so if you have a mid range pc, i suggest disabling anti aliasing and turning the texture quality sliders down a notch to ensure smooth gameplay. im not even gonna waste time reviewing the actual gameplay/storyline as this game has been out on consoles for almost 2 years now. but for us pc players it was certainly worth the wait. brb overclocking my gpu so i can crank up the msaa even more ... #justmasterracethings",1

"overall the pc version is 110% better than the console versions. id recommend it if you enjoyed the game on console and the only issue (not a huge deal) that i have is the flight controls. theyre just kinda hard to get used to at first. i went ahead and changed the controls so that the mouse controls the pitch and stuff for the planes and helicopters. also, i turned the sensitivity for the mouse during flight way down...just gives it an easier feel i think. murdered a hooker with a hatchet 10/10",3

"the following is a personal preference read the following with a open mine or f*ck off i have played all versions of the game and the changes between xbox 360/ps3 graphics and xbox one/ps4 are massive to be honest it is a waste of money if you own a console copy. the graphical changes between current gen console gta and pc is next to nothing on top of that they have promised many additions on all platforms but it is still not here they promise additions many additions and hold back as proof of this look at the heist dlc it was delayed for a bit over 1 year even the pc version has taken blows like this it was meant to be released in late 2014 here we are in 2015 and it was still getting delayed unless rockstar lifts their game i think this game is in some ways the worst gta to be released if i had to rate it i must say as much as i am level headed between pc and console id say console is like a 8.5/10 and pc in its current state is like 3.5/10 my opinion may change with rockstars progress but i am unsure if this is going to change my opinion",1

"ok if you have the gta launcher issue go on device managers, display adapters and disable your video card then it should run then enable the next time you start the game. now for the review its worth every penny. the gameplay is smooth, the game is great looking, havent tried online but ive heard very positive stuff about it and the game is just simply very very fun. if your pc can run this is a must buy",5
"without a doubt a great and fun game, but the problem is that online the servers are so bad have fun driving or shooting any other player. its complete desync 90% of the time, and before you comment, maybe your internet is just , its not because i know the difference between ping lag and actual poor servers that arent keeping up with the load on them. my point is that the game is fun and the online would be playable for 100s of hours if you could actually kill things in less than 200 bullets due to desync.",4
"totally worth the wait, this game is amazing but still some bugs here and there but its real fun. and glorious 60 fps",3
"very disappointed with how this game is running. i preordered in jan. and when i got it on the 13 it would crash everythime i started it up and it got to the loading screen. its not my windows name, its not my graphics card. i spent 60$ on this game and if i dont see it working anytime soon i am going to be very upset.",1
"refunded. im sure the game itself is great, but the launch was not. its not to late to get a refund if its not working for you.",4
"absolutely mind blowing and beautiful ... best game ever..",5
"went into a movie theater. watched the wierdest movie with subliminal messaging, an illuminati brainwashing tool... would watch again, and again, 10/10",2
"f****** awesome game, im about to take the test at next week, but who cares ? this blockbuster must be played when it released !!!!",4
"i bought this game when it was released back in 2013 for ps3 and xbox360. i played alot of online and a little bit of singleplayer. i enjoy online the most i think its what makes this game great being able to access the entire map and do whatever you please. now that i own a decent gaming laptop, the graphics are gorgeous and vivid. i am playing at 900p and getting about 35-40 fps. back on ps3 the graphics are unbearable and i dont know how my eyes got used to the frames. i havent noticed any pop in whatsoever (coming from a regular 5400rpm 1tb hdd user). there is a bit of jaggies and stuttering but i have it under control when i set up maximum pre rendered frames to 1 in my nvidia control papnel and power management to maximum performance. i would reccomend this game to anyone it is truely amazing how rockstar developed this game allowing those with not very good specs to play this game even at normal settings the game still looks beautiful. thank you rockstar thank you pc please guys get this game youll be amazed!",1
"wtf ???? why social club ? whyy ??? i cant even sign in in this fkcn program. even games for windows life was better. i spent like 1 hour to register in social club.",3
"this is pathetic excuse for a launch of a game. i recommend only buying it when the ing servers actully work. well another billionare game company managed to  up another launch",1
"its literally the best game ever made. the largest physics sandbox ever created, coupled with an incredible story, deep multiplayer component and film quality performances from the actors. i cannot think of a finer game and ive been playing them for over two decades. this is the best selling piece of entertainment for a reason. it raises the bar in every capacity. optimization is phenomenal as well. get this game, take your time with it, play it slowly and enjoy the most solid and varied game mechanics weve ever seen in a single package. 10/10. nothing will take this games crown for a long, long time.",2
"game is fun as a sandbox game and a singleplayer game, the rest is tedious as hell. not worth the high price",3
"just finished installing.. been waiting for this.. after configuring the graphics, played on 1080p... pretty much on ultra settings... graphics are wowwwww... lovin the details.. lighting... environment... top work smooth gameplay... i havent play the ps3 or ps4 version.. so i have no comparisons.. because ive only been waiting for pc version. yes a long wait!!.. no regrets tho... btw heres my rigs: i7 4790k amd radeon r9 290 4gb ddr5 16 gb ram ddr3 500 gb ssd evo samsung 840 10/10 awesomeness!!!!!!!! but again.. this review is coming from a gta fan... so of coz itll be 10/10.. :d",2
"soo when i try to launch the game it says the launcher stops working and doesnt let me ing play. help me is there anyone out there that will en help my sorry  im scared loney hurt and no faith left sos",1
"same  i do in real life, but in higher resolution.",4
"to describe gta 5 (online) in short would be; the combination of games including payday, need for speed, the crew with the original gta elements that was in the previous installments. there is a wide variety of things to do from racing to missions to death matches. golf, tennis ... darts. content updates being free makes it more desirable, although faced with some issues right now, (server overload, disconnects). gta 5 online is worth a shot if you got friends, if your a loner then play single player. get a crew going, run some heists, buy a car, mod it, race and impress dem hunnies or get the booty at the strip club and/or random chicks walking on the streets.",2
"didnt buckle into rollercoaster, got trampled by it while a helicopter murdered me. 12/10 stellar.",2
"best game of tennis ive played in a while 10/10 would spend 60 again",1
"amazing fun, great story, and online is interesting. well worth my money, and really enjoying my time with it.",3
"this game is so good in graphics and gameplay that it can hardly (normal gameplay) or compleatly not (online) run on my computer on the lowest graphics 10/10 would watch my computer explode again",1
"edit: i can open it now. cant even open it. 11/10",2
"gamesharing is enabled in steam but blocked by the rockstar drm. if your friends want to demo it they will have a gigantic download followed by the total inability to play the game. wtf rockstar?",1
"very nice game... there are few minor bugs and glitches, but nothing really game-breaking. (if i dont count rp and money glitches).. only bad thing i felt is r* support. it is terrible. 4 days waiting on ticket. - nothing. then some bot replies with some format i should send to their email and i am waiting again lol. otherwise funny, great game. nice graphics. great to play with friends, if you dont have any, you will definitely find some in this game. my rating to this game is 9/10. you can get really angry sometimes and some bugs can occur as i said but nothing else. also 11/10 would kill cats, dogs, wildlife.",2
"-10/10 ing trash game wont even launch good job rockstar",3
"it took 1 year and 6 months and was delayed 3 times but it was well worth the wait. 1080p @ 60fps with all the settings maxed out looks amazing. 20/10 jumped off a helicopter without a parachute and lived. would do again.",2
"if i need to review for you to buy this you need to die!",1
"some cant run it (me) others can at least roman isnt in this game..... yet",3
"well, its a great game, played it on my xbox, but this pc version sucks . excuse me, wasted whole day, trying to launch it, still no success.",1
"piece of crap. does not download properly, does not sign into social club at all. i have wasted two complete nights trying to get it work and when it finally did, the game crashed. thanks for the great support and the ripoff. actually sorry, i am getting my refund right now",1
"stunningly beautiful, well worth the wait. biggest complaint would be the weird air vehicle controls, for kb + m (no-one uses numpad for anything r*). but easy enough to change yourself to something more comfortable. i think this will most likely be my new time sucking game.",3
"my anticipations for this game were really high, although they kept delaying it i was still excited to get home and download + play this game however i had day one issues. but this long wait was well worth it. its a great game but sadly not many people have the game :/",1
"bought gta 5 for the 3rd time, totally worth every penny. using 4k dsr+ultra settings on gtx 970 is so awesome, definitely 10/10 <3",4
"brought a game which cant play.... game exited with code -1073741701 please fix this ! so decided to reformat window to 8.1 and now cant stop myself playing it.",4
"i have been waiting for 2 years and it was really worth it. the graphics are amazing, the game is amazingly optimized for amd and nvidia gpus after the update. my favorite game, love it!",2
"one of the very best video games ever made, impressive open world of los santos in every detail. 10/10",3
"absolutley fantastic! so much fun stuff to do, like heists. you can even play tennis. tennis! worth it! make sure you also play with friends",3
"wtf rockstar?! can not run or load the game at all. well beyond all system requirements yet everytime i attempt to run the game i get a please run playgtav.exe error.... this is unacceptable!!!! i paid for a pre order, pre loaded, am way beyond the system requirements yet.... can not play. i expect a full refund for this lack of playability on the first day. why open the flood gates if you were not yet ready. fix this!!!!!!",1
"wowee grand theft  v is pretty coolios 10/10 -my mum",4
"-issues joining friends online from time-to-time -if you die during a heist, spend the next 10 minutes tying to fix the frozen screen! -terrible nvidia surround, the cutscenes only work on 1 display. -when in-game, the display on the side monitors is extremely streched and ugly -semi-frequent crashes during singleplayer; i blame this on the resolution -driving any form of vehicle on a keyboard is terrible, gta iv was much better! -settings, normal, high, very high?? no.. low, medium, high! get it right! ... -good game however definately a let-down for a year and 1/2 longer wait!",5
"gtav is an overall amazing game. awesome graphics, and endless things to do. 10/10 would play again.",1
"def was worth the wait. it runs very smooth on my comp",3
"good game but i just lost my adder!!! on gta 5 online. dont steal a car and park it in your garage if you have a car allready out and about it will delete your car. since i am pissed the  off about this issue i will be down voting untill this is fixed",4
"so glad i resisted the urge to play it on xbox 360 and waited for the pc version to come out!",2
"this game is great, but without mods it is kind of the same boring game, if you have previously played it on the consoles but with amazing graphics, compared to the consoles. the best thing about gta on pc is the mods that will be sure to come out, but as there are none yet the game is still kind of dry. this game is not very well optimised for pc players, as the keyboard and mouse controls are kind of unusual, this isnt saying they are unusable, but if a player has never played pc or gta on pc before then it takes some getting used to, which is why i recommend playing this game with a controller, unless you are exclusively playing in first person mode.",2
"+driving simulator +tennis game -too great not to play",1
"the game is fun enough, the story is funny and you always have something to do. online is kinda lame since youd normally go from single player with all the items to online with nothing, and if you dont have a group it seems like a gank fest for the most part which can be fun if youre into that kind of thing. my only real complaint about the game is the horrible controls. with a gamepad its not to bad but mouse / keyboard it is so awkward and clunky. for example you go through the game using wasd for movement and then suddenly go into a plane and it wants you to use your num pad, wasd, and then youre expect to look around with your mouse. they could have done a lot better with just using your mouse to steer the plane and wasd to control pwr and left and right (forgeting the name). the game is fun and once you get over the controls is very good. id highly suggest atlest having a gamepad of some sort atlest plugged in for those flight missions since its very easy to switch between the two.",1
"this game and  rockstar. installed the game and ran it, and i get grand theft auto v has closed unexpectedly. contacted rockstar and researched solutions online, and the game will not start.  er",1
"great game must have, verry good work exsept some wired bug when u launche it",2
"had this game on the 360 great game was happy its out for the pc as the graphics on it are amazing its a big download but its worth the wait for it!",1
"jesus christ.... i loved it on xbox and i love it even more on pc. great communtity and amazing graphics. 10/10 would be  to get this game.... again.",2
"omg this game rules all! very happy that rockstar did good this time.",1
"game of the year !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
"10/10 would waste 30 mins of my life to decript the game files again",4
"so i havent played any gta since gta 2 (1997), and that has been one of my favorite games from my teenage years. i skipped gta 3 and 4 mainly because i didnt care for the change from 2d top down to 3d third person. however seeing the total biscuit review for the game convinced me to give this game a try. honestly, im blown away in regards to how good this game actually is. the attention to detail and the grand scale of the world is really amazing. i have only a few hours in so far, but i am completely sold by how good the game actually is, and look forward to playing it for many hours more.",1
"from xbox360 to pc . gtav still the look great and make you can play again from beginning",3
"shut da fug up. buy da game. yo  can stay tender for now. - detective nigbone",2
"baught the game for 100$aud rediculous spent the entire weekend wasting 60gb of internet played it for one day and the next day it broke and i refuse to redownload it. waste of money last time i buy a game for over 20$.",2
"i love how history repeats itself release gta gta does not work either faff around or wait for a fix im just going to wait, too many times have you f** up rockstar, social club and window live etc is the worst move you ever made gg, see you when its done",1
"alright i changed this,im all well for playing this now,thx",3
"game is beautiful. it runs great. definetly worthed if you are a fan of the series or enjoy open world games. if i go back 3 weeks, knowing what i know. i would still pre-order it.",2
"taunted people as trevor, got whole block after me. 10/10",3
"fantastic port from consoles. it is also pretty optimized for lower end pcs. spawned in on gta online and got ran over, would do it again 10/10",2
"great game. great port. looks nice. vram usage chart in graphics menu goes above and beyond what id expect from most modern games. benchmark kinda breaks the game if you try and use it outside of normal free roam, and there are a few occasional glitches here and there, but overall this was very much worth the wait.",3
"gta v. a masterpiece. i play both on ps4 and ps3 and i have accumulated 2000+ combined on gta online alone. its just such a great game, and its much better on pc. this game is worth the 60$ and more. one of the greatest games of all time. no doubt.",1
"gtav plays excellently on the pc. the optimization is great, with mid-range computers being able to flawlessly play this game with little hassle. its a game that can be as beautiful as you want it to be, with a plethora of options to tweak. the controls work well with keyboard and controller. the awesome thing is that you can have the keyboard/mouse plugged in as well as a controller, and the game will detect which you are using and adjust the tooltips. the polish on this game is very apparent. the character migration also works well. what im trying to get at is everything about this game is everything from the xbox one/ps4, but better in every way. except helicopter control, which i feel is a little loose and more difficult, but still usable.",1
"nice gameplay, i just finish download, play and just try for mission 1 very recommend",1
"best pc port of all time, amazing gameplay, you need this game. i only had one issue after installing it was a corrupted file, it was fixed with the validation tool in steam within 20 minutes, not a deal breaker in any sense. i own the game on the 360 and have beat it twice, i started back in single player again and have not made it to multiplayer as of yet as the immersion is a fantastic experience. im sure the online portion is great i just have not wanted to tear myself away from story mode (for the third time)..",3
"this game is extremely well optimized and is just gorgeous. i run at 60 fps i started as a newbie and worked my way up to rank 12 in one day (yea sure im a noob but who cares?) i enjoyed every bit of it. a new update was released from rockstar giving amd graphics card users the ability to play which got me extremely excited to get the game going i started it up and was just like i expected it to be, just better. my experience today: -great details -reflections -shadows -ranking system -online tutorial -full controller support and more but cba to list it here for now. im recommending it because it is a very great game and you should buy it, the 60$ i paid was imo worth it.",2
"dont buy it yet. too many bugs: crashes infinite loading screen etc. wait till its on sale and has been patched properly.",3
"... dat launch fail. first of all, you are forced to sign up with  rockstar social club, so pesky. then the  social club doesnt work for 1+ days on launch. then a good amount of people cant play the game without creating a new user profile on their machine. then many people complain about random crashes, i got some too within a few hours of the game. how the ... how the  can you let things like this happen, ask aaa money for the title and have it postponed numerous times. would it have been even ier if they launched it on pc earlier? (maybe you couldve had a crash every 5 minutes then.) exquisite fun for you. game is good, port is... kinda optimized. story is great. cba to play it, getting put off by annoyances. so. no!  off with that  rockstar social club. you can do that  on consoles, not on pc.",2
"played this on xbox 360 and i enjoyed it very much. now with editor mode and firstperson as well as mouse+ keyboard, the gameplay of gta is much more enjoyable and realistic. i highly reccommend buying this game, because this game is very addictive and very fun to play with your friends :) . glhf",2
"why does my game not work? i downloaded it and then when i click play nothing happens. then i went onto my task manager and then i clicked play again and the gtav launcher appeared. then about 10 seconds later it just disappears. can someone plz help me and dell me how to fix this? thanks!",1
"social club is working...i am not being cheeky...honest. it works...hehe...it works......it doesnt ing work!   !!!!!",4
"good game. some people had trouble with the launcher. i had to turn off my firewall for the launcher to work. hope that helps.",2
"crap. game with alot of bugs mostly playing online",4
"oh baby gta v, woopdy da doop i`m going to shoot a coop. gg, mlg. kryzih out",3
"i hope you like fighting with drm greedware. this game is full of it and i cant even get it to run.",1
"its wonderful, it looks so good, even better than on ps3 and xbox. ive been enjoying this game alot. and i will for a very long time. this is so worth it. if your pc can handle it of course. you can even transfer your character from your ps/xbox to pc, so no worries.",4
"crashes 5 seconds in everytime i try to play.  you rockstar.",1
"grand theft auto might be the best gta game ive ever played, there is some issues, where for example, when i want to switch my graphics to med-high, it want to restart the game to load the graphics, but when it starts again, it goes into 800x600 in resolution and windowed mode, and all normal graphics with vsync, wich can be quite annoying, but otherwise its an amazing game, and i recommend this game for everyone who likes to drive cars into people and shoot old/fat people!",1
"a complete shambles from rockstar games. you would expect a lot more from rockstar. i thought they would have planned for success for this title on the pc, but instead we are left with thousands of people being unable to play the game. my particular case is due to rockstar having force linked my steam account that is linked to an incorrect social club account. i created a brand new account because i was having trouble retrieving my old social club details and was given a warning that if i tick the box, that there will be no return. i decided to wait and try to gather my old details. i got my old details, yay! but, guess what!? i didnt even click the box and it has been linked to the wrong account... clap, clap, clap sarcasm? youre god damn right. well done to whomever came up with the perma link steam cd key idea... pffft, i think you should at least receive a written warning from your employer. now give me my 39.99 back so i can buy another copy and moan about it all again. p.s. do not buy this game guys, they have completely screwed around with the background infrastructure and you will lose your 39.99... technically fraud, as you arent receving anything useable...",1
"i think i would like this game but when i try to open it steam says im playing it for 10 seconds then nothing happens i waited so long for nothing to happen thanks rock star",2
"summary: -game is good fun and in greater quality than ever seen before in a gta game. - steering wheel and flight stick is not supported though which is a shame. - people got problems making their laptop gpu running the game. gta is gta, you run around blow up stuff, doing missions, climbing the ranks and making cash. the game has got crazy characters and during the game you get to play as different characters with different lives. despite this during game they will meet and work together to achieve their goals. when you arent doing missions, there is also tons of activities you can do. my overall impression is that gta 5 is just a little bit different in terms of features, compared to gta 5, but it still feels way more fun and overall higher quality.",3
"gta v finally arrives on pc and im happy to say that rockstar has done an amazing job with the port. the game runs and looks great and is the definitive version. also included in the pc version is the video editor which i can already foresee taking hours and hours of my time.",3
"after more than two yrs rockstar finally figures out how to press w to move forward.",3
"so i actually bought social club instead of the game.",2
"60 dollar for a cant play game, give back my money or fix this ing things now! it keep saying no responding and im not the only one who have this issue, god damn fix it or i wont give a positive review",4
"certainly gta, despite being an extremely late release, the improvements to this game are pretty strong! pros: the fps feature makes a great improvement in playability and experience, for it may help players who are used to fp shooters not feel completely alienated being forced into 3rd person, and driving any vehicle from the inside delivers a nice touch of depth (working odometers in a non racing game.... wow). further more, the story for this game was great! this is to gta v as a whole (meaning pc/console); anyone who hasnt played through it already, anticipate a solid story if you plan on picking this game up. single player content is loaded. cons: more of a personal gripe, ive found myself switching between my xbox controller and mouse/keys due to control-complexity. xbox controller for anything involving a vehicle, and m/keys for in combat (whether in car on the move, or on foot). theres a lot to remember for different key functions.",3
"great game but you have to have a good pc or it will lag complete balls",1
"me and my friends stormed a fort filled with naked old people and killed every last one before being persued by the police for an hour 11/10 would definetly recommend",2
"bought every version of this game for each platform from day one release dates, and i have to say it gets better each purchase :d",3
"simple. if you havent played gtav then you should.",4
"just horrible, you cannot call romans taxi at any stage in the entire game.",3
"cant say much till now....after 3 days me and some other milion peeps still cant play that  game :|",1
"the game that every pc gamer has being waiting for patiently delivers.",2
"every 10 mins it says program stopped working help me",4
"lots of time will be sunk into this game from any fan of the grand theft auto series, let alone those that enjoy rockstars games.",2
"do i recommend this game? yes. do i need to explain myself? no.",3
"first day up you would expect that rockstar has learned their lesson about server overloads yet masive amounts of people cant get online to or even run the game in the first place",2
"very amazing game. dont believe some people when they say it is just another badly ported gta, sure it has a few problems still, but just be happy it runs better than gta iv, a game that came out 2008, and gta v looks just about as good as gta iv with a ton of mods. if you have the money, buy the game it is very worth it. these slight issues will most likely be patched within a few months time, probably not even that.",5
"great game!!!! no issues at all with install. runs flawlessly, and was worth the wait.",5
"well the game is awesome already and ive just played it for like 5 hours or something what can i say, its so much better than the ps and xbox version i can asure you that and its just awesome lol",2
"its no longer just a game, its a experiance for the soul. i played gta v on the xbox since it first came out and this is quiet honestly the best experiance ive had with it ever since then, and ive had some great experiances. if you want a game where you can do pretty much anything you want and have it look amazing at the same time then this is a game you dont want to pass up.",1
"my favorite part about the pc release of the game is that they make it crash every 30 minutes.",1
"crash simulator 2015. 10/10 never pre order again.",3
"horrible launch. with millions in sales and prelaunch revenue this game should be polished and glitch free. i will never pre order a rockstar game ever again. game constantly crashes during game play at random intervals. gta v is not responding to gta v has stopped responding my specs: amd 8350 crosshair v formula z crossfirex 2x280x 16gb corsair platinum",2
"its working really well for my system, im loving the amazing graphics and features, this is by far the best gta ive played so far. well done rockstar!",1
"do not buy this game until it is fixed. the game is horribly broken with bugs. not only are most people that are having issues not able to play the game at all, the gameplay itself is hit or miss. loadscreens are deathtraps and maybe about 20% of the time i can progress through them without the game just crashing completely.",2
"buyer beware: if you are an average gamer that does not have more than or eaqual to 3gb graphics card the game will look horrible, you must havea graphics card to play but it must be a spendy one because the xbox 360 verson of this game looks better then the pc version for me, im so sad i wasted $60 on this hopeing for better graphics but am now out $60 and very dissapointed.",2
"what the... you still do not have this game yet? what a pity!",2
"thank you to the xbox and playstation gamers for beta testing gta v. after 2 years of the beta the full game has been realesed",2
"it is pretty fun, but after a while, the game begins to stutter and even crash. overall i would say that the graphics enhancements were well done, but it is not really as well optimized as other games ive seen. the story is great and the world of los santos is truly immersive.",3
"bye every other game in my library, see you next year!",3
"this game is the only reason i would go back to console gaming, now theres no need. everyone needs to play it.",1
"10/10 review this is the third time buying this game bought it first on ps3 and 2nd time bought it on ps4 and know bought it on pc! this game is so fun! it was easy to install and has really good graphics! absolutely amazing game and plays even better on pc! #console 60 fps all ultra setting i7 4790k 2k gtx 980s sc 16 gb ram",3
"i played the game for a while now, both online and single player and as a guy who completed the game several times on ps3 its still incredibly fun to play with all the additions and improvements. the game is extremely well optimized unlike gta iv.",3
"please make a option for 30 frames per second in the game just as a option please",1
"i sware the game was coming out on friday but im not complaining, gg this made my day!",2
"always good as it is for gta franchise, even though still found some glitch <gta online>, stuting and lagging <both gta v and gta online>. hopefully rockstar will look at it soon. still good for me.",2
"thank you rockstar for not bull shiiting us. this makes us pc gamers really happy and crave even more for it. it is greatly appreciated. in the end, not every company are butt holes towards their customers. as they had said, the game is optimized for pc and it doesnt even require a high end pc to play it. i am very happy with my pre order purchase. :) p.s fu ck those rushing games or just delaying them to give us a version that still is crappy!!!",3
"+fun +trevor +humor +dialogue +weapons +many ways to die +customizing cars +flying helicopters +use taxi if the mission is far +running people over -hospital fee -soundtrack is horrible (use your own music only) -textures -price -cars turning into my lane -flying planes is still  -scripted intersections and events -needs 8+ gb of vram for ultra and still looks like",3
"i love this game on xbox 360 but on pc right now i have a $2,000 pc overclocked and has a amd turbo card amd 8 gb of ram and a intel(r) core(tm) i7-4770k cup and i cant go any where near the city so i hope gta v reads this because you need to fix performance (yes i know there going to be problems because it just came out) but at the end it fun to play",1
"coming from the ps3 to the master race, this is a huge upgrade. this game is a must buy and youll never regret your choice. this is by far my favorite gta ever since san andreas and vice city!! pros: -graphic updates -all past dlc included even the collectors edition exclusive vehicles. -emmersive story -great characters -first person mode works great. -smooth 60 fps!! -huge selection of vehicles. land and air!! -never gets boring -great online that has you playing countless missions to level up and get money. -gta online transfer system works great for all returning players from consoles -online heists!!!! cons: -in gta online, it can be hard to get money for everything you want unless you play heists. -more freaks and geeks can be added, the ones already in the game are great!",3
"the game is amazing, the optimization is great and over all is just the definitive version of gta v. i have a video of fps with gtx 760 and fx-8320 @ 4.2 if your curious about how it runs on a mid range system.",2
"i became master of pc programming after grand theft auto v exited unexpectedly. 10/10",1
"went to a strip club and spend all the cash from the preorder 10/10",2
"the game itself is great. i expected to be able to at least run it on minimum settings and for the most part its reasonable. still looks better than console with shadows being the only issue. the glitches and speed of launch/ loading will probably be fixed soon. it does freeze up a bit luanching the game but i just get a snack and its loaded when i come back, probably 2 minutes at most. gameplay is fantastic, i love the story (never bothered getting it for console) and there are so many interesting things to do in the game world. if you are very impatient and expect a lot from your setup, maybe wait a few weeks for the glitches to pass. but if you can handle a bit of lag, a few glitches, and dont care too much about flawless performance, definitely buy this ultimate edition of gta 5",4
"most negative reviews have over 24 hours invested. 20/10 even haters cant stop playing",4
"smooth like silk.....all settings very high or ultra, even in advanced, running on an evga 780 classified! constant 40-50 fps.......anyone who thinks thats low because its not 60 fps has no concept of what these numbers actually mean! oh by the way, still rocking an i7-920 from 2009 clocked at 3.8ghz......still as powerfull if not more than most current cpus! most people with crash problems and poor game performance on cards like a gtx 970, is just that, their problem!!! learn your hw, and learn how it all works. dont take it out on the developer just because you run mcafee/norton along with itunes and skype and chrome and 300 other apps all at once, then try to load a game and it runs like . rockstar, amazing job! cant wait for red dead on pc!",3
"so far game keeps crashing, cant even get to the main menu.",1
"wont run, crashes on start up, it isnt the windows accoutn problem. rip.",1
"shiit just got real awesomemest game so far by rockstar lol !!!!!!!!",2
"10/10 would wait 2 years for it to come out on the pc",2
"10/10 this game is awesome.. now go! i need to meditate. or masturbate. or both.  trevor phillips hahaha",3
"i have been playing it since it came out on ps3 and have pretty good experince... 10/10 would waste my time again.",4
"well optimized. almost bug free. amazing experience.",4
"well whadaya know, r* didnt mess it up! this is the same game that released on all the consoles already only better, with all the bells and whilstles rockstar has been talking about. and it runs beautifully, a first for a gta game on pc. if you were holding off getting this because of past experiences, worry no more, this is optimized and rocking it ;) what are you waiting for? go buy it already.",4
"so what are u expecting here morons? go buy it now you fxcking fxcks!!!!!! chop/chop",3
"-5/10 this is such a fail, i had bought this in febuary expecting all this hype and how good it was on ps3 to live up to it... then it relesed. having the rockstar social hub thing as a mandatory for both multiplayer and single is 1t as most people cant play because of it and they relesed a more broken pice of crap then grass sim or goat sim but hey, want to stare and a scocial hub loading? be my guest pay 40 for this game..... i stand by this even when its fixed as they should of gitten gud and had bata testors or somthing",1
"what can i say , it runs so smooth it plays so damned well on max settings on the gtx titan i did really like the 2715 resolution until the update put its highest res 1920,1080 but other than that 11/10",4
"crashes after i sign in to social club 0/10 piece of  till further notice",2
"finally come to pc, how can you not play this game. run smooth and well optimized 10/10",3
"if youve played grand theft auto v on consoles, then you wont be disappointed. if you havent, youre in luck because this is indeed the definitive version. in my opinion, rockstar have done a wonderful job developing the game for pc. it was well worth the wait. the amount of graphical options means you can tweak the game to how you like it, especially if youre limited by hardware. the addition of the rockstar editor is just he icing on the cake. you may not be pleased with the price point due to when the game was released, but think of it as a brand new game being released in 2015 (because its that good).",2
"after waiting for so long for gta v out, realise that gta v is not really that fun. get bored easily",1
"while i was frustrated with rockstar at first for delaying this game for so long. everything was forgiven when i powered it up. it has been optimized extremely well for pc, even with my outdated gtx 660 i can run it on medium - high settings and it looks great! i havent had any crashes or annoying bugs (so far) , so all i can say is, well done rockstar.",1
"good port from my experiences so far. be sure to update drivers right away. went from 20 fps stuttering to a solid 60 fps after doing so. controls are a little strange, but use a controller or custom keybindings to fix it.",1
"20/10 why gta 5 is the best 1 the graphics 2 the map 3 multiplayer 4 invest money in storymode 5 do activites :d",2
"i raced 3 other dudes on a bicycle while giving them the middle finger from the front all the way. 11/10 would get raepd at the end again.",1
"everything is bigger and better in gta v. rockstars love, effort and attention to detail they put into gta are qualities unmatched by other developers and is the main highlight of the series. online still seems to be having some connectivity issues but that should be fixed in the not too distant future. the pc port this time is spot on.",1
"best go to game when you have nothing else to play. 10/10",3
"respect is everything. yes rockstar respects gamers. wonderfull graphics, fluid gaming, great story, first person shooter!!! 9.8/10 (i have already played the ps version)",3
"i waited so long for this game...and i was always wondering if it would even be worth it or if the game would suck...i was wrong, the game looks amazing, its fast, 60fps looks great and joining games is amazingly fast :d i would rate 10/10 would bang all hookers again.",2
"headache of a game to get working, my pc is not a toaster, the launcher still dont work tried everything, even cutting off my scrotum for sacrifice",2
"from the forums: friendly reminder of how moderation usually works: (order of events) 1. people make many threads discussing the same topic. 2. moderators merge all similar threads. 3. forums maintain some semblance of order. 4. people go into a rambling, confused tirade about free speech (forgetting that this is a private forum) and censorship before hitting the post history link on the right hand side of the page and locating their posts. there are redirects to inform users where the threads were merged to, however. during events (such as release, patches, updates, promotions, etc.) we forego redirects since we would get 2/3rds of the page fill with redirect links. tl;dr. we do not censor posts. before creating a new thread, check if there is already one discussing your topic. similar threads get merged. rockstars mods are great, sensible people and the only people whining about the game are people who dont understand the rules.",2
"love this game since it was released on ps3 its like san andreas but more graphical",3
"so good. even on a made in china-quality laptop like mine 10/10",1
"after playing gta 5 on ps3 and ps4 the pc version is probably the best one out of three.",1

"i cant even play gta v is anyone having this problom",1
"me and a lot of people with nvidia gc cant play the game. rockstars does nothing about it.",1
"game runs extremely well on fully maxed out graphics. im also using fairly outdated equipment. ive probably spent a good 4-5 hours alone running over peoples cats.",2
"robbed a liquor store and then drove off into the sunset to fortunate sun playing on the radio. 6/10",2
"writing this review to help the overall rating go up. the game works fine, and the people who cant start it probably dont have good enough pcs. if its social club, then wouldnt we all be having a social club problem?",2
"please make a option for 30 frames per second in the game just as a option please",1
"i actually got this game to work everytime ,but its just where i felt like the gameplay was flawed for atleast me i actually got bored of both online and single-player, but luckily i could get a refund so thats good.",1
"crashes every 5 seconds but for the five seconds it dose work it runs smothly so... buy at your own risk",3
"quite possibly the single worst purchase i have ever made.",1
"pros: its gta, do whatever you please makes you feel super baller in a game campaign story is great first person totally feels like a new game cons: its rockstar, always cons with rockstar.",2
"it is very fun. i just wish people didnt suck at the heists so much.",3

"the tennis mini-game is better than actual tennis simulation games... 10/10 two games in one!",2
"who releases a game three times and smashes records doing it? rockstar. simply put, gta v is the kind of game you will always leave installed and play a few hours a week. remember tony hawks games? i always left it in my playstation just because i knew when i wanted to play games, thats the first one id start with. thats exactly that kind of game. i bought it two times, and never looked back on any seconds of it. more than 300 hours on playstation, and im starting it all over again just because of how amazing this game is. get it now! whoever doesnt take the time to enjoy this masterpiece dont deserve to be a gamer.",3
"just bought the game and ran it. curious - you cant family share this game, like any other. pretty crappy to not have a notification of that.",1
"i waited 6 years for the next pc grand theft auto, and after a 12 hour install and $60.00, i still cannot play it because despite the several month delay, they still couldnt fix their game. good work, rockstar. i wouldnt recommend this game until rockstar can fix all of the game-breaking bugs. lots of people can get into the game, but theres a chance you may not be so lucky, and its not worth the headache to wait for this monster to install and then hope your game is prefect, or hope your specific problem has a fix and it actually works.",2
"hookers, strippers, naked cultists, whats not to like?",5
"i dont like how you made that lvl 1s can buy a rocket launcher that follows your chopper. so annoying, but then they cant buy smgs because thats lvl 5???? wheres the logic?!",3
"at the moment the console version is better there is alot of issues. i have never once played without some sort of issue. its either a graphic error, the game minimizing and not opening, randomely freezing but i can still hear sounds around me, or it wont even launch. 2 years and the only thing different is the number of players and the graphics its kinda dissapointing atm.",2
"i had trouble with my grapihcs card at first, but then i got it to work. all i had to do was enable it when it was loading. anyway, game is great 11/10",3
"i rly love this game but i hope that i can buy ingame money in steam pls make this <3",2
"is this game fun and funny in its own regard? yes is it annoying as hell to try to get into a lobby with friends and do . hell yes connection issues are complete and utter , game is fun but online with friends is terrible. until they fix the connection issues i cant give a positive review.",4
"very well optimisation ! ( but you have to activate vsync, unless, lot of tearing ) great work from rockstar games ! about gameplay and game... gta v !!!! buy it now !!!",1
"im running this game on an asus g751 laptop with a 970m with a mix of very high/high settings and it looks and runs great! for me, at the time of this review, windows borderless does seem to cause jitter so keep that in mind if you want to use that setting.",2
"simple. if you havent played gtav then you should.",4
"great game good buy for once. must get if you havent gotten it i pre order mine and was able to play it on launch day after a little online update install and such but yea must get.",3
"everyting has now changed since i last wrote this review amd have came out with a driver (15.4 beta) i would suggest downloading it if you have amd gpu or cpu it helps alot with your fps i went from 18 fps in the main city to now having a sold 60 fps. (i still wont recommend amd tho) everything else with the game is just great! apart from the fact they have have made modding very hard which sucks. over all i would recommend this game to anyone or everyone!",2
"real life simulator v9.201.7 too good to be true. 10/10",3
"i can not load it up on my pc can anyone help me i have tryed just about everthing i can think of????",4
"been waiting for this game since 2013. and all i could say is it was worth the wait. ;)",2
"i remember that i accidently dropped my xbox 360 with the gta v disc in it. the disc broke and i couldnt play anymore. so i waited for pc. when i finnaly knew that it will came to april the 14th i was so excited. just the hype from the xbox 360 release. i really like this game, the graphics are amazing. it couldnt be better. i will continue to play this game and continue to enjoy it.",2
"great pc port no problem with ultrawide moniter and seems well optimiseed gtx 970 = max settings but looks great online seems a bit broken atm but thats expected",4
"i have a beast of a pc. 10k score on 3d mark. this game is unplayable even in the lowest graphics settings. something is just wrong with it, even after the recent patches.",1
"i have to say the dual graphics issue is really a big problem to me.",4
"you can do everything you imagine. i played golf, went shopping. sky dived, and had a couple of casual encounter with a few different professional sex giver. i ran a bunch of red lights, about 30 hit and runs and made it in time to the beach to ride the ferris wheel. love this game!!",1
"like the developers said, gta 5 on pc is basically ultimate edition. -beautiful graphics (if you got the right graphics card) -awesome gameplay, even for returning players -first person -rockstar editor mode which allows you to play as multiple characters that were originaly npcs (non playable characters) and you can use rockstar editor mode to, you guessed it, make videos! -online can have 30 players instead of 16 (i think 16?) -character customization for online is much more unique and fun -you may transfer your characters from online if you had older versions of gta 5 -who doesnt want to play gta 5 on their desktop? biggest dissapointment is that you cannot play offline. if you have horrible internet that shuts off ocasionally, do not buy this game. buy better internet first. trust me though, the game is well worth the money, even if you have to spend more on internet and possibly a better graphics card, its a very very good game. and this is coming from somebody who has already played the game for almost 2 years on console. overall, 8.7/10 sucks that you need a pricey graphics card to run on full graphics, and i wish we could play it offline :(",1
"i get lag sometimes other wise the game is great 10/10",1
"i tried to move over to a wall on the building to climb over, but instead i turned and leapt off the roof. 10/10, would learn control system again",4
"amazing, perfect, couldnt recommend the gameplay experience more.",2
"the console peasents will never be able to see true 1080p 60 fps glory of the pc masterrace. 8/8 will play again",2
"no more need for friends, family, or pets. my virtual life has finally gone sentient. farewell outernet, you sucked anyway.",4
"figured out how to launch it, turns out the driver update specifically made for the game causes the launcher to crash. but forget that, still cant play it. rockstars sh*t tier drm couldnt stop my key from being stolen. guess ill be staring at the social club screen instead of playing the game. nice job rockstar, glad to see you have your priorities straight.",3
"good bye social life.... i fall in love with the classic blista compact...",4
"my game keeps crashing when i try to play online, it keeps telling me that the game has closed unexpectly. always happens when im starting a mission or going in my apt. plz fix it or i want a refund",1
"oh baby that is one optimized port. also the game is really good. mods.",2
"i played this game for the xbox 360, and i can tell you that this is a huge advancement from the 360. the game looks absolutely beautiful, even with normal textures. adding very high shader settings definitely makes a difference. my only problem with this game is that the game crashes every 30 minutes to a hour. i do not know why. hopefully the next patch fixes it.",1
"game caused me frustration. updated gpu drivers, hit cancel, ran driver removal, had to reinstall os due to driver install not canceling and removal corrupting driver. then that night tried a system image restore, next day still not done....reinstalled os. everything updated finally got to play the game after going through the intro sequence 3 times, 10/10 would crash pc again!",4
"this game is ing awesome, but its glitchy and the players are s/trolls. its also already got hackers in it, mostly just people getting infinite money and rp which i really dont give a  about, however i found out some are doing much more when my tank was instantly blownup from an smg shot (im scared what the future holds if this is already here). the glitched are pretty bad too, i have had issues with everything from crahing and getting achievements i didnt do (i have the lvl 100 achiev and im lvl 71..) all the way to being white screened for eternity during heists and being forced to restart. even with all this ery, im still having fun, the game is still a ing blast and ill continue to play it i reccomend this game but please understand the games current state before you purchase.",3
"i was quite dissapointed, there wasnt an easter event? i was hoping for easter eggs that explode, with guts and blood flying everywhere because the baby chick is still inside, 0/10. wheres the bunny ear inflated bumper karts? i wanted to race in giant bunny ears that explode into blood and guts on impact, and causing you to be mauled by mutant bunny rabbits. and bunny strippers, playboy mansion doesnt count. bad rockstar, i wanted to be appeasing to the furry crowd. now i have to use deviantart, /sigh.",4
"best game ever. i never say this before about another game. i got it on xbox, but pc is pc! 10/10 true grand theft auto fan.",2
"ran over civies in a truck in first-person while listening to backstreet boys on the radio. 11/10 would want it that way",3
"well i dont really know how to right good reviews but i can tell you this much, it runs good. with a i5 4670 and gtx 760 i can run this game at all very high settings 1920x1080 at 60 fps.",2
"worth to wait,worth to play,worth to buy! very light and optimized games now we must waiting 2 years more for red dead redemption on pc :d",2
"immediately i disliked the bug causing me not to be able to log in, the launcher wouldnt launch and it wasnt an issue with my windows username. after repeatedely clicking play, it eventually started. coming from consoles i can tell you the graphics are smooth and gorgeous! (much better than console which is gritty-360) the fps gameplay is definitely immersive, this game is worth the $60. not only will the story take you long enough, but going online just adds an infinite amount of additional gameplay hours. play by yourself, with a friend, or a stranger and youll have a great time!",1
"best game ever!...except for the random lag spikes on 80fps :/",4
"ok finally works now:-) cant wait to play and post a good comment",3
"this game looks so much better on the pc then on the xbox 360 i played on while i was waiting for pc release. its all the little things that make this game amazing and the time and effort they spent on the story making the characters so great together and online isnt bad either. in my opinion its one of the best games ever made. i just wish there were more games like this one",3
"if this game was a cake i would rub it all over my self",2
"works incredibly well, both for offline and online.",4
"after playing 1.5 hours, i have already gotten 2 s to have sex with franklin in stolen cars and then proceeded to brutally kill them both and get my money back this is the best porn simulator on the market",1
"its ok. its not worth $60 wait for it to go on sale. the driving gets old fast and the online is not that good. the size of the world is impressive and the voice acting is really good.",1
"only preordered to have more money for the stripclub. it was totaly worth it. 10/10",4
"i am having a good time with this game. i think its much better optimized for pc than gta iv. i am having some framedrops but i am damn happy to be in los santos. my hardware is a gtx 570 ,a phenom ii x4 965 be 3,4ghz and 8gb ram. its not the newest but still manage to get between 30-60fps at middle/high options. the story is nice, loads of sideactivitys, a lot of stuff to do and i am looking forward to gta online. but first i will play the story ofc. what i also like is that there is actually a graphic difference between the console versions and the pc. if you have a good pc you can make gta v really damn beautiful. will update the review soon... death to all pirates!",5
"looks good. i dont thinck their is anything wrong,",2
"i cant even get on the game i click play it *loads* and then nothing happens my name on steam even goes green to show im playing the game but then goes blue again if anyone can help me with this please add me",2
"the launcher crashes instantly, meaning that almost 3 days after launch i still cant play. it also has nothing to do with the windows username problem",1
"10/10 amazing to play this game @60 fps. only problem is that the game crashes frequently. hopefully rockstar will patch this in the future. :d",1
"still a little buggy around places, some missions  up. sometimes my screen just goes black and i have to restart. but, it just got released, so i cant blame it..",2
"r* has out done themselves with this one, first person is done amazingly well, that to me third person feels weird but, it still has its usefulness while limited, the game can be played perfectly fine in first person without having to swap to third person. im running an r9 280(aka 7950 rebranded) heavy oc, an i5-4690k minor oc, and 8gb 1600mhz ram, 1080p is silk smooth on max settings, but 5760x1080 cant really get over 30fps but thats okay, since im only running one gpu, and im mostly using it for screenshotting the amazingness of gta v :) like most the player base, ive had an amazing experiance thus far and highly recommend this game to anyone.",3
"the game is great, but issues overwhelm and im not able to enjoy it properly at the state its in. pop-in is ridiculous, fps drop is like a rollercoaster.",2
"this game rocks so much that i wanna be straight again. 10/10",5
"been waiting for the pc version from ages and its finally here and its runs awesome on 4k with 30+fps...",1
"not too much to say. optimised perfectly. lag free. amazing game. great online & solo.",2
"this game sucks............. u gotta be kidding me. :d",2
"10/10 amazing first person and thrid person. this game just shows many possibilities that can come to this game!",3
"played this game on the xbox 360, i am halfway through the story, but my free live gold ran out, i cant port over my story save. great game overall",3
"as a person who has never played gta before. this is all i could ask for. the controls are great and easy to get used to. so many ways to customize your character from clothing to tatoos to facepaint. you can play alone or with friends online for more fun and points. my only complaint is that there is only one location to play on. even so this is the golf game pc gamers have been waiting for and deserve. hole in one/10",5
"just another open world rpg. only 3 classes that are almost the same and also have predefined races that cant be changed. skills level up by doing stuff like running. there is a main story line and a couple of side quests. but no boss fights, only trash mobs the whole game. you can buy a lot of items, but they dont have stats. weapons are mostly ranged and you will get in trouble using melee only. theres only one kind of armor that isnt even visible on the character. good thing so far, there are a lot of different mounts to ride. some of them can also fly but are destroyed quickly if you collide with the level geometry. setting could be interesting if youre bored with fantasy.",1
"pretty good, but it feels like an unfinished port. i recommend buying on a later date.",2
"grand theft auto 5, well.. first of all its a brilliant game even for being two years old on the consoles, its definatley worth the purchase, if you have a couple of friends too, this game becomes too fun! i have spent too many hours laughing really hard that my jaw starts to ache. so yes, i highly recommend this game! so the downsides to gta v on the pc that i have found so far. unexpected game crashes - yes i have the latest drivers. random fps drops.. that could be just me but for some reason my game runs at a nice and steady framerate then all of a sudden drops to 1-3 for like 4 seconds and then straight back to normal. final bad point that i can think of, the servers, even though a couple of my mates and myself have a decent connection, we still find that they are bouncing all over the roads when doing races. the same for ai traffic too! overall, i rate this game a 8/10 and would highly recommend buying this game.",2
"when i start the game it loades a few seconds then says gta v has stopped working i can play but if i disable the graphics rockstar you really disappointed me please fix",1
"this game is everything i expected it to be! fantastic story, gameplay, amazing multiplayer and much more! totally worth the 60$",1
"the game is fun as well as the controls being easy to learn also im suprised my 15 inch retina (nivida 750m) could run the games in 1080p 60fps in ultra... very pleased",2
"first day had a few hickups as you would expect. but really came together and is rockin. love this game",3
"- newbie to the gta series - the only gta game i ever played was the very first one that came out in 1997 on pc. i decided to buy this one due to all the hype and the much talked about graphics improvements. i have never been this satisfied paying $59.99 for a game ive barely knew anything about - much less played. the level of detail put in this game is amazing. everything from the graphics to the story line, truly impressive. this is the type of game that you dont have to worry about completing in a day. i am looking forward to playing this game for many months. there are small issues here and there that i noticed as far as bugs in the game but i anticipate they will be fixed in the near future. if you are on the fence about this game, i definitely recommend it. as a newbie to the series, i am glad i pulled the trigger on this one. funny acting, great story line, impressive graphics, tons of missions, awesome online multiplayer and it will push your high end card(s) to the limit. 9/10",4
"great game, very well optimized and runs smoothly on my rig on ultra settings.",4
"if your mainly interested in the online play then wait for a few patches. if your using ati gfx card then dont bother till they roll out the patch. but if you do get it right now then make sure you are wearing a top hat. it seems the hitbox on the head isnt working when its worn.",1
"im taking a vacation for next week, buying a lot of food and let myself completely pull in the game!",2
"so far greatest title of the greatest game series of all time. -best content-for-money ratio -open-world par excellence -diverse multiplayer (unlike iv) -framerate friendly -new mechanics (skill & level system, main chars) -so many little improvements -ost what i hope for in the planned dlcs: - more multiplayer modes & customization options - bring back ken rosenberg! - lets ship it out to pc players first this time gta is like beethoven. you cant dislike beethoven.",3
"my desktop broke down a week before this game came out sent it in for repairs, though not coming back anytime soon. tried running it on my laptop and 10 frames a second. gg. see ya in like a month gta v",1
"in a world where rockstar can make a game work on launch...... this is not that world",1
"great game, the campaign is typical gta style if you are firmiliar with the other titles published in the genre, steal some drugs, do some heists yada yada... the online is where it picks up speed pretty heavily with many interactive missions, tasks, and even things such as golfing and tennis against other players! many hours of fun are easily capable of being put into this game!",2
"gta v is a must own for any pc gamer.. its just that good period 10/10",3
"it does not work. i bought this game in january with a promise of a march release. lie #1 i was told that it would be delayed until today to make certain that the game is perfected. lie #2. i called rockstars customer service well within their hours of 7:00 am est and midnight est and got a recorded message stating that they are closed, and listed the hours. lie #3. how do i get a refund?",1
"as long as you install the newest drivers youll love everything; unless of course you dont like the game and in such a case you are wrong,",3
"for most this game is probably better than console but on my  pc its just a bit worse 11/10 would wait 2 years again",2
"bought this game 4 times. worst game ever played 11/20",3
"overall the game is good but there are a lot of crashes, i hope to fix it recommend buying",2
"never really played any of the gta series but after playing gta v for 5 mins i am now a convert. massive sandbox of glourious graphics littered with characters of real depth , recommended 100% :)",2
"great game, runs like any modern pc game, clearly not a port tons of graphic options and custom settings you can change, graphics look great even on medium so far no problems the gta we waited for is finally here :d",1
"this game should be renamed grand theft loading screen. its great when its not loading.",2
"the multiplayer matchmaking is absolute garbage. be prepared to spend 80% of your time in this game either loading, finding a free roam session with people actually in it, and looking for players for your game lobby. the best part is when someone disconnects from your heist and you have to start the process all over again... what the . it can take up to 20 minutes to start a mission that only takes 5 minutes to complete. pros: + fun when it works, that 20% of the time + looks good, runs very well cons: - random disconnects from free roam modes, putting you in your own session alone - takes absolutely ing forever to find people to play with - if someone disconnects from your heist, you must start the process all over - loading screens can sometimes take up to 4 minutes (on an ssd!!) the hardest part about this game is not being able to play.",2
"only the uttermost skilled players will join your heist and ofc they wont die at all after 5 secs in the game.. 3/4 would play again. quite funny, isnt it? game of morons award 2015 approved.",2
"this is the best video game since sliced bread. this is the best bread since that toast i ate at waffle house last week. sometimes you are the cop, but this time.. you are the gun.",3
"do not buy this for single player. the gameplay is incredible (as we all know), but theres this glitch where i cant go past 24% (give or take) completion. ive looked up solutions for this and found forum posts from 2 years ago complaining about the same thing. rockstars fix is to start a new save file from the begining. i did this, and (after another 6 hours of replaying content) it still didnt work. single player is unplayable. youd think that around 2 billion dollars in revenue is enough to fix a glitch, but i guess not.",2

"a woman asked for my help getting back a stolen wallet. i agreed to assist only to be led into a back alley and cornered by 5 armed guys who killed me. she said she was sorry though, as they started shooting. 10/10 would help again.",4

"yes rockstar you did it! my laptop with amd radeon graphics and intel graphics wont start the game for like forever! thats what weve been waitting for!",1
"24 hrs, no patch. have the missing .exe file many have so the game doesnt even load. avoid.",2
"i pre-ordered 2 months ago, installed game on the release date, started game, game asked for cd key i used it and it said its already used. im not the only one who has this problem, i see loads of people complaining about this on twitter and rockstar doesnt care.. 10/10 wouldnt waste money again..",1
"the wait was worth it, if you like the style of game, have a decent gaming rig, and can spare 50 bucks, buy it!",2
"havent had a single problem, everything runs smooth on 8 gb ram, i7 4770k@3.5 ghz and msi r9 280x. the game is well optimized. unfortunately, i can see that there are many people who cant launch this game because of some problems with social club. hope that it can be fixed soon. we know everything else about this game, so ill just make a quick conclusion - like i said, i havent had a single problem, so i definitely recommend this game, especially if you havent already played it on consoles.",2
"i had this game on the ps3 and ps4. i have to say i thought the ps4 was a huge change from the ps3 version. now i have the pc version and it looks absolutly beautiful. i really recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the gta series.",1
"have no words for this. something this big and beautiful is newer seen before in video games.",3
"this game is amazing. walked down the street, saw a dog, walked up to the dog, got hit by a truck. 10/10 would get distracted on a busy highway again",4
"well, a got a bad luck and i think all this great dev should be more attencious about their games before their let it availible. i got a issue with the game launch and, yes, i did all the steps trying to fix something that i couldnt. to be more specific, my issues were: 1- i cant launch the first screen ( social club ), when i thought it would works it crash. 2- my serial was duplicated. 3- it was missing one .exe file on the folder and i couldnt execute it as admin. 4- i play on laptop and i read that almost every laptop users got problems with the game. therefore, my negative reviem is just because i couldnt got to play it and it was kind of frustrating to not be able to play with my other friends... now im the black sheep of my friends group (lol). for those who bought the game and it doesnt works as well, you can reclaim your money if you want. i did it and when the devs launch a fix i would buy it again.",1

"best optimized game ever! my specs gtx 670m with i7 3610qm and i got my 1080p 60fps experiance. well done rockstar! thanks for this masterpiece.",3
"rockstar promised to give us a smooth launch. they took two years to make the pc version, and hell, they even delayed the game three or four f****ing times on top of that. my high end gaming pc handles mostly everything in max setting so i was expecting nothing less with this game. instead ive had fps drop from 60-40~ and sometimes from there to 20~. i cant stand this stuttering and those fps drops, so im a bit disappointed with how this turned out. i suppose im lucky i even got to launch the game at all, since people seem to be having issues with that. in this current state i cannot recommend this game. p.s i will update my review once rockstar releases another patch.",3
"if you are planning to play this offline single player because of inconsistant web acces, or, for whatever reason do not buy this game.. an internet connection is required to start single player offline.",2

"if you dream of killing innocent civilians, hookers, dealers, and more, then this is the game for you!",3
"its with a heavy heart i have to give gta v a bad review - for now. i, like many other laptop users with mobile graphics cards, are experiencing crashing issues nonstop that has completely ruined the experience. story mode, i get a crash roughly every 5-10 loading screens, online (the main reason i bought the game), i get a crash every loading screen so i havent gotten to play it yet at all. i also randomly get crashes on startup. its really a bummer. im a poor college kid so when i spend 60 on a game its a huge deal to me. its a bigger deal when i spend that 60 and i cant play the game. aside from that, the game is really excellent, and when this issue is resolved and i can play the game i will edit this review to reflect the true nature of the game. however, because i cant play the game for more than a half hour at a time before i experience a crash, i cant recommend this game to anyone, especially laptop users who use mobile graphics cards. from what ive read, rockstar doesnt have a fix for these issues pending just yet so save your money and buy when you know youre going to be able to actually play the game and get the experience you paid for.",1
"my god rockstar has done it , they redeemed themself from the awfull port of gta 4 , and made a beutiful propper gta v ! 11/10 , will have no life fir the next few months",2
"gta in first person is the most immersive experience i have ever had. i even, stopped a couple of times noticing how real this really seemed. the single player is the samme but hey it was amazing the first time around, and im ready to go at it again. online felt a bit weird at first, public server to me are really boring, get missions with people driving everywhere like , jumping out of the car, shooting at nothing, not giving a f*** about objectives. so that really cut my immersion and made me think about this online thing but then again found somme good buddies and i play with them for real fun coop heists and stuff. i dont have to tell you how beautiful this game is, i run it at a steady 60 fps with max settings, it runs smooth as ever. no bugs no crash no nothing simply perfection. best pre-released purchase ive ever got.",2
"broken, only managed to play prologue before it refused to load anything at all. biggest waste of money ever.",1
"id like to thank the console peasants for their extended beta testing of this game. its amazing.",2
"11/10 great performance. most advanced game ever played",2
"should have waited for the end of the semester to install... goodbye grades.",2
"as a person who liked ivs driving i am a little dissappointed with this. :( why do cars not flip when rammed? do they have glure on there wheels when braking and turning? also, where is the deformation? rckst* pls apart from that the game looks really really really gud",4
"very good game. fun open world online. make sure u have friends.",3
"hello....? steam cloud would be great for this game!",2

"grand theft auto v runs like a champ. looks like a king. plays like a god. worth every penny.",3
"many  have social club issues but i dont give a sh*t , just suit myself , the game works great , 15/10 p/s: pls gabe , add gta v trading card , i want it really bad",3
"its so weird, if you are one of those 1/4 of all the players where the game does not want to stop crashin. -> bought the game -> issues with social club. (unable to start gta v, please reinstall) ===> keep in mind, reinstalling takes about 14-18 hours via steam -> didnt reinstall, restarted the pc 3 times then it worked for a few minutes -> played online crashin every 10-30 minutes -> found out that u r able to see statistics. how many player killed, time played, time for every session ===> average time spend per session: 20 minutes ===> i like the idea that rockstar has statistic how often my game crashes per hour and its obviously every 20 minutes ===> when u play heists which sometimes take 2 hours with 4 players in the game, u begin to cry uncontroled and fapping at the same time when ur game crashes tip for the crashers if your game crashes permanently: change graphic direct x 11 to direct x 10 and put off fxaa and mxa. then my game only crashes every 1 - 3 hours. actualy social club is offline so 6/10 for this game because i even keep on playin when its crashin every 20 minutes then i begin fapping and crying",4
"bought this game, now 15 hours in im a legitimate a.",1
"have some problem with social club, have to disable graphics card in device manager to get the game work. but beside that the game itself is very good port. run very smooth, high setting 1080p. this is gta v for pc you watting for. 9/10 recommended.",3
"steam removed my game from my library what should i do",1
"best game crash simulator 2015. in all seriousness, i loved this game on console when it first came out and ive been waiting for its release on pc as long as anyone else. after playing a little bit of the game however, seeing its amazing graphics, it crashed, and now all it does it crash on startup. i know its not my computer, because no matter what settings i put it on it has the same problem. youd think since they made us wait so long that it would work on release. guess this is what we should all expect for 2015. ill change this once they fix it, which im sure they will. but when 25% of people whove bought the game cant play it, thats pretty sad :/",2
"just simply amazing, i do not care how long it took them to bring this out for pc its just so good, it runs smooth on my pc and its a mid range gaming pc, it plays well, and all the in game options like menues and game play is smooth as foooook gun fights are fun so much to do, its gta!!! again really good game, should pick it up!",2
"if you have a decent gaming pc and dont buy this game. you are ing .",4
"first time i ran this game, i tried the benchmark.. and failed. /10 would fail benchmark again",3
"fu_ck this game with its bugss ! - u get the car upgrade it put it in ur garage and u dont find it on the next log in.. u see ur old cars wich u sold long time ago... i lost minimum 200k with these bugs without taking into consideration wasted time.. - those insanly long loading screens... problems with joining with your crew members to the same server... and so on and on and on.. and u fu_ckers sell game for 60 eur while this game is in beta stage !!! fu !!!",4
"its gta, the latest version, ported beautifully to pc with its full glory. no more words are needed.",2
"in simple way, bad reviews are only from peepz who can play only solitaire on windows. i have never problem with this game from when we can start it. good optimized for old pcs like my. serious review comming later. watch less porn and ur pc will be ok.",2
"solid optimization! the game runs and feels great. i havent played this since it originally came out.... i loved it then..... and now i love it even more now! good job rockstar 10/10 <3",2
"eh... just - no. at this point, the game keeps causing bsods that i havent seen in years. my spec is way above the recommended hardware requirements and even if i get it to run for 5min its always fixed at 30fps for a few minutes before causing another bsod.",1
"awesome game. well optimized. a few bugs here and there (specially with some people). for me it worked like a charm, only a bit glitchy in a few missions. overall awesome game, graphics are top notch. everyhing else is like gta v on ps4/xbone, story/online/haist is just an awesome experience. glad to see this game well optimized for pc.",2
"amazing port. an even better, yet rather unchanged expierence as compared to console. nonetheless, if you are a gta fan, this port over is a 10/10.",3
"welp, its brilliant. its gta v, excellently ported, running smooth as silk on pc. plenty of scalable options, no issues at all. not much else to be said. this game is a stunning technical achievement and an instant classic.",2
"i played a heist with my friend and he died at the very end making us restart it all 12/9 meth addict rednecks",2
"59.1 gb biggest game ever 11/10 over rated get it eh-eh-eh",3
"well worth the wait. the graphics are amazing and even on launch day, the game was one of the most stable ive ever played. i have everything on high (2600mb/2000mb vram usage) and i pretty much get a solid 60fps. this game is beautiful and fun. im just sad that san fierro and las venturas arent in it. perhaps well see some dlc or mods.",2
"perfect game! it runs so smooth, im even more in love with it than when it came out for the consoles! :o :d <3",3
"im not able to play gta online because im not able to advance from the chracter create menu. after entering the characters name im not able to click on accept if i press the return key it will not advance. this game is bugged and there is literally no one who has reported the same issue. i tried all common sense things like updating my grahpics drivers and even trying to use another keyboard, launched the game in debug mode and even tried going through windowed mode. it will not work, the menu will always get bugged at this screen. this games biggest feature is unplayable for me therefore i cannot recommend the game i would like to get a refund for my purchse but i dont think i will get one.",1
"i get 60fps but i need the graphics at very low settings. besides that, no issues, got the driver. yeah get the game.",5
"rockstar support is amazing, they supported me all my items back and made me feel like a loyal client, thank you rockstar and the great lady who supported me keosha_m is the best!",3
"someone stole my car in the game oh no, got a message on my phone, my car was impounded didnt matter, i stole another car to get home.",1
"i think gta 5 shuts down the debate. optimization is top notch, everybody can play it. well the rest you know haha.",2
"ive always been a big fan of rockstar. they are my favorite developer. that being said i have bought this game 3 times, and it is well worth it in my opinion. i bought this on ps3, xbox one, and now pc. ive been waiting for a pc release since the game was announced in the beginning. this has to be one of the best games i have ever bought because even after around 100 hours on the ps3 version, 40 hours on the xbox one version, and with the above amount on the pc version i still find that this game does and will have a bunch of replayability for years to come. and for the sake of the race: 4k 60fps or die",2
"shiit just got real awesomemest game so far by rockstar lol !!!!!!!!",2
"hello, i am currently 15 years old and i want to become a walrus. i know theres a million people out there just like me, but i promise you im different. on december 14th, im moving to antartica; home of the greatest walruses. ive already cut off my arms, and now slide on my stomach everywhere i go as training. i may not be a walrus yet, but i promise you if you give me a chance and the support i need, i will become the greatest walrus ever. if you have any questions or maybe advice, just inbox me. thank you all so much ~~",1
"xbox 360,ps 3/alpha xbox one,ps 4/beta pc/full its all what do you need know about gta series",3
"not one single regret spending money on this game -- rockstar killed it with gta:v!",3
"edit: i installed windows 7 service pack 1. after installation, i booted up gta v again and it worked. this game is amazing. steady 60 fps, the graphics are way better than the xbox one and ps4. this version is truly superior and it was totally worth the wait. 10/10 would kill hookers in first person again attention to anyone having social club ui has stopped working issues, make sure you have windows 7 sp1 installed and if not then install that and it should work for you.",3
"runs really well and has a good story is a great game all in all.",2
"really good game give it 9/10 but ofcourse its a little buggy at the start like all big games are but its a beautifull and fun game.",2
"godly graphics even with my not so top notch pc. really rate this game. 21/10 xd",2
"had this game on the 360 great game was happy its out for the pc as the graphics on it are amazing its a big download but its worth the wait for it!",1
"ive been trying to fix the game for 3 days now. the social club failed to load due to an incomplete installation (code 16) ^is the error i get, and ive literally done everything there is to try and fix this issue, but it just cannot be fixed. so much for spending 60 euros on a game and not being able to play it. :( i like the game though, 10/10. :)",2
"- visuals, stunning - performance, very impressive (mid range system) - gameplay, super fun, immersive and very very smooth - online games, if latency occurs its handled in the best way possible theres also a huge amount of things to do in stunningly crafted world. gta developers you guys did an excellent job, one of the few games that is worth the wait and the $ not sure why this got 97/100, where are the bonus points? 11/10",2
"dont be fooled. my 1.2 hours played were me trying to sign in to my social club account. 10/10 would get locked out of account again. (in all seriousness it really is a good game as long as you know for sure what your log in is.)",3
"10/10 would press safe mode again! i really enjoy watching friends play a game that i cant play because rockstar has had the best launch days.",1
"grand theft auto are one of my favourite game series. gta v is the best gta game after san andreas, which i loved due to it being my childhood game and being the game to bring new things that year and with a huge map and possibilities. i have played this game both on xbox360 and pc. its amazing. the storyline is amazing, the graphics are great, the pc port is awesome (works smoother than on x360), comparing to gta ivs port (which was  on pc, very bad performance issues). the online is great, as long as you dont play to grind it, and have some friends to play it. anyways, the pc version > console is that theres some new features, and the files were already opened and modding should be available soon, thus we will see some good mods with no doubt. truly a game of the year, for 2015 too.",3
"until the game gets patched and fixed completely, then this rating wont change. once i can actually access and play the game? then well see. just dont buy the game yet, wait until this thing is legitimately playable.",2
"well the game is good and all but it needs patching. mostly because it is frequently dropping fps on an high end card like mine. ( gtx 970) i am sure they will fix it soon though. behind all those flaws its an amazing game.",3
"i cant even play this game, the colours get mad ingame ....",1
"ive never played grand theft auto v in ps3, xbox360 nor ps4, xbox1, and its my first time playing grand theft auto v! i had a lot of fun with it and i think it is really optimized because the graphics is amazing and it still runs good enough.",4
"one of the cleanest pc ports ive seen in a while. gotta love that 60fps.",2
"gameplay: 8/10 the game is good, the graphics are well polished but still has a little of stuttering that can be fixed in the next patch. optimization is ok, not too much as max payne 3 but still is good in these days.",2
"i put 1000 hours in to it on the xbox 360 and have already put 57 hours in to it on pc and its only been out 4 days. on 360 it cost 15 and pc it cost 40. 55 for all those hours of playing this great game thats updated around every 1.5 months. its truly worth buying",4
"dont buy the game at this point! the game is crashing every 5 min. i7 780ti",3
"if i actually get into the game my gta online chracter looks like a barcode. but most of the time i get stuck at a loading screen. the same thing is happeneing to my friends like when it came out with 360, you cant get on because of the servers. i understand things like this happens at the delay of big games but its happened before and they delayed it 3 times to fix bugs. the game should be flawless right now. once all of this gets fixed, it will be a great game.",2
"- cant play - decrypting require additional 60gb of space (good luck for those with 120gb ssd just for gta) - decrypting started 51 minutes ago on ssd - still nothing - another day one premiere and another steam fail update; - decrpyted and... gta stopped working - nothing work on it - plenty of people report same bug gg rockstar&steam update v2; - day and half after release - still no patch from rockstar, not even a word, you need to do fun things with graphic card to be able to play - no word from rockstar. in meantime they announced ifruit app on pc. how wonderful! update v3; - still need to turn off on on graphic card to start game - still no word from rockstar verdict;  you, rockstar",2
"now that finally my game started working (after spending a few hours). i can say that this game is worth every single euro/buck. the graphics are absolutly amazing and a game very well optimized. the story is interesting, more detailed than the story mode on ps3/4 or xbox. the mode online is interesting and fun, consider it the multiplayer playground where everything can happen. this game is, what everyone expected a 9/10 ign rate. until now ive seen no bugs. a very good game to spend some hours playing and great to play with friends. i cant wait to see the mods that are coming. if you are not decided if u should or not buy, i tell you that you should. see you there!",1
"they really pulled this off....im so glade they made so many delays and waited to release this game because they really made it top notch....very hard to find any problem in the game. the game is greatly optimized no mouse lag or acclerater or anything like that. now for the base game the story is awesome and they really did pull off some amazing features with interacting all over the city controlling differnt characters and choices of one another makes all the difference. i rarely highly recommend games but this game i really really highly recommend it a big plus for the pc gaming community, thank you rockstar!",1
"i hate steams rating system... needs to be points based. if i had to choose 0-10, 10 being outstanding id choose a 8. so far ive only played about an 10 hours, and come in with very high expectations. it worked on first launch, no crashes or glitches. i set my graphics to my monitors resolution of 1920x1080 and set several a few items to high, but left most at normal (including textures). i only have an nvidia 570 card so i cant go extreme. i chose to ignore overlimit warnings, and went over the memory allocation slightly. the game still runs perfectly smooth for me so far so i may try increasing a few more settings. with my intel i7 4770k and 16gb ram, running on windows 10 preview x64. ive only played the story mode so far, but so far seems fun in typical gta fashion. ill make a few more reviews as i progress in the game.",1
"wonderful !!!!!!!!!!! it worked just fine !  thank god ",3
"god i ing hate this game, completely lost all social connections because of it. just kidding, i never had a social life to begin with. now seriously, i have a fairly old computer. asus gh73, the specs arent very good but gta is so well optimized, i run at a constant 60fps. its amazing. there are a few random crashes, for instance, i was in first-person and my mate punched me, instant crash. some random crashes such as that will occur, but nonetheless it is definietly worth the time and money that is required in a game like this. i rate a 9/10. once the patches fix all the bugs (if thats possible) itll be a solid 10/10. rockstar done did good.",4
"amazing, everything i have hoped for runs wonderfully.",2
"hands down one of the best games available for 2015. im a three time returing player to this game and the pc version does not let down on its promise. on a good rig youll get lost in the world rockstar have created all over again if youve already played before on any other platform and if youre new to v well youre in for a ride",2
"this game is  right now. i cant run this game with my display adapter enabled so the game runs like . i get around 6 fps when im finally able to get past the half and hour loading screens.",3
"it crashes if i run it with my gt770 m. have to use intel hd... 5 fps is the real !!! 11/10 ign",3
"no matter what i do the game crashes at a certain point in the mission...",2
"maxed out @ 2560x1080 with gtx 780ti pc port done properly. worth the wait.",2
"10/10 i am incredibly impressed by rockstar with the release of this game. after all the first day release issues that many companies have had lately, this game has none. playing beautifully maxed out at 1080p locked a 60fps with no issues. i couldnt ask for better. oh and it looks amazing, console users should be envious. i wish i had a 1440p or 4k to run it to see really how great it can be, but im am very pleased with 1080p. i did notice one issue. when i run msaa there is a pixelization error at the bottom right corner of the screen. a small square . running 2x msi 3g gaming r9 280 in crossfire. also amd released a new crossfire profile for gta v but it doesnt seem to be utilizing both gpus to there max. im only getting about 55% on both. still hugely impressed rockstar!! cant wait to see what modders do to this game.",3
"i have nothing to say about this perfect game. well optimized, great environment atmosphere. this game runs perfectly well on my gtx 880m. i dont really encounter launch issue so i dont know why thats even possible, and whats causing it. p.s.: dont be fooled by the review (by the time of the writing, its mostly positive [79%]). grab it when you have money, you wont regret it by paying the game for full price. if you encounter any issue, you can always ask the support guys whos much better than ea.",3
"best game ever 10/10 stuck in loading screen for 3 straight hours (still hasnt opened) if youre interested if it will ever load add me .",4
"a challenge to even get working, and when it finally works mouse lag makes the game near impossible to play. incredibly unsatisfied by this, and the people at rockstar should be ashamed that they have not fixed these problems yet. screw you i want my money back.",1
"awesome game!! the gameplay is insane!! a lot of fun great story i love the cars and the sounds.",2
"single player game is wonderfull, however, the online component suffers from crippling lag in more places than not. if you have even the mildest of concerns with your online stability, and are only considering this for the multiplayer components, you might want to consider passing....",1
"idiots putting negative review cause they cant play. wait to play the game and then review. idiots. review the game not the poor release which happens with most games.",3
"game of the year 2k15! positive things about the game: everything they fix everything right away great game holy crap they got insanley much things to do in the game you can even watch tv in the game and the programs are great! negativ things: may counter some lag or desync on servers loading can buy in-game money with real money (cheating, no joke. youre just skipping the best part about the game by buying in-game cash) and thats it, i would recommend this game.",4
"many delays, 4 hours trying to get it working - rockstar dont help. $75.00 down the drain and a poor piece of trash. cant believe i pre-purchased this .",4
"launched game, went into graphics settings, set everything on max. started benchmark. loads for 3 minutes or so. benchmark starts playing, hang on, thats not a benchmark, thats the start of the story mode. one second later, camera switches to benchmark scene. a few seconds later, camera switches back to story mode (can hear lady screaming for her life), few seconds later, it switches back to benchmark (where the jet is flying). few seconds later, booooom, slow motion, mission failed message pops up. i click on retry, story mode restarts. i play story mode. right after the part where i loot the vault and shoot the cop in the head, the game blacks out. tried to run benchmark, launched both story mode and benchmark simultaneously. 10/10",4

"bought the game hoping to play the pc version like everybody else. every 10 mins into the game and it crashes and this has been occuring over a few hours straight. waited months for this pc version of the game to be released and all they can give is something that crashes every 10 minutes. gta v is a great game but what is the use if you cant play it properly? royal disaster. thanks for giving such a great gaming experience for our money.",1
"great game overall! pros: - online is great! - story mode is great! - driving is fun. - graphics are outstanding! cons: - loading time is outrageous. - fps spikes while in the city (running on 4gb vram). 9/10",1
"truly amazing. excellent port, i can almost max it out( in 1080). graphics are solid, and gameplay is amazing. controls are top notch, havent had any issues. the game is obviously the same, but pc has better damage, and a first person mode, among the much better graphics. the first person is a huge part of the game. every car interior is different, the lights on the dash function, small dings when you open the door, everything is detailed. the guns you hold in your hand have been redone, looking amazing from a first person perspective. definetely worth the buy, a pc game done right. #pcmasterrace",3

"only bought it so i can see the all-new advanced yoga ball",3
"most people got their game running, and a few dont, its maybe on their side not the game, first time i installed it on launch day its smooth and running, maxxed everything out and i am happy with the result! from 90-120 fps on high and 60-80 fps on ultra/very high, over all i am happy with the game, been playing it since it launched on the 360, money well spent! recommended to all of gamers out there (not for kids tho)",5
"if you have a controller on your computer, you are golden! :) bad things found so far: - very bad vehicle controls with mouse and keyboard (basically unplayable game, if you dont have a controller ... or you arent some kind of masochist who enjoys battling the game controls instead of playing the game) - very bad character movement control in 3rd person mode with mouse and keyboard (1st person is ok!) - you cant sprint in 1st person mode .... whaaat? why? (shift key just doesnt do anything) weird stuff/gfx artifacts: - very weird hair on dogs and people.",1
"amazing! few minor issues at start but now all is good! getting between 60 and 120fps constantly all on very high.",3
"with many good and bad reviews, i though id give my two cents. the game itself preforms very well. the game is nicely optimized for good and bad computers. my computer is not very good, and i can still have just as much fun as anyone else. ive had so much fun in my little playtime, that i know that ill have much more. when people say that the game is not optimized very well, its because they have a  computer. i was suprised by how nicely the game preforms compared to the quality. 10/10",2
"starts online mode. get hit by truck that was chased. 11/10 would waste again.",1
"having put ~150 hours into the 360 version of this game, i can say this is a vast improvement. not only visually, but in the playstyle as well. i see that a lot of people are having issues with the game, and all i can say is that i havent had any issues, and im running on 8 gb of ram and a 750 ti 2gb sc. getting a solid 60 frames on some mid range settings. the technical issues are a big problem, but will surely be fixed within a week of release. rockstar isnt known for their stelar releases, but they usually fix them pretty quick. to those coming from console versions, you will notice better graphics, provided you have a capable pc. to those who have never played the game, oh boy are you in for a treat with this one. this is simply a game you must own, regardless on what platform you play it on. the constant online updates that the devs give adds a nice flare to an already mouthwatering and addictive multiplayer. i give this a 9/10, only off by 1 point because of current technical issues.",3
"blows the console version away. they cannot do on the xbox 360 or crapbox 1 and crapstation 4 what the pc does for this game. rockstar! you the man!!!!! for you console guys who think that is real gaming. buy a pc cause all you are buying with the xbox and playstation are dumbed down pcs they are not even consoles anymore. put the thousands you spend in a console and asseseries and buy the real deal.",3
"definitely worth the 2 years waiting for this game to come out for pc. the first person view is so sweet i ed my pants on the first playthrough of the game. best part is this game is optimized to the max. im only running i5-3570k and hd 7850 which are pretty old but im doing fine on 1080p with 60fps on a mix of high/very high settings. with that being said i would like to give a little shout out to console peasants for beta testing this game. you guys made it much more worth it for pc master race. without your sacrifice, we wont be getting this awesome piece made by rockstar. much love.",2
"i could have played this game when it first released in 2013, but i stuck it out and waited for it to come to pc. two years later and a few delays, but all worth it entirely. the game looks amazing and plays really well. i guess its kinda good that all the bugs were really worked out by the console players so that we could have a bug free experience. im running the game on high settings with a 4790k and a 760 with about 50-60fps. anyway, this is the first game i have ever pre-ordered in my life and i love that i did. also its the first steam game that ive paid full price for and it was definitely worth it. right now i have about 30 hours in and i still havent run out of things to do!",4
"san andreas is back in this fantastic installment to the grand theft auto series. i was actually surprised how realistic and beautiful the game turned out to be. first-person mode makes gta v feel like a completely different game. npc artificial intelligence and interaction had improved dramatically. the plenty of graphical options will make any pc enthusist cream in their pants as tessellation, advanced shadows, txaa, 4k textures and a lot more are available with supreme hardware optimization. animals, bikes, aircraft, side-missions, immersive atmosphere and ambient enviornments make story mode surreal, as gta online provides the most in-depth experience ever seen within the series. aside from some buggy custom keyboard bindings which may or may not be fixed, rockstar has definitely redeemed themselves within the pc community. overall rating: 10 of 10",3
"good game but theres no gfwl so im not sure i can recommend. it really brought the experience together in iv.",4
"i played for six hours straight and couldnt stop laughing while doing so. this game is so much fun.",2
"just formatted my computer and lose all my date ( story mode ). a newbie mistake for that company.",1
"almost impossible for me to say a bad thing about the pc version of gta v. i was worried about buying the game, considering my computer is budget equipment. my main pieces are my evga gtx 750 ti sc, & my amd fx-6100. anyways i bought it, and am very surprised how this game runs on my system. even with all graphics settings maxed, except msaa, & post fx, i still can get 45 fps of course i got the settings lowered to aim for 60. but with the system i got, i cant in anyway say this game runs bad.",5
"i havent seen my friends or socialized since april 14, 2015. thanks for optimizing it for pc and making it the best game right now and also thank you console users for beta testing the game.",1
"now i can play without that black annoying rasta from gta 4,good job rockstar games gta 5 ruleees.",3
"i run out of a truck jump onto a bus from a bridge, i grab my grenade launcher, i fire it into a helicopter then i jump off the bus, i run like a madman for the last copy of gta v on the release date, i jump onto a train and escape the military. 10/10 would blow up a poodle that would cause the army to come.",3
"it doesnt take much to know theyve just done it right. well done, rockstar. a true masterpiece that will raise my entertainment yet lower my success rate irl! 42/10 - would definitley destroy all my life oppertunities again.",3
"windos 7 professional 64 bit, geforce gtx 970 4gb ftw, amd fx(tm)-8320 eight core processor, 2x8 = 16gb ram gta 5 runs really smooth with nearly maxed out video settings. i noticed some of the same bugs that the ps3 and ps4 have on the pc version. i had trouble downloading gta 5 for my pc since i kept getting a error disk space. i had over 120gb free even though it only recommends having 65gb. while the game was downloading & updating it was using over 100gb space on installing. once it installed and updated, i still had over 50gb. i recommend this game for any one with high specs & enough memory drive ;d",1
"imma let you finish but gta v is one the best ports of all time... one of the best ports of all time!! it was totally worth the wait for a better version after playing it on ps3. theres a huge jump in terms of visuals. besides, custom soundtracks, mods, first person mode, better graphics, smoother frame rates, higher resolution, more music and of course, the best thing ever; the amazing director mode. i love you rockstar!!!! 10000 out of 10!",2
"where did the steam sales get me? they got me right ing here! the end of the road. with a big library, and a useless ps3. and im stuck playing you because no one else gives a . oh im playing the game baby, and that game is ed, ing ed",4
"it doesnt even start up ... i got all the drivers up to date and it doesnt want to work , i have a geforce gtx 760 m i7 intel",4
"will probably change when ever game starts working. launch was terrible, rockstar support is nonexistant and only seem to be helping with mismatched keys/social club. im one day from refunding this bs..",3
"spent 10 days installing 2 days trying to launch but nothing other than a crash. im sick of it and will be waiting one more month before requesting a refund. i get a crash saing social club ui has stopped working. if you can help i will return the favour",2
"finally rockstar is being nice to pc gamers. great port, im playing it maxed on my pc and it looks very good and stays above 60 most of the time.",1
"put 50 hours in the first few days of its launch, why dont you own this already?",4
"first of all i sant to clarify that i havent played the game because ive got all the imaginable errors that a game could have. it seems that the game wasnt tested on laptops with two gpu (brilliant rockstar) and there is a big problem with linking and unlinking steam-social club accounts. the customer service its just awful and unacceptable. say again: this is not a review about the game, its about the company, the port and the errors nightmare.",3
"this game will take a big dump on your computer. for the time being, just stick to console.",1
"i was a bit scared of purchasing the game after some of the reviews, but after watching some gameplay i knew i had to get it whether it worked or not. i run a single gtx 980 and the game runs smoothly at a constant 60fps on very high and ultra settings. there are occasionally fps drops here and there, but nothing that would affect gameplay. i had two instances where the game crashed, but it was on two different parts instead of the game freezing over and over again on the same part. all in all this game has been a blast so far and the graphics are amazing. havent really tested the online yet, but will soon! but so far i am really enjoying the single player story. i am sure that patches and updates will be released to address all of the crashing issues so grab this game either now or in the future. because once you get the game going you will not regret a thing. specs cpu: intel core i7 5820k ram: g.skill 32gb ddr4 os: windows 8.1 graphics: nvidia geforce gtx 980 storage: 1 tb ssd mouse: logitech g502 proteus core keyboard: corsair k65 rgb w/ cherry keys headphones: turtle beach earforce px22",1
"check out my video for a potential fix! it worked for me and may work for you.",1
"what the actual  is wrong with the devs, still no fix for launcher crash, tried everything, this is great game but your bringing down the vibe. pull you fingers out of your asses and fix the ing game. 8/10 story, 8/10 multiplayer.",3
"this game is very fun, i really cannot be asked to come up with more because id need an eternity.",4
"killed a cat, got on a bike, ploughed into the back of a car, hit a lmapost and died 11/10",1
"i bought the pre road and so i finished intalling the game and now after i made a id on the rockstart socail club when ever i click start a game it keep saying is loading the game but nothing start ........................ is this only me or is there anyone out there have same problem like me ?",1
"======= opinion======= the game is probably my favorite gta so far. the 3 characters come together to make this unlike any other experience in the past. nice to get back to ol san andreas. any fan would love this game. honestly havent done anything else for 4 days. id keep this one away from the kids if i were a parent though. its full of filthy adult entertainment as should be expected. ======= hardware ======= in 29 hours of gameplay it glitched twice but i think it was installing an update. running this game on my amd 6800k with 8 gb ram, and radeon hd 7870 ghz. the specs are flexible. any decent system that was built in the past few years should be able to play it.",3
"walked outside of house and was swiftly murdered by a fat man in short shorts. 10/10 would recommend",2
"i meet the requirments but it lags like crap and has trouble starting the game up. i lowered all the in game graphics but it didnt help. pls fix and i will recomend the game",1
"pc master race nerds.. hope you enjoy your 2 yr old game you paid full price for lmao",3
"- fov is too narrow, the slider does nothing. - vehicles do not even have an fov setting. - vehicle damage has so heavily been dumbed down form the ps3 version, they dont even crumple in any more in the slightest. just disappointed, got my refund, rockstar need to fix these things.",1
"its the strangest thing, ive explored the area from top to bottom, but i cant seem to find san fierro or las venturas... ...not only that, but the gangs that i genocided about 20 years ago, the vagos and the ballas, have some how come back... other than that, great experience, preloaded 60 gb in about 5 hours, took 1 hour to download the 210mb decrypter and another 2 hours and 60 gb to unpack the game. would preload again.",2
"i never had the xbox or playstation version.... i have only played this is a ps3 that was not mine. anyway i think gta v for pc has not yet demostrated how better can it be compared to the consoles exeptuating graphics of course. just wait and lets hope they add mod support thats what im looking foward to.... modding the  out of gta v until it explodes. :d",3
"my computer is bare minimum spec for this game, however the physics and the game runs great with no lagg at all, graphics look pretty bad but the game is very very playable. thanks rockstar for gearing down the graphics properly and ensuring it playable. i will probably update this once i upgrade my computer... awaiting parts :)",1
"finally! i wait this moment for too long. one of the best day of my life 100/10",3
"optimized very well. this just proves that most pc devs dont even try. obviously because they have a secret deal with gpu manufacturers to optimize badly --> more sold gpus. this is basically an old game with new skin. but thats some nice looking skin, and runs silky smooth. some people have had problems like crashes. for me zero crashes. had a problem with installing though, gta5 needs 120 gb space to unpack files, even though after its complete, its only 60 gb. but the game works fine on (modern) hdd, doesnt need ssd contrary to what many believe. loading time is not long.",1
"uhhhhhhhhhhmaaaaaaaaazzzzzinnnnnnggggggggg!!! pc master race... that is all.",2
"huge game doesnt do it justice. great graphics, top-notch gameplay, and tons of stuff the average person wont ever do. third-person action game, with first-person thrown in as well, that uses a three-person main character storymode all about heists, revenge and the like. multiplayer is a blast, with buying apartments, cars, and weapons with the objective being what you want to do. you can race, heist, deathmatch, or just enjoy the fanastic chaos that will ensue!",1
"downloading: 5.5 hours unpacking & installing: 1 hour crashing into other people and not getting arrested for it because the cops dont do jack: priceless",1
"best pc launch since i can remember. game runs smooth as butter with no problems on very high! (running a single 680 gtx atm)",4
"3 days and still not working. support hasnt done  all for me. dont think ill be keep it.",3
"good game great gameplay overpriced for coming out a year later on pc. bought it anyway.",1
"hi there i got problem when i updating my gta 5 if somebody can help me please to solve this problem??thanks",1
"couldnt get my account back from console just bcuz the first letter in my pw was in capitals(fk u r*), bye best everything and lvl 80 character :( but anyways the game is great, if u havent played the console version this is a must-get. game runs perfect max settings 1920x1080 on a i5 4690k,gtx 970 and 8gb ram the game floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee, runs so fast even console peasants can`t see.",3
"really like the game. only problem is when i play it, the map on the bottom left is glitching out for me. does anyone know how to fix this? thx",2
"11/10 would reinstall windows again to fix the launcher",2
"hands down the best game i have ever played. its that simple",4
"not even lowest settings are as bad as xbox 360 lol",3
"guys buy this game !!! it was worth to wait for. awesome !!! 10/10",3
"im happy for the players that can play the game. but me for example cant play it as the game itself crashes on launch. thought i was the only one but turns out there are many others witht the issue. i dont recommmend the game until a new patch gets released to fix the game.",1
"this game is a beautifle, interactive, masterpiece that is packed with things to do. it is excellently optimised for pc and there arent many things that are negative to say about this game. rockstar has truely poured its heart and soul into this game and i look forward to the games they make in future untill then though i shall be exploring all the things to do in los santos and san andreas doing missions, races, deathmatches, and hiests with my friends, playing the amazing story with even more things to do, and creating my own missions with the rockstar creater and to top that all off with free dlc and more to come a true 11 out of 10.",2
"after years as a beta tester on console.......pc version is finally here!! -9.5/10 worth the wait",4
"60 fps or higher does a brutal difference, now it has exclusive pc content such as rockstar editor and a great community overlay. you can also notice a huge difference between ps4 or xbox one on graphics, rockstar did a great job. if youre thinking about owning this game, you should do it right now! as our friend, gaben, would say; - worth the wait. good job rockstar, im 100% amused. filthy , aka carlos",2
"altough i played it on the ps3. and it was a very good game on that platform. after a day i haven been able to get the game to start. yesterday i made a rockstar support ticked nothing heard of it. i find it sad because on the ps3 it was a titan of a game. on the pc i expected even more. so im sad that this happened i cant recommend it now form my point of view. but when i can get it to work. i think it would be one of the best free roam pc games right now on the pc. so right know i cant recomment it sadly. because of technical problems. when those problems are solved. and will not arise for new players. based on my expirience form the ps3 version i would definetly recomend this game. just not the pc version right know sorry",1
"i played gta since the age of 7. plus waited for this game for 3years. rm 150 + patientness are truely worthwhile .cant deny rockstar made a masterpiece again. gta - 4ever.",2

"this is the gta game i have been waiting for since san andreas. it delivers everything missing from gta4 and so much more. 10/10",3
"another great game in the series. finally on pc. i personally enjoy the graphics better.",3
"this game is amazing! it is very well optimised. i can run this at high settings with my 4gb ram, nvidia 840m laptop with little lag. but i lag more with the lowest settings o.o anyways, its a very fun and enjoyable game to play with your friends or by yourself ;d also highly recommended for people that like beating up  and racing",2
"game is currently unplayable for 20 percent of the people who have bought it. please patch the game rockstar!",1
"it took 1 year and 6 months and was delayed 3 times but it was well worth the wait. 1080p @ 60fps with all the settings maxed out looks amazing. 20/10 jumped off a helicopter without a parachute and lived. would do again.",2
"its a great game but rockstar please fix the grass texture gta san andreas has a better grass texture :p",1
"one of the greatest games in this decades. one of the few games that made me laugh out loud as well.",3

"best loading simulator 2015 11/10 would pay another 60 for this.",4
"despite a few rare bugs with the graphics and physics, this is a very enjoyable game. singleplayer is solid and the multiplayer is fun for the mostpart, though its not exactly open to users to play with.",4
"excellent game for pc playing on my new republic of gamers laptop i bought just for the game. glad they added vehicles and new weapons previously for online only to single player that was an issue with the ps3. enjoying the better graphics and first person mode as well as the blimp definetly worth it.",4
"i need unlink my steam account from socialclub account, its told me you must talking the customer support wtf its only unlink not hacking my account. i told him before 29 hour ago im very angry customer support is very primitive",1
"basically a definitive version of console gta with new stuff",5
"this game is amazing. walked down the street, saw a dog, walked up to the dog, got hit by a truck. 10/10 would get distracted on a busy highway again",4
"great game! but they have some requirements for the specs that are high. :)",2
"oh boy,gta v on the pc the textures,the fps everything so perfect but the best thing about this game is that its actually fun driving around los santos mountains with your friends on an pick up truck driving around the city while your friends shoot out of the windows killing some noobs flying a plane across the map with your crew and jumping out to skydive robbing a bank to get some money to spend on hookers the list goes on and on baby",3
"i have had no issues at all! runs way better than it should be!",2
"well worth the wait. the graphics are amazing and even on launch day, the game was one of the most stable ive ever played. i have everything on high (2600mb/2000mb vram usage) and i pretty much get a solid 60fps. this game is beautiful and fun. im just sad that san fierro and las venturas arent in it. perhaps well see some dlc or mods.",2
"fantastic port from consoles. it is also pretty optimized for lower end pcs. spawned in on gta online and got ran over, would do it again 10/10",2
"this game is awesome. on my 670 i can run on normal textures with most everything else on high, no msaa. runs very smooth with fps over 80. looks absolutly amazing. between single player and multiplayer this game has countless hours of enjoyment. buy it now.",3
"its pretty good. all it needs now is the princess elsa stripper mod from gta iv and itll be a solid 10/10",1
"i always hated country music. but after playing this game i fell in love with it. rabel radio ftw. 10/10 game.",3
"i figured the game might actually work on launch day.. or the day after..",2
"great on pc love the first person and everything looks great. but still there are too many trolls online and makes it impossible to exactually complete any missions to make any money plus when u lose a mission that i need to pay $40k to start because of trolls makes it not so fun. need people u know who wont troll in order to play online :( so game play is a 10/10. missions online i give a 1/10 because of trolls",1
"aside from the 10 hour 60gb download, the game is giving alot of people problems and rockstar is sitting on their asses counting money. i have put in a support ticket and followed up 6 times and no one has responded. the online freezes and crashes, a problem that many other people are having. on others forum posts, rockstar also has failed to reply. it seems as though they have absolutely no clue as to what is causing this problem prohibiting online and story play. totally unacceptable for it to be out this long and no patch for an issue making the game unplayable for some customers.",3
"for some reson i cant start up my gta v game can someone help me?",2
"loaded game, linked character, walked out of apartment, got killed by falling exploded aeroplane. 10/10",2
"i spent 73 minutes trying to fix this game, along with 4 hours of reinstalling it twice. we waited 2 years , 10/10 got more then monies worth.",2
"i waited 18 months to play this on my rig and boy was it worth it!!! its perhaps one of the most technological marvels ive ever seen in a game!! its beautiful, hilarious and it is jaw dropping awesome in nvidia 3d!!! 3d is the only way to play this bad boy!! makes it a whole new game...and that game is a masterpiece!!! 10/10 drink sprunk and dock with buddies!!!",3
"rockstar did an amazing job with this port. while my single gtx 770 isnt running the game at full ultra, its pretty close to it. much closer than i expected, after gta iv and many of the overhyped games to come out recently. this game looks absolutely amazing. i havent played as much as i would like yet because of work, but i will be playing when i get off. gunplay is as good as ever, driving is smoother, switching characters (not that ive done it much yet) works exceptionally well, and its all bound together by one of the most beautifully rendered games ive ever seen, and certainly the best open world in terms of visuals. i havent played on console since ps2, so this is my first time playing this amazing title. if, like me, you are a true pc gamer, you will pick this game up. even if you are a cross-platform heathen using both consoles and pc, you should pick this up if you are interested in the in-game video creator. it seems like a great feature to play around with, though i will wait until ive beaten the campaign first.",3
"had console version ps3. pc is light years ahead of the consoles version. the depth and detail in pc version gta v is the true power of what pc gaming is all about. best game of the year! steam user must have! #globalgrandstand",3
"i want to first say, well done rockstar. what a great game you have made for pc. everything about gta v for pc is amazing. the graphics, the story and support for widescreen displays. (as im using a nvidia surround setup) it really is very well optimized. i have not had an issue, as many other people have, which is fortunate. hopefully that will be fixed soon. again, thank you for making a great pc release, and not a reproduction of what gta iv was.",1
"cant play for more than 20 minutes at a time in online, and cant get to the point where i can save in singleplayer. somehow still not ready to be released after all this wait. if i could get a refund, i would. what a ing waste.",1

"this game is fantastic, but i think everyone already knows that: pros: -great open multiplayer world. -awesome story line (even though i havent gotten far) -game runs very smoothly -good customization -you dont have to go bowling with roman cons: it has a few bugs, like your screen sometimes freezes right after a mission. several of my friends has that bug, but no bif deal. 10/10, its that amazing and totally worth waiting for. thanks for beta-testing it for us, console peasants.",4
"if your pc can handle the fps issues then yes i would recommend it but as for me, the fps drops and the constant lock up of my pc, i would rather wait till they sort it all out before trying this game again",1
"its easier to make an account for my bank than this @#%#ing game. i shouldnt be this frustrating just to set up the game.",1
"hands down the best gta title to date. i need not explain more.",3
"***day 4, still no fix. rockstar, not even a released statement saying anything regaurding this problem...*** a huge  you to about half the community from rockstar. wait 2 years for the came to come to pc preload for 7 hours wait 2 days for it to be released unpack for about an hour and a half. launch game, moment i have been waiting for my entire lilfe rockstar social club has stopped responding every time on launch verify integrity try atleast 7 different solutions nothing helps or fixes it. been waiting 2 years for gta v to come to pc, a week for it to be released after preloading it, a statement or a patch to be released for 4 days now, im done waiting. i actually want a refund for this because it guinenly does not work for me. im not smack talking or hating on the game, im stating that it doesnt work for me and anyone looking into this game should be wary about if they have amd hardware, because apparently it does not work with social club ui. i really really wanted to play this on pc because i could run it, but sadly social club ui crashing constantly prevents me from enjoying myself with gta v.",2
"its freaking awesome!!!! <3 <3 <3 beautifug graphics,amazing gameplay!!big difference from the ps3/xbox360 versions!!!",3
"story mode was great. not much to tell, worth to buy just for online play! online is really fun untill you get to a certain point were the game just gets kinda boring, not much to do. try getting as many friends as possible or join crews to do stuff together. as in planning heists, team deathmatches etc etc. overall, run around and kill people, and have fun. rate 8/10 for both story mode and online. there are more serious reviews out there, no hate please. :*",5
"unbelievable. the coders from r* have been porting the game for almost 2 years, but they didnt think about the owners of the modern laptops with 2 gpus. im not even able to launch the game. upd: ive managed to run the game by disabling my second gpu (and then enabling it), but i hope the devs will fix this as soon as possible. the game is gorgeous, no doubt about that. upd 2: i should make a huge remark. the game optimization is just outstanding. r* did a great job here. everythings running smoothly on my 3-year-old multimedia laptop with high details in 1080p. just amazing.",3
"game is really amazing. download was bad, tho, but gameplay is amazing. i like story and graphics. music is good, first-person mode, i like it all. but most amazing thing is that i dont need to listen to roman on going bowling. :p",4

"dear r*, you have gave me the great gift of gtav before on my xbox360 and my xbone, now you give me this pc verision. i have never seen such a beautful game before ported over! runs like its on ice and looks like a nexgen game. thank you r* for blessing us with your holyness ps give us red-dead 2 pls",3
"after two years, the blockbusting grand theft auto v has finally arrived on pc. and now the question im sure everyone is asking: is it worth a buy? i can safely say this is one of the best optimizations of a pc game i have seen. even a gtx 860m, a the midrange laptop gpu in my comp, is able to churn up 60fps on high settings with little to no hitches. kudos to r* for delivering a fantastic product. note: now while the game itself runs beautifully, the installation issues were a royal pain. if steam ever crashes during the unpacking, or the social club client is unable to start the game: grand theft auto v has exited unexpectedly verify the game cache, it turned out that 10 files were missing so let that unpack. other than that great port 10/10",3
"i tried everything and still gta 5 has stopped working !!! >:( when is the fix comeing ?? its frustrating to buy a product you cant use .",1
"i played the xbox 360 version to death and now im going to play the pc version to death. its great. buy it.",1
"after a long much awaited delay... i cant say that im in any way dissapointed. this game is all that i would hoped it would be, it runs on lower end pcs as well as looking great on high end pcs. its a all around good purchase for everybody around the pc gaming community. i am so glad that rockstar stepped up to the plate and made this game live up to the hype aside from some early download issues which are to be expected with the amount of people hitting their servers at one time. all around i can say that this game is completely worth full price(at least for a pc only gamer) and it wont dissapoint!",2
"amazing port. i was really afraid of the port being similar to the one of gta iv in the beginning, but they took their time, which initially annoyed me a little, but in retrospect i must say it definetely paid off. the graphics are amazing and even with a medium-end computer rig, the game looks beautiful and runs at a stable 60 frames per second most of the time. there havent been any issues that ive run into so far and im praying that it will stay this way. all in all great game, great port and definetely worth the money! thank you, rockstar! perhaps i can get my girlfriend to get a copy and play with me ;)",2
"gta5 online experience theres a mission called titan job you have to steal the cargo plane and the pilot did the 9/11 he screamed like a terrorist and we all died 9/11 - best game",4
"alright, when you request help at rockstar. they help. you got issues they will help you. now the game is a great game you should get it 10/10",3
"would i recommend this?  yes i would! i played a lot of it on the ps3, and having seen the differences so far in the pc version, i gotta say rockstar smashed this out of the park! worth the 39.99 asking price? youre damned right, buddy. side note: having played 3+ hours so far, ive had no problems in story mode or gta online. both ran smoothly.",5
"crashes very often, many graphical glitches, unplayable as of this review. tech support blames microsoft.",1
"hell, i could be going on a heist with my buddies right now, but im too focused on chasing cats and hitting them. wtf.",1
"daaaaaamn i missed a good gta game, havent enjoyed a gta game since san andreas <3",4
"i had this game for my xbox 360, and loved it. so naturally i bought it for pc, but realized too late that rockstar are ing idiots and didnt account for people not having amazing computers. the game has no low graphics option, and everytime i try and play it it crashed my computer. not the game, the computer. do not get unless you have a good desktop computer!!! other than that it is an awesome game and i would totally reccomend it.",1
"played the xbox360 version and i thought that looked beautiful... this just makes that version look 16bit! even if you played it first time around, this is well worth it as its still one of the best games around and its now stunning looking.",1
"fun game, looks good, runs well, great voice acting and soundtrack. only 3 problems with it so far: 1- game is hyper-unintuitive. i had less difficulty learning to program with the unix vi editor than i did trying to do very simple things in this game, like figure out what the hell passive mode is or how to disable it. hell, i couldnt even find out how to leave gta online, and i had to force it closed with task manager :/ 2- pvp in free roam is extremely shallow. get mg, get fast car, spray from car. if not, get spammed from car, die. shame, if you had to actually aim to shoot from a car in third person this game would be a much more fun and skillful pvp experience. 3- dear god, the law enforcement system in gta online is atrocious. you would think that offing someone in a dark alley with a suppressed pistol would reduce your chances of being discovered, but apparently big brother sees all in los santos, and the nations entire police force will dispatch endless troops from your anal sphincter. why even have a suppressor when you have radar always on and cops see everything? just remove it from the game rockstar, stop misleading people.",3
"game is broken from re-release. online doesnt work no matter how many ports you open or what you configure. errors with many users but rockstar says everything is perfect. no help found anywhere nor any news! 10/10 would not buy again for the third time! maybe online becomes playable in the next 2.5 yrs and only supported until gta 6 is released. very sad time to be alive. and to think this game was one of the main reasons i got a gaming pc! so i guess its back to skyrim.",2
"really great and funny game, special when youre playing with friends ^^",1
"i enjoy it a lot but the online is still plagued with intense lag. i know rockstar will fix this. the game is still super new. chill everyone.",4
"game is just stunning, a masterpiece, just gonna keep playing the shetz out of it. well, i fixed my game at first, it was stuck on social club loading after logged successfuly. maybe thats cuz my system name has a symbol -> . ... heres how i did it: if your username contains non-english or normal characters, then first create an empty folder wherever you want (for example: c:newfolder). then, right click on your c:usersusernamedocuments folder, select properties, and change its location to the new folder that you just created. the computer will then ask if you want to move all the files, say yes. after that, try running the game and it should work. update: now that a patch was released and a new social club, i can play just fine with everything back to normal.",3
"pros: overall a great game for the pc. if you are used to how this game looks on the console, you will be blown away by the graphical improvements and the gta experience at over 30 frames per second. there are a rediculous amount of settings so you can customize the game to your liking. the controller support is also amazing since gta v provides a seemless transition from keyboard to controller. i personally use a controller for flying and keyboard and mouse for everything else. the game as a whole seems so smooth, driving especially. cons: you have to start nitpicking in order to find something about this game that isnt up to par. the obvious for me was the excessive time spent on loading screens. finding a gta online game is a pain since loading screens can sometimes take up a substancial chunk of time. joining jobs and heists also have the loading screens. in the end, i couldnt recommend this game enough. the game itself is among the funnest ive ever played with the graphical improvements over the console version making it even better! buy this game and you wont be sorry!",2
"heard this was a good game, so i bought it three times. its good, would buy another three times, 10/10",1
"the game has its hiccups, bit r* have been great about getting patches out quickly. enjoying the hell out of this.",4
"its grand theft auto 5, my favorite gta game... on pc! this game already kicks  on consoles, but this is by far the best version of grand theft auto 5! i have played the ps3, xbox 360, and ps4 versions and the pc version tops them all. better frame rate, better graphics (supporting resolutions above 1080p, directx 11 features, and higher resolution textures), and (by opinion) better controls (mouse & keyboard). if you have not purchased this game yet, what the hell are you waiting for? go and hit that add to cart button and buy this game already! i will see you online!",4
"you must buy this game.very optimized,lots of fun,great time waster.",3
"everybody knows grand theft auto games are awesome and this game is no different. chances are if youre reading reviews for this game on steam, its probably to see if they actually optimized it and if it runs smoothly for pc. the answer is yes. it runs flawlessly. all sorts of fancy settings you can adjust to tweak your gameplay experience. bravo rockstar - you havent disappointed with this one.",1
"great game right from the start, i liked the other gtas but that is the best one. i will tell you it bad side, rockstar sucks at support, ea at list have live support and i need to wait a month so i could submit a bug report, what brings me to wonder around there site for bug report. the bug is not importent for the moment. im also disapointed that you cant change the level of the first person view. but the game still worth the money, great buy.",2
"this game is great. very well optimized and amazing gameplay. if you dont belive me look at my time played... ive only owened this game since launch and its ruined my life.",5
"its gta san andreas turned mmo rpg. best game ever, buy now or suffer the pain of wishing you had purchased earlier.",3
"i just bought the game and it crashed immidiately after i logged in my rockstar account",1
"best game ever. love the graphics of the loading screen. 10/10 would buy again",2

"i had sex with a hooker in my stolen car, then i killed her and left the car on some tracks to get hit by a train. after that i went home and played grand theft auto 5 which i thoroughly enjoyed.",1
"ummm...just played and yank it. game is 9/10 and story is 10/10.",1
"gta v on pc is what we have all been waiting for, its here and rockstar has shown that they have learned from their mistakes with gta iv. this game is well made/well optimized and i havent seen one single bug yet, props to you rockstar! youve done it! 10/10",4
"its easier to make an account for my bank than this @#%#ing game. i shouldnt be this frustrating just to set up the game.",1
"was expecting the worst but its a nice surprise to be presented with a game that runs so well and has no many pc specific settings. even has raw mouse input! and the world is just gob smacking...",2
"horrible, horrible port. i meet recommended requirements (except the 8gb ram part - i have 4gb), and the game is barely playable. scratch that, after the prologue its unplayable, with all its stutters and graphical glitches, even on minimum settings. i cant recommend the game as it is (day one), and its beyond me how rockstar managed to release such a crappy product, even after all the delays.",1
"everyting has now changed since i last wrote this review amd have came out with a driver (15.4 beta) i would suggest downloading it if you have amd gpu or cpu it helps alot with your fps i went from 18 fps in the main city to now having a sold 60 fps. (i still wont recommend amd tho) everything else with the game is just great! apart from the fact they have have made modding very hard which sucks. over all i would recommend this game to anyone or everyone!",2
"essentially cookie clicker but with the play button...",4
"the game runs really smooth, fun to play... wait times are a little long to log into online gta",1
"i flew a plane into a tunnel. half way boom. apprently destroyed car someone was travelling across city for. rage rage rageeeee but it was epic flying until a truck got in my way. right?",2
"check out my video for a potential fix! it worked for me and may work for you.",1
"its gta v. need i say more? ps. it ruins social live :(",4
"what is not to like about gta? i have played this game on x360 and x1. story mode is fantastic. the elements of playing three different characters was a great idea. seeing the game evolve over the years of releases has been a blast. x1 version looks great but once you can great the game up to max and play it at 60fps it feels like an entirely different game. trying to go back and play it on console just doesnt satisfy anymore. frame rate is king to a degree. driving just feels incredible at 60fps. gta online is a blast to just drive around and mess with people. once you can get ranked up heists are fun but they do leave some things to be desired.",1
"i can only run this on low, otherwise its a fine game.... my gpu is an 8970m, which doesnt make sense",1
"so i went online. so i found a tank. so i saw the tank was shotting at me. so i died. 10/10 ign. tank are op.",4
"really great game, my pc cant handle it too well, but it will be fixed probably. i rate it a 9/10 - wolf gaming reviewers",1
"i see all these great reviews of this game, and what i have been able to play of it i really like, but thats where the good things end. for the most part, i have to sit here and start and restart, start and restart just to get the game to work, and in the rare times that it does work, it only works for a short amount of time, so with that said i cant play it until they come up with a fix for what is wrong with it, and thats 60 bucks wasted. so in light of the fact that i cant play i cant recommend until rockstar fixes the crap thats wrong with it.",1
"god damn, endless hours of fun, jaw dropping graphics, legit",3
"the forum is filled up with people having trrouble with the game and rockstar does nothing about it, i have bought a lot of crappy games on steam but this was probably the worst (and most expensive)... i want my money back.",4
"i had this on xbox 360, and have just been waiting for the past 2 or so years for it to arrive on pc, and it was worth the wait! the graphics surpass the ps4 and xbo easily. they even designed it for weakerish rigs to be able to run it decently. i have several hours on it so far and just love what they have been doing. gets a little getting used to once youve played with a controller for quite a time! 10/10 love the game.",3
"social club failed to load due to an incomplete installation (code 4) methods given didnt work. 40 people found these methods helpful and 1000 didnt.. thats saying something. been a whole week now and still not one word about fixing these problems. the customer support is so poor, its hard to believe im experience this from a company that made 1 billon+ off this game.",1
"you rockstar!!! you make us pc gamers wait months for this beautiful game! all that waiting for graphics that almost no ones computers can handle!!! not only that, but there are soooo many mothering bugs and glitches!! i cant play a game for more than 1 hour without it crashing or freezing or just having insanely  glitches! as trevor always says,  you...  you  you  you  yooooooooou. fffffuucckkkk yyyoooooouuuuuu!!!!!!!!",2
"the story is great, the graphics look amazing and the multiplayer is even better. what else do you need from a game?",3
"good but you need atleast 3.5 ghz intel core i5 to play",3
"running on a gtx 550 ti. looks pretty great, no lag till 5 hours straight of gameplay. aside from that the game is ing perfect.",3
"broke the steam market and made my cs:go inventory worthless. 69/666 great job rockstar!!!",1
"i love this game too much ,this is my favorite gameplay ever :)",4
"so despite the problems people were having, i experienced non. this game is truely remarkable and might i add, the best sandbox game currently out. gta v ultimately became, what gta iv was supposed to be. online is awesome, casually get my crew and start blasting people away with a rhino or just casually going for a drive. gta v has it all, the activities could be expanded though, but hopefully r* will add some more features in the future, with the anunciation on activities. and ofcourse the main event. heists. heists with a full crew makes it all the more better. and if rockstar will continue support for this game, itll last for years just like the cs games.",5
"my pants and tears of happiness when finally played after several try outs. 100 franklins out of 10 chops.",3
"gta v was my most craved game of 2015. every delay even further made me want it more and ensured me rockstar was going to give us a fully-optimised product here. yeah, this game works for a lot of people, hence the dominant recommended reviews, but for me: no. this game crashes all the flippin time. im running an r9 290, i5 w/ 16gb ram. im above rec. specs and this game crashes like there is no tomorrow, even after its 2 updates. i dont have all of the graphic settings turned on and many of them are lower than the highest setting available and itll still crash like crazy. sometimes it crashes after 10 min of play, sometimes 1 hr. sometimes driving, sometimes walking, sometimes in a mission, sometimes just standing there. i have found, however, that the lower the graphical settings are the less the game crashes. but man the lowest settings look almost worse than the ps3/360 version of the game. i dont have a $1,200 computer to deal with that. its just not worth it. please, rockstar, patch this puppy up. i cant enjoy it. dont ditch us.",2
"this game is better on pc than it is on xbox. thank god i swithced",1
"cannt even launch into the game. 0/10. f**k the social club.  dont buy this sh*t. if you want to play it , buy an xone or ps4, or just wait for the crack.",4
"my playing time says everything am addicted i log more hours in than i do on my regular job. gg",5
"reality, home, at least it was before gta v ed everything up.",2
"the most brutal gta experience i have ever seen !!",4
"incompatible with laptop computers without a semi-complicated workaround that involves turning the gpu off and turning it back on before the game loads. unfinished game.",2
"best game ever, i have 50 or something games but this takes the cake !",1
"this is a good game, but i find it difficult to play it for many hours due to me already playing on xbox 360 when it was originally released for the console. its very similar to the xbox one, and ps4 release apart from obviously 60 fps (frames per second) and better graphics. i can tell a difference in the graphics and the game looks incredible and isnt very demanding which is good. the game suffers from a large about of bugs due to the new, and recent release but nothing that cant be fixed. it honestly sucks that we had to wait just under 2 years for the pc port and its still full of irritating and game breaking bugs which effect the overall game experience. but putting that aside - by the far the best gta in the series imo and a good port apart from the bugs. i recommend this game to any gta fan, and anybody who wants to experience an unrealistic machine gun town 3rd person/1st person shooter.",1
"ok those getting the appcrash when in the social club, click start, go to control panel, system and securty, go to windows update, and update the hell out of it until you get windows service pack 1 installed and configured, should work golden!",3
"controls,  interface, if you fail at an objective the game goes out of its way to start you at the othe end of the city. even the best vehicles control like they were built by a factory of inbreds imported from the stone age. frequent lag spikes whenver someone joins or leaves while you sit there wondering why you give a  when they arent on your friends list. if you want to sit for a round of move you fker!, oh my god just fking turn already and why would that even cause any lag, what the f? then this game is for you. if you dont want to scalp yourself to relieve the rage that will build up when a random lag spike causes you to drift off the side of a bridge then play something else.",1
"i will not be reviewing the content, because i guess everybody knows what to expect (i have never played and seen almost no footage of console gamplay so im having a blast on story mode) performance wise my specs are i7 2600k 4.5ghz - gtx970 - 32gb ram purchase went smooth as it gets, buy, download, register for the first time to rsc, launch and play, just like that. game runs really fine for me almost maxed except aa (just fxaa), grass on very high (there is ultra) and shadows on high. almost 100fps, using vsync anyway to avoid screen tearing. i havent jump into online yet and it seems a lot of people are having troubles for now. for my personal experience i would recommend it 100%",4
"after last update that fixed the issues with the launcher i have to change my opinion about the game. everything now is perfect. graphics are gorgeous and the game story rocks!! i recommend this game to everyone because its the biggest title on gaming.",2

"quite simply, a masterpiece. i have this game for the xbox one as well as pc, the pc version is the icing on the cake for a superb series. this title is a must-have in your pc collection. it looks beautiful, has a social following vast in numbers and has more playability than any other title out there. whether you want to squad up and hit the heists, or relax in free-mode getting into all sorts of trouble, the simple and mundane will have you entertained for hours. a++ pc title of 2015 by a country mile.",5

"honestly the most difficult game i have ever had to deal with, and sadly i have even avoided most of the major issues. it loads about one fourth of the time and the other 75% it provides the annoyances and frustrations that i can only imagine be rivaled by a barbedwire laced power drill rapeing my nostrils. seriously considering a refund.",2
"i recomned this game. but i cant play it for an unknown reason. i open it and it crashes. its quite depressing. people say to disable my gpu but that is probably a lie. help",2
"simply amazing ... grand theft auto in first person almost makes you feel bad for beating the  out of some random civilian ...almost...",3
"rediclious you buy a 60$ game and cant even play it because they dont know what there doing ill never pre order another game",1
"most people got their game running, and a few dont, its maybe on their side not the game, first time i installed it on launch day its smooth and running, maxxed everything out and i am happy with the result! from 90-120 fps on high and 60-80 fps on ultra/very high, over all i am happy with the game, been playing it since it launched on the 360, money well spent! recommended to all of gamers out there (not for kids tho)",5
"man, i cant wait to play this game. if only rockstar social club wasnt stuck in f***ing offline mode, i might actually get to play!...rockstar has disappointed me. if it started working i might be inclined to change my review. im glad that the game was delayed three times just so i could buy the ultimate version that doesnt even ing work.",1
"most of the textures are terrible, vehicles are way too maneuveric. but still the world is good enough. 2.5/10 textures 7-8/10 gameplay",3
"was worth the wait. game looks amazing on very high settings and will make completing the story again a whole lot different from the xbox 360 version. sucks that the pre-order bonus money was not spread out across all characters in story mode.",2
"having played hundreds of hours of this game, the pc version is just that much better that it feels like a whole new game entirely. 10/10",1
"all i want to say is: the glorious pc master race 60 fps 4k 3d lord gaben",2
"no crash issues here. intel i-7 2600k 3.7ghz oc, gtx 770, 8gb corsair vengence. seems like the game takes up about 1.5gb of vram for me, so i still have 0.5 worth of change left. i bought this game the first time around for the xbox 360 and stopped halfway because of all the loading and waste of a good thumb stick... and wonky 3rd person controls. none of those issues on the pc version, and 1st person driving is surprising easier than in 3rd person. traffic collisions down by 90%.",3
"sorry the grand theft auto launcher has stoped working wtf rockstar you ing delay the game for many months for bug fixes and now that the ful game is out you ahve no excuses to say why the  myself and many other players are having problems 0/10 fix it",2
"amazing graphics and game. few bugs on release, benchmark tool not working, fps drops sometimes, especially with lots of grass and trees around. early days, though, id hope these minor issues get fixed but so far 9/10! well worth the wait and effort from rockstar.",1
"this game is truly amazing. 1. looks great, runs great. 2. easy to pick up, doesnt bore quickly 3. some hard nut achievements 4. great storyline, best multiplayer gta has ever seen id type more, but i gotta get back to my missions... cya",4
"amazing game! decent port, although could use a lot of work on optimizing lower end graphics cards. there have been a couple bugs with online, but not gamebreaking. definitely recommend, especially if you have some friends to play with!",5
"o m g best gta ever! im sorry kyrat, im moving to los santos again. nothing they promissed is missing. thanks rockstar, worth every penny!",3
"i think apparently some nvidia users are screwed they cant get through social club launcher. there is solution and got it finally working. i found working solution this page",3
"ive already played this game on console so the hours played are not correct... with that said. the game is way different from console. i mean... it is the same game. but it feels and plays much better. i max out the game and rarely get below 60 fps. if i ever do i get like 55 fps... not a big deal. so rockstar did a great job porting the game. it seems people are having issues logging in to the social club. i never had that problem. my friend did though. his steam name had a dot at the end (name.). once he removed that dot he was able to log in. it has something to do with the social club not working with certain symbols. the game: the story is crazy and filled with even crazier people. the longer you get through the game the more fun it becomes. i love the characters though i think rockstar did a much better job in red dead redemption when it comes to personalities. the world is filled with stuff to do so you will never be bored. if you somehow get bored theres always the multiplayer. ive not tried it yet on pc... but i can say the console version had a ton of variety in community made maps and game modes. i am sure the creativity of the pc gamers will outdo what has already been done.",2
"thanks for beta testing console players. #pcmasterrace etc.",3
"everything about it is superior to the console version, the graphics are just amazing.. online community is still mostly s who want to just run around killing you repeatedly and troll eachother over the mics. the only problem is ive never had a game take up my cpu cores like this game.. it runs at 100% almost all the time (i5 4690) and stutters",2
"played on both xbox 360 and xbone, but it didnt last half as long as this. 60fps really makes a difference. everything runs smoothly and i see no significant bugs or anything worth noting, aside from connection problems once in a while, dropping me into empty lobbies, but perhaps thats on my side. rockstar did a really great job on this one!",2
"i was playing gta: online the other day, then i killed some random guy and i had only pistol ammo. after that he killed me with his scoped rifle couple times, i got angry at him. then i went to ammu-nation and spent over 30,000$ on marksman sniper rifle, extended clip, ammo and body armor. then i killed him once and drove off, after all that, i did not have enough money to buy a turbo for my car. gg 10/10 - would shoot a random guy again.",2
"rockstar have done enormous work on gta 5 on the personal computer. say thanks to them!",5

"i love the game, it is a lot more fun than 4 was. thank you rockstar!",2
"i thought it would be more fun on my new pc with a gtx970 16gb ram and an i7.... but nope the graphics arnt nearly as improved as i thought they would be. i am already board as i beat it on my 360 two years ago when it came out.",2
"load times are kinda long but otherwise a very good port. besides why are you even looking at the reviews.",2
"the game is fun but i regret no buying the pre order and did not get the bonuses",1
"574 days since the initial release on old consoles... but it was totally worth the wait!",2
"no doubt this is the best version of gta v, just a shame it took this long to get here. optimization is pretty good but definitely could be better, the graphics looks stunning along with the improved pedestrian and traffic density. the settings is also pretty good with a lot of options. overall id say it was worth the wait, but next time dont make us pc gamers wait this long and release it alongside the console version.",3
"the game is great except for one thing. i really hate how im crashing multiple times in row for me and then being fine for maybe an hours. i feel like paying this much for the game and it being capatable for me i shouldnt have to deal with these kind of problems.",1

"you must install correct drivers in order to even start. the game already has glitches, you cannot push esc or it will auto close down and try to reboot in safe mode. secondly when you go to take covor the game will freeze and you cant move to covor, the bots will just stand there doing nuthing. i bought this game to add to my collection soon to be all gtas...i do not reccomend buying this outrageous expensive game, sold my gut knife on csgo for this....",1
"fairly gpu demanding but if you can run it, it looks ridiculously good. plays smoothly and everything feels good. only downside ive seen is that every time i load the game it goes back into window mode. other than that gg rockstar.",3

"as of writing have only played a few hours of online but i am already very impressed. playing with friends is a blast. i anticipate many good times to be had with this game, glad it finally came to pc with the improvements from xb1/ps4. controlling vehicles with keys took getting used to for me but keybinding and/or a gamepad can fix that. other than that, no gripes. exemplary port.",1
"all i can suggest is do not buy this game now wait 6 months the game us currently unplayable for a lot of people there is an issue that comes up for most people where after playing a few minutes the game will have a dramatic frame rate drop and then eventually become unplyable all together no matter what settings rockstar knows this is happening but they are simply refusing to patch it yet they are focusing on the stupid windows installer thing when this issue is bigger in my opinon",3
"this game is great. i think i dont have to talk about this :). its perfect beside that rockstar sv is not so good. i know im from sea and i cannot have the best server but this sv is unstable. overall its worth-buy games but r should upgrade their sv.",4
"i was chasing a cat around the city... she got hit by a train... and survived... i got hit by a car... and died. 10/10 would chase the cat again and die. anyways.. this game works.. even on my potato laptop. i like it.",2

"how can you pospone a game for so long and release it with so obvious crashes? youre not winning my review back when its fixed.",2

"amazing simply put amazing. gta4 has nothing on this neither do the wash out dogs. so much to do so much fun to have controls are great story is nice",3
"won a bikerace while playing highway to the dangerzone 10/10",2
"it was really really good and then it got revoked from my account because the guy i bought it from did a chargeback on his credit card. ive sent a steam ticket to try and get it back but they probably wont respond for a while and even if they do i dont know if ill even get the game or my 22 keys back. 10/10 the worst thing is its all my fault",1

".. i cant even everytime i start the game it just crashes pls fix this r* .-. refund pls",1
"why the hell do you have to have social club when its so bad? i cant even start the game because it keeps crashing on startup because this social club crap just wont work! what were you guys doing in that one year delay? i thought you were fixing it, polishing it up. this is just terrible!",2
"cant log into my rockstar account. gg release day bugs.....10/10 would play again",2

"i have a great system yet i get fps drops every 10-15 seconds (60-90 then drops to 9-20). changing the graphics setting doesnt affect it. gta 4 never worked properly on my computer and now this one doesnt either. waste of money!",1
"very nice game, played it on ps3 and still the same feeling. runs very smoothly, but the only bad thing is: the high cpu usage. i can change everything, but my cpu is always on 100%, still on low settings. and this causes no texture loading while driving, which is very bad.",4
"this, game is amazing, even if you played the console version(s) i recomend you pickup the pc version. i have had no bugs and its great. 10/10 - must buy",3

"i cant play my gta v because i linked the wrong social club account to my steam account seems like a prob that could easily be fixed but nooooooooo rockstar made the link permanent i just blew 60$ because im stupid but i know i cant be the only one who has done this",1
"im surprised how smothly it runs on my first launch! almost everything on ultra/highest and im getting between 50-60 fps at all times. although im running an sli-setup but still, the game has insane ammount of graphic options making it possible to run on high variety of pcs! definitely worth that price tag!",4
"amazing so far. great sequel to the series and finally on pc. running on a gtx 760 at 1440p. 4k looks nice, but fps drops to below 30. buttery smooth @ 1440p. radio is very entertaining. the map has definitely changed alot since san andreas, but there are still some areas that are very close and reminicent of the older game. cars handle alot better than gta iv. switching between characters isnt as bad as i thought it would be. im also a big fan of how the map is not locked down from the beginning such as all the other gta games. first thing i did after the prologue was boost a car, drive to the airport and grabbed the first plane i found and cruised around the map (dat turbulence). love this game so far. only played online for a few minutes and hit rank 3. lots of potential and really looking forward to continuing this game. 10/10.",2

"where can i apply for a job in the rockstar team? two years of development and still they didnt even try to do a test run on some laptops, i think they have mighty fine siesta breaks at that company. oh well i guess the laptop players will have to wait 2 months more on a patch. sleep tight rockstar (for people with switchable graphical units i.o.w. intern graphical processor unit (cpu) + dedicated graphics card, dont invest money into this game yet. gta5 doesnt support this verry common laptop setup.)",1

"i think its a great port of the console versions and it could only get better from here",2
"game crashes after the social club loads,, having a blast of not playing the game! back to gta4! can not recommend till i can play the game. not happy",2
"i never cared for the previous gta titles, but this one is a winner. awesome story mode. wonderful graphics and sound. detailed immersive gameplay. and the online mode is fantastic with friends. the cons are the matchmaking issues that plauge this game. very adult oriented, which is great except i often hear childrens voices while playing multiplayer.",1
"i have this on console and i decided to buy it on here because i wanted to play it with friends. i must say it is a great game and the first person gameplay is amazing, from doing missions down to the team deatmatch! this is a must buy even if you have played it on console, pc version outshines console. 10 out of 10 rockstar!",2
"fun game! i own on all systems. online doesnt seem to work though and their are already problems that have been found",1
"cant say how disappointed i am right now , seeing the game downloaded for 3 hour and unboxed for 1 hour , i still cant play the game. rockstar such a big company release a game than hasnt been full made and it has a big name gtav , i mean not what im excepting , i hope they can work on that asap .",2

"after playing gta iv on pc, i had few expectations for the pc port of this game to even run. rockstar has really learned something though. i get a constant 45-60 fps on ~high settings with my 750 ti. and the game is great fun, so much to do. 10/10 best $60 ive ever spent (except for cs:go :^))",1

"i have bought this game 3 times already. (the fact that i bought it 3 times must mean something) i currently own grand theft auto v for the xbox 360, xbox one, and pc. this game is one of the best games i have ever played. it runs amazing my rig. i highly recommend this game. pros:",1
"best pc port of all time, amazing gameplay, you need this game. i only had one issue after installing it was a corrupted file, it was fixed with the validation tool in steam within 20 minutes, not a deal breaker in any sense. i own the game on the 360 and have beat it twice, i started back in single player again and have not made it to multiplayer as of yet as the immersion is a fantastic experience. im sure the online portion is great i just have not wanted to tear myself away from story mode (for the third time)..",3
"thanks rockstar for taking your time while developing this game, it runs incredibly smooth, and i cannot wait to spend another 100h in the game.",1
"a really great port for one of the more stranger stories in the gta franchise though dont mistake the strange for anything but greatness",1
"is this for real? the optimization is unbelievable!! outstanding optimization!!! finally, a long awaited game in its definitive edition! thank you very much for this, rockstar. i hope im not dreaming xd 10/10",4
"my pc can barely run this game with a gtx 460, 6gb ram and an 2.80ghz cpu. but its giving me more motivation to save up and upgrade my computer.",2
"gta v has finally made to pc. its fantastic and obviously the definitive version. but i wouldnt know that because the games launcher doesnt even start. also rockstar has mentioned any problems even though it has been 3 days. 10/10 great port- ign",1

"this game is truly a masterpiece, one of my most favourite games of all time. buy it. now.",3
"never thought i would say this... i think this was worth the 1 1/2 years we waited for. r* you really pulled through on this one. game runs like a dream, looks amazing, and (besides some weird mouse sensitivity issues) has little to no bugs. absolutly worth every penny, even at full price. now if you dont mind, im just going to spend every waking hour i have left in los santos for now...",3
"only game i dont mind spending 5 hours troubleshooting to play 10/10",2

"after download cant launch cant play please help to fix the problem thankyou",2
"really rockstar? 2 years and 3 delays seemed to have added up to nothing. the game is unplayable for me as as the launcher crashes and i get a message saying gta v launcher has stopped working. it then checks for a solutio to the problem and closes. and it also seems about 25% of all people who bought gta v are experiencing game destroying problems. i have tried reinstalling both the game and social club, verifying my cache files, restarting steam and my computer, and fidddling with my gpu. nothing worked even the slightest. rockstar - fix. this. now.",3
"after patch, still cant play the game. i keep getting error code 9. im so glad i pre-ordered this.",1
"the game that crashes constantly in multiplayer: the game",1
"i have changed my non-recommendation to a recommendation after rockstar released a patch to fix the issues in their optimized game. everything seems to be working fine now, so it appears ill be able to rate the games content in the future (if i remember) rather than the crashing i was experiencing.",2
"an overall astonishing game, although i noticed when the preload gave me my $1.35 mil, it spread out to gta online, etc. on story, only franklin got money, he got all $500k, oddly, trevor had $100k to start with, which really confused me. overall amazing gameplay experience, good action, nice hud layout, everything, just, flawless. definately worth $60",2
"better than ever. looks amazing, and a riot to play.",1
"cant play because i cant change which social club account is linked to my steam account",1
"this game is so good that it wont even turn on 9/11 -ign",3
"finally on pc (waited for years) welp, before it was announce to be sell on steam i cant wait so i buy ps4 what do i expect for pc? 1.kids screaming 2.racist people 3.lobby wars 4.trolling everywhere 5.hacker 6.scammer 7.noobs this is what i met on ps4 do you think it will happen on pc? who knows?

"great port with loads of settings and at 1080p on a computer with a gtx 970, i5-4690k and 16gb of ram the menu is choppy but the game runs perfectly",2
"gta 5 on pc is amazing, and dont let some launch bugs stop you from getting the game i was apart of the october gta online launch when no one could play, and did i bash the game no i just waited for it to be fixed and it was the best game ive played in a long time.how good is this game you ask between the xbox one i bought for it,the gtx 970 and the 3 times i bought it i put over 1000 dollars into this game and it was well spent",4
"lot lot of problems...i m tryint to solve one of the problems and cant do anything....its just a p!ece of sh!t",1
"this game is a beautifle, interactive, masterpiece that is packed with things to do. it is excellently optimised for pc and there arent many things that are negative to say about this game. rockstar has truely poured its heart and soul into this game and i look forward to the games they make in future untill then though i shall be exploring all the things to do in los santos and san andreas doing missions, races, deathmatches, and hiests with my friends, playing the amazing story with even more things to do, and creating my own missions with the rockstar creater and to top that all off with free dlc and more to come a true 11 out of 10.",2

(you can check my hw in my profile and my native settings are very high) [i preordered and i am fully satisfied] thank you r* 5 stars out of 5 ;)",3
"worth every cent of those cs skins ive sold for it! :)) i really really love this game, basically you can do anything, even going to the  ladys  :)) like in real life, you just need money! online is awesome also! i can play counter strike if i want ... or i can race and feel like playing nfs ! :) what else do you want from a game ? + a cool story line .... definetly would buy it again and again! 100/10 :d thanks rockstar! best game this year :)",2
"its good to be back in los santos... and this time its even better!",2
"rockstar can suck my , absolutely no support for those who cannot play the game because of their  perma link to steam accounts... so if you bought the game on a different account not activated to steam rockstar will take outs its big willy and shuv it down your throat and make you wait 1 month to answer a ticket that will probably not help. because giving the power of unlinking your steam account to the customer is too much to handle and would give them a god complex.  you, ruined my day/week.",2
"this game though. i compared the graphics of xbox and pc it was amazing. the wait was worth it optimizing.. you did a great job rockstar im looking forward to gta vi hahaahaha :3",4
"wtf!all is out of control! but dont worry,its all under our control! not just a game, its a real world!",2
"great game. with a 27 screen, resolution 2560*1440, on my xeon 3.5 ghz and with a gtx770 4 gb it performs phantastic",1
"ing great. one problem im having is that online charcters have all these horizontal lines on them on all parts of there body and clothes. not sure what i can do to fix it but other than that its great",2
"dont buy this game. it doesent work for at least half the people who have. its not worth the gamble.",1
"10+ hours in to the game, still only gotten 10-15% of the story done (this includes some online gameplay too). i ing love this game.",1
"amazing amazing amazing, running at high settings on a ing 2g 750ti and it looks so amazing, lap dances in 1st person is really nice, i really feel like this game was worth the wait and im so excited for university to end so ill never have to look at a real human beeing again",3
"10/10, no comments. this game of ages, rockstar forever!",3
"third time purchasing gta v. youre lucky we love you, rockstar.",2
"all i can say is thank you rockstar! hands down the best gta of the series! and definetly the best pc version of the gta series yet! this game is highly optimized on my rig, and you can tell that rockstar put a lot of effort into making it so! well worth the wait!",3
"specs: gtx 650 ti 1gb ddr5 8gb ddr 3 ram amd phenom 965 3.4ghz m5a97 asus mother board 500gb hdd i can run it at an average of 30 in the city and 70 in the country side with drops below 30 due to my vram. the launch for me was smooth i do not know why people are having issues. on multiplayer i average 30-45 fps this is on lowest on 1080p the controls are quite good although a bit confusing for piloting aircrafts (you have to use wasd and the numberpad arrow keys do i recommend this game? hell yes. will you listen? of course not you probably already have it.",3
"10/10. although the wait was long it was well worth it. pc has opened up a whole new side of the game, the graphics make it feel really realistic and my gtx 660 has no problem running on high. do yourself a favor and buy this game for hours of fun.",1
"ladies adn gentleman this is grand theft auto at its finest glory the dfintive version this is and a must have even with the slight issue that windows has is a very easy fix do not let any one detour you with a bad review saying it is not worth the purchase cause of that it so is worth every dollar that rockstar wants for this game. i had the issue with windows and fixed it in 2 seconds.",2
"this game looked so good i had to change my underwear",2
"i dont know how to say, but totally i love the game,",4
"[?/10] review for what ? dafuq did you expect ? just buy it. best game series in human history.",5
"just as stephen colbert won television, rockstar has won video games. this was called the everything simulator, and thats not inaccurate. attention to detail, solid mechanics, a great storyline, online gameplay even i enjoy, variety of cars/weapons/clothes/buildings/people/everything else: one of the best games ever made.",2
"no issues whatsoever. framrate is decent. could be optimized better i feel, but definitely miles above gta4. if youre not convinced, wait for a sale. definitely worth it.",3

"i downloaded 60 gigs of ing garbage, i start the game and it says failed to initialize directx 9 cant even play the game after paying $60!!! (fixed) well, now that i got through that the game wont even get past the gaming club saying there is an error",1
"strang...when i transfered my character over from xbox. he had small lines all over him. looked like a human zebra. anyone else having this???",2
"the magnitude of the map and just how open the world is for exploration and causing chaos makes the game extremely fun even with no goal or mission at all. the port is very well done and plays well. controls with kb/m are clunky the first hour or two but you get used to them fast. no regrets for full price on this one, the hype was real.",1
"if you dont know how to make a usable account register, then just dont make a game, simple as that, im not paying to get stressed trying to create an account on this useless socialclub(the ideia is bad,just as uplay) while those guys who own a ship with a black flag can enjoy the actual game.",1

"id like to write an honest and thorough review for this game, but i cant. why, you may ask? simple, because it doesnt ing work. i bought the game at 8am this morning and let it install throughout the day. not only did i have to wait until almost 5pm for the ly huge filesize to finish downloading (59gb), but after going through the process of setting up a rockstar social club account (which you need in order to play the game, because there is no offline mode - the offline mode in game still requires an internet connection) and activating the game, it just loaded. and loaded. and loaded. and loaded. and loaded. see where im going with this? tl;dr, typical aaa , game never loads, not worth the $60 spent on it.",1

"its your cousin, roman. would you like to go bowling one last time? :(",2
"one of the best launches i have experienced. the game is very well optimized, and runs extremely well. once you get past the social club stuff, its incredible.",2
"great game, but its it the same as console, except wider player base and more things to do with more flexibillity. its not different than console, but somehow better.",2

"got sick, played gta online the entire moring. no longer sick. 11/10.",2
"edit 2~ installed amd beta drivers and they helped majorly. if anyone has any problems on a good rig, download the amd or nvidia drivers. they help a ton. game runs great now although i cant tell any differences in graphical quality between this one and current gen consoles (running on high+ goodies). gta online is as you expect, a bunch of s with sticky bombs blowing everything up and ive encountered quite a few children already. story is great though. hell i bet you already had it and beat it. well, buy it and beat it on pc because why the  not?",2
"best game ever !!! i do not have words to describe how chicly this game 1110",3
"buy this game. the console version was the prototype for sure as this is the definitive version. if your pc can support it, buy it now.",2
"bought the game cause of all the great reviews.i5 @3.5ghz+r290x 8gb.i am very dissapointed at the way this game runs.even when fraps shows 59fps the game lags badly.hope a patch fixes this soon.",1

"finaly. i had been waiting for it for 4 years. since the first trailer came out. the,ing,best. p.s never played it on console, or watched any letsplays. p.s.s #hachiko",3
"its here on pc now, is it worth it? yes! rockstar did a great job with the graphics and the game looks great with lots of attention paid to details and evnironments. they also did a great job with bringing life into the characters. the game runs completely maxed 1920x1080 on my system with full antialiasing (i7 4930k @ 4.5ghz and a gtx 980 4gb with 32gb of memory) and i get 50-60 fps constantly. its really fun, a big improvement from gta iv. driving is a little tough at first, but once you get the hang of it, its much better than in gta iv.",3
"joy at last! its finally working, been playing for over an hour and theres been no problems! (touch wood!) before it wouldnt last long enough to finish the first mission. now there seems to be stability. from what i can tell there have been two issue affecting my experience. 1) nvidia experience set all the opimal settings to way over my gfx cards capabilities and instantly put the settings in the red (on the game graphics-in-game-settings had me using over a gig above the spec of my gtx 760 2gb, i7, 16gb while we are at it). 2) downloading the game, i repeatedly found errors in the downloaded file according to steams cache checking utility. even when it was repaired the game would crash. today i finally downloaded it with no errors when checking it prior to installation (this is only time this has happened in over four downloads) and its the first time its run perfectly. after all that trouble i can say that it has been worth the annoyance but i could have done with out it. ok now let the scally waggery commence!",2
"with many good and bad reviews, i though id give my two cents. the game itself preforms very well. the game is nicely optimized for good and bad computers. my computer is not very good, and i can still have just as much fun as anyone else. ive had so much fun in my little playtime, that i know that ill have much more. when people say that the game is not optimized very well, its because they have a  computer. i was suprised by how nicely the game preforms compared to the quality. 10/10",2
"awesome, this game is awesome. the graphics, everything!",1
"flawless intallation,performance and gameplay, absolutly nothing to say against this title.. best gta ever... dont listen to all the whining, just a bunch of unlucky and or poor ... test your own luck",4
"amazing. to the console version, theres no competition. i am running at full settings on a laptop, getting a minimum of 30 fps, if i wanted to tone those settings down, were talking 60 fps! grand theft auto has always been a great series, with gta v trumping all the others. even if you already have the console version, paying the extra $60-70 is totally worth it!",1
"that wait was worth it, great pc game in every aspect.",2
"runs great on minimum requirements. -i3 processior (3.2ghz) -hd 4400 graphics integrated gpu -5gb ram i can run on low at 30fps also amazing game.",1
"behold gta v on pc. all hail gaben. all hail the pc master race. jokes aside, plays at a beastly 60 fps on 4k resolution with 2 overclocked gtx 980s so im glad that it is optimised well for how nice the game looks. (just turn off aa, at that resolution you dont need it at all :3). as for online capabilities, much better than the torm that was launch on the peasantstation 3 and xbox #360noscope since you can actually play gta online without disconnecting 24/7 (all hail pc master race). *good on rockstar for not pulling another gta iv on pc",2
"after the patch which fixed the problem with multiple grafic cards it is a great game.",2
"this is pc porting / optimizing at its best, and most patient. this is what the community expects from a developer that delays a title, for it to be as complete a pc experience as possible, and have dimminished a sense of it being made for something inferior. rockstart has accomplished that w/ gta5 - its an amazing to look at experience, and it runs flawlessly. we all already know how great the content and story is, so ill leave this review as is. its a great game on the pc. it truly is the ultimate edition.",3
"ive played the console versions of this game and it is fair to say that this is worth the wait. gameplay was great in both 3rd and 1st person mode (dont recommend first person if you have motion sickness), the cars didnt feel slippery, the campaign feels like sort of episodic (if i spelt that right) and the graphics were impressive. especially on the last gen versions of the game. 10/10 ps. be prepared to run into high level pr*cks going on a rampage in their tank on the online portion of the game",1
"smoked reefer, shot up aliens, watched dogs bangs, watched humans bang. i want to bang too 10/10",1

"its fun playing with mates, tho the loading is too long.",4
"game is unplayable until rockstar patches it. save your money until then.",1
"amazing, everything i have hoped for runs wonderfully.",2
"was looking forward to it, but stuck being unable to play it due to rockstar station issues!",4
"game is just amazing ---|pros|--- 1. free roam 2. buy a personal vehicle 3. buy a house 4. can customize almost every aspect of your personal vehicle 5. loads of things to do in muliplayer 6. fun with friends 7. can create movies 8. can customize your player completely. from cheek bones to what he wears on his wrist. 9. money system, so you have to do stuff to earn $$ 10. multiple things to do yourself around the city, like, tattoos, hairstyles, etc. ---|cons|--- 1. auto lock is available online 2. armored vehicles are available online 3. loads of ways to get money fast. i made $1,000,000 in 3 days 4. lots of kids (thats any game though)",3

"epic game!!! no comments. 12/10 ps. optimization better than in gta 4! bravo rockstar ^_^",3
"i dont even get the intsall prompt after i download when i press play. ive tried every workaround i could find but nothing works. edit: yay they fixed it, it only took 4 days.",2

"warning: for those with motion sickness issues. the game looks great! wish i could play it. seems like fun. i bought it .. played it for 30 mins or so.. got back motion sickness when when driving around. the way they did the camera work didnt agree with me. i turned off head-bopping in the menu, tried a bunch of other stuff. but it was still bad. i was able to get my purchase refunded from my account settings.",1

"best jesco white simulator ive seen in a while. mostly loading though.",3
"absolutely worth it! i am running it on gtx 970 and almost everything is maxed out. going 100% on enhanced draw distance can crash the game though, so be careful not to push your gpus memory to the max. this is probably the best optimized game ive ever seen. 9.5/10 - buy it now!",3
"now i can get a private dance from a stripper in ultra graphics and 200fps. well done rockstar! #heilgaben",3

"very confused as to how to get the 1.5 million from pre-ordering and transfering over from gta5 ps3. i got the singleplayer money but not the online money. any help plz message me!!!",1
"way too many glitches to release this game. would have been happier if they took a little bit more time and made the game actually work correctly. i will change this review to positive when they fix all the problems with gta online.",3
"i would lick peanut butter off a homeless persons toe to play this game for an hour.",2
"simply one of the best grand theft auto games out there. deffinetely better on pc.",3
"logged onto gta online, looked at houses online. shortly after closing my phone i was quickly beaten to death by a man with a baseball bat. 11/10 ign review in progress",2
"this game is just beautiful. everything looks stunning, especially the water and how the city looks at night. 10/10 this game is so much fun.",2
"this game does nothing new. at all. everything it does, someone else did, in some cases better. but in most, not. from the joke ads onthe radio through the wide range of vehicles to the story and multiplayer, everything is very well done. the game is optimized really nicely as well. there really is no reason not to like this game. everyone should have it.",4
"clearly not a game that ready for market yet. its have loots of issues. had to reinstall windows to get the game to work.. and now that i did update to windows 8.1 the game stop working for me again.. contacting rockstar for support its like asking a dead fish where to find sand.. rockstar is the new ea games when it coms to support.. the game is fun when it works but rockstar as publisher and support service on this game is what make me not recomend it. will update this when rockstar decide to com out with fixes if game works.",2
"cant play this  game because of infinite rockstar social club charging, gonna keep this negative till this ing game works. edit : so i was able to get on the game after having to tweak some  that i shouldnt have to be doing but oh well, i dont know if rockstar came up with a patch or anything yet but this really isnt serious at all, they delayed it so many times and for what ? so many people had and still have issues just launching the game, its a joke... aside from that, the game is pretty well optimised, im running on high and a few setting on very high with a r9 280x oc 3go and an i5 4690k at around 40-60fps, mostly over 50 though which im pretty satisfied about, amd will probably still come out with another driver to make it even smoother (yeah i guess im an optimistic person) only negative point i can really think about which is pretty ing annoying are the endless loading times on gta online, i have the game on a 240go ssd and its so ing annoying as im not patient at all when it comes to video games. all around im enjoying this game now that i can actually play it, id recommend buying it if you have the recommended config.",4
"i deleted origin so i could have enough space to unpack this game 420/10",1
"steam says ive played for 7 minutes, it used to say 6 but i didnt think anyone would take me seriously with only 6 minutes. 10/10, would click play again and again, and again and again and again....",1
"rockstar and their infinite loading screen for social club. worst day one launch yet.",1
"almost impossible for me to say a bad thing about the pc version of gta v. i was worried about buying the game, considering my computer is budget equipment. my main pieces are my evga gtx 750 ti sc, & my amd fx-6100. anyways i bought it, and am very surprised how this game runs on my system. even with all graphics settings maxed, except msaa, & post fx, i still can get 45 fps of course i got the settings lowered to aim for 60. but with the system i got, i cant in anyway say this game runs bad.",5
"10/10 great port (or at least seams to be so far) wouldnt revise again.",3
"problems i currently have with gta 5 - loading delay when the game launches - resolution changing from fullscreen to windowed - built in benchmark program does not work properly - graphics stuttering, especially when driving - some textures and objects loading at a slow pace which result in blurred images on the screen ive updated to the amd experimental drivers for gta 5, which helped a lot. im disappointed in amd, they need to make better drivers and churn them out at a faster pace for big game launches. switching to lower graphics improves the fps, but doesnt remove the stuttering. so once again im in this waiting game for bug fixes. the sad thing is this is rockstar games best port they have done for the pc recently. both max payne and la noire had more problems at launch, but eventually those games ran very smooth for me on high settings. shame on rockstar for the mediocre port, shame on amd for the mediocre drivers, and shame on me for pre-ordering again from a publisher with a history of pc launch problems. this game is great, ive played in on ps3 and i really want to play it on pc and change this to a positive review :(",1
"runs flawless having zero issues maxing it out with my 290x 4gb great port rockstar you guys & gals did a great job",3
"works fine for me. on lowest settings to maintain decent fps for my toaster, still looking pretty good.",3
"played this on ps3 at release, yet it is a completely different game in my eyes. the graphics and the framreate change everything and make this game a game to contend with on the pc platform. also the fact that i retained my online stats and charecter is awesome. i have owned this about 30 hours and i already have 14 of them logged into this game. praise gaben",2
"had this game for ps3 and now on pc. its just plain fun!",2
"bought to play gta online as i already finished story on ps3 a year ago. well. may be i didnt get smth, but. to much boring grinding. i heard that there were challenges as a good income source, but they were removed and now you doomed to do dozens of boring missions for $20k max while your friends desperately trying to connect to your game session so you can go and finish second heist already. yeap. constant problems with social club. get your  together rockstar.",5
"great preformance on any build, currently getting 60fps 1080p on high no problem. game is fun as one would expect with a gta game. 9.5/10. good job rockstar, it was worth the weight.",1
"just played the firdt 3 minutes on max settings. im going to love this game.",5
"this game is actually great, some little added stuff that was not on the console, did i mention the graphics? only if your rig can handle it though. 10/10",3
"altho its been a bit buggy for some of my friends. for me its pretty good just the loading times a bit annoying :( lets hope for an update soon... definitely the best game i have ever played so far. i wished we can still do the story with the friends in the online mode but yeah its still fun. story mode is story and when its done mess around with friends on online xd get it.. its actually worth buying if u have a pc that can run it",5
"plays beautifully for all of 10 minutes then completely locks up, running on an amd fx-8350 with an asus radeon r9-290 and 16gb radeon memory. computer never breaks a sweat. hits, maybe, 40% cpu at times and 5gb ram. this game will not run for long on an amd based system. however, ive now got it running beautifully on an i7-4770 with a gtx 770. if youre running an amd system, wait for the fix. intel based, you should be playing it now.",1
"you must play the prologue before going online 10/10 would alt f4 again",1
"buyer beware: if you are an average gamer that does not have more than or eaqual to 3gb graphics card the game will look horrible, you must havea graphics card to play but it must be a spendy one because the xbox 360 verson of this game looks better then the pc version for me, im so sad i wasted $60 on this hopeing for better graphics but am now out $60 and very dissapointed.",2
"this game is fun a little hard to get fa,ilar to the controlls",1
"that was worth of wait. maybe the best and most beautiful openworld game. story is good, but online is so buggy/laggy. you can play this game like 24/7 without getting depressed.",2
"well worth it, concidering the massive ammounts of mods soon to come out, much better graphics, runs smoother on pc, of course.",3
"not only is the storyline immensely intriguing and immersive, but it is fairly long as well. the missions are comical, alluring, and ing fun. the game also has great replay ability. simply put, the game is worth the $59.99, and is a must-have, especially when it goes on sale for summer.",5
"bought this game three times. 4k, 60fps, gta online.... what else needs to be said.",2
"rockstar weres all the s i searched every place for them so ican get my online character laid for the first time in pc in ps4 i got to the hood s everywere pc none to be found plz fiz this other than that 10/10",2
"+this game runs smooth as butter. +the gameplay is as good as the ps4 version, except much much prettier. +this game has no issues and can be ran by any decent computer. +port is amazing with tons of graphics settings -the max first person veiw fov is 90 -mobile app is not updated for pc -60gb of space 9.5/10",1
"the game runs at 40 fps and microstutters all the time, even though i meet the recommended specs. pathetic port. ridiculous optimization. after 19 months of wait, that is the unfinished piece of garbage rockstar dares to give us.",2
"one of the greatest games in this decades. one of the few games that made me laugh out loud as well.",3
"first of all, let me start off by saying they never should have released a game as broken as this. i cant run it for 20 minutes without blue screening, but that doesnt change my opinion of this game. it is still one of the greatest games in the franchise, and of all time in my opinion. (vice city will always beat out the others for me). for the small time i could play it, the controls were incredibly fine tuned and responsive, and the controller support is phenomenal. the game is very well optimized, especially if you have the newly released amd/nvidia drivers. the level of detail is wonderful to have, and was nice to see coming from the ps3 version. even though its currently a broken piece of , i will still reccomend it.",1
"if i had to be angry at rockstar for 1.5 years each time to wait for an unbelievably amazing spectacle like this, id do it over and over again. 10/10.",3
"had to format c: for the game to function properly! not due to the user name, but for every other reason this game had a problem with my pc. havent had a single error since, though! game is gorgeous and runs really smooth, even when settings are set to above my gpu memory limit. if you havent played the story yet, yourre in for a real treat. else theres gta online. prepare to get shot alot in freemode, but it is also your right to pass on the tradition as soon as you hit the higher levels. just watch your back as you become a red player (also a sao reference).",3
"gta v: the game in which white kids shout the n-word in multiplayer constantly and babies claim to have screwed your mom when you kill them. a riveting experience.",3
"rockstar has did it. they promised a smooth 60 fps (smooth gameplay) + a decent port and they succeeded. i have nothing bad to say about this, i knew the gta online servers were going to be unstable after it launched it wasnt a surprise if people thought it was going to be stable... i dont know what to say. + decent port + extremely fun game with friends + first person mode is not useless at all, i love it. + i dont know if i will ever stop playing this game",4

"pc master race wins again. this game is literally amazing on pc. you want good graphics? gtav pc you want some nice fun gameplay? gta v pc you want a great game? gta v pc. once again this game wins, not only for itself but for the master, the pc race. oh and thank you, thank you very much console peasants for the beta testing :)",1
"the console beta tests were really worth it! 10/2 - f**king get this now you skrab",3
"i waited for years for this after all theses delays the game is still buggy as hell....not worth the wait and the money",1
"after waiting for so long for gta v out, realise that gta v is not really that fun. get bored easily",1
"how do i link steam to the rockstar social club to play the game?",1
"this game is having massive lag issues. plus people are abusing the car insurance. i keep getting people in armored cars that camp people as they spawn and your only option is to use a rocket launcher to kill them. the  part is you have to pay for it. so you blowing up someones car costs you.",3
"performs exceptionally well on 2 660s with 16gb of ram and a i7. lots of fun.",2
"rockstar did a great port of this game! i agree there were a few mishaps with the servers at launch and such but that happens with most big titles. game runs smoothly at 60+fps on my 290 without dipping lower than 55.",3
"this game has a nice online mode. minus the  load times, i really enjoy this grindy game that has nothing but mission grinds and other . i like this game because black people. rate 1/10 bad load times fix please you rongles.",2
"didnt buy it yet? - well? - the hell are you waiting for? - a sale? - this aint that type of game you wait for sale. this game is simply amazing. endless possibilities for so many situations. story mode is excellent. 10/10 online mode is excellent. 10/10 youll have stuff to do for hours on end! perhaps weeks, months, years... and to those who give a negative review because they cant launch the game yet or stuff like that... chill! you know they are working on a fix and it will come. when that day comes, so will you!",4
"literally the best thing to happen to my pc since i uninstalled uplay. seriously, its really good.",3

"my rig :-gtx 780 -intel i7 4770k -16 gb of corsair ram my pc isnt the best but isnt the worst either.ive tryed running the game with nvidia geforce recommended settings and it always gave me the error err_gfx_d3d_init.we have all have waited for god knows how much time, and still when it finally launched...you cant play because apparently rockstar games didnt have enough time to tweak the game.i hope they will fix it soon but until then the game gets a big thumb down from me. :|",3
"this is even better than the console version... amazing graphics and fast loading. 10/10!",4

"good single, absolutely horrible online and community. sa > v.",2
"its a good game, but you pretty much need a really good computer to run it at the moment. cant even get off the launch screen :/. once they fix the bugs it should actually be good.",1
"dont buy the game. first 40 hours were good but then: after playing the game i could not even typ well anymore, sometimes my pc just goes on standby and cant go on anymore, and now my pc is really off and cant even start it. gta vice city, and gta san andreas are way better!!! gta 5 ruins your pc. f u rockstar... really!",3
"i can see the delays were well worth it. the game runs smoothly on max settings and is well optimised. this is a port well done, my money was well spent.",5

"drive like an  simulator 10/10 would run over cops again",4
"when ever i try opening gta it keeps saying that it dosnt respond. is the patch going to that?",1
"ive been waiting for this since ever and finally its here :d since it came out yesterday i only played a bit, no crashes, no bug, no framerate issues and i wonder how smooth social club has become, you dont even notice it, it only flashes up when you start the game for 5 seconds. after reading other negative reviews i decided to write my own because i cant quite understand how ppl can be so stupid to not get this game running.. on steam, it isnt going to get any easier folks... -.- so good game, totally worth waiting and paying 60 bucks 10/10 would hit a fat lady in leggins again",2

"great game with lots to do, lovely graphics however the performance is less than satisfactory. my graphics card is fairly decent and runs everything on high and most things on ultra yet even though the graphics arent better than some games out now, the fps doesnt stay at 60 and theres drops by about 15 frames for no obvious reason. not pleased",1
"the greatest game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2
"this is ing  i waited all to-ing-day for a game to download that i cant even god damn launch. if this isnt fixed today im getting a refund. rockstar you are the iest production company ever.",1

"theres a lot of menu options and you can change the controls, but you cant change the gamepad controls if youre using a wired 360 controller as far as i can tell. will update if changed. overall, a kickass game though!! looks beautiful for real.",3
"so basically i paid 60 euro for an error msg. or i am in a paralell universe where this is an ubisoft game...",1
"great launch by rockstar, great port, great game 10/10 must own. 60 fps ultra on my gtx 970. lived up to its hype.",3
"man wtf this game lock me out of my account and it crashes when i run it",1
"took quite a while to download but totally worth it!!!!",2
"this game... is freaking awesome! you can choose whatever you wanna do - to just  around or do jobs and heist stuff. you will always have an activity around the corner. i totaly recomend this game",3

"game was so fast even roman cant call in your cellphone 10/10 no more bowling",1
"maybe pre-ordering a triple a game isnt so bad after all i havent tested the story out too much (just unlocked michael), but me and my 2 friends spent about 16 hours on release day on gta online. let me rephrase that. 16/24=0.66. we spent 2/3 of the day playing this game with small breaks. so ing fun. i play on minimum settings because my card is old (radeon 7850) but the game looks gorgeous and runs 60fps consistently still.",4
"if the workshop is available for mods that will be more awesome!!",3
"this game might be a little prettier than it was 2 years ago, but there is nothing new added that makes it worth paying $60 for a 2 year old game. the online portion of the game is still an awful waste of time. not to mention for some reason they never got rid of the boring ifruit app which requires you to feed, water, and walk chop. all in all this game is not worth half of what they are asking.",1
"been waiting for this game since 2013. and all i could say is it was worth the wait. ;)",2
"its an amazing game! (mabye) i love it! well, maybe. or maybe not. i have no idea because i preordered but am stuck in social loading screen and yet, there is no solution and according to people who submitted their tickets earlier rockstar does like nothing and doesnt even answer. buy this game anyhow because i saw enough other people playing it and it is amazing, but maybe dont buy it now, even if you hardly want to play because there is a chance that it wont work for you and youre gonna be so pissed. ps: my pc is able to run this  thrice and i tried like everything, even the stupid stuff that cant work, and yeah, that included turning it off and on again. multiple other things, as well, but i want this to be short enough for people to read it because everyone should know this before making a decision. pps: anyone want to play unturned beta?",2
"absolutely fantastic. runs like a dream, and is gorgeous.",5
"well worth the wait. running it on an overclocked gtx 670 everything on very high. cant wait to see it on my pascal card next year. this score goes up to 11.",2
"this game is the best game i pplayed in a long time the last awsome gta i played was san andreas and that was 15 yrs ago",1
"bought it downloaded 50% realised i have a laptop regrets everything downloads 100% plays chanes graphics to 768p goes complete  changes to 1080p runs smooth af 100% worth it",3
"nothing to complain about. other than the delays. happy with the outcome.",2
"been waiting for this game ever since the release on ps3 & xbox 360 and finally it arrives to pc after 2 years and 3 delays. im been waiting for this moment forever and now my babe have finally found me. rockstar is the bomb. 10/10 for not having to ride with my  cousin roman ever again.",2
"now that rockstart has fixed the game, 10/10, third time i have paid for the game, and it is my one true love.",2
"for the most part, this game is great. its everything a pc gamer wants from a game. great storyline, fantastic graphics, 60 fps, you name it. but there is one thing that is so serverly aggravating that it is preventing me from giving this a good review. its the fact that every single time i try to join gta online, it forces me to sign into to social club. dosent sound bad, right? well, the issue is, every single time i try to log in nothing happens. absolutly nothing. in fact, when i sign in, it actually logs me out of the game, forcing me to restart my game. i cannot join online because when i sign in it sits on the sign in screen and does, as i mentioned before, absolutly nothing. it dosent look like its trying to sign in, it dosent look like its trying to do anything at all. so now my friend and i cannot play online together, which is a huge shame considering how everything else about this port is amazing. its almost as if i can only play 50% of the game, because gta online is such a huge part of the game. hopefully, rockstar games will fix this issue. if that is to happen, i will change my review for sure.",2
"i keep it short, i will list the good and bad things about this game; good: + open world with a lot of stuff to do. + first person view. + many options for video and controls etc. + wide variety of vehicles. bad: - too many things force you into cutscenes or scripted events. - no full customization in single player mode. - long loading times during activities in online mode. - no fluent transition between sandbox play and doing activities, everything will force you into menus and loading screens. - main story characters switch to their default clothes every time you switch character. - unreliable system to store vehicles, vehicles might disappear and its impossible to buy bicycles even when having an empty garage. - forced to play with story characters you might not like and having to sit trough every degenerate thing they say and do is painful. it could learn a thing or two from the saints row games when it comes to customization and fluent game play, but its still a decent game overall, i would rate it a 7/10.",2
"running great on my pc, ~1 hours of play, very stable, no freezes no crashes, rock solid 60fps on high settings, i actually think the game was very conservative with the auto tuning, i fiddle with settings later and try max settings. the game looks gorgeous and its really good fun so far, seems like rockstar got the port spot on. at the moment i highly recommend this game for pc, ill return later on with a more in depth review.",3
"i played golf for an hour....dunno why...i never liked golf games before",3
"robbed a store, got shot in the back. came back, shot everybody, and then got killed by cops. 10/10 would rob again",2
"got it working by uninstalling fraps and d3d gear beautiful graphics, running it close to maximum sooooo smooth! character transfer was  easy great game, buy it.",2
"whell i just finnished the singple player campaig (mostly the main story missions) witch took me around 40 hours to complete, i found the story compelling and intresting.",3
"worst game launch ever, no one tested on notebook with 2 gpu. non rockstar(failstar) support. very dissapointed. the game do nothing when i click play. that was my last buy from rockstar. i rather go back play on x360 gtao.",2

"what in the actual , rockstar?? i kind of expected to be able to play a game i paid for, on the day it is supposed to be playable. i, like so many others out there, have had to scour the depths of google just to figure out how to just get the game to launch. i really love the gta series and had great expectations for this release, but have been thoroughly let down. please fix what needs fixing so we can all get along again.",1
"jumped on a bench, did a faceplant and died. 10/10 would faceplant again. also ultra graphic strip club 10/10.",2

"if you have a laptop, you have to disable your dedicated graphics card everytime you try to start the game, and you have to enable it when the game launches. thats what we get after waiting for a year?",1
"cant start this social club at all. over a week already and no reply. please do not buy this game.",1
"my drivers are up to date, my computer is fine, and yet ive waited months for a pc port so i could pay $60 for a game that doesnt work.",1

"gotta love a game that crashes all the time :/ its one of the best games on pc atm i find, but that only when it actually runs. im running this on a good machine with sli and everything, but no dice. ive dropped the settings too but nothing, it will still occasionally crash. hope theres a fix soon. atm i cannot recommend this game.",2
"we waited this to release. we waited it to unpack. we have been waiting this for one and a half year. this is the day what we have been waiting for. today...we...are....gonna....play till our eyes are burning and cant feel our fingers. this is the day when heaven came down.",3

"joined an online session and got run over by a tank. respawned and tried to rob a store and the shop keep shot me in the face as i left the store. listening to people rob stores and sing in the shower over mic at the same time is one of the weirdest things i have ever heard. game of the year.",4
"horrible garbage, takes nearly 3 years to come out on pc and on first day launch, error all day every day. thanks ing rockstar thanks.",2
"running 120 fps high graphics with 4gb(ram) thank you rockstar !!!!",1
"would not reccomend this game to any1 on pc, the game is a joke and the online is ing broken. how many months was this game delayed and it still doesnt work what a shame i spent $70 on this",2
"bought this game to play online with my friends, and do missions etc. but online doesnt even work. you can have an online character and you can start missions but if you have anyone in your friends list you cannot play with them or get in the same game. rockstar has even patched it already and you still cannot connect to friends or crew members. you will join and there will be 4 people in your lobby max but they will soon leave your game for one reason or another. basically because you are losing conenction to them.",1
"just wanted to say thank you console peasents for testing this game while it was in beta.",4
"18 months and we got it on pc. was it worth waiting? hell yeah it was!! huge city full of life, just living its life around you; long story mode with amazing, ehm... story. and then comes online with hundreds of activities and missions to do with your friends or random thugs. its just pure amazing and fun experience in huge open world gangster sandbox worth every cent, would buy even if it would cost more. 10/10 would recommend, best game ever, why the hell i am not playing now...",3
"so.... i have a valid windows name, and yet when i launch gtav, social club crashes due to an unknown error. truly a shame i decided to pre download it if everything was for naught. currently uninstalling and reinstalling, hoping for the best. in the meanwhile, a big fat nope is a verdict if i cant even get past the login system.",2
"-logged into gtav online. -bought a fedora from the mask/hat vendor. -wore the fedora and drank some e-cola; obtained maximum euphoria. -i took two steps away from the vendor only to be run over by a randomly spooked npc (while still drinking the e-cola). -milady.",5
"looks amazing, 60 fps really shines, and super fun to play.",2
"its a good game but without steam workshop and stability issues i dont think i can bring myself to buy this since i already own it for the 360. thats not to even touch on launch day issues which is totally inexcusable for a game that came out in 2013 and has been waiting this long for a pc release that has been promised for so long.",1
"in its current state, i cant recommend buying this game. im experiencing stutters, extreme frame drops, crashes and many bugs playing on more than decent rig. this game needs patch. its literally unplayable like this.",2
"went to a friends appartment and watched tv for 2 hours. 10/10 would watch american tv again",1
"with the last incarnation of gta on pc (gta 4) i was very dubious with this purchase, but it was a great purchase in the end, be it with a few les here and there. it might have took a few hours for the last chunk of the game to be installed with it being unpacked and installed but it is just as good as the max payne 3 port and runs smooth on my i5 3570k and amd 7950 3gb. the only time i experience noticeable fps drops is during high speed driving and im sure with a few graphical tweaks in game in regards to texture quality it will improve. all in all a good purchase.",3
"awesome though i cant figure a way to reduce my sensitivity since its ridiculously high.",4
"its midnight. gta unlocked?!?!?! nope. -extra download (takes 20 mins) -unpacking (took forever) ~oh my god i can finally play (1 am) *waits a minute* direct x installs. done at last!! time to play online with friends. *chooses online - error message comes up* !!play the god damn prologue before the online!! *plays prologue (finished at 1:30 am)* ??i can finally play online?!?! online servers arent yet online. rip 10/10 would wait 18 months again",4
"i am unable to play after updating my graphics drivers. i was able to play on the first day i owned this game, but that is it. i keep getting the social club code 16, i have tried everything rockstar suggested and then some. if i cant play, i want my money back. i sent a message to rockstar support, and i have yet to hear back. fun game when iit works.",1

"transfered my character from playstaion 3, logged in to online, died within a minute to someone in a prius flipping me off. 20/10, the 2015 skyrim.",1
"this game has been out for years now, so you should already have a good opinion on the game and its gameplay. the main thing people worried about was optmization, because gta 4 was a disaster. however, i am glad to say that so far this game is very well optimized. i am running this with a gtx 970 and i am never below 60 fps on highest settings.",1

"gta 5 so far is the most beautiful and detailed open world i have ever seen.",2
"what is the point of pre-ordering a game if i cant play when it comes out? i sure like to make some sort of recomendation saying its good or ba. but if i cant even go in, then i cant really do that now, can i?",4
"its a huge step up from ps4 and such. the pc version shines with color and view. textures are amplified and crisp and even a low end gpu can handle most tasks. my gtx 780 runs everything maxed out at 60 fps now that is a deal.",1
"this game is insanly fun to play, especially the online!",2
"thanks rockstar for taking your time while developing this game, it runs incredibly smooth, and i cannot wait to spend another 100h in the game.",1
"wow this game is amazing and to be honest am blessed i had absolutely no issues what so ever except not seeing the ok button in bottom right under steam key pop up after linking accounts /facepalm running this on my gtx 780 @ 1920 x 1080 144hrz with all on ultra and having again no issues. well worth the wait and i really hope everyone else can get their issues sorted soon so they can enjoy this masterpiece 10/10 cant wait to bang a hoe so tried out online and its so much fun ,managed to find me a hoe and a quite spot ,to have another player pull up beside me looking for my hoe ,much honking was initiated and she got scared and legged it !!!!!",3
"yep as gta games go, this is very good one. compared to the xbox relese though, there is nothing extra that makes it special, even as a special pc version, the hype around 1st person view was stupid, as this ads nothing to the game.",3
"2 much swag 0/10 wuld nut bey agen c4nt quikscup m8 -ign",3
"first of all, i want to thank to console peasantry for the beta test. now lets talk to the point, after a long wait, couple of delays, that turned me into sick person, finally we got this piece of art. truly optimized for pc, almost free from bugs and huge improvement from previous gta, no gfwl but still the sc. nothing to add about the gameplay, you probably know what is about.",2
"amazing port! amazing game! edit - also ive seen a lot of people moaning about rockstar support and quite frankly theyre really not that bad. they got back to me within hours when my game started crashing and the things they surgested gave me a 20-40fps boost! also contacted them about an online issue which, admittdly, took about a week for them to respond but they still helped.",3
"after 2 years of porting to pc, hopefuly its worth the wait.",1
"been playing this on the ps3 and the ps4, but wasnt able to finish the campaign.. i guess you save the best for last? i tell you the pc version is the best! awesome graphics! very well done rockstar! the game is optimized very well!!!",2
"if someone gives a positive review, that probably means their game launched successfully. if someone gives a negative review, that probably means their game failed to launch. you can guess how my game did.",2
"looks amazing when i finally managed to stop it from crashing every 5 minutes. didnt seem to have any problems from r* social club either. like i said it looks incredible, i can nearly max it out with an amd r9 270x (make sure you download the updated drivers). pushing the textures detail up too high seems to make it a bit twitchy but still looks lovely. 10/10 would develop another stomach ulcer due to stress from figuring out why it kept crashing and thinking id just wasted 39.99 on an unplayable 60gb parasite again.",1
"took me all darn day yesterday to download just to have a stupid the rockstar update service is unavailable (code 2)  error with the social club launcher messing up and not being to fully update.. was p.o.d cuz was not able to play, got a refund of my $59.99 to my steam wallet.. gonna wait and see if this problem gets fixed soon, if it doesnt, then that $59.99 will go toward something else and rockstar can go to h e - double hockey sticks",1
"game is fantastic and well-optimized; only issues stem from the community and the lack of a more solid group/party system for freemode and heists.",3
"excellent port, runs very smooth on my pc (except for the odd graphics driver crash which i expect will be fixed soon). i get around 55fps @ 1440p on my gtx 970 & i7 (4ghz no oc).",3

"soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo many issues with the lauching i redownloaded 2 times then it worked when i got to single player it was fine then when to play online i got to play for 10 -15 before it crashed and never let me on after that",1
"forget the idiots who perma linked the wrong account. this game is bae",3
"single player game is wonderfull, however, the online component suffers from crippling lag in more places than not. if you have even the mildest of concerns with your online stability, and are only considering this for the multiplayer components, you might want to consider passing....",1
"here comes again after years of releasing, pc version surely immersive, those funs never end.",1
"my friend preordered the game for my and separetly for himself but he only got 1 code which was for himself, i got no code for me neither did he.",3
"spent first 15 minutes watching tv. 10/10 would watch cartoons again",2
"amazing. just amazing. unfortunately my poor fx 6300 has mini strokes trying to play this game lol. looks like its time for an upgrade! 11/10",3
"launcher problem - solved! i had problem with launcher (crash just after log in to social) ive just reinstal my win7 and left much more space for instalation (90gb before, 300 gb now)now game working perfectly! the problem was i think that before when i left 90 gb for instalation i just forget that gtav instal will weigh 60gb but complytly i did not think that game after downloads must unpack and instal and download another paches when ive seen few erroers and monits about no enough space on your disc so i think you have to leave minimum 130 gbor even more. after instalation game weigh 60 gb . enjoy !!! dla wszystkich ktrzy maj problem z launcherem ktry wywala do windy,zaraz po zalogowaniu do social club, crashowa itp, itd , mi pomoga reinstalacja systemu i ponowne zassanie gry z ta tylko rnica e zrobiem zamiast 90 gb wolnego miejsca na dysku a 300 bo podczas instalacji wyskakiway mi bedy o braku miejsca na dysku itd. gra teraz chodzi a mio. pzdr.",1
"this game is so buggy its not even funny. 1. gta online doesnt work at all. 2. steam still says im playing it an hour after i quit it, and guess what? i cant launch it because its already running 3. rockstar offers no support for any of these issues and neither does valve. 4. so many other people are experiencing these same issues, so dont hate me saying oh your comp must be  im a dumbass",5
"oh my days. switching from first person to third person is epic. the graphics are immense and smooth too. well done rockstar north, well done! no wonder you kept putting it back to make it perfect as it actually is! the shooting in first person is as good as any fps out there! im babbling on but its 2:30 am on release date with work in 5 hours but i cant help it im blown away, seriously blown away!",1
"10/10 racist cops. would get shot at for saying hi to an officer as franklin again :(",2
"complete waste of time... bad port from console. they made absolutely no effort to ensure playability for the pc. it runs poorly (compared to games of equal qraphical quality) and it takes forever to load. avoid... or at least wait until its under $10. not worth a penny more.",1
"didnt have an issue installing it. but now this game is being completely  and is opening then deciding to not respond as it loads. i already played it for 4.3 hours and now i cant play at all. its dumb as . fix this , dont release a game that isnt ready you dumb s you should know this by now. ive been a steam member for 8 years and i hate dumb little tiny issues like this.",2
"yeah dont bother atm if youre planning on just playing gta online, it keeps crashing every 5 minutes. edit. game keeps crashing even on single player mode wait for a patch",1
"you can push tourists off the mountain and watch them roll down 13/10",2
"will have to not reccomend this game until mine can be fixed. seems to be widespread. (btw, i do not have speical characters in my name) edit: 54 hours after launch. still broken. tried everything, including a reinstall.",1
"this is a half thumbs up, for now. online is buggy for me. idk how fast things will be updated or even patched. otherwise fun, its gta. gameplay isnt to bad, wait till the price drops wont be long. dont see people playing this non stop, loose your freakin mind!",3
"1010 great game just love this i didnt play in the console so i having realy fun time in the single and in the online thats all i need to say to describe this awsome game was worth the time of the delay",3
"first impression, epic! i can run it in fullhd, on high setting even with my notebook. great polishing r*! finally, a good reason to uninstal dota 2 after 1600+ hours of life stealing.",3
"man, i cant wait to play this game. if only rockstar social club wasnt stuck in f***ing offline mode, i might actually get to play!...rockstar has disappointed me. if it started working i might be inclined to change my review. im glad that the game was delayed three times just so i could buy the ultimate version that doesnt even ing work.",1
"i cant seen to get my social club account to log in i have the correct user name and password",1
"i was happier when this game launched than when my first born child was born",3
"right now, theres a reasonable chance you wont be able to launch the game, or youll be like me and youll have to find an unreasonable workaround. in order to play, i have to turn off my nvidia card, launch the game, and then turn my graphics card back on. wait until its on sale and has been patched.",3
"created very good, but there is some graphical glitches sometimes with beards or your surroundings, but they dont affect the gameplay at all. the story is not very long but it is very entertaining, i have completed 30% of the game and i have 20 hour gameplay in single player (goofing around also)",3
"so far this game looks exquisite. its so exciting to have a game that i can push my pcs limits with in order to have such phenomenal visuals. gta v contains unlimited gameplay and potential gameplay to entertain you. if your pc meets or exceeds the requirements, i highly recommend you pick up this game. if you are looking for a reason to upgrade your rig? gta v wouldnt be a bad reason to do so as well.",2
"ive played a good 50 + hrs of gta v and i need to say one thing all you console peasants eating ice cream while crying at gta v pc videos wanting to play it then u cry to your mom to buy it on a dell laptop run the game message comes up - go build a gaming pc you lazy  ............. one ddownside to gta v when you go into a public match in under 30 seconds you are more or less likely to get ran over by a 100  with an armoured car and sticky bombs over 9000 / 10 ign - inside groovy nans would laugh at console peasants again would get a lap dance in first person again best gaymee evahhh any console players woould say 10/10 would get hacked by lizard squad again :) i spent over 69 (heh...) hours coming up with this  review now im off to help kim jong un set of another mushroom croud bye!!!",4

"playing this rendition in 4k and all settings maxed. r*, you have outdone yourselves on this release. hats off to everyone involved! you guys rock!!!",2
"worth the 60.00 dont see why theres so many neg reviews.....alot seem to be not updated systems... either way great game. worth the money and alot of fun to be had online",4
"the first person mode has really put this game on a whole new level. also lets not forgetting the following: -visually stunning.(4k resolution) -action packed. -brilliant story. -great humor. -massive world. -does a great job to progress the story in a non linear feel. -awesome soundtracks fitting any mood. (gotta love getting into a highspeed chase in a stolen car that just happenes to be playing something fitting to the scene) -hours upon hours of gameplay. -etc. downside: -requires a really powerful pc/laptop to truly appreciate its greatness. -may lead to psychosis ... lol",3
"this game is so good in graphics and gameplay that it can hardly (normal gameplay) or compleatly not (online) run on my computer on the lowest graphics 10/10 would watch my computer explode again",1
"spent 10 minutes running up a hill. got savaged by a mountain lion and died. woke up in hospital 10/10 would mountain lion death taxi again",1
"wow, just... wow, i have played this so much on ps4 so i expected to be bored the first day this was realised, this pc version feels completly different compared to the consoles, it almost feels like a whole new gta game, the graphics are unreal and probably the best graphics i have ever seen in a video game, so easy to run on such high quality, by far the best game av played in years... 10/10 by far. the long painfull wait was woth it!",3
"owned this game for xbox 360, and the pc version is like a brand new game. so much more enjoyable on the pc. playing this at full settings with a gtx 780/ i7 4790k is just amazing. would buy. also, i would use a controller for this game.",2
"the game is simply awesome, the most creative sandbox game you could find on steam. you will get hours and hours with gameplay time, and the port/parallel is awesome. i run the game at steady 60fps with a 780. you can enjoy the game alone or have mega fun with friends in online!",3
"amazing! i have a amd fx-6300 oc@4.3ghz, 12gbs ram,gtx 650ti and i can run this game with some stuff on high and most on normal at over 100 fps sp and mp at 1360x768 i love this game",5
"finished downloading after 3 days straight of not sleeping wasted 10/10 would download again",1
"yes,is cool but it has bugs now and it can be optimized better for laptops at least!!!",1
"just another open world rpg. only 3 classes that are almost the same and also have predefined races that cant be changed. skills level up by doing stuff like running. there is a main story line and a couple of side quests. but no boss fights, only trash mobs the whole game. you can buy a lot of items, but they dont have stats. weapons are mostly ranged and you will get in trouble using melee only. theres only one kind of armor that isnt even visible on the character. good thing so far, there are a lot of different mounts to ride. some of them can also fly but are destroyed quickly if you collide with the level geometry. setting could be interesting if youre bored with fantasy.",1
"plays very smooth, 2x gtx 780 and i5 2500k - 2560x1440 every setting on maximum apart from txaa and it runs and loooks great. accidentally left sli disabled and if it wasnt for the odd drop down to 54 fps i would never have known. so far the game is good fun, city looks nice and had a quick try at multiplayer too which seems to work fine.",1
"everything i have done in my life up to this point has been to prepare my body for this lovely moment. took 1 hour to get into the game after release but it was worth every single second! 10/10",3
"the all-in-one game which includes open world roaming, heists, sports such as tennis & golf, racing and deathmatch. there is nothing more can i ask for.",3
"i have been waiting for 2 days to play this game after launch because my installer wont allow me to sign in with social club saying im not connected to the internet when i clearly am. i have contacted rockstar and have had no reply or any help to fix this problem. complete waste of my money.",1

"love it !! its just awesome the online with couple of friends and just own the city :) 11/10",4
"this social club is ! my game is registered, then it forced me into a neew account, now my activation key is useless, and there is no way to turn back. good job rockstar you ing s! if steam isnt enough to activate a game, maybe you shouldnt be making ing games in the first place.",4
"fourth time buying this game, and i still dont regret it.",4
"i dont think anyone needs any introduction to this game so i will just comment on the port. the game runs perfectly at 60+ fps with all high settings with my gtx 970 sli. the new feature of having your own custom radio station that plays your music is a really great feature, just put your music files or shortcuts (both work) in the user music folder found usually at c:usersyour usernamedocumentsrockstar gamesgta vuser music. after putting the files just perform a quick scan in the in-game audio options and you are ready. my only gripe with this game is that it will be tied to your social club account and in case you lose the account then you wont be able to play the game anymore.",2
"this game is alot of fun, better optimized than many other games in a similar situation. i would not recomend it for anyone with higher than 1gb of vram due to the fact that you will likely have to play at 1440x900p. overall very fun and gta online is amazing.",2
"they really lost their touch since the first civilization game",2
"what can i do?? the game is not openig. always loading - loading. i have win 8,1",1
"edit: as of waking up on the 16th after a format, while gta v loaded all night, i managed to get it running, whether it was a update from rock star or blind luck. good luck guys. launcher has stopped working. have spent over 6 hours doing a lot of different things to try and fix it, even reinstalled over night. dont waste your money. wait for the game to go on sale and the bugs should be fixed by then. edit: ive managed to get the game to update by using rockstars installer program (you can find it on the social club page) but now it just simply doesnt load the launcher, or the game. with this in total ive put about 8 hours into trying to get the game running. if anyones wondering why theres only 0.5 hours its because ive only had to run the launcher for a minute at a time for it to crash, and as of writing this review ive been using the non-steam installer so its not keeping log. ill try to keep updates on anything that fixes the problem for me. any shitposts will be deleted.",1
"this game is so realistic, it taught me you can rob a convencience store with a flare gun!",3
"i was thinking hey imma play gtav until like 10pm or so start playing for a little bit, thought i played a good amount for the night, i was starting to get a littie tired. i check the clock and it said 4:00 am. gg 10/10 ign",2
"problem with log in i can not run the length of time",1
"man id love to be able to play this game, but, it seems like aaa game devs cant put out a title for the pc without it being ed for nearly a month. i, like a lot of other people have been dealing with crashing, constantly. hell, i have only been able to play this game for 5 minutes before it crashed and blue screened my computer. if you are looking to buy this game now, dont, wait at least two months and allow it to be patched then get it.",1
"review in progress: so far in my experience on xbox this game easily wins 9/10 because of how fun it is. many bugs are easy to ignore. however having any amount of lag can  up your experience when being the passenger of a car because the car, like hydraulics, humps the ground. i feel the same on pc. pc includes better giraffics and better gameplay (imo) and its not fun unless you got friends to play with. the only con is that you really need a good pc otherwise you get 30 fps max. tl:dr 9/10",4
"what can i say... its grand theft auto! who wouldnt buy this?!",3
"wow... now i know what playing grand theft auto v on a playstation 6 is gonna look like. 10 / 10 for those who cannot run the game on a notebook, i assume you have some kind of hybrid gpu installation inside. what you need to do is this: disable your external gpu via device manager before hitting the play button. after the launcher starts, activate it back on. this will solve your notebook launcher failure problem. gtx 680m & gtx 680 lightning reported. oh btw, solid 55 - 60 fps with my 680 lightning on very high - high settings with msaax2 on. (i5 3570k @4.2 ghz) i have absolutely no idea how.",2
"this game is simply amazing. you cannot even compare it to the console version. this game is running flawless on launch. this never happens anymore. every game on launch is full of bugs and errors. this game doesnt have that. graphics are unreal. i recommend everyone to go out and buy this game. rockstar goes above and beyond compared to other companies. 10/10.",4
"i find that it often stutters while playing online with a gtx 970 and an fx-8350. also after about half an hour of single player it drops fps. its still a really good game.",2
"while gta v is awesome, it should be known that the game currently has quite a few issues. video for details.",4
"all good..but in few minute i play keep getting this error (err_gfx_d3d_init)",2
"this is a really good game and i have it for xbox 360 and ps4 and i can say this is the best edition even if there are a few problems, i am sure they will fix it very soon.",2
"super great game, still with 20fps and huge lags its super much fun",1
"i preordered since last month, i still cannt play it. its got so many issues.",1
"got arrested for honking behind the cops car. 10/10",4
"gta v? great- a blast to play, pretty, versatile. only complaint is the time it takes to initially load the game. gta online? more bug-ridden than simcopter, but at least simcopter was fun for it. had to reinitialise social club twice, got stuck on a prompt at the end of a tutorial race, tutorial mode refuses to shut off & i subsequently cant join friends in-game, ive had glitches where my character gets stuck moving forward+left (as if id started the game with a joystick nudged to the side), ive been stuck in shopping screens because escape does nothing, typing in chat also triggers any hotkeys in shopping screens, and ive had to alt-f4 a half-dozen times in 2 hrs of gameplay because esc did nothing.",2
"stole a car as franklin and the radio was on east coast classics 10/10 not racist at all",1
"i would love to play gta 5 for my pc. i purchased it for my birthday yesterday and windows 8.1 will not allow windows media player. gta 5 needs it to start. pls fix i need 2 play!!!!",3
"damn after all this waiting, now im finally able to play gta 5 with mouse and keyboard!!",3
"downloaded, played and that i can say? 1.nice. 2.thank you rokstar. 3. i will play it until i will be satisfied than you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"amazing story mode, with an envolving story and memorable characters, along with fluid gameplay, being one of the best single player modes ive ever played. about gta online, it is definitely the best multiplayer out there if you are looking for some fun time white friends.",4
"aside from day one launch problems, gta v on pc is all that you dreamed for and more",1
"i took my time to write this review during the laodingscreen 10/10",2
"i tried to move over to a wall on the building to climb over, but instead i turned and leapt off the roof. 10/10, would learn control system again",5
"performs exceptionally well on 2 660s with 16gb of ram and a i7. lots of fun.",3
"what else can i say?... probably one of the best games ive ever played... so much detail! this is a must have.",2
"this game is ing unbelieveable i ve been impressed you should get it as soon as you can dont waste your money on stupid games like cod buy this game and youll not regret",3
"when i first saw that gta v would come to pcs, i was kind of skeptical, but i bought it anyway. turns out the graphics are amazing, i also realized how ugly  my online character was, and the campaign is still just as fun. oh yeah, and i should mention: no 12 year olds!",2
"great game! a must buy for any previous rockstar fans or new fans alike!!",3
"never had so much fun playing a male rottweiler banging another male dog (in one of franklins missions). onlines working well with all rookies laying around. graphics very optimised. still have stutter problems now and then. other than that......100/10 would always play this superior version.",3
"why are you reading this review? its a great game, you can see that. why havent you bought it yet? play it now.",2
"im running the game with a gtx970, amd fx-8350 eight-core processor with 8 gigs of ram.. and this game crashes out after a couple minutes of playing even if i set it to the games safe mode which puts the graphics as low as they can go, or at least looks that way, looked like i was playing a playstation 1 game and im still crashing because im running low on memory. everytime i get hyped about this game i get kicked down.",4
"on launch the first person mode of this game is unplayable becuase the fov is locked to 60, and on top of that there is horrible mouse lag, no matter what mouse input setting you use. rockstar, it took you 2 years to make this game, and still managed to  it up. i am never going to preorder a game ever becuase of this.",3
"tried to take a selfie, got flattened by a sports car going 100mph 11/10",3
"at least it runs well on my pc. game itself is good. looks a lot better than it does on my nephews ps4. unlike the gta4, at least this one is not horribly optimized. this review would have been a positive had not a certain petty even occured. the moderators of this game are trolls. they ruined my perfect steam account with several bans. i was locked out of steam for a few days pending ban. i wrote a petty post stating too bad p!r*t3s are enjoying the game while we are just stuck with a preload. that comment resulted in ban. then i got in more trouble for contesting it resulting in a temporary lock out of my steam account. forget about steam support. they dont answer calls, and the ticket is a week old. maybe i should not have wrote it, but i dont think it was worthy of a ban of any sort. bottom line dont even say the word p!r*t3 or any other related word in any way. not even in the old definition before we had internet. you could say a racial slur, and nothing will happen to you, you say p*r*cy and bann. seriously though is steam becoming as evil as ea? ps. they keep deleting this review. so my truth must be getting to them. i keep rewording more carefully.",1
"this game is the best grand theft auto i have ever played. (and one of the best games i have ever played) i played it on xbox 36 originally but compared to pc that fealt so stripped down to what it really is and im seeing that now. the story isnt the best ever but it has some intresting characters like trevor, a very well acted out psychopath. the gameplay is great however atleast for me the starter keybinds are a bit wonky. lots to do esspecially if you have never played it before and its your first time playing it ever. the graphics are amazing on almost any graphics level to be honest and its a pretty stable game. the only issue is that for windows users the game tends to wanna crash and have issues. however rockstar did say they would eventually fix this issue and so other than that this game is fantastic.",4
"i can die happy now, i have finally played grand theft auto v",5
"i dont like it because it is too expensive for my country. our average salary is about 180 euro where some money are for food , clothes and bills. that means we cannot afford this even if we wait months . i hope that one day lord gabe newell will read this review.",1
"really well optimized, compared to gta iv, the graphics are amazing, even in the lowest settings, the shadows are unbeliavable, tottaly soft and without pixels. the only bad thing is the lot of problems that came on the launch day. lots of people trying to download, install, open, but without success. i had to deactivate my nvidia gt 630m and use the intel hd graphics 4000 to launch the game, then activate the offboard gpu to run it, because the launcher crashes at every try. worth the money and the wait, but me and tons of people are still waiting for those compatibility fixes. 8/10",2
"is this grand theft auto or grand theft arcade? i purchased this game assuming its an evolution based on gta iv, but they removed the realistic driving/crash/deformation physics. it feels like youre playing a browser racing game. wth? i am not playing this game until either the developers add an option to switch physics to gta iv-style, or until a mod has been released.",1
"absolutely amazing game, was great on ps4 and is a mile better on pc. i understand people have been having a few problems which is kind of understandable, but im sure it will all be fixed pretty soon. (its only my friends that have downloaded though the rockstar client that are having the problems with major bugs like falling though the floor, friends that bought on steam have had no problems with no major bugs. just the traffic bug with cars exploding.) besides the few minor bugs, totally worth the money. must buy. have fun everyone. :)",4
"honestly the best version of gta5 so far and ive played on ps3 and ps4 hands down gta5 was meant to be for pc",1
"im sorry but this game is unplayable i have a geforce gtx 770 and the game crashes all the time for no reason. dont buy it guys.",2
"runs really great, looks really great. its simply amazing, well worth the wait.",2
"it still has some technical issues, nonetheless the game itself is perfect! it runs smooth generally but there are occasional crashes and glitches.",5
"rockstar has made no attempted to fix issues with the games launcher system. currently does not work for lots of users edit* after about 3 hours of installing things, going through forums and checking game files the game started to work, though it shouldve at the beginning. the game is visually stunning even on some lower resolutions and the character switch function, although locked for the tutorials, is super fun to mess with",1
"this is the game we were promised when the ps3/xbawks versions came out. heists give everyone a reason and a way to get wealthy, the fps is acceptable for the pc master race, and the graphics have potential which exceed most mid range rigs capabilities. have not tried online for pc yet but heres hoping the community is slightly less.... aggressively stupid.... then the ps3s was/is.",3
"thanks console peasents for beta testing this for 2 years so we could get a better game than you.....and the best part is no gfwl. pc master race ftw",5
"wow, just wow. everything i and everyone else wanted.",3
"right, so you can disregard a majority of the negative reviews on steam for gta v since rockstar has recently rolled out an update to fix issues related to their launcher, and just go right ahead and click purchase on one of the best (if not the best) games released. theres a reason that metacritic score is so high... ;)",2
"last time i played gta 5 it was on the the playstation 3 and was no were neer as good as the pc version. 24 hours of play time id say its a darn good game. a few graphical bugs but nothing big thats all",3
"0/10 game is one of the best games ive ever played... but the radio tracks dont have a single nickelback song so i cant recommend it.",5
"dont know what to buy in steam and you dont have this game???? buy it!!",3
"this piece of garbage keeps crashing. totally unplayable - crashes as soon as i drive off with lamar on the very first mission. ive had to trouble shoot and research countless message boards with friends who are pc experts themselves and we cannot find a solution - countless hours wasted. the game is playable for them with minor crashes from time to time however. if you do not have time to f**k around like myself,l maybe a wait a while before purchasing this game as it is not 100% complete. there are multitudes of threads online regarding crashes and issues such as: gta 5 pc mega crash thread. utterly dissappointed with this multi million dollar company who could have invested a little more in ensuring a much more successful launch for all. great game? yes it was on the ps3 despite many bugs and issues but it was still playable. but on pc? perhaps wait for rockstar to iorn out the s**t they should have done int he first place and purchase this game when the prices come down.",2
"didnt crash at launch. became charlie scene. dominated server. 10/10 would smoke cactus again.",2
"i didnt chose the thug life, the thug life chose me. 10/10",3
"amazing port! amazing game! edit - also ive seen a lot of people moaning about rockstar support and quite frankly theyre really not that bad. they got back to me within hours when my game started crashing and the things they surgested gave me a 20-40fps boost! also contacted them about an online issue which, admittdly, took about a week for them to respond but they still helped.",3
"lester is the best written character in a video game ive ever seen.",4
"gta 5 is the worst game in the seires,  states obama. kim jong un comments  its prasing 9/11 isis is currently rallying to get it removed from steam",2
"finally, the best game is on my laptop *can barely run* son of a bi- 10/10 would miss one requirement again",1
"story is good graphics is ok. but i cannot recommend its way too buggy",3
"~lf a girlfriend, message me details+hobbies. ~best game of its genre no doubt. if you enjoyed the other gtas then this is a must get (even tho its been out for a while now on console) but now its on pc!!!! bring in the mods!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ~ps: gta4 was kinda dumb except for its graphics and next gen physics and stuff for its time (in other words it didnt really have much content/things to do but storyline and such). gta5 is that but on roids and full of things to doooo!",3
"game is awesome!!! lots of glitching due to the fact its only been out a week but , 9/10 , someone should really make a zombie apocalypse mod",3
"even though im driving along, doing my damn job, and suddenly im flying because every single video card in this house cant perform well on this game and my textures keep dropping out, but rockstar would rather fix golf courses. but hey, i cant stop playing and i dont know why.",4
"brought this game yesterday, im sure its a great game but i have been unable to play it. everytime i click on the icon i get a steam installation come up for a few seconds and thats it...nothing, gtav will appear in my processes for a few seconds then disappear. ive tried installing the social centre manually and running as administrator as a recommended fix but this hasnt worked either. not worth the 40 until its working correctly after installation for everyone.",2
"so far so good, after taking awhile to unpack anyway (to be expected). 1440p max everything including all options under advanced settings and im getting between 45 and 60 fps at all times in the city (havent been to the desert just yet) on a gtx 980 with a light oc and i7-2600k with 8gb memory. no aa though, frames drop to mid 40s with 2x. the game is gorgeous, those saying its not are either butthurt about a technical issue or seriously need their eyes checked. its absolutely night and day from both console versions (i played both ps ones). everything from improved lighting, tessellation, ao, vastly improved shadows and shaders, the works, is inlcuded, and all very customizable. give it a go!",2
"bman1225s hardships in gta:v so far: - i was checking my phone on a side walk and 2 level 80 guys rolled up on me and killed me - i tried to rob a store on a bike and got hit by another player. i went flying off the mountain and died. 10/10 would get hit by another player again",1
"caused my gtx 780 ti to combust 10/10 other than that it ran really smooth and didnt feel like any of rockstars previous ports, so i would recommend getting as long as you have a co2 fire extinguisher nearby otherwise you will be able to cook bacon and eggs on your burning hardware since it is incredibly demanding and taxing on your hardware.",4
"this game has inspired me to rob banks and beat up hookers for the rest of my life. 10/10",2
"i like the feature they added where the game doesnt launch",4
"i do not recomend this game for people that do not have a good pc. i have a  hp, and this game wont render. the game also is so laggy. i have this game for ps3 and i love it, dont get me wrong.",1
"basically a definitive version of console gta with new stuff",5
"its good but you need the recommondatations to this so its good but bad in a good way",1
"no imponte dukes on pc, next gen exclusive cars 0/10  game",3
"i get online a have been booted off fail intiazation says if it presists redownload the game i did twice nothing happend still does it",2
"the new gta on pc a must have for the real gamerz :d",5
"the best of the best. great graphics with great gameplay. you will never be bored while playing this game and as a bonus , it grants 100% chance of a mother screaming get of the computer! at you.",2
"game is not working. support doesnt respond. i could get refund only in 7 days. excellent.",1
"very good job done , runs really nice and looks great",2
"just like all the others - this game is truely amazing. fully topless nudity lapdances (couldnt believe my eyes, as im playing right next to the g/f) to curb stomping crack heads- fully customisable characters & vehicles. gta online is freaking amazing as well. open world w/ 30 players all causing chaos and robbing stores. rockstar really got this one right!",1
"godlike game just best game ever guys, who cant enter it, sorry for you. but you can fix it by your own probably. gta v - awesomeeeee",1
"after the planned release date was put back another 3 months due to game optimizations when the game was realeased all we got was a game that was buggy. this game takes forever just to get into a game, sometimes not even loading at all. fix your god damn game rockstar",2
"50/10, flawless, beautiful graphics, spectacular open-world visuals with hugely impressive render-distance with low specification requirements, awesome online gameplay, a seemingly heavy weight game that is suprisingly light weight, highly entertaining and incredibly enjoyable gameplay. this game has everything youll ever need. except for zombies, but forget that - zombie games are old and lame, i mean cmon how original >>>lets all get a buzz like little girls by looking at scary faces and pooing our pants... errr no its not scary its just sad and gay, haha just joking, it is my personal opinion though. the most scary thing in this planet is chin-chin (search filthyfrank on youtube). im more than happy in the online trolling sandbox world of infinite-possibilities that is gta 5. (+ it installed fine for me with no problems)",3
"finally game works. some patches were made and now my game runs perfectly. i own a gaming laptop: msi dominator gt70, 8gb ram, intel i7 4810qm 2.8ghz, nvidia geforce 870m 3 gb vram great game. good response from rockstar. for other rigs configurations, i dunno.",2
"loading loading loading loading play this game if you love to endlessly load a game. this is so godamn annoying, all you do in this game is load. - get an invite to a heist - join it - loading loading loading - its full! quit it ! - loading loading loading loading loading - get in invite for a mission - join it, players are using different targeting, would u like to use it? accept - loading loading loading loading loading - its ing full would u like to quit - loading loading loading loading loading - invite for a setup - join it - players are in an active mission would u like to spectate hell no, quit it - loading loading loading loading 30 minutes later ive still not done a single ing thing but loading!",1
"incredibly bad customer support. dont buy it from steam because if you do the customer support will just tell you is your problem when your activation code doesnt work. my story: bought the game---excited and ready to play---installed the game---activation code require---no problem, activation code entered---activation code invalid---scratch my head, lets try it again---activation code invalid---keep trying...---45 mins later contacted customer support---waited 12 hours for their reply---reply received, says please ask your actual seller for another set of activation code, which is steam itself.---i raged---story end.",2
"rockstar more than made up for gta iv with this awesome port. everything works exactly as expected, and i have a stable 60 fps with a gtx 970 on very high! awesome!",4
"decent game with a broken horrible multiplayer. they dont allow for dedicated servers, causing a lot of latancy issues, and there are a lot of game breaking bugs such as the infamous unpatched heist bug. untill rockstar stops being  this will be a negative review.",4
"the best version. thanks to beta testers with consoles.",2
"most likely will be the best golf & tennis simulation game of 2015.",2
"i dont know if i can run ultra, but fantastic looking game on high. the game is smooth, looks great and is a huge improvement from the consoles. good buy, you wont regret it!",1
"flawless victory. i feel bad for the people who couldnt get it started. seems to be user error to me, i went off without a hitch. my only complaint is that the resolution settings are glitchy. it takes some playing around to get it to stick with full screen.",4
"havent managed to launch it without crashing, but im sure its fun!",1
"thanx for console players they improved the pc version by your money 10/10",1
"just excellent! i didnt suppose that this game will run on my pc, because it is a normal thing nowadays when minimum requirements for the game are just meaningless - there is a very little chance that it will at least launch. however, i was very impressed when i saw a nice optimization - stable 30-50 fps in fact, that every spec of my pc is just as the same as the minimum requirement (i5-2320 3.0 ghz, gtx 550ti, 4 gb ram). the game itself is the best thing ever done for the whole gaming industry - not more not less. rockstar did its job well. 10/10.",3
"do not buy this game if you have nvidia graphics card due to the fact that it wont work this is a rip off-we wait for so long to have the game on pc and i does not even work its a joke screw you rockstar",1
"grand theft auto v has some of the best characters youll see in a video game to date",3
"one of the best games of all time, with the pc port it deserves. wait for more mods to come out, and this game is easily worth paying $150 for. if you call yourself a gamer, you owe it to yourself to play gta 5. a must buy.",1
"awesome, this game is awesome. the graphics, everything!",1
"games good, but after 30 minutes or so i get crazy stuttering/lurching/hitching/frame drops/whatever you want to call it. the game runs at a stable, silky 60fps for a half hour or so, and then itll start lurching down to 30-40fps at random intervals every few seconds until i restart the game. usually itll start after ive driven somewhere fast, but once it starts i can be sitting stationary in a safehouse and itll still continue unabated. i run a 660ti and i7 3770 with 8gb of ddr3 for anyone who cares, but its not a hardware issue: ive been reading around forums with people with identical issues who run the whole gamut of available hardware configurations, from amd to intel and nvidia, from high-end to low-end. just be aware that until they fix this, buying this game is a roulette of performance irrespective of the power of your setup: maybe youll get lucky and be in the majority who find it smooth, or maybe youll be condemned to frame stutter hell like me and a bunch of other people. ill edit this review to recommend this game when they fix the problem.",4
"downloading is one thing, unpacking is another but still... its worth the wait.",4
"its gta on pc! an awesome port with great graphics options! it will run on a potato!!",2
"at first i was going to give this a thumbs down for its social club issues but this game is great! overview grand theft auto v for the pc is finally here and it does not disappoint one bit! being released in 2013 for ps3 and xbox 360 consoles and then ported over to ps4 and xbox one in 2014, 2015 brings us another port of gta v on pc. this is clearly the best version. pros 1. settings, all of the settings! 2. beautiful game regardless if you are running it on lowest settings. 3. rockstar made the game very optimized for many computers alike, whether its barely on system requirements or is on maximum. cons 1. social club tends to be buggy at the moment. final verdict 10/10 runs smoothly, ign.",2
"with new update is very very good! 60 euro for something good!",2
"the optimization of this game is wonderful, there is no lag, no frames skips and none of that type of thing. the level of detail on the normal texture quality setting is surprisingly amazing will be difficult to manage all those screenshots :p",3
"great game, the more people the better. hopefully, rockstar will patch the game regularly and continue to improve on the performance so that i stop seeing dips in frame rates.",3
"rockstar did a really good job on this. the delays seem to have paid off. the game runs completely maxed out (ultra settings @ 1920x1080) on my laptop (gtx 780m 4gb sli) and i get 40-60 fps. oh and the game is really fun too, a huge improvement from gta iv. i dont think i need to talk much about the game because everyone on earth knows its great already + huge improvement over grand theft auto iv + runs smooothly on mid range pcs + first person mode is amazing + entertaining characters and story + no glitches at all yet = co-op in the story mode would have been cool - first person mode doesnt work good for most missions",2
"got 7 hours in, and already know im going to play for much, much longer! this game lives up to the hype for this pc version esp. if you went in cold like i did. perchasing this game is the best $60 dollars ive spent in a while.....other then the internet bill :....",5
"i really hope they fix it,and i cant wait to upgrade my pc and play it",1
"paying $80 just for seeing the game crashes all the time",1
"shot a cat and alerted the neighborhood. 10/10 recommended",4
"notice: some customers are experiencing issues installing or playing gtav due to a windows user account name error. click here for details on how to workaround the issue. ^^^^ nah m8 my download is 2 sik",2
"this game gives you exactly what you want in real life. the ability to kill a random colored person on the street and then hide from the cops behind a trash can. 10/10 would kill again.",1
"i love this game.there are way too many things that are great about it to even know where to begin. but just to start there was obviously a huge amount of time and thought that went into this the open world is not only vast with tons of things to explore but its also well thought out and interesting not just huge and the graphics of this game are incredible and the physics....well let me finish by saying if i could only buy a single game this year it would have to be this one.....enjoy!!!",2
"plays very smooth, 2x gtx 780 and i5 2500k - 2560x1440 every setting on maximum apart from txaa and it runs and loooks great. accidentally left sli disabled and if it wasnt for the odd drop down to 54 fps i would never have known. so far the game is good fun, city looks nice and had a quick try at multiplayer too which seems to work fine.",1
"i love thus game but i can not figure out why windows keeps turning the app/task down.",2
"best grand theft auto game to date! the first person view definately makes it a whole new game. the only bad thing is that its hard to control a vehicle when driving or flying in first person but with the oculus rift coming out i think this game will only get better.",1
"by far the gta series is one of my favorites game franchises. gta v is the most expansive of all of them. a two year game im already familiar with from the peasant consoles. the pc version is an amazing remaster of the game, with insane graphics, smoothness, and whatnot. with a great story with three protagonists, awesome gameplay, and soundtrack. the online multiplayer is by far the best of the series. at first it is confusing how the lobbies work, but you get used to it. my only con about this game is the, incredibly, lengthy loading screens. but i guess thats what you can expect for a 60gb game.",4
"great game and graphic than gta iv.. but i have a problem, cant even launch gta v with my windows 8.1, installed it not on the same system hd.. after i reinstall windows 7 ultimate on my new harddrive, it works like a charm, please fix this annoying bug.. but yeah like the previous version, gta is always fun to played..",1
"runs great on my computer (was built to game, but is getting older (i have a 7880 2gb, just above the recommended)), but i could get better preformance in this game. i have to play around with the graphics settings just a bit, but its fine for now. plays well with no crashes, even testing with a 360 controller (yeah, i played it on console, now cant use kb&m for this game because it doesnt feel right). the first person is pretty good, the extra music and car customization is pretty cool, and thank jeezooz there is an option for custom music again! so far, ive only played 1.1 hours, but i plan to find my graphics settings that i need and port over my old characters. and also play online. waaaaaaayyy too much online.",2
"simply stated, gta 5 is the best pc game of all time.",4
"watched chomp hump on some dog at 60fps 10/10 worth the 2 year wait",3
"i think dis game needs review sow.. game is very bad it doesnt even work on my $200 laptop wow thats really sucking very bad",3
"its gta v pc bro, what the f*** did you expect????",3
"failed a mission during a benchmark test. 10/10 - will gladly watch benchmark fail future missions too!",1
"definitive edition by far. best pc port of a game ive seen by far. no bugs that ive seen so far. i was able to port my ps4 characters over with no problems. graphics are top of the line, im running at 1080p 60fps on almost max settings (i think i only have one thing that is not set to max) it runs smooth. i loved this game when it first came out and im ready to relive the experience all over again.",1
"the way they decided to start up gta 5 on a persons pc os very poor. there are glitches and problems with the start up. i cant even acess my game becasue they couldnt find a decent way to start the game.",1
"the game itself is great. i expected to be able to at least run it on minimum settings and for the most part its reasonable. still looks better than console with shadows being the only issue. the glitches and speed of launch/ loading will probably be fixed soon. it does freeze up a bit luanching the game but i just get a snack and its loaded when i come back, probably 2 minutes at most. gameplay is fantastic, i love the story (never bothered getting it for console) and there are so many interesting things to do in the game world. if you are very impatient and expect a lot from your setup, maybe wait a few weeks for the glitches to pass. but if you can handle a bit of lag, a few glitches, and dont care too much about flawless performance, definitely buy this ultimate edition of gta 5",4
"so much better than console i mean its not withoutt its bugs but im having a blast online with my gaming community as well as single player in first person",5
"great fun with friends in online as well as the impeccable gtav on its own. it would be a sin to say this isnt the best version of gtav on the market.",2
"hello im sethoz22. i stream sometimes on twitch. i was waiting for few months this famous gta v on pc. the game is trully amazing in first person. i have some graphical issues due to my old cpu but its still a good game. its like a real-life simulator when you play in first person. i recommend this to everyoone who didnt buy the game already.",5
"so i have been playing for a couple of hours and i can only say this. the console versions was beta tests for the pc version. this game is gourgios works perfectly performance wise and only takes a few tweeks to make the fps view mode work perfectly! if you liked san andreas and have not played a gta game since then this should be your next gta game :)",2
"you can steal bikes as a black dude 5/5 recommended",2
"i will not waste my time commenting how great this game is, as many people have experienced on the ps/xbox already. all i want to say is that unlike some heart-corrupted devs, rockstar did a great job in game optimization on pc. even a low-stat old-fashioned pc like mine could run this game smoothly. gj rockstar! 20/10",5
"install the game ready to play rockstar say:put the code i put the code and says code already used now i am like seriously bro -_- report valve report rockstar",1
"finally managed to install it without getting lag/fps drops. love the game, of the best gta games ever made.",2
"the launcher doesnt even work. are you kidding me, rockstar???",3
"so as well you all know gta has always been a good game but the pros: linking your steam account to the sony account online works now good graphics from what ive seen so far heists work cons: i have to spam launch the game to get it to work it takes forever to launch sometimes it wont even launch at all its crashes a lot as well",3
"thanks to this game i now know that when the gta6 trailer for consoles will come out, i will be able to play that game on pc in the next 3 to 5 years. 10/10",5
"when i launch the game, its says im playing then nothing happens and im suddenly not playing. no word from rockstar about a patch and none of the community fixes worked for me. i wouldnt purchase gta v until rockstar makes an official statement. although, from what ive seen on streams the game looks and runs great but the launch issues overshadow the good.",2
"awesome game!! the gameplay is insane!! a lot of fun great story i love the cars and the sounds.",2
"9.5 hours of pure crashing launcher epicness. do not buy till it gets patched. crash reason: mov dword ptr [0], 0 gg rockstar.",2
"the best game on the best platform insures and secures gta vs crown to be the best entertainment software ever for the next decade. key pros: graphics settings (lots of options) realistic scale story on pc would recommend to aliens xd",2
"i neet the minimum requirements and my game still runs like cow a-s-s",1
"this is my first time ever reviewing a game. ive come from console gaming to pc, which ive had this game on ps3. i can only say its way much better i dont have super highend graphics like most people do on here but im playing on high settings with 30 fps which is pretty good considering im not too worried about having mind blowing performance.",3

"say goodbye to school simulator 2015 10/10 would ditch school everyday",2
"i run this with my 2013 laptop perfectly fine... im way lower than the minimum... 10/10",2
"the overall design of the game or a good personal feeling good play a lot especially ol mode gives the player more play options personally feel that the only drawback is that the log ol model is not very stable often appear offline mode but also unable to connect! a lot of players have also appeared in this situation do not know is the server slag r star or because the network causes!",4
"best game i ever played from feeling to story! graphics are just wow",2
"good game! funny dialog! good graphics! well optimised! pc-version runs without problems for me!",1
"i skipped class to play this game..... still dosnt work been trying every trouble shoot for 4 hours and still no solution.. i crash right when im in launcher and i have a more then capable pc...... thanks rockstar even battlefield 4s launch didnt have as many bugs as this!",3
"on my first day of playing gta v, i realized this game is about freedom to do whatever you want. after completing 1,2 missions, i decided to hit the golf course at about 10:30 pm. a sharp pain in my right eye broke my concentration and ive messed up the shot. alas, when i looked upon the cellphone clock, it was 4:30 am and my eyes were bleeding. but i honestly cant remember when i had so much fun in life, and i have a pretty cool life too, cant complain. the thing is, there is so much to do, so much to see, im guessing its gonna take me 100+ hours to see it all. every ride reveals beautiful, realistic eye candy that just puts a smile. dont believe me? grab a chopper or a plane and gain some altitude, then look down on the city. it feels so alive, every car driving with a purpose, every pedestrian doing his own thing. this is so much more than a video game, its the video game. its a life simulator that it sadly, way more fun than real life. p.s. one of the best optimised games for pc ever. looks and plays wonderful. i have to sleep now, or ill die.",4
"watched trevor fall over a fence in 60fps 11/10 waited too damn long, not even mad.",3
"the game crashes constantly. i have tinkered with all of my settings and my pc should easily be able to handle it. i cannot recommend this product as it is simply not working for me.",3
"has sh*itload fo bugs and glitches that makes the game a bit more than bearly playable. the most annoying one is crash when finishing first heist. would still recommend. (im a (happy) preorder scrub)",5
"best loading screen simulator ever! i love watching loading screens -ign",1
"would be great if it would ing work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"best port ever, works so well. is bloody beautiful. tons of gameplay to be had in singleplayer or gta online. gta online has plenty of fun game modes, shooting is awesome with no  auto aim from consoles. its all manual aim here! insane game.",3
"game is great the thing is the servers dont have west or east coast server, and the bad thing is we are playing with russians. chinese, japanese, people around the world, when they host a game we lag like  while they dont lag at all",5
"a solid port, not much better than console version but run smoothly ... as long as you dont mind rockstars ing social club. nothing more exhilarating than twisting your thumbs while staring at the loading screen for hours since the game cant load past scs authen check. on gameplay: single is ok, as expected of a gta game. multi is okayish but somewhat misleading. the famous open world gta is known for is no more than a glorified lobby, every match brings you to a separate match instance. nothing new since the game is already 2 years old but if you are like me who didnt bother reading up on the game before purchasing, its something to reconsider. tl;dr: tic tin th ng mua, crack m i cho c vic. update: third day in, and the game still refuses to load past the initial loading screen. this pile of shiet is officially the worst purchase in my collection after rome ii total war. if you can, dont buy it, but pirate it. a port is still a ing port.",1
"while technically a great game, i cannot recommend it to people like myself who have grown up with the series and find themselves with much less time to indulge than when they were young. i just find myself not really getting into the game as i did when i was young doing random  just isnt as satisfying anymore.",1
"im only gonna giving this 11/10 because of all the fun ive had.",4
">disable gpu >star launcher >enable gpu >game starts rinse and repeat every time im gonna play. 9/11 would bomb again",1
"dont buy this game if you want to have fun with friends. you wont make it past the tutorial that takes multiple hours of you guessing where to go since you actually recieve no tutoring. if you want to spend hours doing the same thing over and over go for it, otherwise stay away.",1
"this, game is amazing, even if you played the console version(s) i recomend you pickup the pc version. i have had no bugs and its great. 10/10 - must buy",3
"awesome game good graphics id love to play this game more :d",2
"wont launch, this is what we get after two years.",2
"get sick looking cars - 10/10. get all the weapons and guns my heart desires - 10/10. get all the secrets and easter eggs - 10/10. get hella rich off of stock market - 10/10. bang hookers - 0/10 (dont want them aids). rob a store - 10/10. get a car wash like no other car wash game - 10/10. overall - 11/10 would buy again",2
"worth every second of wait entailed, the polish and performance is mind boggling",3
"cant run the game because of a missing .exe file broken download broken launcher 10/10 would play again thank you rockstar",5
"so imagine gta v on 360/ps3 was like the meal youve waited for all your life that tasted a little raw, but it was a good meal, yknow? then, youve got the ps4/one version that is the same meal cooked ever so slightly better, yet youre still hungry. this version is like, the real deal. the main entre. the dish youve been truly hungry for your whole life. and it may have taken a little longer for it to be done but you craved it even more. in the end, this is the most delicious meal of your life. you get everything and more, especially for those who can crank up to 11 (4k resolution, baby) even if youve bought this game before and thought youve done it all, dont overlook this well optimized glorious experience that will make your return to los santos ever so sweeter.",2
"way better on the pc than ps4 and xbox! graphics are 10x times better, make sure you do the driver update today for this game! nothing better then blowing crap up with your friends on the master pc race! tanks, helicopters and big explosions!",1
"50+ hour interactive movie that you can enjoy at your own pace - in one of the most open and beautifully detailed playing environments you can get in a modern game.",3
"i hear everywhere that people cant launch this game. people, if you cant even launch the game its probably because your computer isnt good enough. this game works like a charm, both singleplayer and multiplayer, which comes as a shock because i expected gta online to be unstable for a week at least. never mind that. game is great, franklin is black, michael is best character, end of story.",4
"gta online ed up to save my character, now i have ing lipgloss and fake eyebrows. 11/10",5
"two years still wasnt enough to prepare me for 60fps",3
"the game for the most part runs perfectly fine on medium to high graphics, my issue is that after about 60-90 min of playing i get this wierd stutter occuring, i have an amd r9 270x and an i7 4770k and did not expect this kind of issue, anyone else having this problem please let me know. edit: dld amds most recent beta drivers (15.4) works perfectly now.",2
"! just play it, for the sake of humanity why are you even reading reviews?",3
"aside from the issues with installing the game, i give gta 5, easily, 5/5 ign, 10/10 gamespot, 6/6 demongaming. holy crap i think this is one of the best gtas so far. the optimization is better than i expected with the graphics, and since i waited since the pc version was announced, its even more legit to me now. see everyone online hopefully :)",2
"pro and cons after playing 10 minutes, i was really satisfied with franklin and lamar giving the game 10/10 n****",2
"absolutely amazing, gtx 770, i7 4770 and 16 gb ram, 90-110 fps without vysnc on high settings. runs amazingly. alot more control then console version. 9/10 (online has some errors). excellent release rockstar :d",2
"f***ing double drm bs with an unitutative setup, and they couldnt solve that in the month long delay. this is worse than the old series because i have to setup an account link my soical club account to my steam account then god knows what. this is terrible.",3
"finally! i dont have to go bowling with roman ever again!!!",2
"its wicked fun. playing at 60fps is amazing and its still a great looking game. it does use alot of vram so be prepaired for that. other then that its a great buy.",2
"game is great and optimization is better than expected right on launch day. great game! love it 9.5/10",2
"i remember the day when my friends told me id never experience gta 5 on the pc when it first released, i kept my comments to myself, knowing that when gta iv released it took them 9 months for it to come over to the pc. 2 years later i pre-odered the game, hoping and praying this game wouldnt turn out terrible....and to my surprises, with some of the launch problems, and rubber banding during online play, rockstar really did make this game one of my favorite games of all times. it runs flawless on my gaming pc, it isnt a beastly rig, has medium specs to it, but damn even with all my graphics set to normal/high, the game runs 40-50 fps in cities, and over 60 in the mountains and blaine county. online is funny as hell, playing with friends is amazing, running from the cops, to holding up store clerks for money, to heists, they really have made the best version of gta 5 possible. if you already havent purchased this game, open your wallets and buy it now. if you asked for a refund, buy the game again. this is the best game of the year for me, and i will be playing it years from now with friends, and i promise you its worth every minute, hour, and dime you put into it.",4
"i get better performance in gta v on release than i get in gta iv now and gta online worked at launch, good job rockstar.",4
"warning! do not buy this game at the moment! wait for patches! not worth getting a ing broken piece of  right now. now that ive vented ill be more detailed. this game is amazing truly is. some of the best graphics i have seen since alien isolation. the damn thunderstorms in this game alone make me cream my pants. however im getting crashes every god damn 15-20 minutes of play time. i can not see how after multiple delays this game is still not release ready. i trust rockstar that they will fix these issues in a good amount of time. but once again this game proves that 1 you should never pre-order a damn game and 2 that the launch of games nowadays means at least 1 month of patching will most likely fix things. buy the game a month from now when its actually finished. it sucks a lot because i really want to play the story which is the main reason i bought the game i love the storylines in all of the gta games and this one seems like the best so far. ill just have to wait a bit longer than i hoped to enjoy this game. release rating: ing poor as . expectation rating: classic...when its fixed.",1
"its great cause my modest rig can run this at 1080p 60 fps, the game is very well optmized",3
"i stole a car, in san andreas i stole a bike. 11/10 would upgrade again.",3
"everybody knows grand theft auto games are awesome and this game is no different. chances are if youre reading reviews for this game on steam, its probably to see if they actually optimized it and if it runs smoothly for pc. the answer is yes. it runs flawlessly. all sorts of fancy settings you can adjust to tweak your gameplay experience. bravo rockstar - you havent disappointed with this one.",1
"absolute blast to play. certainly worth the wait. graphics are slick, game play is perfect. occasional online hiccups, but meh, to be expected sometimes, especially this close to launch. getit, get it now!",3
"my pc was fully updated before installing the game i started the game and it worked perfectly as i was not expecting it to run smoothly the game it self is fun to play there is no good tooltip and hints to help you during ur game play and this is theonly bad thing so far!! what i recommand everyone iis that they turn on the in game subtitle as the dailogs are extreamly good and perfectly made that is the most thing i loved",4
"i love this game, the graphics omg the best i came from ps3 to pc and i am loving it i recommend people to buy such a fun game to play you wont regret it. :d",3
"3rd time i bought it, was it worth as much as ive shelled out? i guess if you havent played it i highly recommend it and if you have played it i highly recommend it.",1
"i own this on ps3 / ps4 / pc. i think thatsays enough about how much i love this game...",2
"looks like a great game but crashes everytime i open it, and i do meet the requirments. so annoying to spend money on something that constantly crashes. annoying",1
"finally here... amazing graphics, maybe the best ones in the gta v, it is well optimized, super good and i recomend it! :d wow 60-70 fps, im running this game at high-very high settings at a resolution of 1920*1080, which it is a laptop and it runs it very smooth: i7-4710hq gtx 860m 2gb 8gb ram",2
"when you first come into the story line, you will meet a little kitty in the street corner. i tried to hold that cat and pressed some keys, instead touching the kitty the character i controlled kicked the kitty. and its dead. definitely the worst gaming experience in my human life. yes i am a kitty lover. highly not recommended.",2

"as michael, i went jogging somwehere in the desert. suddenly, i was attacked by a cougar, and got killed before i managed to draw my weapon. 10/10 would die again <3 <3 <3 <3",3

"yes this game is the best ive got it on all my consoles xbox 360 xbox one ps3 ps4 and its a really great game! you should buy it if you have money and download it then play it!",1
"wait till all the issues are resolved. pro: - amazing graphics -fun!!!!!!!!!!!!! -online gameplay -cars,bikes,helicopters,planes,boats -mansions,appartments cons: - tons of issues and glearing buggs (as to be expected) - stuttering - connectivity issues , crashes - hours of hair pulling",2
"after years of waiting we finally got it - the holy grail of self indulgence. was this masterpiece worth the second wait? you can absolutely bet on your life. welcome to los santos once again. michael, trevor and franklin have been waiting for you. new vehicles to drive. new missions to explore. new weapons to play with. new properties to buy. new wildlife to discover. new online events, modes and extra content. new overhauled engine improving graphics, textures and world population density. not to mention a huge menu for graphical optimization, it is truly impressive. if you previously had or have a rockstar social club account you can transfer all of your previous data into your new game. this is the definitive edition of gta v and it feels so good to finally play. 15/10",4
"the game itself is amazing! it is fun as hell. in terms of performance, it runs like a charm. i heard the 750ti was able to get a 50 to 60fps on high 1080p. the downside are the current drivers : they arent too get yet. it may take another month for amd to release better drivers. performance is good but stuttering and fps drops can occur - they are rare though. there is also an issue with system ram. if you play for about 2 hours, your ram will start to fill up. this maybe a slow memory leak. it sucks for those who have less than 8gb. hell, i have 8gb and this ram issue occurs within 2 to 3 hours of play.",2
"my pc met all requirements the only question mark was gpu which is integrated, it will still run and smoothe though rockstar really did a good job with this. i can tell they made full use of the delay times they had, with my integrated graphics card i shouldnt be able to run it but i can. however that will be upgraded today. was well worth the wait rockstar great job on making the pc version. ps. which is not a port it was developed with the main game side by side",5
"cannot start the game - and no help can be found. i just want my money back.",1
"rammed jet into a skyscraper. 9/11 would attempt again.",3
"waited for the pc version for eighteen months - only played the intro but the game is gorgeous on max settings and runs very smoothly. disregarding the 60 gb download, i dont get the technical issues people are having. stop using toasters and ridiculous windows user names.",1
"i attempt to start it up and social club refuses to let me log in and play on offline mode or do anything thing. ive been looking for a way to get a refund and cant.",1
"this is a game. you install it and play it and enjoy the ride.",1
"well, i guess it is like all the rest of the gta games sp atleast, and if you like the other games you will like this... me however i have tried the mp and it is beyond s**t imo, im glad a friend of mine bought it for me, becouse i would not put a cent of it in to this game, not even 2 hours in it and im fed up with it already.",1
"downloaded the game was hyped as . and then? well the game starts....well thats waht my steam profile says....for about 3 seconds and nothing happens after that. i am so happy to pay 60 for an icon . extra:- yes, my pc has the requirements - no, i dont use anything other than the abc in my windows-name - yes, r* still has nothing to say about this bug (they should move, there are 80 pages in the steam forum regarding thi issue.",2

"this isnt a review. just a statement. this game is awesome!!!",4
"great pc port imo, graphics look amazing in ultra. hope this shows other games how to do a pc port well, and that it can be done well at that.",3
"great game, 10/10 would wait two years again. this game runs mostly off your graphics card ram so if youre wondering how to allocate more to it, you cant.",2
"good port and and for the price you get your moneys worth thats for sure, so many aaa games release at the same price point and offer nowhere near the amount of time and enjoyment spent in gta 5.",4
"grand theft auto v launcher has stopped working/10",2
"this game is freaking awesome. i have it totally maxed out at 1920 x1080, at a steady 60. it has absolutely breathtaking visuals. it has been very friendly so far with crossfire 7970 lightnings. no issues at all. no flickering or other sli/crossfire common issues. it fired right up and worked great! i played about 10 minutes and was amazed, all the time after that was even better. first person view is so awesome. so much easier to drive. when i got to my safe house, moms house i am guessing, first thing i did was sit on the couch to watch the hilarious tv shows rockstar always puts on, my guy smoked a huge dank  jay, and started talking to himself. then i went to the gunshop and purchased a .45 automatic and a cqc submachine gun, there are a ton of mods, such as sound suppressors, optics, and all things that are good. next on my list is to bang some hookers and then get my money back with my .45 automatic. this game is sweet. 10/10 all around. graphics 10/10 gameplay 10/10 weed dankness 10/10 controls 10/10 (a lot to remember.) guns 10/10 physics 10/10",2

"this is my shortest review ever. why? because. there are no words for gta v except one. masterpiece.",3
"dont know whats all the hate about. the game is extremely well-optimized having no trouble playing it at a steady framerate. pc master race!!!",4
"this games running capability is like my employment status, not working",3
"cool game would buy 5 million times but i dont need that many copies",2
"i was playing gta: online the other day, then i killed some random guy and i had only pistol ammo. after that he killed me with his scoped rifle couple times, i got angry at him. then i went to ammu-nation and spent over 30,000$ on marksman sniper rifle, extended clip, ammo and body armor. then i killed him once and drove off, after all that, i did not have enough money to buy a turbo for my car. gg 10/10 - would shoot a random guy again.",2
"you need about 5 years of downloading this game. but the first time running over a hooker in your undies while playing trevor. priceless. 10/10 would run over again",3
"this would be a good game if it wasnt so buggy. online is almost impossible when theres bugs going on all the time. game crashes randomly. ive looked up specs and my machine exceeds requirements. character will stop right when opening door to get into car as if hes frozen in time, wont get in car. they made heists online so you have to have 4 people for most of them, most of the time you have an impossible time getting enough people to join your heist or even stay long enough to get it going, you need to have 3 people you know and are friends with on rockstar online to get a game going well. game crashes randomly and theres bugs. oh did i mention bugs? quit putting out games when you havent ironed all bugs out. patch this pos plz, and soon!",2
"its disgusting that such a great product is released with major bugs. i paid for it, and i cannot use it. and as it is already installed, steam has stolen my money. its ...",2
"absolutely fantastic game, horrible optimization for online, game lags on even the most high end computers for a large portion of the gta community. just play the single player for now, do not even bother online with all the errors like having to do a tutorial that never ends and it dissalows you to buy homes in game and other features. hopefully these errors get fixed soon.",3
"first time playing on pc was with pesants for 2 months before it got released first frakin group all had mics and we even teamworked all the way through humane raid from the coke the insurgent the harrier and so forth we became the expendables 5 got into the first harrier and all i heard was highway to the dangerzone and so before any of my teammates got off the platform into their jets all aircraft was gone one of our team members even sounded like jet li and even did a quote exactly like him in the last raid but 10/10 would top gun again!",3
"very well made game, if you havent played this already id highly recommend it.",5
"absolutely perfect. gta online is such a chaos world and it is really excited. with my gtx 850m and normal setting but the graphic are still more realistic than my city and 45 - 52 fps is just a fantastic expirement.",5
"finally i can give that game a thumb up awsome game, its even more awsome if you can play it with smooth 60fps the borderless fullscreen mode seems causing mircostutters, so try avoid it until they patch it",3
"amazing, amazing and amazing. best game of the century. thank you!",2
"was gonna withdraw some money in atm... .....got hit by a rocket is this real life?",5
"a shining example of what thorough development times and attention to detail can achieve. also a fantastic port with a ton of pc-specific options. i will gladly wait longer for a games release if it means that they will all be of the quality and standard of this game.",3

"a masterpiece on last gen, a masterpiece on this gen, and a godlike masterpiece on pc. one of the best games ive ever played. its grand theft auto, what do you expect? oh, custom radio station with your own music. that feature alone makes it worth the rebuy. 10/10 100/100 1000/1000. now go get rid of that yee yee  haircut!",2
"very fun game ..... i am pretty sure you knew that tho !",2
"yay new update, i can play this game now!!! its an awesome game, there is so many stuff that can happen and you can do anything. this game may be heavy but it is worth the money. i recommend this game.",2

"it was 60 dollars for a 60 gb game, the way i see it 1 dollar per gb is pretty good for the fun i am getting out of this",2
"its a huge step up from ps4 and such. the pc version shines with color and view. textures are amplified and crisp and even a low end gpu can handle most tasks. my gtx 780 runs everything maxed out at 60 fps now that is a deal.",1
"the best gta yet that rockstar created. i deff recomend it to those who wants to or like to play open world game. i give this game 98 of meta score.",3
"if you love running over hoes with a muscle car. this is your game! overall: i r8 8/8 m8, its just gr8.. i could masturb8 on this game.",2
"sold my cs:go knife and bought this, 10/10 would sell again.",3
"i pulled an old lady out of her car and beat her to death with a hammer. 8/8",1
"1.5 million for purchasing early is a lie..allow me to clarify: if you want the full amount.it is a lie..you cannot get 1 million of it unless you pvp!!!!!...pvers were only given 500k!!!!!....this is a total misrepresentation of what was to be when sold ...if developers/reps will lie this early then game isnt worth it",4
"me like very much me special boy me recommend me good game",3
"got three stars for robbing a convience store and continued to be chased by a helicopter while i was on foot. 10/10 excessive force",2
"been playing this on the ps3 and the ps4, but wasnt able to finish the campaign.. i guess you save the best for last? i tell you the pc version is the best! awesome graphics! very well done rockstar! the game is optimized very well!!!",2
"went in game killed some cops then drove a sports car ran over some people went to strip club got a lap dance took the stripper home and ed her brains out 69/10 would thug life again!!!",5
"extremely frustrated, there is a huge community of people including myself who have bought the game and it does not work, start, or function in any manor. by huge i mean 1/3 users. will never buy a rockstar game again. there are no fixes for amd users with issues, some fixes for nvidia users. 0 luck for amd, no excuses rockstar.",1
"ive accumulated 24 hours on this game already. out of the four days ive owned this game i have only spent three actually living my life...",3
"awesome game just love it but i wish if rockstar incresses the sessions players size",2
"i am not sure if i am the only one experiencing this problem but this game stutters as soon as i start driving, basically when i move around quickly. i tried to turn down graphics settings and optimized it through geforce experience and still experiences the same thing. i opened up fps counter and it started above 100fps (im running 3 gtx980s with 144ghz), so is my cpu the issue? i have a i7 4790k @ 4ghz so really? an i7 couldnt run this game smoothly?",2
"ubisoft has to learn from rockstar how to optimized games.",2
"best grand theft auto ever!! holyshit. worth your money. xd",2
"didnt expect it to be that good on pc. great story and awsome multiplayer (10/10)",3
"it would be a great online game if i didnt have to spend the majority of my time joining gta online or loading. or what appears to be the norm timed out and kicked back to story mode. my internet connection is fine and all other games are fine. until they sort out these issues i would stay clear. presently a cake and  game",3
"honestly, even considering the fact that i like many other games far more than the gta series... gta 5 pc is probably in the top 5 of best video games ever made. this is a monument to gaming.",3
"third time ive bought it. xbox 360- xbox one- pc. you dont shell out $180 for a game unless its as good as gta 5. also its the most fun benchmarking software on the market. already melted a friends gpu on day one. edit- gta v can be played on 8g of memory. if youre ram crashing on memory like i was its probably virtual memory. youtube how to add virtual memory, super easy. but this still uses about 6 gigs of physical for me. so maybe 4 gigs if you had nothing else open. -my original stupidity post- (((this game cant be played with 8 gigs of ram. if it can, im doing something incredibly wrong. 1920x1080 and 720p with everything as low as it will go and ram crashes on the second mission.))))",3
"grand theft auto, awsome! grand theft auto 2, rad! grand theft auto vice city sweet! grand theft auto all others, wtf rockstar?! grand theft auto 5, holy  havent had this great of a time since grand theft auto!!!!",2
"just like the thousands of other people who have had problems with gta v because we live outside of usa - a completely unknown phenomenon to the people over at rockstar, my game gets stuck on the loading screen without even reaching the main menu. rockstars supposed fix doesnt even work. after spending 2 days trying to find where to send a support message to rockstar, i quickly realized that even if you write a ticket, theres no working button to submit it. maybe im just stupid but the one button that says submit does nothing and i havent found any other way of contacting them directly (not including twitter which gives you a half- support bot programmed to respond based on specific phrases with the same answers as they have on the q&a page).",2
"was doing a heist with friends. two friends start beating up a car, other friend gets pissed and launches a rocket at them and kills them both. mission failed. 10/10 would reccomend.",4
"dont let someone with a stupid username that cant log in turn you away from this game. its awesome. ive been playing gtas since the top down days and with each entry it just gets better and better. i cant wait to keep digging and turn los santos inside out. i have experience zero troubles and im getting excellent frames on high everything. i5 3570 8gb @ 1600mhz gtx 760 4gb its running beautifully.",1
"waited for 14 april, and started the game, since then i have not stepped out of my house. still playing. 10/10",5
"the best if i had a million dollars simulator i have ever played haha",1
"this game is just over over powered! i can finaly go to strip club :d 11|10",2
"kicked a cat then shot a hooker and stole her money. life doesnt get any better! especially when it looks so good while doing it!",1
"bought this game three times. 4k, 60fps, gta online.... what else needs to be said.",2
"so good, i dont think it should have taken this long but it is very good.",2
"insanely boring just like every other gta game ever made. i know im the minority here, but i cant suggest this to anyone.",1
"yah. haie. we cant buy apartments with runways, pools, tennis courts or sea access. this would make the game so much more fun. runways people...",4
"this game is a fantastic pc port. i have heard of issues but i have only encountered one bug that was very minor. definitely worth the wait.",2
"worth the wait! online works good, graphics are amazing, & fps keyboard + mouse flow is amazing! pc release really nailed it so far, been playing for 12 hours straight since launch! looking forward to making lots of great content with gta v and its editor! 420/10",2
"thinking of buying this for the online feature? prepare to spend alot of time at the loading screen.",3
"oh look an update wait still crashes.... grand theft auto v launcher has stopped working bought the game today installed it cant get passed social club havent played it at all yet it says ive played for 30minutes....",1

"so i spent $60 and 6 hours to troubleshooting. all i got is the rockstar update service is unavailable (code 2) and dispointed.",3
