"by far the most involving, dynamic, and immersive single player rpg to date.. if you play i highly recommend getting the immersive mods, either on the workshop or the nexus to make the game even more dynamic,",1
"the world`s best game. thanks bethesda! your the best.",3
"this game is relatively meh. theyve managed to dumb this series down to something that can bore me in a few hours. hint: only put points into the strength/health/carry weight/armor/toughness/everything stat. being a magician is worthless. every play through you should be a sneaky melee character that can use a bow. also enjoy fighting nothing but the same bear over and over.",1
"one of the greatest games of all time. so much content you probably cant complete it all. i agree with the other review that said, ruined my life. 5 stars. except i have no life. :(",2
"hundreds and hundreds of hours can be put in that game and it will still be amazingly fun to play, well worth the bucks!",6
"good game that has potential with modz to be over 10000 hrs",1
"love this game so much. i have always loved the elder scrolls and this one is no different.",6
"this game is great for people who are looking for a good way to pass a few hours as you can explore the vast area of skyrim as well as slay dragons, get better equipment or if youre in the mood kill inicent people that live in the citys",1
"skyrim is like an old friend that you keep coming back to visit. there always seems to be something left to do in this game, which makes it particularly challenging for a completionist like me. even after long breaks without playing, its massive world, great graphics and sandbox play-style always offer up an enticing allure to accomplish something new. its not perfect, but ive thoroughly enjoyed every minute spent playing it and will continue to enjoy it in the future. i can see skyrim being a game to come back to in the years to come - much like oblivion and morrowind.",1
"if you do not like this game, then i hate you. buy it",2
"there are flying lizards that constantly throw hot sauce at you and scream racist slurs at you. and you can yell racist words back at them too then kill them and absorb their pig farts to unlock more racist words. 5/10 needs more racism.",2
"best game i have ever played you will never run out of quests and if you do you can always take over a bandit fort. the game never gets old",4
"i alredy own this on the 360 so dont be fooled by how much time i have played on steam. this game will eat up every bit of free time you have with its story telling, and the large amount of quests available. add in steam workshop support for easy access to more mods and addons than you can shake a stick at, this game will keep you busy for a long time to come.",2
"awesome game. gives loads of gameplay and an open world where you can wander for days. good game if you have nothing to do.",3
"great game. i originally owned this on a console and purchased it last year during the winter sale because i like it that much. even playing through it normally twice it still has great replayability because of the amazing mods that are around. if you ever were to purchase a game buy this, especially during the sale its 7.50",1
"a very large fantastic experience, especially if you mods it with great things like brighter water, dragon souls for perks and more armors/weapons from the lotr (etc.)",4
"amazing game. so many mods make this game have a whole lot of replayability. i have logged in over 300 hours and still have yet to complete the main quest lol. for those considering the upcoming eso (elder scrolls online) i strongly recomend this game and oblivion because they are both a lot of fun, and will make the history make sense when playing eso. this game has a lot of depth and grit. i love being able to mix it up. i wield a 2h sword in light armor and also am a conjuror and restoration mage as well. :d happy gaming!",4
"awright... so weve got dragons, shouting old men on mountains, sweet rolls, arrows to knees, knees to faces and faces to axes. theres some verbal assaults on dragons and a little comic mischief along the way. the quests are somewhat in depth at times and you get to pretty much choose your path of what you wanna be.. so long as that path is the dragonborn. theres about 10 million hours of playing and dicking around to be had.. also theres mods now adding more dicking. youve heard of it already, so just buy it. youll like it :3",2
"i would recommend this game to any fan of bethesda or elder scrolls games!",5
"maybe the best game ive ever played. wow. 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/5",3
"of all the games that i have ever played, this is by far the best. even two years after release, the graphics still hold their own, and the gameplay is fantastic. the way that the game lets you do what you want, when you want is just awesome. it is probably pretty hard to make a game of this size and scope and for it to acually be a sucess. the team at bethesda is by far my favorite gaming studio, and they deserve all the praise that they get for this game. the dlc is really well done to, and if you were thinking about thorwing some money down for it, you wont be dissapointed. but if you were sceptical for the game, dont be. the game is worth every single penny, and is just fantastic. a perfect score in my opinon. just fantasic.",2
"one of the joyable rpgs ive played and cant wait for elder scrolls online, and all the expansions for skyrim along with the mods; off steam and nexus make it even more fun.",1
"tl;dr end of review. this game: -has a magnificent story. -cheats -awesome mods (nexus) -open world -do almost anything -and the list goes on. if i had more money, id buy 10 more copies of this game for anyone who really needs to play it. in this game you can: -go anywhere -kill anyone -scream -get married -buy a house -kill dragons -eat (dragon) souls without being a ginger -store a thousand item in your inventory -climb mountains on a horse -duel with losers ingame -travel -explore a wide vareity of places, cities, villages, dungeons and many more -have a cute lady follow you everywhere and defend you (better with sexy mods). too long, didnt read (tl;dr) -----buy this game, dont pirate it.----- -----the developers deserve more than pirated downloads of the game.----- -----this game is totally worth you $20 (or $5 if sales)----- support the developers, think about it, if you dont buy their amazing games, they may go bankrupt and not make good games like skyrim, fallout nv, dishonored, etc. then wed get stuck with  ea and ubisoft. you cant buy anything in this game for real money. it wouldnt rip you off. spend $20 for this game and play forever instead of buying another overpriced game from another game developing company. thanks for reading.",1
"this game is still going strong since its release in 2011, especially when accompanied with user created mods. if you havent played skyrim by now, there is something wrong with you!",1
"this is a great game for all those people who like to chose a what to do rather than having to do one quest line. awesome game!",2
"i loved this game, best first person game i ever played",1
"while i enjoyed all of the elder scrolls games, skyrim has been the one i have enjoyed the most. the ability to do what you want and be what you want is just amazing. the modding community is fantasic and the options are endless.",4
"a great game filled with hilarious bugs and repetitive sequences that never gets boring (with mods that is). the environment of the game is still simply yet stunning to travel into. if i got the time and place to wander around in skyrim, so would you :d 9.5/10",2
"simply put buy the legendary game pack because after a few minuets you will be addicted and wanting more.",3
"good game. (i also love how the trailers characters armor sucks)",1
"always have loved rpgs but never have the time for them but after picking this game up during the steam summer sale i was surprised at how much fun it is and enthralling it is. basically do you want to become a clepto / hoarder thief or a mage that ends up using amazing spells or just a warrior that rushes in to flee from bears but not from dragons? the answer is yes and just the amount of backstory and lore inside of this game can keep you entertained for many playthroughs and i still have yet too finish the game but the amount of quests and just exploring skyrim in its entirety keeps you excited what can i find in this cave oh a bunch of bandits whats this switch at the end of the cave woah i opened a dwemer passage into some ruins. i recommend this game if anything i mentioned is what you like in a game this game is perfect for you. and as of yet i have not purchased any dlc but i am planning onto and will update this review further down the road.",1
"like change from ur bad cod shooter? try this out... you will love it",2
"absolutely terrible game. not worth wasting your time on.",7
"10/10 i put a basket on a guy then killed his chicken #swag #sneakybeakylike",1
"not buying this game basically means you hate kittens. and what kind of person hates kittens?",1
"this might possibly be one of the greatest rpgs of all time. i would buy this in a heartbeat and im sure some of you agree. this game will always be remembered. the modding community has kept this game alive and still going strong for nearly five years. if you want an open world rpg thats immersive, has an amazing soundtrack, and want to be lost in the large amounts of lore this series has to offer, get it. its the game for you. you can also expand your experience with the dlcs. unlike its console ports, tesv features an unprecidented amount of mods that can add hours and hours to the total play time. i took a moment on plenty of occassions to take in the views from throat of the world. its on of the only games that has a truly beatiful (and mod-able) skybox, with stars and moons giving light at night, along with nice shadows cast in the trees down in falkreath. i also killed braith, hiding her body on a building (hiding) 10/10- like far cry 3 with bows -ign",1
"modding simulator. you will get mods, have the game crash, fix mods, get more mods, have the game crash, fix mods, and then the cycle repeats. 11/10",3
"awesome game would reccomend to anyone, one of my favorites!",1
"i cant remember there ever being a year with so many amazing games. i think this one edges out the rest for game of the year. an incredible experience that will last you 80+ hours.",1
"waaaaaay better than console version... if ya get this make sure to download the free hires texture pack :)",2
"first of all i want you to play the game at least 100+ hours before you say any kind of  about it. this game was the pure god rpg game of its time, and that all other new rpg games that come out better look at this game and say mabye i should try to follow the same format and not  it up. i truly think this game is a great game, and if any of you cocklikers think it is just a game where you swing your sword at stuff so you can level up and swing your sword at tougher stuff. then here is the ugley truth man, all rpg/mmorpg games is just that sorry to bust your apples there. 10/10",3
"the best of the single player rpgs... i have to say im not the biggest fan of the genre and havent played that many either but still a diamond among the mass! enjoyed all those 60 hours (and counting) and has played only one character without the dlcs. with hd texture packs you get the most of it if you have the iron. sadly the dungeon clearing quests get pretty repetitive...",1
"love this game like game of thrones fighting dragons !!",1
"what else can you say that has not already been said about skyrim, love it!",1
"this game can be a dream of awesomness if you want it to be you can have naruto fighting ermac from mk 9 its a beast  game and for 7 bucks one hell of a deal",5
"this is a really good game and does not dissapoint. also there is a active moding comunity",4
"absolutely one of my favorites games! i get lost and lose track of time when i play this game!",1
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",2
"buy this, just do it. its fun, it seemingly never ends (im like 30 some hours into it and nowhere near running out of quests), and for 20 bucks its an epic deal.",1
"this game is pure fun. the quests are indepth so you wont run of things to do or unlock anytime soon. also there is full player customization so who wouldnt want to be a fu**ing mage or a killer dressed like a crazy jester. you can kill anyone you want who isnt essiential to the story line for example you can kill a city guard but not the jarl of whiterun. also you can retire from adventure by buying a house and marrying someone or you can go out and make a name for your self in a good or bad way. 10/10",1
"excellent, open world rpg. in my opinion, not as pretty as oblivion, and far easier than oblivion - thus more accessible. immersive, beautiful title, play your own way. can easily log hundreds of hours just exploring side quests. dlc are fun, though not as good as oblivion dlc (horse armour aside!). played extensively and completed on xbox.",1
"good: beutyfull scenery, good story and so many refrances bad: stiff voice acting, paddle swords also, i came to the dragonborn dlc island some wizard flew up in the air and fell on my dog. 10/10 senile scribblers aprove",3
"this game is the reason i built a gaming pc. 10/10- would try to add enough mods to kill paarthurnax again",1
"the vanilla game is okay, but not exactly my cup of tea... i dont prefer hack-n-slash types of games. but when you add in some of the available mods the game can do all sorts of things. i really like the exploration.",1
"i am a quest , but i can play this game for hours and hours and hours without a goal. i love catching butterflies and selling loot to the highest npc bidder.",1
"you will loose yourself on this one. the mood is awesome and so much fun! just care for the killer mudcrabs...",1
"endless fun. got almost 700 hours now and with mods the contents just keeps comming!",6
"u go around yelling at ppl and your supposed to be the hero everyone expects... best gaem 10/10 -ign would shout again.",2
"skyrim is truely the best game i have ever played in my entire life. ive played various of game such as super mario bros and pokemon as a kid. growing up i began playing more violent games like grand theft auto, call of duty, street fighter 4, etc etc. everything about skyrim is really good. the soundtrack brought life to the game and enviroment in my opinion. the graphics and looks on the game is beautiful. several quests to do that will keep you playing after the main story quests. the best part of skyrim is that you can mod it to your liking, it could be skins, adventures mod, this game will keep you enterain for a long time. i dont normally do reviews either, but this game is as good as people say it is.",1
"everything i loved about oblivion done better. side note: dragons are awesome.",1
"if a man came into my house,  me, killed my family,  me again, went into the future and aborted my children, and then came back and shot me in the kneecaps i would hate him less than this game. please. save yourself. dont do it.",4
"skyrim is an excellent game graphics:even on low quality still looks better than morrowind and oblivion. gameplay:best combat yet dual weilding ftw. story:i like the story ,but i still think sidequests is where the action is. length:you will die before you finish this game. sidequests:excellent bad things:some bugs",1
"this is the gatewaydrug to the elder scrolls. extremely easy to pickup and go. best part about it though, is the mod community. this game can be perfectly tailored to your desires.",2
"if you are a big fan of open-world, fantasy or rpg this game is definetly worth all of its purchase prize. the game does have many and som pretty massive bugs and glitches, but more often then not, the good outwheights the bad.",2
"sidequests are boring main story line is pretty fun get dat feel of adventure overall this game is worth it, but isnt anything amazing. 6/10",1
"this game plays awsome if you use the high def mod it even looks awsome, only fluncky part is that the main story line sucks but this is always a bad point in bethesda games i hope they evolve in this before fallout 4 is announced :p. i say play the game and download some cool mods to even tweak it some more there are much good mods out there that make you exp even better.",2
"i have spent so much time on this game that all of its glitches, bugs and annoying mechanics are bygone complaints. that theyre there hasnt stopped me from playing for the past 2 years. nor does it seem likely that they will in the future.",2
"this game has got to be the best rpg i have ever played. if you like a rpg were you can make your character any way you want, explore a massive world of skyrim, complete numerous quests, and fight firce monsters. this is the game for you.",4
"what can i say? the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the best (and most addictive) games i have ever played. even years after its release many people still play this masterpiece. the community has also added hundreds more hours worth of play time through the mods found on the steam workshop and the nexus. definately worth your time (although be careful you dont play it too much...) i would rate it 10/10 for sure.",5
"the only game that made me go from 9pm to 3am without even noticing.",2
"this is the best rpg i have ever played completed like five times on the xbox and thought i would try it here.trust me this has great stories great quests and the great mods so highly recomended enjoy",1
"this game has been out for over 2 years and i am still playing it. its beautiful, huge, and fun to explore. this is truly an rpg, because there are many different ways to play the game. the downsides to the game is that many quests require you to delve into a cave, which gets repetitive. the voice acting is also kind of bad, and the npcs are forgettable. the greatest thing about this game is the modding community. there are many mods and enbs that enhance skyrim visually making it one of the most impressive games out there in terms of graphics. there are also mods that overhaul the gameplay of skyrim like t3end0s skyrim redone (skyre), and then there are joke mods. i saw one that turns alduin (the main enemy in the game) into a fire breathing thomas the tank engine. scary stuff.",3
"the best game yet in the elder scrolls series (way better than elder scrolls online). a great game for rpg pros or noobs.",3
"first time i played.... >hits chicken >town ignores dragon and goes apeshit on me 10/10 would never make mistake again.",2
"fus roh dah! a masterpiece of gaming. will go down in history as defining a generation of games.",1
"im so tired of these massive arcade-style games with these enormous overhead inventories. finally, arcade style action without the excess narrative of objects. two enthusiastic thumbs up!",3
"apperently every gaurd was like me and was shot by an arrow, in the knee, well this is akward",1
"this game has stolen my life, and given me several new ones in return. immersion is key. excellent game, with an expansive modding community. highly recommend.",5
"good open world rpg... has the feeling like u really are in skyrim. this makes it wonderfull. later in the game. it will get a bit borring.. but who cares!",1
"tell you what, i love skyrim! i have owned this game on ps3, xbox 360 and now on pc and it just never gets old. if youre looking for hours upon hours of exciting gameplay then this is definitely the game for you...",1
"beautiful game with hundreds of hours of replayability. one of the best products from bethesda studios. i highly recommend!",2
"the legend that is elder scrolls v. it would be impossible to fit in all the amazing things skyrim has to offer, even to list the basic features and mechanics of the game would create a review lasting pages and pages. the game has an amazing story that is revealed to you depending how much you put in. you start the game, sandbox style you can follow the suggested story or head off and do your own thing, filling your knowledge with the history of the world, races and characters the story becomes more and more clear to you. dangerously immersive, hundreds of hours worth of gameplay, perhaps easily the game of the decade, century even. only bad point, why didnt they hire more voice actors?",2
"get this game.. i literally have clocked in 1,000 hours. to good to pass up",9
"ruined my life with crack version, just bought legal ver to support the company (summer sale ofc lol)",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim. amazing game play it. play it. play it. play it. play it.play it! play it!!! play it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111",2
"this is possibly one of the best games ive ever played!",2
"skyrim is a good game because you can make your character a cat. also, you can find a girl and get married, but who wants to do that when you can ride a dragon? a good video game",1
"possibly the most dull, uninspired and over-rated rpgs ever made. the took everything charming and interesting in tes morrowind and completely abandoned it in the sake of making a more mass appeal, radio hit of a game. if it is trying to be as generic as possible then it has suceeded in doing such. i hope everyone who made this game drinks bleach.",1
"best game to put on different awesome mods from awesome mod makers i highly recommend - s of skyrim cause its basically skyrim with  10 out of 10 would be  again",2
"whats to say about this game that hasnt been said already? 11/10 score from me. with over 500 hours clocked in theres no end in sight for what i could do in even one of my saves in this open-world fantasy rpg. the easy addition of mods makes this game literally endless. the land of skyrim is your canvas and you are the painter in this masterpiece of a game.",4
"if youre into diablo, dark souls and other rpgs, this is definently for you! if you think you are all in for skyrim, buy the bundle that includes all the dlcs, beacuse buying the dlcs seperate from the game will cost alot more.",2
"reasons mountain climbing sim 2011...i mean skyrim rocks: 1. play as cat people 2. shout at people 3.****  up as a werewolf/vampire 4. you know, instead of reading this and wasting time, you could also find out for yourself. enjoy.",1
"i cant say enough about this game. between my wife and i, we have played over 300 hrs of this game. it will immerse you in a world full of adventure, fantasy and rich lore. there are a ton of mods for this game which allows you to customize the game how you want it if you are not happy with the vanilla version. you will definitley get your moneys worth out of this game with the length of the campaign along with side quests and replay value. if you are a fan of western rpgs or enjoyed any of the previous elder scrolls or fallout games, get this game now!",2
"a game like this comes along once in a generation.",1
"it was a windy night. my family was asleep, the windows were shut tight and the sound of wind blowing could be heard behind them. my lights were off and i was ready to pleasure my filthy lizard. i looked at it, pet his cute little red head and said soon, it will be all over my dear. my erotic skyrim mods have finished downloading. this is it i thought. this is the most realistic sexual simulation i can get in my life. it will feel as real as it can. my lizard looked at my face and smiled. i smiled back. after the mods were finished installing, i finally launched the game. i found a shrew in the tavern, that looked like she wanted the sexual pleasure. come with me, shrew i said. she nodded and followed me up the stairs. i closed the door and told her to take off her clothes. so she did, and the animation started. i starred at the animation with amezement. it looked like a wooden statue moving up and down another statue. my facial expression screamed disappointement, and my lizard went soft. i looked down on it, and just as i thought, my lizard wasnt as wooden as the statues on my computer screen. i put my underwear back on and went to bed. that night i decided 2 things. i will find a way to kill myself, and i will not try to experience sexual relationships in a video game.",1
"nothing like some good old generic skyrim, eh? while there are glitches in this game, it holds a special place in my heart. if you enjoy adventure, or just cliches, pick this game up when it is on sale. mods make it enlessly replayable as well. 11/10",1
"imho this is simply the best game ever! when i am not playing, i am spedig hours and hours modding my experience. i have never seen a game whose developers encourage such mods by individuals and you can simply play any game you want i this world. from light sabers, to flying dragons, to flying broomsticks (lol), to gods swards. i could not reccommend another game that i would rather spend time with.",2
"this is one of the best games i ever played (i played a lot of games trust me) . this is an epic open world rpg, the graphics are awesome, the story is awesome (i really like it cuz i love dragons ;d ) you nearly have unlimited quests and a giant world to explore and challenges to master. you can easily spend 150 hours on this game and its still not boring (not like other games after 10 hours of playing story is over). and because of the steam workshop you can load unlimited mods, new quests, extend the world, new weapons and many other things. 11 out of 10 because of pure awesomeness ;)",1
"incredible, but i felt that some of the main questlines could have been better, but who plays tes games for main questlines!",1
"one of my most favorite games. played it on xbox 360 and now i own it here. a wonderful game and rpg, this game will have you playing for hours and hours until your eyes bleed!",1
"skyrim is a great game that will keep you entertained for hours on end. the game is far from perfect but if you overlook those few bugs you will greatly enjoy the game . ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- keizaal los lot kred tol fen dein hi entertained fah omaar nau oblaan. kred los gut nol tozeinnu nuz waan hi overlook den lith pusojur hi fen lotgaar kujiir kred.",2
"incredible game. i can personally never find myself ever completing it. it has so much into it, also the modding community spices this game up very nicely.",2
"if you like to play a great for hours and still find new things, play this game. you will never get bored and you get to kill some mother fu*king dragons",1
"after oblivion, you think, hey let me hit this chicken... bad choice",1
"one of the best games that i have ever played. i know that the combat is not great but i dont really love skyrim for its combat, it is a solid exploration game with so much to do. the story and gameplay are a bit linear but its awesome fun all the way. the two content dlcs do add a ton of stuff to do in this game. music is simply brilliant. definitely a must buy.",2
"amazing game with a great modding comunity. it is playable for hours on end with so much to explore. 10/10 my type of game",2
"apex game of its generation. love the freedom to adventure any way you choose.",1
"its skyrim. do i really need to persuade you to buy this?",2
"the province of skyrim might be frigid, but the role-playing game that takes place within it burns with a fire few games possess. in the elder scrolls v: skyrim, you take up arms against dragons, and your encounters with them are invariably exciting--yet depending on where your adventure takes you, such battles may not even represent the pinnacle of your experience. a side quest that starts as a momentary distraction may turn into a full-fledged tale that could form the entirety of a less ambitious game. yes, skyrim is another enormous fantasy rpg from a developer that specializes in them, and it could suck up hundreds of hours of your time as you inspect each nook and crevasse for the secrets to be found within. if you know bethesda softworks previous games, you might be unsurprised that skyrim is not a land without blemish, but rather harbors any number of technical glitches and frustrating idiosyncrasies that tear open the icy veil that blankets the land. many of them are ones elder scrolls fans will probably see coming, but theyre ultimately a low price to pay for the wonders of a game this sprawling and enthralling. prepare for many sleepless nights to come.",2
"skeerim. da numbah 1 rpg post 2010 of all post 2010 teim. morrowpoop was better oblividerp was different daggerwaytobigofamap was different and better arena stunk. if ya want a gud rpg, go get the quest - [and its all 15 additional content thingez] on da mobile. is gud. skyrim is derpy. the shadows are terribad. the voices are repetetive. the detail up close is horride w/o mods. the trees are ugly w/o mods. the water is absolutly ugggly, and more so at long range cuz it starts 2 flow in 2 different directions bcuz of how they optimized it and its gross. the modding community consists of 3 types of catagories. 1 derp 2 an actually kind of gr8 mod 3 nude mods yet, this game is beautiful. go bei it, mod it out, run it at ultra, and take a hike up a mountain. yeah, i beat its boring main quest. but what do i do now? well i accidentally deleted my save for my main quest completeted character. so now i make my character a god with the console and look at pretty stuff. yus is fun. go get yus",1
"what can someone say about skyrim that isnt said by now.. one of the best, if not the best single player rpg games, where those who dont (or do) care about quests can simply roam around with so much to do, to never get bored. adventure awaits!",1
"it starts out great but older players might find the game lacking in alot of rpg features like durability loss, custom spells. my personal big problem is the wobbling camera when swinging weapons",2
"this is a most epic game that has everything an rpg should! the only small gripe is that there arent other people to adventure with. but elder scrolls online will fix that!",2
"yeah, if youre going to buy this, you might as well be ready to give your soul to it. for the amount of things you can do, the time you can spend, and enjoy about every moment while playing this game... it is very much worth your money. not to mention, dawnguard and dragonborn, some of the best add-ons ive ever seen, with hearthfire being alright. smiley face for happiness :)",2
"im not one to review a game but this game really screams out at me how fantastic it is. i recommend this to those who enjoy open world free roam games. worth all of the money and theres not much else to say. so get it now",1
"great game overall. great mechanics. tbh just doing this to get an achievement. love the game!",1
"first of all. this has to be one of the most fun games of all time. i think it is the only game i have ever played where it litterally does not end. you will always find a new cave, new enemy, new quests, new things to do, etc. if you are a fan of lord of the rings, you must get this game. even if you dont like lord of the rings, you should get it. the story is so engaging and nothing feels tacked on or out of place. everything has a purpose and everything has a reason for being there with their own story. its great! i have no idea why you would not get this game. oh side note, the dlc for the game is great even though i dont own it yet. i have played it on my friends computer and they add even more content to an aready content loaded game. in closing, if you dont buy this game you are a fool!!! a fool!!! it is way to good to pass up rating: 11/10 blows me away",1
"one of the greatest games i have ever played. cant wait for either new content or another complete version of the game! 10/10 -bar none",2
"want to waste hours adventuring to far away lands, scaling mountains of content, and hunting to find the best treasured objects? oh no thats just the modding section of the game, i cant review the experience itsself.",1
"great graphics, fun open world where you can do just about anything",2
"me? explain this game? well, thats difficult because i cannot. this game is so good, that (when i finally beat it.) i gave it a standing ovation.",1
"you will have to spend dozens of hours to fully explore skyrim. like any other bethesda game, it has its share of imperfections and broken promises, but its exciting and fascinating nevertheless. im enjoying 99% of the time im playing it. :)",1

"been playing this game through the night and this game is so addictive...it open world game play is so amazing and the quest that available in this game is some massive...thumbs up...recomend this game...",1
"one of my favorite rpg open world fantasy games! world is really big and just fantastic. i love the style and gameplay of this game. quests are really fun and you are never bored while playing. i really like the style of playing because you can play as warrior or wizard style. also there are skills/levels for character which you decide which one to upgrade. world is huge! fantasy level is normal because you can kill also normal warriors/people instead only monsters/dragons. story line is really sick! only the problem is on start of game because you need to walk a lot but later when you discover all the places and towns then you can use fast travel option. game also have a lot of side quests and hiden places to complete and discover especially if you buy legendary edition of the game then you have a lot of new quests. like i said, its one of the best rpg games so i reccommend this game to all rpg and fantasy lovers. game it totally worth of money! 9,5/10",1
"a modern classic. if you enjoy rpgs at all you owe it to yourself to give this game a try.",5
"pros * good fights * good graphics * good storyline * decent expansions * pickpocketing * backstabbing * an unbelievable number of quests available * many mods (dont take the ones on steam though) * i rode a dragon cons * menus are annoying, clearly written for consoles (but can partly be fixed by mods) * replay makes you go through lengthy opening sequence again (but can be fixed by mods) * why do npcs always say the same things? 9/10",1
"one of the most amazing games i ever played. amazing concept, you can decide your own path, believe me, youll never regret buying this, so many hours you can put into it. plus theres the workshop to check out! ;d",3
"i defently made a good choice switching from the 360 version to steam version of skyrim.",1
"i just got skyrim i guess my friends wont be seeing me for a long tim",1
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",2
"the best game i ever played i play the xbox version that version was bad cause i had no modz on there",1
"the thing i love most about this game, is the ability to form an entire story all on my own within the game, then when i get bored, go back to the original content. after you spend many hours indulging yourself in the vast world, and youve done pretty much everything you can, you go to the modding community and you have a thousand reasons to get back into the action for many, many more hours. the storyline is great, but after you beat it and restart a new character, it gets very repetitive, but there is so muh other stuff to do it really doesnt matter. you can either be the guy who runs in with a greatsword slicing everything up, an assassin who uses only a dagger and stealth, an archer with a wide variety of bows, or a mage who would rather set their target ablaze or freeze them solid, then bring them back to life a their thrall. you could also mix and match to get your desired character. all in all this game is one of the best games ive ever played and if you have not played it then i dont know whats wrong with you, but you better get into the action because you wont regret it. i only have had this game for two days on the pc but on the xbox 360 i have hundreds if not thousands of hours into this amazing game.",1
"its an awesome game!! i first pre-orderd it on ps3!!",2
"not sure why it took so long to purchase and play skyrim. ive only logged about 10 hours but i am thoroughly hooked. definitely worth every penny as a solid sandbox style game that has hours upon hours of playtime to be had.",2
"shouted at a guard and he learned to fly, and he never came back 10/10",1
"let me just say, the 13 or so hours logged on steam are only the hours since i got my new computer. my old computer couldnt handle pc gaming, so most of my skyrim hours are on my xbox. with that out of the way, it is time to state the obvious. skyrim is one of the best games out there, even now at almost three years old. immersive environments and hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of gameplay mean that the snowy province in the north of tamriel feels truly alive. the world is almost seamless, despite a few graphical bugs (some of which are honestly hilarious though; it wouldnt truly be skyrim without them), and npcs are endlessly interactive. there are so many hidden locations and optional sidequests, it is nearly impossible to run out of things to do. and even on the off-chance that you do manage to find complete every single thing in the game, there is a vibrant modding community (something i didnt have access to on xbox) out there that does make the gameplay literally endless. ive never quite found another game that satisfied my need for open world, character-building rpg quite like skyrim. plus where else can i scale a sheer cliff riding a giant wolf wearing purple leggings? nowhere. a+++++",1
"it took me two years to get a real copy of this game and find out it was a good game",1
"you will regret not buying this game......................",3
"now with over 150 hours on record i can wholeheartedly recommend this game. skyrim has almost everything i could have ever wanted from an action-rpg game, save for dialogue options, which can be overlooked in such a massive game. quests are mostly varied, although due to the size of the game some repetition is bound to occur. i have only now, after more than hundred hours of gameplay, begun to run out of quests, and i suspect there are still some to be discovered. skyrim, just as all the previous tes games, comes with a good selection of races, classes and playstyles, adding to the already great replay value from quest choices. regarding overall gameplay, i feel skyrim is a slightly casual experience as whole (at least within the rpg genre), being relatively easy with a short learning curve, but it blends action and awesome story writing together into a very attractive mix that nobody even slightly interested in fantasy adventure should miss. on top of all this, there is also a very active modding community, adding potentially hundreds more hours of gameplay.",3
"its a f***ing elder scrolls game. while it may not be perfect, its still pretty fantastic.",1
"thank you steam for letting me buy both dlcs this morning, before the sale. really nice of you to help me spend more money. thanks alot...",2
"its a great game. loads of fun and you can spend hours of playng and still enjoy it. you can mod the pc version and also create mods which make it more enjoyable. so have fun and play.",2
"this is actually good, the graphics are very nice and the hud is very easy to understand as of the colours for health, stamina and magicka. this game got me so hooked i have planned a youtube series of it and will be excited if/when i get a better computer so i can play this game on ultra and enjoy every damn moment of it. 10/10 owns all dlc",2
"you like legend of zelda? dark souls? adventuring in general? well.... this is your game and the modding community make it even better for first time players! i just cant explain how much i love this game... it just sooo great! 1000000000000000000000000000000/10 would buy",2
"great game and will hold up through time just as the other elder scrolls games have.",1
"ive modded this game for 3years. as vanilla maybe not that good, but when you start modding it, even the graphics look beast. this game + all of ultimate  mods = (   ) shout out to loverslab modders, keep up the hard work (   )",1

"got axed to death by guards in suggestive attire after using my sword to play with a kids dog. 10/10",1
"excellent game. i have lost over 6 days of my life to playing this - worth every moment.",2
"the vanilla game was not fun, i wanted to like the game but i did not. the game had bugs and glitches that ruined the game for me. the quests were boring and not exiting. the game lacks ranged combat, only having a bow, which i do not like because it only reaches medium distances. leveling up in the game is too slow, it feels like you earn nothing for leveling up. none of the good skills can be unlocked early in a skill tree which is boring. the sneaking and bounty system seems broken, even if a bounty is removed guards will sometimes still be hostile. some npcs in the game cant be killed and will constantly attack the played which is a broken mechanic of the game. some parts of the game will despawn all dead bodies making it imposible to revive a follower since their body dissapears. followers die which is realistic but not to my liking. horses are almost pointless, they run slow and seem lathargic. character models look ugly",1
"i dont actually own this game but i apparently have 34 minutes in it. its good i guess?",1
"hello everybody!! today we have a game, and this game is called.................. the elder scrolls v: skyrim!!!!! its got action packed babes and motheras who like kill u and stuff so just get it when on sale baby!!!!!!!",1

"across pc and xbox ive probably sunk well over 300 hours into skyrim. if you count watching friends play it too, itd be closer to 500. the only game i might have sunk more hours into would be halo, and even then thats across 7 games, not one. best game of the last decade. easily.",2

"the elder scrolls franchise is amazing, especially skyrim. if you love open-world rpgs and havent played skyrim yet...... honestly where the f**k have you been!? 11/10",1
"deep storyline, tons of quest and dungeons, stunnig graphics, infinite modding tools. in shoty a must have.",4
"one of the best rpg ever. a huge map full of enemies, dungeons to explore, villages and cities with tons of quests and tasks to complete. a really good story line and amazing side-stories that will absorb you. a wide variety of equipmient and the chance to upgrade it as you see fit. you can choose from any role and make hybrid classes. totally worth your money and the time you will spent on it, because you will spent a lot of time on this game.",2
"a substitute for oblivion, skyrim scratches the elder scrolls itch with some improved features to oblivion such as better combat, lore, and graphics. the only sad part is that the dark brotherhood quests were lacking and there is no arena, but that does not mean this game should not be played. one can easily spend just 20 minutes on this game and rack up a plethora of quests. a great sequel.",2
"skyrim is such a fun game with many hours of gameplay with many paths to choose as the dragonborn of tamriel.",1
"this game, guys. for anyone who, in younger years, obsessed over elder scrolls while the rest of the world wondered what the hell was wrong with them, this game represents a cure. few heard of morrowind in my hometown. none had beaten it. three or four classmates knew of oblivion, and only two got past the battle of kvatch. i honestly thought no one else could obsess over the series the way i had. then came skyrim. it wasnt morrowind or oblivion. it didnt need to be. skyrim gave me more than gameplay, more than caves and barrows. it showed me there were others just as obsessed, just as excited to see the secrets hidden in the next ruin, the next chest, the next mission. forget graphics. forget story. forget immersion. skyrim is perfect because it showed me i wasnt alone. beyond that, i can say nothing higher.",1
"of course i do. i just built a sick pc so playing it on ultra high makes it really amazing!",1
"this game is soooooooooo awesome i passed it like in a day",1
"135+ hours spent playing this game and theres still more to do.",3
"awesome game just as standard vanilla skyrim, but even better with mods. 11/10",1
"this is a game in the series of elder scrolls. a game where you can be a werewolf, fight a war, steal and kill, and is one of the very best games of this generation (my opinion)... this it the elder scrolls v skyrim!",2
"this  game. i cant play without crashes 0/10 worse port than gta iv",1
"the... best... game... in... the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"this game is amazing. its really good with mods too. one of my favourite games ever.",2
"absolutely best game ever. its worth every cent. and those dragons... theyre just awesome",3
"the best game ever, this game deserves a 10/10. no doubt at all its a free open world with different races and awesome skill tree. you can level up to 81 but there is a update system that works like a call of duty prestige system, as you -prestige- enemies become more difficulter. its just a fantastic and brilliant rpg game. spent like 190 hours or something like that on this game because its worth it. even the dlc does too! and there is steam workshop so you can download some awesome custom mods such as armours, weapons, house, npc and more!",3
"off-line i have played over 600 hours and just love skyrim. the modding comunity is wonderful. the one thing i really wish for is a way to play this over lan 2-4 people runing around in skyrim would be incredible. 2-4 over steam would be my second choice. i have played eso but returned to skyrim.",1
"quite possibly one of the best games ive ever played. very nice as a standalone, and even better modded. this game is waiting to be molded into your image! what are you waiting for? buy this masterpiece already!",4
"what i like about skyrim is that you can go into a farmers field, take their harvest right in front of them, and then sell it back to them for profit with no repercussions. now that is entertainment.",1
"this game is so cool! it may needs some tweaks here and there but there is so much to do! im a 100hr in the game and i still havent done half the things there is to do in this game. the world look amazing, much to see and do. and the mods is the cherry on top and that cherry is big and red with awesome thing. the modding community is so good i think its the best modding community! i dont think this game can get old with how much great mods that are out there! 9.7/10. but there are some bad things with skyrim here i will spot out the pros and cons. pros: much to do, awesome soundtrack, lots of quests! (maybe to much), intresting places and people. and an awesome modding community! cons: animation is clanky and bad, quests can get really repititve with too many quest with you fetching thing for people like a dog, bad voice acting with voice acters being reused for many people. and combat can get boring and its kinda dull all you do is swing your sword like a mad man! thank you if you read all of this! :d",2
"dont play it. especially not with mods. it will ruin you",2
"a stunning game with hours and hours of interesting and challenging quests. i would recommend this game to anyone above the age of twelve, due to the fact that it is also a very bloody game with a major use of alcohol.",4
"my favorite rpg. pros: - great story. - long gameplay. - allows mods. - very addicting. cons: - none.",1
"probably one of the best games ever created, despite the fact that i like games where things like relationship or other things like managing stuff are very slightly noticeable in this game, this game in a nutshell makes for good fun, a very interesting workshop and loads and i mean loads! of choices or faction related stuff are all here all in all buy it for a great experience, and the dlcs will have its advantages too",1
"this is a great game where your choices effect the gameplay. great for people who just want to have more freedom than they already do.",1
"its an elder scrolls game. enough said. looks best on pc as always, i highly recommend using mods from nexus. if you want even more of a challenge, even better textures, and more immersion then i recommend the following mods. immersive armors reezehome fully upgradeable hearthfires + dawnguard edition v1.7.9 realvision enb 254a achieve that! random alternate start (for those whove already played through the game once) frostfall -hypothermia camping survival (makes it ultra realistic with temperature, hunger, thirst, and resting) immersive patrols skyui and of couse dont forget to have skse installed. i played about 300 hours of this game on 360. i wish i had purchased it on pc at first. but now i get to revisit the game with so many mods available to help change the game a little bit.",1
"people who like rpg should really play this game... and if you already have; then good for you, because i really recommend this game to anyone who enjoy playing rpg, adventure.... and i already know that the friends that i have on my list like dungeon siege iii, so play skyrim as well!!! =)",7
"this game... will consume you for every flaw this game has theres 10 good things. the vanilla game alone could provide you with 100+ hours of gameplay add another 25 for perfectionists then the dlc add ons not to mention the huge library of mods available for free that add hundreds of more hours thats right hundreds!. like i said this game will consume you i have put in 600+ hours and i still feel like playing it.... i honestly dont know how bethesda is going to top this but if they do god bless them and god bless todd howard lol.. so yes you should totaly buy this game!!!",6
"kkiiinnnggg ammmaaazzziiinnnggggg (i broke it with too many mods. fml.)",1
"700 hours in - 5 times completed everything - modded to make it prettier than nextgen games.. yep this might be good... brb need my 6th completion! ;)",5
"by far the best out of the elder scrolls series. it has so much to offer and will leave you occuiped for hours on end. the graphics coupled with the excellent combat system switching between physical damage and magic seamlessly brings the player to a new level of rpging. on top of a main storyline, the side quests and stories have a lot to offer, especially to those who are veterans of the series. theres a reason elder scrolls game get goty... go get it!",1
"still yoba govno dragons game for childrens ugly ai cant take this toyworld seriously deleted returned to morrowind",1
"anyone who has put a negitive review simply has no brain. great game with so much potential. love it to death, along side the fallout series.",1
"theres ways to get into shape and look sexy at the same time. the trick is, olive oil. also, youve really got to learn how to hold a pose like a professional. note, that not everyone can be a barrel-chested savage, like yours truly. that means, things may be a bit more difficult for all the normals out there. we all cant have won the genetic lottery. not all of us have viking dna coursing through our perfectly sized veins. ive gone on 42 hour persistence hunts. i have 20/10 vision. i can spot the seems on a 90 mph fastball. one step at a time, folks.",1
"wow!!! this game is amazing the best rpg game ever! :d",1
"the first thing i stole in this game was a sweet roll, it put me on a path of thievery that promised to go down in the history books, nobody stole my sweet roll /i/ am the one who steals sweet rolls! ive stolen every sweet roll ive seen in my travels... ive got 28... i shouldve stolen the cheese instead...",1
"subtract everything you hate about past elder scrolls games, add everything you love, add a better engine that does not crash on you every 10 minutes and is not a steaming pile of bugs, pretty up everything, make the faces cooler and make just about everything better and you have skyrim. this game is a masterpiece.",2
"user reviews: overwhelmingly positive (91,233 reviews) why did you bother looking here?",1
"pretty fun game ive been playing for a long time and i already beat the game so download it ill teach you some tips and tricks",1
"open ended game that lets you play the way you want to play (almost to a fault!). your character will experience amazing storylines all initiated by you yourself in the order you want to do them. the base game content is rivaled by the insane amount of mods out there, with a huge number of them being excellent quality and will add almost countless hours of gameplay to an already impressive amount... of gameplay. yes, waste your life here folks. its worth it.",2
"if you have the patience, time and electric then skyrim is one rpg worthy of dropping in on. it is massive, it will take you a whole lot of time building your characters stats and also collecting a whole lot of stuff to use on enemies. overall if you wanted a singleplayer experience that is gonna take a whole lot of time to complete everything then skyrim is one of the best in its genre.",2
"heaps of hours of gameplay.. great graphics, another great eldersrcolls game. main quest is bugged but can get through it with console commands..",1
"this is a great game. i have over 100 hrs into it on xbox 360. however, i would not recommend this game (on steam) to anyone because it has some really annoying bugs that make it unplayable for me. the water does this flicker thing every time you are within vision of it. character randomly starts swimming when there is no water. its so annoying and ive tried every fix and messed with every setting. i have spent more time trying to get the bugs out then actually playing the game. by the way my gpu is an amd 7950. my buddy has an nvidia powered laptop and his runs flawlessly so idk maybe its just amd. for me this one is an uninstall :(",1
"i installed a mod that turned the chickens into mini nukes. now riverwood is nothing but a smoking crater 10/10",1
"a game that is quite enjoyable for the first 30 or so hours yet fizzles out eventually. at the current price it is worth a buy but its not as amazing and revolutionary as people say. with mods however, it can be one of the greatest fantasy games of all time.",2
"this game is just fantastic. the storyline lacks a little excitement, but the amount of side quests is enough to take your mind off of it. many mechanics of this game are pretty good and the graphics are decent. skyrim is a great game for the role playing gamer and suits the needs of an action/adventure.",2
"great game! i dont understand why you have not bought this yet...",1
"a must-have installment for the elder scrolls series brings the exploration, questing and enjoyment to one place.",5
"it may be getting a bit of a old game now, and even though it has no multiplayer its still an amazing game",1
"this is by far one the best rpg that ive played. i would highly recommend it for anyone who has any doubt about getting it.",1
"the newest release of the elder scrolls series, skyrim brings excellent graphics and polished gameplay to the forefront of this wonderful new rpg release. like all of bethesdas giant, open-world rpgs there are plenty of bugs to wade through (and have fun with!) and youll definitely sink way too many hours into this game. its fun on a whole new level - bethesda is the best at this type of game and theyve done an unparalleled job once again. pros: good gameplay beautiful graphics enormous world to explore mod support immersive cons: still not as good as morrowind was if you like bethesda rpgs, have enjoyed any of the previous elder scrolls games, or just love fantasy, pick up skyrim - youll love it. the immersion is top-notch and youll wander the endless mountains of the beautiful countryside for hours on end, truly believing you are the dovakiin. i still preferred morrowind more; however, the graphics and beauty of this game cannot be beat by any of its competitors. a+",2
"buy the game, it is wonderful. ive sunk so much time into this game and havent even begun the main story yet. plus with the workshop support it makes mods so easy to install.",1
"if youve lived under a rock for the past 2 years you might not know that this is a good game. has its problems, bugs, ect, but its a great game. the combat system suffers from being either too complicated (as a mage or whatever) or being way too simple (as a basic warrior / archer)",4
"i have been playing this game on the 360 for more than 300 hours and now ive purchased it here on steam so i can experience the mods for this game. onto the review, this game is just absolutely amazing, it has to be the most well done rpg currently, what i would say as an elder scrolls fan is that skyrim is much more streamlined than oblivion and morrowind, there are less skills and the levelling is system is much different, but more better than the previous installments. the pros of this game? like any other elder scrolls game, the world is beautiful, you would have to constantly stop every few minutes to view a breathtaking scenery, the games graphics is brilliant, though the faces of the characters are rarther stiff, also, killcams are a great addition. the cons? well, it mostly suffers from bugs but it can be fixed by using console commands (sorry console peasants!) and most of the npcs are rather bland, but nevertheless, this is a game that will truly immerse you for countless of hours, the dlcs are must have, too.",1
"explore. fight. speak to random people, and perform arbitrary tasks. theres some story involved, but frankly its both poorly written and executed. this is perhaps intentional, as skyrims greatest asset is the freedom to explore. too bad the combat system awful.",3
"excellent game hands down. explore, destroy, progress, and role play. one of the best games out there with not only full graphical quality but replayablity. thanks to the modding community what was over 500 hours of gameplay now is about over the thousands. vanilla (default) experience of the game is superb but with the addition of modding youll be coming back all the time for this game. legendary edition is well worth the price for first time buyers as the dlc add new heighten experiences, abilities, features and even drastic changes to the land of skyrim, from vampire lord transformation (dawnguard) to dragon riding (dragonborn) and even a lil cosy charm with child adopting and real build homes (hearthfire). for the sake of sharing refer to nexus, steam workshop, and loverslab (18+)(yes theres clean stuff too) via google for all your mod needs.",3
"the perfect game. only complaint i have is maybe a better navigation through magic and weapons while in combat and the entering a building is a bit slow. with all the mods available this is replayable till the next one comes out.",2
"great game, perfect for pc. mods are recommended, like trains instead of dragons and dwemmer chainswords. possibly the best single player game in existance.",2
"i recommend this game. get skyrim. get mods. disappear for two months. gg, bethesda. best $60 i ever spent. <3 - 2br02b, 2014 ps: that multiplayer mod would make me  myself, since seriously? ffffffffffffffffff eso.",1
"skyrim is a great game with amazing quests/stories. also the amount the mods available adds so much more to the game after youve beat the main game, and the dlcs.",2
"well. it doesnt get much more thu-umingly good than this. skyrim in pc is a waterfall of fun - the game itself boasts a 94 in the metascore, and theres so damn much to be getting on with in skyrim! the atmospheric views and daunting enemies make this game cash-worthy, and the ability so shout - rather loudly - as a dragon can is pretty unique, and brings skyrim to the table as a worthy rpg contender. graphics? theyre a little demanding, but the ultra settings are a different story - bringing the best graphics to an rpg ive ever seen. such a good game - especially with mods. brilliant. buy it. be the dragonborn.",4
"it says it needs to update but it wont ive tried all the stuff it told me to do but it dosent work untill it works i dont recomend this game on steam please help",1
"pretty neat. mods make it a lot more engaging and fun to play. 9/10 since modding is a pain, but totally worth it.",4
"i found this elder scrolls to be the best one out their atm when i completed the main story i had to download the dlc well woth the price.",1
"what can possiblly be said? this is by far the best elder scrolls game yet. many of the more annoying features from previous games(i.e. rapid transport, poor waypoint systems) were finally addressed with skyrim. while the game is hardly perfect, character for example are still very 2-dimensional and shallow regardless of how important they are supposed to be, overall the game is an excellent play, made all the better by a steller mod community and the presence of the dragons.",3
"realy cool, but its realy expensive in a quick summary. but if you like a more extensive recconmendation: +workshop so you dont get bored +exelent back story +good video quality choices -very expensive dlc, but can be worth it sometimes during holidays. +very long story line so you dont beat in a day. - save selections sucks since you have to find which ones which thats realy all i can name since i havent gotten to far in the game and ive played 52hrs xd",1
"lesson iv learnt while modding skyrim is: if your computer can play skyrim without a struggle you dont have enough mods installed 10/10",1
"its to broken of a game for me to recommend buying it. i understand it is a large game and it would be hard to fix every bug, but come on! ive run into more bugs playing 7 hours on here and 20 on ps3 than ive ran into all other bugs in every other game combined. i wish i could recommend it, but the fact that you have to go into console command more times than you have to save makes the game leave a bad taste in your mouth.",1
"if you havent bought skyrim yet you should be locked up in prison for the rest of eternity",2
"if you can get past the occasional glitch, this game is loads of fun.",6
"if you dont already own this game, your parents should disown you. just buy it now, ill forgive you.",1
"this plus many many mods equals so much time wasted. this is probably my favorite game as of now. if you can afford it, go nuts.",4
"everyone who even remotely likes rpgs needs to play this game! !0/10.",1
"this game is ok. not my type of game really, but the only reason i got the game was because all of my friends were telling me that it is the best game youll ever play. i was a little disappointed when it wasnt that good. overall the graphics are pretty good and the storyline is amazing. rating: 7/10",1
"this game is awesome! fight dragons, zombies, other things, and tons of cool mods!",1
"just an amazing game to get lost in. the mod community takes the pc version of this game to a whole new level. hours of fun in this one for sure.",2
"played this on console the most (78 hours) and i can tell you it is worth the money. the graphics on pc beat the newest cod if you get a few texture enhancing mods and it has the best gameplay experiance ever 10/10 by far one of the best games on the market",1
"it is a fun game and i like to play it alot i have made a totalof 3 charater that have finished all of teh main non downloadable missions",1
"mess with the best and be downed and undressed, oh what a great feture a bunch of shouts that do nothing, ill clear the skys motherf**ker you know im not bluffin. ghosts in this  just wanna be bros even underground it still f**cking snows.",1
"this game is so amazing better quality and surround sounds. get hands down.",2
"one of the best games ive played. but dont kill the chickens.",2
"this game will ruin your social life......trust me xd but to be serious, i have been a huge elder scrolls fan since morrowind and this is by far the most in depth es game to date and im loving every minute of it. i do have to say though, its pretty hard to kill dragons when half the town is on your butt cause you turn into a vampire lord to slay it xd i give the game 9 dragon souls out of 10 :)",1
"an arrow to the knee cant stop me from playing this game.",1
"this game isnt as vast and expansive as oblivion, but people must understand that with todays technology, it would take a signifigantly larger amount of time and resources to recreate something that big with a new engine. that being said, the enviornment is still extremley varied, and assuming you dont fast travel all the time, its still a huge map. the enemies are varied, combat feels satisfying when you beat someone, and many new or improved features exist because of the developers lessons learned from oblivion, and fallout 3/nv. this game will feel familar, yet different. in some time the development tools will be released for pc, and the game can only get better. highly reccomended it to anyone who can pull themselves away from the cliches of bf3 or mw3.",6
"pure video game crack. 10/10 find out why an arrow to the knee is bad for adventurers.",2
"no ending... thats why its great... free roam and top quality mod",1
"this game is too fun but i need more i completed it in less than a summer i completed dawnguard in three days gimme more",4
"excellent game, great graphics and gameplay. hours of fun and always something to do. pc version i find more fun than console",1
"i have never been a huge fan of fantasy, im much more inclined toward superheroes and science fiction. skyrim is the first elder scrolls game ive played and the first fantasy game ive played since tabletop d&d when i was a kid. it has taken over my life! i stay up too late playing, i dream about it when i go to sleep, i compare movies to the game experience... im having too much fun with this and it only got better when i started modding the game. i really like the game play and the controls are not a nightmare when using a keyboard (unlike other pc games) even without nifty control mods. theres so much to do and even at 163 hours of playing (at this writing) ive still only discovered maybe half of the encounters on the map. looking forward to getting the other add-ons, dragonborn and dawnguard. hearthfire has added a new dimension to my story so it makes me eager to explore the rest of what skyrim has to offer.",3
"oh boy, heres an interesting one. now this one is going to be hard to describe in a small paragraph. skyrim is a big sandbox game where you go around, killing dragons, bandits, and even guards. you choose whether or not youd like to be a good guy or a bad guy (though i prefer to stay neutral so i dont have to choose between the two). you can join the companions, become a werewolf, and be badass. or you can become an assassin for the dark brotherhood and totally kick some  while earning a fair amount of cash all together. like i said, i cant put it all into one paragraph. but if your computer can handle it, or you have a console (and like medieval/fantasy games) i highly recommend this game.",2
"i would recommend this game it is a great rpg game it brings you back into the ages of swords small bows and skin amour and last but not least magic its graphics are very good depending on your computer it has a great story line good luck if you buy this great game :)",1
"dragons, dragons, dragons. this game is brilliant, loads of stuff to do. tons of quest, tons of places to explore. a must buy for any fan of rpg games. get this and tesiv & tesiii, all brilliant games.",2
"vanilla game is a disgrace, modded its absolutely amazing (pretty much the same as with fallout).",3
"its all starts on an xbox... 3 months later the ps3 gets involved... 9 months later, i decide to get it on ym laptop because its the greatest game ever created in the historical book of gaming ever created in the universe of gaming in the know universe... i think? press play? i shoudnt have now all i can do is sit on my 600 pound butt eating cheetos and playing skyrim. i have beaton the main questline 9 times (yeah only 9) put about 19,000 hours into this game, eatin 9000 bags of cheetos and somehow managed to spend over 200$ on this game (how tho) once i started for my laptop i noticed you can mod so of course i gotta sit for another 50 hours (yes i am not even kidding) just downloading mods, now i wait to use them! now i cant decide weather to recommend this game or not...",1
"truly one of the greatest games that ever was or will be, skyrim is something that has to be experienced rather than discussed to get why this game rocks. the fact that this game is still being updated with mods and that players are literally spending thousands of hours on this game speaks for itself. that being said, the game has its flaws (the dragons become just so repetitive, for one) but this is more than made up by its gargantuan scale, allowing players to do almost anything. skyrim offers an escape that few other games can provide and it only makes me hungry for the next elder scrolls installment.",1
"well, much like previous elder scrolls games (im looking at you, oblivion) the main quest line is very short, and very easy. fortunately, theres plenty of other questing to be done, and the modding community is amazing, as it always has been. so, yeah, great (if a bit easy) content, great modding community, great game. except for the guards bringing up knee arrows, but theres a mod to fix that!",2
"omg this game has consumed my life for days and i been modded mopsting of the time just started playing 12 hours ago and i just stopped thanks skyrim now ima be lifeless for a while",1
"with the abmount of mods you can get now for skyrim it is now turly epic and worth the money, this is a must own game for any gamer hands down.",1
"great game, a lot of content and mods to make this game your own adventure",2
"with almost 200 hours on this game i can safely say that the base game is great. throw in the mods, you just entered a whole new world with endless possibilities.",2
"originally owned skyrim for the ps3 and just bought it for pc, can honestly say im enjoying it way more now!",1
"i killed a chicken and soon became most wanted in skyrim",1
"fantastic game! you could spend your entire life on this game, especially with mods.",2
"if, in the year 2014 you still do not own or have played skyrim, well then you should probably not waste anymore time playing video games..this game is a masterpiece, which hits a new high when you throw in the mods on the pc version...must own 10/10",1
"excellent game, spent a lot of time on it, still not finished!",2
"the best game for a long time. its a game. you can play it again and again even without commutys mods. if you havent played skyrim yet (omg, is it even possble???) take your money from the wallet and put this game to your game library right now! oh. my. god. 1010, 1010!!!",2
"truly immersive and enjoyable experience. on par with morrowind for me.",5
"this game earned goty for a reason, you can literally spend 100+ hours and still be entertained with plenty of quests and items to get. the world is vast, the dungeons numerous and plenty of monsters and creatures to interact with. more so i recommend getting all the dlc, they are worth every cent.",1
"skyrim is probably the best rpg i have ever played. ive waited for the game for at least a year for it to come out. got it on 11-11-11, and just recently bought it on steam for my pc. the game with mods is so fun you can make the game to however you want to play it. the game on its own though is amazing. if you are a fan of rpgs buy this game now! you will not regret it. if you ever played oblivion you know how much fun that was and skyrims experince was 10x better. i 100% recommend this game.",1
"i dont know how to express this enough. this is the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if you are thinking about getting it get it! in fact if you dont even want it get it! if you are alive you should get this game! if you are dead you should get this game! this game will channge your life!!!",3
"a game where trying to interact with giants holding clubs turns into the funding of nasas space program.",2
"the only question you can ask yourself when even thinking about this game is why am i not playing this right now?",2
"i have created another life in this world! i have a family and i even have a pet skeever! skyrim has given me the chance to have a giant rat as a pet! what more could i ever ask for.... unicorns?",3
"by dis gaem if u liek de dragons and magic shoutingz. also i am a lizaerd and my wifu is a lady. she does the beastiality on me but i don caer she is so kawaii i also installed nood mod and had sex wiv her!",1
"so many mods, and customization makes the replayability so high that you will keep playing for years.",1
"youre all like fusrod- then a freaking dragon appears and wubwubwubwubwubwubwubwub you kill it and take its soul.",2
"war, war never changes... or was that this game? yes/69",1
"if you want a game that you can play for hours and hours and hours, and then just stop for a long time, and then come back to and play again for hours and hours and hours, then this is the game for you! the only reason not to buy it, is if you dont want to slay dragons and be awesome!",1
"this games awesome in the 5 hrs ive played, but the lag is high on my potato of a computer. unless you can deal with lag, get a gaming pc or laptop and play on that.",1
"only 3 words can describe this game: fus ro daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah",1
"you are not a true gamer if you havnt played skyrim. one word. epic! this game is epic! do you fricken understand me! if you dont i will come to you and slap you and make you buy it! and the dlc! do you understand!! sorry i got a little carried away.",4
"having played 90+ hours of skyrim this past week, i figured that i should write a review on it. first of all, i had to said this is an amazing sandbox+ rpg experience. i am someone who enjoyed doing side quests as well as misc quests as a mean to earn more money. i got to say that till now i had not finish the story as there are so much more to do. i was pleasantly surprised initially when i see people with over 2000~4000+ hours of gameplay time. all i can say is skyrim had just that much content especially if you include all the dlcs. i mean just building a single house took me more than 2 hours, not to mention the fact that i had to design and decorate my own house. it pretty much a chore that feel great after you are done with it. i am also barely done exploring skyrim after 90 hours in, the combat are extremely fluid and animated especially when you do a sneak attack. there are many other great elements in skyrim such as pick-locking which can be extremely frustrating but fun to play around with. i had never been this impressed with a rpg before and i definitely think skyrim is by far the best i had played so far for this price. i definitely recommend this game to every rpg lovers, you wont ever regret it especially if you enjoyed other rpg such as the witcher as well as fable.",2
"everyone should at least try one of the elder scrolls games. :]",1
"great open world rpg and beautiful scenery for a desolate snowy area. combat still feels clunky and needs an overhaul in my opinion but the story and wide variety of quests and exploring you can do make up for it. huge community and vast selection of mods keep me coming back to this game in my library time and time again.",2
"i bought this on 360 and played 1500+ hours and now on pc you get infinite modding content. you dont know what youre missing. 10/10",2
"skyrim: the best fantasy rp (in my opinion). if you like fantasy, rp, individuality, and choices, this is the game for you. thanks to steam, nexus and a special thanks to all the developers, we players can get even more out of the experiance of playing skyrim. as a female gamer i find this helps meet might individual needs and style as a rp. im still new to steam. but so far it has been a blast. so far i have nothing negative to say. at this point i am a 100% costumer.",4
"i killed the eater of worlds in one hit with a dagger half te size of my . this game is okay.",1
"people if you havent played a elder scrolls or skyrim get it. the main story line its self is awesome imagine all the dlcs and side quest etc it will provide hours of fun",1
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",2
"excellent storyline(s) with tons of gameplay, and the legendary edition is worth the extra $20. you may have heard that this game has a lot of bugs, and thats true, but they actually can make the game more fun. miraaks a , by the way. just thought id warn you.",3
"arguably one of the best games ive ever played. open world, free to level up your character as you wish, interesting quests, being able to buy and build houses (with hearthfire) and of course slaying dragons. who doesnt like killing flying lizards? i would definitely recommend this game. simply one of the best rpgs out there. too bad there is no multiplayer option and combat feels rather clunky at times but the multitude of things you could do in skyrim easily offset those.",1
"this truly is a masterpiece and incredible role playing game!",1
"skyrim is a wonderfully detailed world that provides hundreds of hours worth of play. even though the game is now three years old it is still one of the best, if not the best game of its type out there on the market. i paid sixty dollars for the game a month before it came out and i have more than gotten my moneys worth out of it. sadly, steam and valve has caused far too much difficulty for me. they take a ssimple disk download and turn it into a two week ordeal. they require that i prove that i bought this game eveb though i have bought dlcs that require this game from them. the service is laughable and at best unreliable. in short they make this game a waste of time. i will remind you that the only servie that steam provides is to the companies creating the software. they dont do anything for the actual customers who bought the games. i have supported bethesda with the purchase of elder scrolls 3,4 and 5. i also bought fallout 3 and new vegas but i refuse to ever buy another game from them as long as they continue to do business with the likes of steam. dont waste your money on this game. dont waste you money on anything that steam has any part of.",9
"heavily moded, its a gem amongst the crpg. you cannot be wrong when you buy skyrim on pc.",1
"highly addicting and fun game. somewhat lagy, but other than that i highly recomend it.",2
"good lord, the sheer amount of things to do is enough to make ones head spin. this game rightfully deserves to be heavily played years after its original release. i know im not breaking any new ground by speaking highly of it, but ive certainly gotten my moneys worth and then some.",2
"played this first on xbox 360 when it came out, but now i have a pc capable of playing it it will be fun to play it again and gague the gamplay differences. its a great game to play with a huge world to explore and get lost in. it lacks a little of the magic elder scrolls oblivion held for me, but thats probably just personal preference. id reccomend the game for any fantasy geek who loves to cast spells and bash things with swords!",1
"this is the best game (role playing game) i ever played... glad i purchased this ^^ worth all the moneys.",1
"skyrim. nuff said. simply amazing. also, makes the console version look like a joke.",1
"a harrowing simulation of a world where animals fall from the sky and everyone has been crippled by arrows in knees. emergent horror gameplay as entire towns follow you into your house and have to be told to leave by your huscarl. marry a lizard but not a cat. become a mage. kill butterflies.",2
"while various glitches and crashes still haunt this game years after release, the storyline is epic and the systems are pretty good. play it to explore the beautiful, detailed world.",1
"i strongly recommend this game with its price it has good value if your not choosing to buy it i will say this #syyyyyyyyyyyyyynd",2
"its a really good game. its had me hooked for a couple of years.",6
"worth plenty of money. a bit bland. lots of content. but you must play with mods. they make it a truly great game.",2
"one of my favorite games of all time. truly an experience.",1
"one of the best games ive played. the fun never ends and you will never get bored.",1
"easily one of the greatest rpg games of recent times. i highly recommend playing this if, for some ungodly reason, youve yet to do so.",1
"its skyrim! what should i say? buy it. (i redeem it to late at steam, thats because i only have 10 hours playtime.) buy it. god damn!",1
"shouted a goat off of a mountain 10/10 would shout at goats again",1
"i spent countless hours in tamriel, bethesda made a great game, even though it was not near perfect, the modding community made skyrim into one of the best rpgs in recent years, if somethings is not like you want it? mod it. if there is something that cant be modded in skyrim, try another bethesda game, someone even managed to mod fallout: nv to have working cars! without mods: 7.6 with mods: 9.1",3
"way too hyped up for what it was. its ok for a time sinker but its just the same  over and over. dungens are copy and pasted and quest were boring as .",1
"skyrim is an absolutely phenominal rpg and great community and mods.",1
"skyrim is the type of game where you spend 30 mins+ in a dungeon then spend another 30 mins+ selling and stashing your loot and buying new armor and weapons and then you find a new quest or dungeon to do then repeat the process. how i say it makes it sound boring but you are engaged every single second.",1
"downloaded bunch of mods. now, when i shoot bow it says f*** her right in the  , when i use torch it says smoke weed everyday , theres tf2 and marvel universe charachters walking around and i am jedi. 10/10",1
"one of my favorite games of all time, if youre looking for a great open world adventure with a vast amount of character customization and a huge modding community to keep you playing for hours on end.",1
"this game is not bad. probably not enough sewers, bad jokes, fus ro dahs!!!!!1111!!!!one!!!111eleven!!11|||!",2
"this game is broken, all youre gonna get is a failed to initialize render. do not waste your money on this broken game until bethesda studios fix this damned game.",1
"dont buy if you want to do well in school, keep a good social life, have good friends, and keep in touch with family. 10/10",1
"love this game.... have inveted so much time but it is the ultimate in free roam... when will there be vi",2
"you could run this on a toaster i swear. mods are great 10/10 would get this gifted to me again.",1
"is more realistic than real life. 10/12 -ign/gamespot",1
"spent 3 times the time i actually played the game modding to make it worthwhile. 8/10",1
"loved skyrim even with its flaws. high hopes for argonia.",4
"now this... this right here is a game to invest hundreds of hours into. its easy to run on most modern computers, so theres no reason why you shouldnt buy it. i dont need to tell you anything else- buy. this. game.",1
"this is generally one of the best games i have played, thank you for hours of fun! :dd",1
"killed an old woman. stole a plate. got arrested. (because of the plate). fought a dragon. stole a crown. got drunk. became a werewolf. killed bees with fire. followed a talking dog. visited the old dwarven cities. killed robots. became an assassin. killed the emperor. got beaten to death by a whole town for stealing a cabbage. became a respected general. fought bandits. poisoned mead. stole cabbage again. 10/10 would skyrim again.",1
"is a good over all game wityh grafics and gameplay being some of the hiest quality i seen but however often time the collor scal seems a bit mono tone and the capabilitys of the magic combat system will leave you lacking however that does not tack from this game in any way for you first to 3rd play thrue and will be barley noticed skyrims lockpicking skill is a step up from the one featured in oblivion giving a more imersive fealing as well as lot less randome titals and spells that are ether usless or are just cluter",4
"im a bit late to the party, but this is just an amazing game. actually, its more of a virtual world, populated with people, characters, and creatures of all types. theres always something to do, and the variety is nearly endless. i still havent tapped all the potential of vanilla, so im looking forward to some of the dlc down the road. cant go wrong with this one.",1
"i recommend this game because it is a very exciting game with alot of weird and creepy things including ancient nord ruins, falmer, etc. but the main reason why i like it is because there is alot of roleplay and stuff to do, earn, and mess around with. its one of my favorites and ive had this game a while on my xbox. but with the whole moding experience id say it is pretty crazy and awesome! you should get it.",2
"this game though. the best fps fighter ive ever played",1
"best game ive ever played, if you dont have it, buy it now",4
"i had a lot of fun with this version of skyrim i think it is loads better than the consle versions pros you have mods now. to me that makes it so much more fun. cons it is confusing how the controls work at first. some mods dont work for the game",1
"this is an amazing game and the only disbenifits from owning this game is the glitches and how you have to spend money on everything encluding the dlc. i recomend this game to anyone that likes adventuring, killing things, absoving a dragons soul, pickpocketing and casting weird dangerous spells.",3
"meh. its pretty fun once you mod it, but still gets kinda dull fairly quickly.",2
"a game isnt great just because of good graphic or good story, but because it is crafted is such a way that it can run great in medium pc and yet run superb in harcore pc. i have seen many large filed games with so-so graphic quality, while this game doesnt have that much, yet runs much greater than those games. one of original rpg, where it is all about you, you are an adventurer in skyrim, it is up to you how you journeyed throughout this world and slay undeads, beasts, monsters & dragons. this game is designed for mature players and be warned, very addictive",2
"vary good game with engough dlcs and mods to keep you busy for a very long time.",2
"i sometimes oil myself up and roll around naked pretending to be a meatball marinating in a pot.",2
"i cant even write how awesome this game is, just read the other reviews, and read all the gaming articles about it. do yourself a favor and download the highly rated graphics mods for this. and after you complete the game, you can download conversions or make a new game with certain war related mods enabled. youll love this game, this game is up there on my list alongside the mass effect and assassins creed series as well as kotor.",1
"this game is addicting. i am picky and i love rpg games that have a midievil feel to them. what really gets me hooked it the ability to mod this. i can not only play the game, but i can build off of it for a truly custom experience to make it look and play how i want it to. it enables me to truly immerse myself in the game how i want to be immersed and enjoy the lore, storyline, and general gameplay. im not typically into one-player games, but this has to be my favorite now. the graphics are amazing, the lore is extensive, the gameplay (fighting, weapons, training, skills, skill tree) is easy enough to pick up but gets very complicated in higher levels which really makes you think about what youre doing. the mods are a pleasure, and with the nexus mod manager, easy to implement and manage, even if you have to rebuild your data install.",1
"its just too much fun and so long of a story, youre guaranteed fun every time you play! mods definitely help!!",1
"i think this game is still one of the best rpg in the store. this is must-have for rpg fans. lots of deep stories, large map, swords and dragons... anything else needed? nope!",1
"this is one of the time consuming games ive ever played, the lore is fantastic, the scenery is awe inspiring, and the amount of freedom it offers is unprecedented. if youve got the cash, get this game.",3
"i have had very memorable memories with this game! 10/10",1
"honestly one of the best games ive had the pleasure of playing. ive spent so much time with this game, and have yet to ever get tired of playing.",1
"its an awesome game, long quests, great value. ing get it",1
"best game of the last generation made even better with mods :)",1
"amazing game, the workshop community makes the game even better.",1
"torrented it. and still bought it. yes its that ing good. or i am that stupid. 9/10",1
"skyrim is an amazing game because it is open world and you are free to do whatever you want.",3
"the whole town got mad at me because i picked up a bowl. 10/10",1
"i dont think this game will ever end and i dont want it to. its such a beautiful game!",1
"im a completionist, something that is quite a challenge with the elder scrolls games series. skyrim is a dream come true for my play-style: free form, free roaming, play and discover. i love getting lost in skyrim and discovering new places, side quests and what not. really one of my all time favorites and highly recommended!",2
"to be honest, the elder scrolls games just are not my thing. i even loaded this guy up with some ~250 enhancement mods, but... in the end, it just comes down to doing dungeon over and over... and over...... and over......... and over........... and over. did i use too many overs? because thats what the game feels like to me. the standard response to that is that its supposed to be this big open world you can explore. but yknow, ive already got a big open world to explore called the earth. when i pick up a game, i want a narrative, a directed story with fun, engaging gameplay. so is this a bad game? well not really but you should know what youre getting into. if you like open world games/the other elder scrolls, youll love it because its basically the same thing as oblivion & morrowind & etc. if you do not, then skip.",1
"if you have a computer that can support this game. play it. it is extremely addicting and fun! browse the workshop and download some mods and addons to make the game even better! it is worth it. just buy it and agree :)",1
"hundreds of hours of gameplay before even considering the expansions or mods. one of the greatest gaming bargains.",2
"so much trouble with hang ups about 30 hours in... xp sp3 , athlon quad 3.2 ghz, 8 gb ram decided to upgrade to windows 7 and try it again. one of the most awesome games ive ever played.",3
"this by far my favorite game that i have ever played. where do i begin? the gameplay is excellent along with the combat, and the story is wonderful, there is more much than a huge amount of questline... from being a soldier in the civil war to stopping the dragons coming back to skyrim. and those graphics..... good work bethesda, good work.",6
"this is such an awsome game if you ever get the chance play the living hell out of it",1
"amazing game, the moddability makes it epic! get nexus mod manager though, it is far better. you can get the game to load mods from both the steam workshop and nexus with a bit of work, as long as you are careful about conflicts. cannot wait for tes6, with next-gen graphics and tesselation it is going to be beautiful.",2
"i have not been a big fan of the elder scrolls series but skyrim i found was a really good game the controls are quite easy to learn and arent to complex as well the graphics of this game is super but lags out a bit however that could be my laptop overall i would rate skyrim 4/5",1
"what more can be said about skyrim? in my opinion its the best bethesda game ever made, which also makes it one of the best open world games ever made. its aged a bit since release, but its still gorgeous. the amount of things to see and do is staggering; my first playthrough of the campaign totalled 80 hours and i still hadnt seen half of the content. skyrim was also a cultural phenomenon, sparking internet memes left and right that will be remembered for years. if you havent played it, youre missing out.",1
"one of the best role playing games out there! great medieval and magical type combat! vast world that looks very beautiful! id recommend you have a computer that can handle better games. so many quests you can do and the dlc i think are worth it.",2
"if your friends dont like/love skyrim you should stop being friends with them you dont need that negativity in your life.",1
"the most immersive gaming experience you could possibly hope for. well over 100+ hours of content. 10/10",1
"skyrim is a great game. i recomend this to everybody.",1
"this i sgame is one of my fave. game to play when i play adventure game but it one of the coolest open world games right up the with sleeping dogs if you like open world and adventure games this is a game for you but there is a dlc that is awsome called heart stone i want if some one knows or has it tell me if it is worth the money!?!?",1
"amazing game, there are hours of replay value. must buy!",2
"ever time now when i play this it keeps closing any help?",1
"do you like your soul? this game will eat it. but in a good way. this game will pick the lock of your heart and then cook your soul over a effing campfire. much mods. mods good. game great.",1
"interface is annoying as hell, game crashes on alt+tab without mods, and theres significantly less customisation than in previous tes games. the game likes to crash randomly, the textures are worse than in oblivion, and the voice acting seems pretty shonky, since everyone speaks in some kind of russian accent.",2
"open ended, gorgeous, easily moddable, and with great core gameplay and story. despite my love of morrowind, i still say this is the best of the elder scrolls games. do anything. do everything. above all else, its fun from the first second to the last.",2
"loved this game back when it first came out played it on a xbox. the game never gets boring for me as you can play with an infinite number of types of class with the make your own class in effect system and you can install mods to make the new experience even better 10/10.",1
"i dont care if you have ever played any rpg before. if you love the format or are new to it... this is a must for any gamer young and old. i once chopped wood for 3 days (game time) then it took me a full day to walk the twenty feet to sell it to someone who die in a dragon attack... there is so much to discover in the northern realm of skyrim and the current social stigmas are many. if you think we live in a world where we just cannot get along; it is interesting trying to unite a nation of thick skulled nords... oh and try playing the game as a nord... you get some unique dialogue.",1
"i dont even think i need to convince anyone that this game is good.",1
"great game with great development from the core graphics to the dynamic-ness of a chicken this game shows true passion from the developers....fyi bethesda are the best at rpgs so yah. overall amazing game with great replay ability; however there are numerous bugs but they dont take away the immersion and over time it gets quite funny! 4.8 / 5 bananas",1
"skyrim has everything you want in a game. good visuals, good story, good combat, and a great amount of variety. this game does a great job at immersing you into this world and keeping you there. it has dragons, werewolves, magic, vampires, otherworld gods, dark elves, mystery, robots, tragedy, humor, awesome loot, and epicness. what you experience is based on how far you want to venture into this world and on top of all that, you have the steam workshop to add even more.",2
"this game is an example of how a game should be, skyrim is a game that is near perfect in every aspect. please, we need a new elder scrolls game (eso blew) co-op would be really cool(forget about mmo, it wont work)",8
"a game unlike anyother, and one that tops my list regardless of age or error. it is a masterpiece and will stay that. it is, as p0rtalplay3r would say. a truly great",3
"what can i say.... great roleplay game you can mod it like crazy! love it my most played game recommend if you like spells, swords, bows and killin! :d",2
"get it!!! it is a really fun and well-known sandbox game with free-rome, and loads of quests for you to complete!",1
"theres a mod that allows me to decapitate skeletons. 11/10 would always play again!",1
"skyrim is an amazing game, full of content and totally worth its price. one of the best games ive ever played!",1
"no elder scrolls game is about story. skyrim captures what the entire mission of the elder scrolls series is about: adventure. when youre walking on the road and bandits attack you, when you stumble upon a cave loaded with enemies and treasure, when you stay up through the late hours of the night because you dont want to go back to the real world, you know youre playing skyrim. the story driven quests are there to give you a general direction. the random encounters are there to make sure you take the longest route possible while going in that general direction.",1
"mods. so many great mods. turn a dragon into a train = makes this game scary as hell",2
"the elder scrolls skyrim is the king of elder scrolls so far. boasting good graphics, a 100% open world and a large amount of quests. tesv also houses the finest mod workhouse with skyrim nexus and steam workshop allowing mods of all shapes and sizes from new houese, free dlcs (falksaar recommended) and storm troopers this game will last you for ages. i have 313 hours and still are not bored. i highly recommend this game and be sure to mod it to however you like.",4
"simply put, this is my very favourite game. its immensely fun its own right, and has a massive modding community, ensuring near endless replayability.",4
"a wonderful rpg that should not be missed by any lord of the rings, game of thrones, and the hobbit. one of my all time favorite games and the mods!!!! make this game so much better and add over 30 hours of gamplay. you can even download all of morrowinds missions to skyrim and play them in new revized manner with. a 8.9 outta 10 in my book.",2
"on the game you can run around doing anything from stabing chickens looting killing anything you see it kind of speaks for it self 5/5 get this game now other wise your makeing a masive mistake",1
"why is level scaling a thing, why cant you just ing balance the game, why add so many skills if levelling alchemy is just going to make everything in the game stronger and thus punishing me for wanting to not level up combat skills",1
"id say over 14 days of cumulative playtime between 4 characters on 2 systems says plenty about how awesome this game is.",1
"this game makes every other game ive played seem tasteless.",1
"with the worlds best community and top-quality mods this game is a piece of art. 9/10 without mods its lacking some stuff, its buggy and can get dull after several hours. 7/10",1
"very interesting game, but cant keep it running. will not load, stops at start screen. have deleted and reloaded several time. just a big pain in the butt.",2
"i died.........alot........damn you alduiweiner...and mega mods...yea 40 bucks right now get it asshats go put yo fridge your room and then move your desk and fridge to the bathroom because you will snevahz stop playin",4
"fus doh rah!!!!!!! one of the best rpg games there is. fullstop",3
"excellent game, cant wait for the next generation eventhough i will always come back to this game.",1
"a game where you can do just about anything from pickpocketing to killing dragons. definetly worth getting",2
"im used to playing mmorpgs and sandbox indie games but never anything like skyrim, i was afraid id get bored so fast becouse of the single player thing as im used to online games but im hooked!",2
"just look at how many hours most players who play this game have logged playing this game. that should tell you how immersive skyrim can and will be. it has to be considered one of the best games ever made, let alone in its genre, and certainly one of the best ive ever played and enjoyed. nothing shy of epic.",3
"i have always been a fan of the elder scrolls ever since morrowind back in 2002 and in my opinion this is a great sequel. skyrim is the most stunning game to look at in the elder scrolls seris however some graphical gltiches occur. skyrim has also the best modding community so far as after more than 3 years mod delvepors either in the nexus or the workshop are still cranking out great mods to help enchance the game. in the end you must play this game if you are looking for a great rpg experince or just a great game.",3
"simply put, the best elder scrolls game out. endless amount of hours can be sunk into this and that doesnt even touch the mods out there.",1
"im not a fan of fantasy games. in fact i dont have a very high tolerance for them at all. so it is from a non-fan of the genre that i say just how pleasing and thrilling this game is. the freedom to do whatever you want, the customization, the landscape, everything is beautifully done. this is a great game that i can whole heartedly say to everyone, you need to play this! its epic!!!",3
"ah skyrim, youre that one rpg game i keep returning to (i had it on the 360 first in 2011 before i got the pc version last year, so yes i have spent a fair amount of time on this game. just figured id point that out in case some  hat says, you only have 25 hours on the game!!! you havent even played it much !!@@@!@#$#$@#$%) back to the review. this game is unlike any other. there is literally so much you can do in this game and its addictive as hell, plus on the pc version of the game you can mod the ever living  out of it. mods that add to the core game, or mods that enhance the graphics by a bunch. i dont really like making long reviews, but i will say this. if you love rpgs or if you want to get into rpgs. get this damn game! it is worth every penny!",1
"overated and overhyped. while the artstyle and music is still as good as other elder scroll games. the game mechanics have been simplifed for todays gamers. only way for me to enjoy this game is to mod the hell out of it so it feels more like elder scrolls iv.",1
"i dont really need to say anything for you to know this game is good. get it!",1
"this is my first elder scrolls game and compared to most games it does have some issues with glitches, but overall it is totally worth it! the scenery is beautiful and i love the open world/do missions when you want to aspect. you can play it however you like to. the only thing you dont have much choice with is a lot of the random dragon attacks have to be dealt with even though you are on a mission to get something else accomplished. i normally play shooters and this has been a nice change. i probably would not play it if there was no bow & arrow because it is the only shooting weapon. if you work hard and explore a lot and get the major missions done, you can become a force to be reckoned with! ;-) many mods available to do whatever you want and totally change the game and add missions/areas etc.",4
"a great open world rpg. best part about it, in my opinion, is the ability to mod the game. there is so much added replayability thanks to the huge and active modding community.",1
"the elder scrolls skyrim is a strong single-player only classic rpg. it features a skill-based system and an open world. this game has tons of content and a decent story. some of the side quest writing is exceptional. the game also features dragons that fly around and can attack you at any time. these dragons dont really provide a challenege (especially towards the end game) but add to the world immersion. overall the game suffers from being way too easy. any experienced rpg player will fly through this game with little effort. its still worth a play through and still tons of fun but id go somewhere else for a challenege. never played the dlc. genre lovers: must buy (doesnt get anymore rpg than this) non-genre lovers: worth a try (tons of value and pretty easy) time to beat: ~80 hours (i did every side quest in the vanilla game)",1
"seriously, what could i say about skyrim that hasnt already been said?? its an open-world rpg! its an ocean as deep as a kiddie pool, meaning there is tons of stuff to do, tons of content, but most of it isnt very deep. it doesnt really affect the world at large. but ya know what? its still super fun, and has hours of content, especially considering there are tons and tons of mods to customize basically every piece of it, as well as add all sorts of content. check it out.",1
"skyrim is truly a must own game, one that goes down as one of the best of all time. im sure though that you probably know this already, and are looking to buy it on your own, and if you dont already own this game, you really should. welcome to skyrim, a world were nord fantasy and dragons aboad. here, magic wizards and sorcerers live, only to be lost in defeat to the returned dragons. now, all that is the armys of skyrim, waging war on both eachother and the dragons that have come. you, a prisoner in the crossfire of these wars, is destined to defeat the dragons and restore the skyrim world. though in skyrim, you may choose another path. like most open world games, your options arent limited to one path. you can choose from the evil of the world, or the conquering of the world. here, you can wander steep slopes, vast tundra, large bodies of water, and even slay dragons. all the while, you collect several items and other incredible peripherals known as shouts. the more you play, the more you just get pulled in. not to mention the modding community for the game is beyond massive, and the people who do make these mods create thousands of extra hours of content, and that is trimming it down to just a slim portion. simply put, skyrim is one off the best games ever made, ever. a must own for any gamer, and for the price, it would be a sin not to buy.",1
"this game is very fabulous you have much adventure and much fun very good very good",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is my favourite game of all time. for potential buyers, skyrim is an open-world rpg that positions you as the dragonborn. your quest is to save the world from imminent destruction by slaying dragons. however, youre also free to do as you like. from trading with caravans, killing the undead draugr or even jsut cooking, there is a lot to do. despite the large amount of glitches, as bethesda games often have, they wont take away from your experience. on top of this, theyre also quite generous with dlc by providing entirely new weapons, skills and playable areas. this is just vanilla skyrim! once you use mods, anything can happen! i cannot recommend skyrim enough.",1
"oh gosh what a fantastic game, bethesda you should be proud!!! i have played skyrim for hours and hours, days and days and i hardly ever got bored. so much freedom, fantastic scenery and lovely graphics and gameplay. hardly any bad points here. from the first quest to the last skyrim is a long, hard but amazing experience. i love this game and sure many do to!!!",1
"this game may be old but it is one of the best games ive every played. it has great combat mechanics and gameplay. the story is very well made and there are tons and tons of side-quests. and it is one of the few games with dlc that is actually worth the money. i dont think i could ever get bored of this game, wether you are clearing out shops with stealth or throwing around giants with your shouts there is always something to do. 5/5 stars.",4
"definately a must have game for those familiar with the rpg genre. it is a major step up from the stereotypical rpg games, especially the jrpg types. there is so much freedom; room for customisation, creativity and exploration; and it is open world, where one players experience will differ from anothers. great game.",1
"no words for such an amazing game fun for the whole family",1
"100+ hours of play and i still keep finding things to do, awesome game and plenty of mods for everyones taste. ive been a fan of the elder scrolls since morrowind and skyrim didnt disapoint me, many hours on morrowind and oblivion. skyrim is a must for the rpg lover and fan of the elderscrolls",2
"i definitely recommend the game to anyone interested. this is undoubtedly one of the best...no, the best game i have ever played. never before had i been so excited everytime i played it. ironically, when the game was initially released i disliked it due to the fact the i had to kill dragons, (i had a soft spot for them) now, 3 years down the road, im gonna maul some bandits with odahviing! :) bethesda, you did too good on this one, now start working on tes 6! :d",1
"- installed - loaded in - created character - did all the intro quests - talked to jarl of whiterun - noticed that i could use console commands - turned off my auto-save feature - spawned 500000 cabbages - game crashed - loaded back in - sees that i cant continue my game - creates another character cabbage/500000; would over throw whiterun with cabbages.",1
"skyrim is good a game enough, but combine with mods... it makes the game near infinite. get this game",1
"literally the best game on steam you can do whatever you want. (even turn alduin into a sweetroll and eat him.) and the modding community is so big the fun will never end.",1
"killed an old woman. stole a plate. got arrested. (because of the plate). fought a dragon. stole a crown. got drunk. became a werewolf. killed bees with fire. followed a talking dog. visited the old dwarven cities. killed robots. became an assassin. killed the emperor. got beaten to death by a whole town for stealing a cabbage. became a respected general. fought bandits. poisoned mead. stole cabbage again. 10/10 would skyrim again.",1
"its skyrim, you either love it or hate it. pc version is best with all the various mod options with an extremely active modding community since release.",1
"if youre a fan of anykind of rpg game, this is really recommended! a huge world to explore and of course a  of quest ;) i wouldnt go as far as to say that skyrim is better than morrowind, but its definetly close behind :)",2
"came back to the game after first enjoying it at release. the skyrim mod community is fantastic and, coupled with the dlc, have really turned the game in to something truly awesome. everything else about the game you probably already know - engrossing stories, hundreds of things to see and do, and a strong sense of connection to your uniquely crafted character. one of the best there is.",1
"best game ever ngl get mods its great, any one who says otherwise has not got any lives left.",1
"the elder scrolls series has given us a number of masterpieces over the years. morrowind will always remain etched on my brain whereas oblivion has offered a vast world i found myself immersed into for hours at no end. following up on footsteps of such giants is never easy. and yet the 5th installment of the series, skyrim, still managed to impress and ensnare me.",1
"best game i have ever played. if you have money buy this. if you dont you have to save some and buy.",2
"way better than on console for one simple reason, mods!!!! the best mods are on nexus, and there are so many, total conversion mods, you name it, already had ample playtime on console, got this on a sale, and added just about 120 more hours in with mods!",1
"awesome game. very in depth and will entertain for hours.",2
"great game, bit glitchy at first but i thoroughly enjoyed playing skyrim.",1
"if you havent heard of this game you probably live under a rock, you hate yourself and i want nothing to do with you. however, if you have heard of it and havent yet decided if you want it, im here to assure you that yes, you are an indecisive idiot, and yes, you should buy this. now!",3
"this game is super cool!!! i got the xbox version and it was boooooooring... but now i have access to mods! batman in freakin skyrim!",1
"in my opinion, if you want one of the best rpg experiences, get skyrim.",1
"with what hours i have put into skyrim over a course of about a year i can say it is clearly worth it and im pretty sure everyone here agrees, worf.",2
"me- what have ya got for sale? belathor- mmm a little this, and uh little that.. taught me everything i need to know about running my own buisiness 10/10",1
"the graphics, amazing. even for it being a 2011 game. it you like long storylines,gaming,fun, ect. then you gotta buy skyrim. its on sale but i bought it back 2011. totally worth it.",1
"i started playing this game about 2 years ago when it first came out. i played it on the xbox 360 and now have switched over to pc and am still amazed at how much play time this game gets.",2
"i do recommend people play games such as morrowind and oblivion too when getting this game. skyrim has such an amazing feel when running out in its really big open world area. then a dragon flys off a ledge, grabs an innocent bystander and throws him.the dragon then lands right infront of you trying to kill you. seriously dragons are the best part of this game. the quests are fun except i dont care to do them again unless it was going to the afterlife of the nords and fighting alduin again. the characters emotions look alittle blank unlike oblivion where the character has a bit more of the look in their face. but their voice acting is ok. i recommend a good graphics card to run the game. i cant imagine how this game is already 3 years old. i feel like its still a very new game.",2
"great game, there are so many things you can do and create it is jam packed with fun and excitment and there are many fun mods which you can use to ehnace the gameplay!",1
"short review from metacritic: skyrim reimagines the open-world fantasy epic, bringing to life a complete virtual world open for you to explore any way you choose and its true :)",1
"great game before and afeter modding the sh*t outta it",1
"evidence that a good game with a workshop becomes a great game",4
"how about finally allowing us that bought skyrim at release the ability to add the dlc cheaper than buying the entire effing legendary game",4
"cant beat another elder scrolls game, a great time waster!",1
"85 hours in, and im only halfway through the main story. the ammount of content in this game is incredible. best quest system ive ever encountered. fun to play.",2
"awesome game - just wish the dead bodies dont roll around like they have no bones. easily addicted. some frustrating aspects involve being stuck at cutscenes and unable to see underwater, causing character to drown and die.",2
"this is one of my favorite games of all time. i have played this game through several times and i keep coming back for more.",4
"bought it, installed it, heard that it was full of bugs. when i start new game, and the intro scene when you go by horse, the wagon bugs out and literally gets stuck in a tree, and the horse winks up and down. would play again, 2/1.8846 gabenz.",1
"got the game and in under 24 hours i put about 50 mods on it... love it!",1
"what really is there to say? the elder scrolles franchise once more doesnt fail to dissapoint but now its back and better than ever. the world is gigantic, showing insane scale and beautiful scenery from the high mountains to the waterfalls. locations absolutely crowd the map (in a good way), leaving you on your own to carve a path into the game as you see fit. near endless customization adds to the immersion and bethesdas standing concept of the power of choice. whether wizard, warrior, or theif, this game will not fail to immerse you in its deep and awestriking stories. the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the richest, largest, beautiful, best games i have ever experienced.",2
"with its complete open world playstyle skyrim allows you to take complete control of your destiny and play at your own pace and style. with countless player made mods and dlc there is no end to the fun you can have with this game.",3
"this game is probably one of my all-time favourites. never gets old.",1
"im declared legally dead by government. would highly recommend.",5
"shot a chicken from across the map became most wanted man in the world 110/10 strongly recomend",1
"its a really good game to play and test your skills and use your own choise of going on a rampage in skyrim",1
"good game, even better when modded, id recommend it to anyone that enjoys rpgs edit: i also highly recommend playing the other tes series games, which also having modding communities.",3
"this game is one of the best singleplayers only! it has over 40 hours of gameplay(including sidequests and dlc). and best of all there are many classes to choose from. warrior, assassin, mage, and many more! skyrim has many different characters with very different attitudes toward you. you also have dragonborn blood(get the game to know what this is). bethesda put a lot of work into this game and it has shown to be worth thier effort. get this game and your going to have a really great time!",1
"probably wont ever be ported to the steam console. great game, runs fairly well in wine.",2
"i started the elder scrolls series since oblivion, so this is my 2nd tes ive played. i could say there are some improvement from the previous, like the atmosphere (i felt this game more fantasy-esque than oblivion), trigger event (how the guard react to your character, etc), and dragon and off course there are daedric missions which have its own background, and those missions give you reason to take and finish it. actually, daedric missions are my favourite part in this game, then there are main mission and faction/guild mission. apart from it, there are tons of mission, some are worth digging, some just bulls***. but that just elder scroll, it offers you a chance to explore an amazing world since it emphasize opportunities the player offered, those who cant bear free roaming game should avoid this game. you can gain a progress by just doing main mission, but you wont have rich experience, since it lays on the other mission or books, which will reveal how huge the tes world is. so if you searching for straight game, story dependent, and strong protagonist, ill advise to avoid this game",1
"i wish one day bethesda softworks will hire obsidian to do the writing of their titles. until then, the elder scrolls v: skyrim remains a slightly incomplete masterpiece, yet able to provide one of the best single-player experiences of the decade.",2
"the spiritual successor of elder scrolls iii morrowind - this game has everything that was missing from oblivion. a mixture of the awesome world design and such from morrowind, and the graphics from oblivion. words cant describe how good this game is.",2
"this is an adventure game in first person. when you enter the game for the first time, you will be amazed by the fantastic land of skyrim. ive spent so many hours on this game, both on playstation, and on pc... but everytime i start playing again, its as if i played it for the first time again. you can complete everything in this game, and still not have seen everything since the game is so filled with opportunities and decitions that can change the game drastically. i highly recommend trying this game out.",4
"any game that lets you use a power to wildly fling ragdoll physic bodies off of a cliff doesnt need any other recommendation. its an elder scrolls game, which can be hit and miss for some folks, but if youre open to experiencing an open world sort of rpg with a story that lets you approach at your own pace? this is a great game. more so, if you dont like any aspect of it? you can just go ahead and download mods to change nearly any portion of it.",4
"skyrim good game graphics are sweet u can mod all u like its an rpg with endless fun what more do u want?",1
"like viking style rpgs? this may be an old game but its pretty good.",3
"theres lots of stuff to do in this game and the best part of you can do it your way, what i mean by you way is you can create your one followers, create/modify your armor and weapons and ect... . i recommend this game to anyone who craves creativity.",1
"limitless entertainment thanks to the modding world. getting bored? pick new mod, change styles. better yet start all over, you think you might get bored but before you know it youll be traped again.",3
"skyrim is one of those games where you start something but you just cant stop afterwards. since this is steam you have the option to mod your game however youd like (after the purchase of the game of course). but this game has a great story line and tons of options to choose from. this game is probably on my top 5 list of games right now.",1
"an amazing game it is one of the games i have put the most amount of hours into and im not even half way through",2
"one of the greatest games ive ever played bar none. i dont know what else to say, really. this is a game that should be in the library of every rpg fan, period.",1
"skyrim is one of the most arpg games i enjoyed, i spent hours playing and couldnt get enough, the music its just amazing",1
"f*cking sweeeeeeeet! watch out for psychic guards :d",2
"very good game, and modding it can make it even better! if you not so much in to modding start with steam modding because its very easy for new modders :)",3
"been playing for more than 200 hours on another account, this game is amazing! 9.5/10",1
"first off, let me say this: skyrim is not the grand culmination of the elder scrolls series. skyrim is not the most amazing thing to ever roll across your computer screen. that said, it is a noteworthy addition to the series for its technical advancements, as well as the accessability it brings to newcomers to the es franchise. pros: ~very good learning curve ~beautiful graphics and sound ~much improved voice acting over previous games ~maintains the sense of freedom ~decent balancing ~god-awful speech wheel game is gone cons: ~story inconsistency. before you get angry, i am referring to the sense of continuum in the game, that is, there is none. you can become a legend by finishing any major quest line, but yet, npcs outside of that specific line show no change in attitude or conversation, even though they should logically have heard of you. this was something that morrowind did well, but oblivion and skyrim fall flat on their face in this regard. ~hand-holding. skyrim is extremely user friendly, but it is to the point that even on legendary difficulty, the game has little in the way of challenge. there is a cursor at all times to guide you, and there is virtually no situations that require legitimate puzzle-solving. all in all, an excellent game, that i highly recommend.",2
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a great game for anybody who enjoys rpgs. it has vertually limetless character options and a lot of replay value, seriously, you can play this game countless times and never get bored of its many storylines. if you get this game, be sure to check out the workshop for even more hours of enjoyment with mods.",1
"a very good game, much good ,such buy ,so fun, would recommend this to people who like role playing games and massive maps to roam through but make sure your computer can run it.",1
"oh my god... how much content can you cram into a game!? my completionist streak kicks in after a few hours and i suffer total brain failure, as i try to track too many quests and objectives, while simultaneously deliberately not advancing the plot, in case i miss anything. it results in complete nervous system collapse and i then have to start all over again. still... an absolutely brilliant game (though get some good mods for it!).",2
"so my original review of the majestic fifth installment of buthesduhs aaa hiking simulator series was, ing combat qtes!!!!!! which still holds true. oh well you have to deal with it i guess rite? some good things have been patched into the game like the infinite dragons can now fly backwards and also the game ctds a lot but its okay if you run 3 save + an autosave files like a bro. the game world is huge and there are 57,612 quests (yeah i counted( but there is no c&c to be had you either do quest like they say or u just leave it in your log like a quitter and quitters never win. tbh i have a lot of gripes about this game andf i wish it were a lot better than how it turned out and it is incredibly short sighted and frustrating at times but you know i still played it for over 100 hours final rating 11/10.",2
"the interface is too consoly, the close combat system too simple, the walking takes ages...but i still love this game.",2
"this game is absolutley tremendous i would advise everyone to buy this.",4
"this game has taken so much of my time up, but do not regret it for a second. originally i had it on the ps3 when it first came out and sunk about 300-400 hours into it then, after the debacle with the dlc on the ps3 i bought the game on the 360 so that i could play the dlc when they each came out and sunk a few more hundred hours into the game. now i have finally found wisdom and got myself a gaming pc i have it again, this time modded for a whole new experience to sink more and more hours into. if you like fantasy, first person and making up your own character back story and character quirks then this is the game for you. you can do anything and everything in this game, but the question is, what does your character want to do?",2
"obviously, this game is popular, and anyone reading this review is either neutral towards the game or likes it. i greatly recommend this game to anyone who likes an extremely moddable game. if you go to the nexus, there are thousands of mods to look at. the workshop has some mods in it, but most of them either suck or are from the nexus. im not going to paste a link, just google skyrim nexus and youll find it eventually. really though, if youve played this on the xbox or some other console, youre going to want to play it on the pc with mods.",5
"i want to play this game, but for some reason i cant. i think it must be because ive watched so many playthroughs on it to properly enjoy it for myself. this being said, the series of this game on youtube are amongst the best ive ever seen.",1
"one of my favorite aspects of wow (back in the day) was that you could just wander around and kill stuff for a while. i have played the elder scroll games since daggerfall, and have always enjoyed them. they have gotten better and better, both graphics and storyline (thought i enjoyed the storyline of morrowind more than oblivion, but the graphics on oblivion blew me away). my main gripe with oblivion was just how totally linear it was once you got in the storyline. and all the cool monsters were in the alternate dimension you closed off, so after story content was pretty week. then i read the reviews on this and gave it a shot. without a doubt one of the greatest games ever made. especially for those of us who like to play how we like, not always in a clean class. this game lets you do whatever you want in terms of skills. no longer are theredominant attributes you have to mess with to gain levels. lever skills, gain levels, just that simple. huge world, i find myself just wandering in a direction. find anything you can on the map. i always loved the dwemer mythology in the other games, and they explore that ever further. great quests, not always kill 10 rats like so many rpgs can be. if you havent picked it up, do yourself a favor and try it out.",2
"if you havent played skyrim on pc, you havent experienced just how far gaming has come, ive never touched a game thats made me feel so awesome while playing it, whether you want to run around killing everything, or play through checking every location, perfecting stats, and just exploring, skyrim will take over your life for at least a few months. the mods for this game are amazing, and with over a hundred installed myself, i can safely say, with the right hardware, skyrim is still the most beautifuul game i have ever played. it never grows old, put a few days aside to mod the game, then all thats left is to light up a fat one, and let your very own adventure begin 9.5 / 10",2
"this is game is amazing!!! i loved the quality of it and it has an amazing story line with extra sidequests... its never ending i swear...",1
"this game is awesome and with so many mods it literally has no end to the questline. overall i would say it was money well spent and was not one bit disappointed with any aspect of the gameplay or graphics. 10/10",1
"skyrim is a fantastic game, one of my absolute favorite games of all time, its beautiful, moddable, challenging, open world amazing, if i made a lengthy review, all the text could be translated into a very simple picture of me giving bethesda fellatio and enjoying it..... no homo, the game is simply that good.",3
"i really like this game. it has a great, detailed story line, and you can go about it however you want (be stealthy, use magic, etc..) it can be pretty challenging though, especially if your a lower level. overall, great game, i recommend getting it.",1
"the elder scrolls v : skyrim is one of the best games i played in 2013, possibly the most immersive and addicting game ive played as far as i know right now. its been 3 years already and i still have more dungeons to delve, trolls to slash and bandits to shout off cliffs. i definitely reccomend this as a 10/10 game!",4
"one of my favorite games of all times...but hey...im an rpg kinda guy",1
"game is awesome, who is unknowing enough to qeustion it? but.. you know theres a problem when dlc is more expensive than the game itself",2
"this game alone is fantastic. dont listen to the other reviews that say you need mods to make this game good. its already a fantastic game by itself. that said, mods can enhance the experience even more. i personally use mostly graphics mods (such as realvision enb) and the unnoficial skyrim patch.",2
"you can pause in the middle of a battle and consume an ungodly amount of cheese wheels, making this game one of the best games ever to exist simply because of how many cheese wheels you can consume in the middle of a battle. can you imagine somebody just carrying all these  cheese wheels into battle? bewilder friends and foe alike with your unholy cheese wheel obsession, you daring thing, you. 10/10, would play again for some more cheese wheels. also there are dragons and swords and magic and stuff whatever no big deal. p.s. can someone make it so that a single cheese wheel only takes up 0.1 carrying capacity? no reason just that it would be super useful im asking for a friend ok thanks mate",1
"this game is always exiting, beautiful, challenging and all around amazing. i beleive that skyrim has set a new standard for all rpgs, even though it is over two years old now. and with the massive community of modders, it will only continue to thrive. skyrim is without a doubt one of the best games ive ever played. 2/10 would not bang.",2
"well what can say about this well i think that in the elder scrolls world that skyrim is one the best beacuse of how it drawn you in too the gane so fast and puls as a bounce you can add any type mod that you can really think to in va by the steam workshop or something els and that it by it self add at lot too the game just by that for me i love skyrim it one of my favorts game of all time and all will be",5
"this game is awesome. its a great game if your a fan to elder scrolls and if you like open world games. also you can get mods, but some are laggy and some have viruss on some mods. so be carful and have fun.",2
"this game is absolutely amazing and i would recommend it for anyone into open world and rpg.",1
"ive played nearly 200 hours so it cant be too bad.",2
"this game is more like morrowind and less like oblivion. for all the good reasons. no other game can make you immerse yourself in itself like the elder scrolls v. the only fault i could even think of is the kinda clunky ui takes time to get used to if you dont use a controller. aside from that, this game is as close to perfection as a video game can get.",3
"if you have never played this game, something is wrong with you...",1
"copied oblivion completely. come up with your own ideas, blizzard. be creative. go outside. jesus. 8/10.",1
"i absolutely love this game. bethesda is far and away the best gaming company out there right now, elder scrolls and fallout, i could play nothing but these two series for the rest of my life and be okay with it.",1
"you cant kill annoying brats without mods. 1/10 but you kill dragons. 10/10",1
"provides hours of fun! great game alone or with workshop mods!",1
"this game is so awesome that no words can describe it!!!",1
"its like oblivion, but with better faces, dragons, ebols, kiddy killing, and native killing.",1
"i hate you skyrim. never have i spent more time doing mundane tasks like cooking and physical labor ingame than in real life.",1
"so much fun! hours of gameplay amazeing-ness! also, days on days of gameplay in the workshop! just, an amazeing game.",2
"11/10 i can eat people after transforming into a werewolf.",1
"pretty much everything to be said about this game has already been said. from the perspective of a person who has logged well over 100 hours into the game on xbox 360, this was a must have when i got my pc. the mods breath a whole new level of fun into this game that i did not even know was possible. play with the mods in the workshop and tailor the game to your liking. the possibilities are endless.",1
"skyrim is arguably bethesdas best game ive seen yet. the graphics are stunning and the storyline is far better than any of the previous elder scrolls or fallout games they have made. that doesnt mean it is perfect, though. the game does a great job at keeping you playing, but the game has its fair share of glitches and rough edges. i wont mention them specifically, but they can be overlooked, but as soon as you get past the 30 or 40 hour mark, you start to notice these things. glitches aside, this game is definitely worth the money. youll get to experience a vast and in depth world filled with all sorts of creatures. on top of all this, there are so many mods to make the game something new or even make the game even more beautiful. the incredible number of mods will allow you to keep playing the game in new ways for quite some time and will definitely give you your moneys worth.",2
"skyrim is a truly magnificent and thrilling game. it has stellar grapghics, good personality in npcs, and a smooth and responding combat system. with this combat system comes dual wielding spells and weapons, combo kill cutscenes and unique weapons. you can customize your character down to a single smear of dirt, advance in personal skills that interest you and choose to be good or evil. all in all, get this game!!!",2
"this game is amazing. if you have a computer, you must get it.",1
"a great rpg so many possible ways to custimize your character",1
"elder scrolls v is the first game ive played in the series. it would be a fantastic game even if it wasnt already part of an amazing and innovative franchise. you start the game a prisoner in a wagon and the story unfolds from there. you can choose to do different things that may or may not affect how the rest of the game works out. by killing enemies and do certain things like picking locks, going on quest, swing your sword, shooting your bow you will earn exp. when you get a certain amount of exp you will be able to choose a skill to levelup in. skills like archy which increases power and accuracy with the bow., or one-handed swords which will increase the power of swords you swing with only one hand. the graphics and envirments are awesome! unfortunly my computer which im using to make this review cannt handle the awesome that is... skyrim.",1
"this is a must get game!!!it has very good graphics and very good gamplay!!!one of the best games ive every got my hands on!!!epic metal theme",2
"some serious replay value here. one of the best games of recent years/memory.",4
"if you got the money and like rpg games or stuff thats in skyrim i say go and buy the game and a dlc or so, the game is really fun including with all the dlcs and using mods. gameplay- 10/10 grahpics- 10/10 modding community - 10/10 dragons - epic",1
"the contents are very good and have a wide range of motion ! (y)",1
"if you like sticking your toes in peanut butter you will like this game.",1
"if you enjoy medieval type of fighting, hours of gameplay, open world, and heavily moddable, this game is perfect. having played this game on ps3 for about 500 hours then playing it on my brother account for about 50 hours then 100+ on my account, the game is addicting and a perfect game to buy.",2
"fantastic game to pass the time if you love in depth stories! endless gameplay which makes it well worth the buy!",1
"awesome open-world rpg. huge world with numerous points of interest to visit. good amount of customization with the ability to play how you want (melee, ranged, spell caster, etc.) enjoyable main story line, with a satisfying end, unlike most games. there are lots of gripes and nitpicks about the pc version. many things could be better and more fleshed out, but the game is enjoyable to casual and hardcore players alike. i find this game a bit clunky at times, but is overall much more enjoyable all-around than i found oblivion to be. lots more to say, but youll just have to play it for yourself to judge. i give it a 9/10 because its definitely not perfect, and theres a lot more to be desired, but its not an unplayable game by any means, and definitely has a hundred hours worth of content, if thats what youre into.",1
"one of the greatest games of the 7th generation and an all time classic. countless hours of exploration and fun awaits.",1
"currently the best game ive ever played. few flaws for a bethesda launch. completely engrossing. gorgeous enviorments, well written stories, deep lore, epic soundtrack. cant ask for much more, and mods are on the way! buy this!",2
"have it on the ps3 also and i have over 500 hours on ps3.... i havent seen the sun in months... please send help... this game is to addicting and is just to awesome not to get",1
"i love this game and i always will. i hope to see elder scrolls games being releases for a long time.",4
"100% replayability even after 10 years to come !! you wont bored to death rumraging across skyrim !! massive multiple story creation with endless sidequest !! plus superb character/item creations !! +1 must have for your library",1
"damn.....i am impressed by the graphics (if u have a good computer) and the gameplay...wow...... after u complete the main storyline, dont stop! there are a ton of side quests waiting to be done! buy this game. its sooooo good! :)",1
"the mods for this game . just awesome. you could easly lose many many hours into a modded game of skyrim with lots of end game material. thank the modders and community for that.",1
"its really good looking once you add the necessary mods",1
"i have bought this game twice so i would totaly recommend it.",1
"this is one of the best rpg games you will ever find out there. you start out as a prisoner, captured by the imperials on your way to skyrim. you start to realize theres a huge conflict between the imperials and a rebellion team known as the stromcloaks who call themselfs the sons and daughters of skyrim. you then venture through the lands of skyrim, slay dragons, and kill the world-eater, alduin. you can then join many other things, such as the imperial army, or the stormcloak rebellion, you can join the college of winterhold, the thiefs guild, or the dark brotherhood. this is just a small portion of the game, excluding all dlcs which im hoping to buy soon and enjoy the rest of this amazing game. if you nearly even liked just a little morrowind, or oblivion you will love this game.",1
"launched follower off the throat of the world and survives. 10/10",1
"i highly recommend this game to someone who has 17 hours a day to spare every day",1
"playing skyrim is like walking in on your mother doing it. at first your afraid and confused but then you get used to it and fantasize about it more later. 10/10",1
"i cant even play i bought legendary and normal on 2 accounts and yet it doesnt work ive tried everystep on the help page",1
"skyrim... i dont even know where to start with this game, it is massively exploreable and really gets you into the feel of roleplay when playing it. never worry about losing stuff to do in the game because the community has made mods that expand skyrim infinitly and you will not run out of content for this great game ever.",1
"ive loved the elder scrolls series for many years. i first started with morrowind, oblivion, and now skyrim. this game is freaking awesome. sure i notice a few bugs/glitches here and there, but id highly recommend it to anyone who hasnt played it. ive already put countless hours into my xbox 360 version of this game, (which is now sadly broken.) but if you like an action packed, open world rpg with dragons... then skyrim would be one of the best options yet. very addictive!",2
"one of the best games ever created, would highly recommend it to anyone contemplating buying it",2
"day one of skyrim on pc: this is pretty good. cant wait to tell my friends about it. day two of skyrim on pc: ah look! mods! ill only use a few. day three of skyrim on pc: 150 mods for graphics isnt enough i need more. here we go killable children. thatll do nicely. day four of skyrim on pc: i have adopted child slaves fighting dragons in a battle arena. another one dead. back to the orphanage. day five of skyrim on pc: we dont have any more children for you to adopt. player.additem 64b33 1500. u wot m8. day six of skyrim on pc: this is getting out of control, im going to make a new save. repeat...",1
"i yelled at someone in the town, a guard politly asked me to stop, i apologize and proceeded to set everyone on fire. 10/10",1
"better than oblivion. but then oblivion kind of sucked for me, so that isnt a huge victory. but it seems totally neat.",2
"i recommend this game. really enjoy it on pc and playstation",1
"mountain climbing simulator 2011 is one of the best simulator games i have ever played. only down side is that they tried to tie in a plot into this. yes, a little back story is kinda good on why you must climb so many mountains, but this game just takes it over the top. 9.75/10. remove the plot; add more mountains. then it will be 10/10.",1
"if you want to never see daylight again, buy this game. unless in-game daylight suits you, then youll be fine. sometimes, i just walk around the forests and admire the scenery, dont even finish any quests.",2
"great game, what more can i say, i love the elder scrolls series and the modding community takes it to a whole new level. ive lost hours of my life exploring the far reaches of the home of the nords as babbi the coward, merchant extraordinaire and his 3 hired goons who do all the heavy lifting (killing) while babbi hides in the corner counting his gold.",2
"good game had it for ps3 and can not wait to put even more hours in to it on pc",1
"a ton of things to do, lots of mods, a great game in general.",2
"this game is truly amazing! the story and lore are very rich in content and has been well developed. at every turn i find amazing views and more enemies to fight, leveling my character to get amazing powers and abilities along the way. this game is a truly rich and fulfilling experience, and is worth every penny!",1
"epic. although, i recently switched to mac and i cant play it on this os, but for any windows users it is definately worth the price.",1
"great game , great history , live another life , be another hero , be a villain , you choose !!! the most important part of this game for me was the history , that u can modify every moment. divine parts of the game that make me love it , and one of them was the end of main history that makes u feel complete with yourself . some npcs are dumb , but others are really smart that makes the game equilibrated . every choose can have different reactions . this is art in pixels , this is skyrim .",1
"this game is massively expansive and has a huge modding community that allows for just about any content changes, from graphical improvements to full conversion mods. it is a personal favorite of mine and many others. if you havent played it yet you are missing out.",2
"good game for people that like long lasting adventures, even after you beat the main story.",7
"i have played the game a little bit,even if it was priced at 100 you are still getting your moneys worth,so many mods to play around with,its a must have game",4
"simply one of those great open world games you can find around, vanille game is already great if you skip the main quest and wander around or slaughter everything in your path, you simply would have fun for over 200+ hours on 1 save game... and thats just the vanille game, skyrim is one of those games you can mod into a even greater game making it even more challaging and harsh then it would but you can make it as easy as drinking water... eitherway both ways are great its just how you play the game!",6
"the elder scrolls is a well known gaming name so it is no suprise that the elder scrolls v: skyrim is amazing an amazingly crafted world with people who have real feelings towards you and others makes it one hell of a ride. skyrim is a great game for anyone who played elder scrolls: arena to the new people to the series.",1
"skyrim is one of the best video games ever made. mods = infinite replayability.",2
"this game troubles me in ways but in others makes me want to play for days on end",1
"high fantasy at its greatest. combined with mods, the replay is unbelievable. 200+ hours already.",4
"fallout gamers must play this one! great game, great work!",5
"75/100 stand-alone 95/100 legendary edition 100/100 with mods",2
"and awesome game with really interesting non-linear story and side stories. i really like the tes leveling system, because its much more realistic. you do things the better the more you do them. no increase of smithing by slaying 50 enemies like in some other games. and the mods can do literally anything so with enough mods it suits any playstyle.",2
"among the best, most-complete gaming experiences i have encountered ever, let alone from bethesda (who have a reputation for releasing incomplete material). combined with the steam workshop and the other modding communities on the web, skyrim is still a powerhouse years after its initial release.",3
"10 out of 10 *amazing storyline *free customize character (healer as assassin etc.) *avaliable to download mods *fighting mechanics and great game to kill time. just kidding but seriously one of the best rpg game in the universe",1
"played through on 360, beat regular skyrim. playthrough 2 on ps3, dabbled in legendary, long way to go before complete. got legendary on pc, testing the limits of modding and console commands is really making this more exciting than the last 2 play-throughs. especially finding the room that has 1 of everything that you can console command coc to, ive done all these fn quests before, its great to be able to just go grab all the games keys and super special items so you can just enjoy your play-through without trivial bs. also, thomas the truck.  yeah. oh, one more thing, it looked good on 360. it looked great on ps3. it loads a billion times faster and plays way smoother on pc. got my ps3 controller wirelessly hooked up with motionjoy and this is the best skyrim experience ive ever had.",1
"this game is a really good game, one of the best games i have played in a while. the detail in this game is really great so far i have not seen a game that ha topped this one for me. i love it and i love to play it, it is now one of the only games i play. the gameplay itself it really good i do recommend buying this game, you will be better off getting all the dlcs with it because it does add so much more gameplay, it makes the gameplay so much better with more quests,weapons,armour and other items. do buy this game i recommend it thumbs up.",1
"a great rpg thats soars above so many others with its vast open world, fantastic music and wonderful storytelling. play skyrim anyway you want, do quests in your own time, complete freedom of movement. craft weapons and amour, then enchant them. use a vast array of spells, shouts, potions and racial ablitles. become any charcter you can imagine. with hunderds of hours of gameplay you wont be seeing the light of day anytime soon.",6
"a dragon got kill stealed from me by a crab. 10/10",1
"this is a great game. and the mods for it can leave you speachless sometimes",1
"this game is by far my most-played on steam. the variability and replayability is insane. this is the best game going, until the next elder scrolls game is released, anyway.",3
"stab dragons. force people to carry your . yell at people. punch cat people in the face. eat everyones food. 5/5",1
"outstanding game! i dare say. . . this may be the lord of the rings of a quality fantasy setting with deep lore and memorable names. anyone who is a fan of the fantasy role playing genre will not regret experiencing the lagacy of the elders scroll saga that is skyrim. fus ro dah!",1
"this game has everything that the hype said it would beautiful graphics, compelling story, cool ways to kill people, and interesting human dynamics to observe. i love this game, and am excited each and every time i get to play it.",1
"*finally stops playing to take a break* holy  its 5 months later!!!!",3
"you like dragons? we got em! you like shouting? we got it! you like iron daggers? we got em! you like bugs, glitches and overused memes literally forced out of a redditors  and then beaten like a ing horse? we got plenty of those! so come on down to skyrim to- skyrim.exe has stopped working. windows is looking for a solution to the problem.",2
"the mods make this game fresh and worth playing again. originally got this game on xbox and played it to death even with all the dlc. made probably about 100 alternative characaters to offset the fact that you become too powerful. with the mods here increasing and decreasing the difficulty is not an issue. you can even add new boss battles!",1
"the male nudity mod has inspired me to put more  in my next book 10/10",1
"this game is a unbelieveable adventure, even if you havent played the older elders scrolls games it doesnt matter. there are some inside jokes, that you might not understand unless you have played the older ones (maiq im looking at you). with the addition of steam workshop you can mod this game very easily to increase the graphical fidelity, or add more quests, although the main quest, is already excellent and the sidequest are great. the graphics on their own are good, but not great. but remember were looking at a 2 year old game so the graphics, arent at 2013 level. with the addition of dawnguard and dragonborn you can add two whole new questlines which both you can affect like the main games quests. pros: quests are great. even after completing the main quest line, you will have a lot of interesting side quests. the attention to detail is amazing. the world levels with you, after you break a certain level you will see new enemies. cons: voice acting isnt the strongest part of this game; the same voice actors are recycled from character to character. the graphics arent the best, but remember, were looking at a 2011 years game.",5
"well, it is next game in very popular rpg series the elder scrolls from bethesda. it is really amazing game for rpg lovers. open world, two handed combat system and leveling systems are just great. you can also craft a lot of stuff. you can simpy do whatever you want, buy a house, marry a wife or just go to dungeon and kill them all in. i can strongly recommend this game. ps: if you wish to improve graphic experience, just visit skyrimnexus and download some mods. ;-)",1
"skyrim is a fantastic game, and newcomers to the series will no doubt be enthralled by it. veterans of the series may find it lacking in comparison to the past titles, depth wise. its still a fantastic game.",2
"if you have a problem with the launcher just update your drivers with geforce experience",1
"love everything about this game. i have played this game across 2 formats (ps3 - pc) and have found pc to be the best as it loads faster and there are mods to get around glitches.",2
"its skyrim. you can do pretty much anything. buy it already.",1
"game of the year, highly modifiable! i enjoyed this game, but it does get old once you beat it",3
"this game is super fun.it provides hours upon hours of new quests and adventures all around skyrim",1
"this was ome of the games i upgraded my pc to play, having wasted days of my life to the xbox versiion. which does not even hold a candle to this . the base game is brilliant the dlc is good but its the mods that make this game a keeper and truly add to its replability if you dont own this, you should .",1
"one time i killed a vampire while sneaking, and a nearby skeleton pointed threateningly at a rock that was like, 14 meters from where i was. 11/10 also, dragon priest laying down in a throne. that part gets a 10/10",1
"very good game! bethesda clearly put a lot of effort into their lore, and the experience can be greatly improved with the many mods on the nexus or steam workshop! 9/10",1
"who needs family or friends when you can kill dragons! 10/10",1
"this game is by default, amazing. i recomend this to all and every gamer because there is no doubt that they will like it.",2
"fus roh dah all of the chickens. put buckets on heads. linear caves. sell dragon bones. download mods. break quests. uninstall mods. break more quests. visit limbo. undo hours of progress. spawn npcs. visit space.",2
"this is one of those games i can find myself lost in for days on end...with a rich and deep enviroment as well as a the constant flow of quests keep you busy and the game moving. the dlc for this game adds some more levels to the story and the moding community has put so many new and amazing featrues that you may never want to switch out!",1
"skyrim is honestly one of the most fun and exhilerating games ive ever played. 10/10",1
"this game is awesome, only thing im really annoyed about is not the game, but steam itself. i bought it yesterday for 40 blimen dollars, and now its on sale for about 12 bucks, its ridoucouless, but its the way of life and i shouldve been patient on my part. i still recoommend this game to everyone interested in a free-roam hack n slash type game.",1
"shout nordic profanity at dragons until they die- 10/10 (+ great multiplayer, beat faze clan like twice)",3
"this game to me, is the best game ever produced in any category and any age. there is no equal to this game, not even close. if you want to get immersed in a world where you can do pretty much anything you feel like, then this is the game for you. what makes this game so awesome is not only the scenery but the easy way of getting around and quick interchangable functions, for example the 1st to 3rd person swap is simply a mouse roll and back, if you feel like it. and not to mention the thousands of mods and add-ons for those who want a different look or feel. i played this for over a year before i even touched a mod, because yes it is that good even in vanilla mode. playing different characters, doing different missions (not including the main steering objective), i can see anyone young or old playing this game for years. not bad for a single player game, which i would admit is probably the only downside to this game. i recommend this to everyone, young or old! but do get the complete game with dlcs and add-ons, or get the legendary edition which contains everything. its imperative that you have all of them.",2
"excellent sequal would deffinately recommend playing it if you enjoyed oblivion :)",2
"skyrim on the p.c. is one best experiences youll have. go to nexus mod manager, you can add countless hours & fun to an already fun game. i highly suggest interesting npcs if you do this.",9
"this game without a doubt is going down in history as one of the best games. i played an excess of maybe 2-3 thousand hours on my old ps3. only recently did i get the pc version, and all i can say is that the mods, the modding community, and the sheer measure of how much you can add onto this game with them? makes the game a thousand times better, and it makes me sad that i cant install every single one and play with them forever. this game is surely worth getting, if you can only buy the base and none of the dlc? worry not! mods can add in entire story lines with new armors, weapons, dialogue, locations and many many more! all in all, i wil always love this game, and always recommend it to anyone. no matter how old this old but favorite game gets.",1
"a game that will make you want to lose yourself in the wilderness, delve into dungeons deep, and explore a huge world teeming with all manner of savage creatures, dragons, and the undead. if you have a life and value your time, you might want to skip this one otherwise it will enslave you!! mwahahaha...",1
"you dont have this yet? why the hell not? that said, i havent found it very replayable.",1
"never thought i would play a single player game this much. with all the mods and addons, i see no end in sight.",2
"i bought this after beating the main questline the game seems to never end. its amazing at the amount of locations you can visit. with mods this game can truly go on forever. it is by far the best game ive had ever played. highly recommend it!",2

"you can be a werewolf!.......rip out peoples hearts and suck there blood out",1
"first time i played this when i preordered in 2011, i was very disapointed, the game was very buggy and some of the stuff the devs said they would put in wasnt there, skyrim wasnt anytihng like i expected and im dissaponited, but i did spend a lot of time on it, because cmon, its an elder scrolls game, but oblivions better. go buy oblivion kids, its more for your money.",1
"skyrim is a very immersive game that allows you to take control over. every decision leads to a cause. play style is customizable to any preference, and mods breathe life into the skyrim world allowing endless hours of enjoyment.",1
"ok what i can sey about this game...probably the best rpg back in time and it is still staying on a top of all rpgs...just i got stuck after 88 hours and i can not continue,it is some bug and i dont wanna play it again...",1
"modded the game so much that i made a character with incredibly huge breasts and sexy looking that would do prostitution around skryim. thanks japanese modders!",2
"have already spent over 200 hours on the ps3 version but i played through the main story on the pc again . pros: .big open world, you will reach the higher echelons of 150+ gametime hours should you wish to complete everything this game has to offer. .diverse character playstyles and skill customization to suit your way of playing. .the guild quest lines in this game in my opinion help you hone your way of playing. .thousands of mods are available to customize the game to your liking. theres so many mods out there that for me this game is almost as new as when i picked it up from the shelf 3 years ago. .good voice acting. cons: .the stealth system isnt the best, sometimes enemies detect you from the most impossible places. .some of the terrain in the world, mainly mountains can be ascended by running and jumping up them. overall i love this game and would recommend to anyone who enjoys rpgs to buy it. you definetly get your moneys worth with the ammount of content on offer thats even without including the mods you can download for the game.",1
"addictive? yes. this new high can be taken in many forms, and will rarely get boring. you want to be a barbaran? happily. you want to be a alchemist? brilliant. you want to be a mage-assassin? hail sithis! and, for the best highs, youll want the legendary version. in case youre after shiny new things to add to your addiction, i would suggest checking out nexus mods (and their nifty manager), or the steam workshop. for help with your skyrim addiction, pop over to the forums and the workshop, where lots of people share the same addiction... and will happily help you find the best addiction mode for you. (no suprise arrows in the knee, promise.)",9
"was so good, i got all the acheivements and did more. the only thing i think i can say is i 100% reccomend getting this game. its gr8 m8",2
"i can not even start to say how good this game is. if you dont have it, then why the hell not? 10/10 worth the money",5
"heres a sword and a bow. now piss off - skyrim tutorial 9.5/10",2
"bethesdas rpgs really are their own thing. you create your own story in a virtual world as open as digital virtual worlds get circa 2012. hard not to like. skyui and favourites categoriser mods essential.(otherwise you will spend most of the game scrolling through the terrible user interface) bethesda, just improve the writing , character interaction and variation of voice actors.",2
"so... this is probably the best single-player pc action rpg ive played. am at about 60 hours and am finally wrapping up the main storyline (only got mildly sidetracked by two other major plot lines). a lot of the cheese from oblivion is gone, and along with it a lot of the annoyances. overall, skyrim is a remarkably polished experience and a welcome addition to the franchise. apart from the sheer breadth of the world and thus its comparative lack of depth along individual paths, and the problem that all really open-world games eventually encounter with players outleveling and trivializing even scaled content... the biggest problem with skyrim is its control scheme, which still suffers a bit from being designed with a console controller in mind.",1

"this game is amazing but you must already know that. i modded my game with hd graphics, lighting, water, landscape overhauls, new quests, locations, holiday events, weather, people, and more. i also added an enb for photo realistic graphics which take full advantage of my graphics card. very fun game, so much to do, no way to get bored. 10/10 and not a 0.1% lower.",1
"words can not even discribe this game. this has to be the my favorate game of all time becuse ive played 388.4 hours. and ive compled the game 3 times as mage warrior and theif. ive been playing sinse 2012 so that is alomst 3 years and i realised that you can never be done with an elder scrolls game.ive been olny playing straght no extra game that just goes to show unbeliveble the map and there is a welth of dongens to clear and things to game and i havent even played with it dlcs i bought this game for 50ish bucks and it was totaly it i have played oblivion and morroiwind they were amizing so im recomening skyrim but im realy recomending the elder scrolls. {expt for elder scrollls online that sucked] the olnt poroblem is that i belive that if theres about 50 markarth witch is not that much for the bigest city in the nation witch is sad becuse they have like the world worse populaion. i think they should have had more peole in conculison igive this game a 100/ 100",3

"best game purchase ive ever made. entered the elder scrolls series late into the game, but skyrim proved to be good enough to make me dive back and purchase morrowind as well as oblivion. i hope i never forget the awe i felt experiencing my first open world rpg by escaping helgen and exploring the vast country and opportunity skyrim offers.",3
"probably the second best game ive ever played (1st being pokemon!!)",2
"this game is a load of badassery. 10/10. seriously. i love every single minute of it, and im sure many others do too as well. if youre looking for a game with lots of lore/war type of things, then i would highly recommend this game. the graphics are awesome, especially when youre in different world realms like hermaeuss realm. i would have to say that this game has pretty basic and easy to learn controls. the swords can be slashed vertically or horizontally, depending on the way you aim it at. if you want a horizontal swing it is simply done by moving to the side while doing a power attack. i didnt know this at first until i had to use this technique to beat a mission of the game. there isnt much that i dislike about it really. so i might as well go on a bit more about how i absoluetly love this game. i really like the option to create your character, and also the option of swaping clothing and armor every once in a while. i get tired of seeing games where in every single gameplay/walkthrough you watch the character always looks the same and is dressed the same exact way everytime. i also love how every skyrim character has a different and unique look to them. so yeah, i would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the topics mentioned above.",3
"can steal from a merchant, then sell it back to him. 10/10 now on a serious note. skyrim is best value of your money that you will get in any game ever. reasons is are mods. quest mods, graphic mods, weapons, npc, new spells, voice, animation, you name it theres a mod for it and will add to the game. there are several, hundreds of quest mods that add hours of extra gameplay and even new areas and dungeons. combat in this game is great. amazing if so. you will never find a fps game with sword, magic or bow as great as this. if first person isnt your style you can easily go to third person. enb and graphic mods change the game completely to make it look like an entire different game that make it look like its a brand new game. i highly recomend this game with the dlc as they add new variety of items and new mechanics that the game can do. though for pc i highly highly recomend to get skse (skyrim script extender) and skyui for a pc friendly ui if youre not going to use a controller.",2

"from someone who has played the elder scrolls series since morrowind, i bought this game as soon as it came out. i may not have a computer to run it at anywhere near what it should, as all my freinds wonder how i am able to play through so much lag, and all i can say is that this game is one of the best games i have ever played. i recomend the game, and i also would recomend going through the steam workshop from time to time to see what others have put forward to make the game that much better.",4
"this game is getting old now but its still fun to play",4
"this is skyrim. that is really all the needs to be said and if you do not know about skyrim, where have you been? this game is amazing. it has such a huge world and even if i dont want to fight giants, mammoths, and dragons, i could just go around picking items to make potions or food. it has everything in it i love and the mod community is great as well. there are achievements which i love. i cant recommend this game enough.",1

"this is my favorite game ever! i got it on xbox when it first came out and recently brought it on steam. the world is big, beautiful and adventurous with hours and hours of fun gameplay from the dlcs, main quest, secondary quests and small quests. you have three main ways of fighting, magika, archery and melee. what makes this game also amazing is the modding community. you can get new areas, quests, armour, weapons, compainons and features! i rate this game 10/10 would buy and bang",1

(users work shop) so, yeah. be safe. by the way my favorite npcs are ulfric stormcloak and nocturnal. oh wait jzargo, too.",3
"this game has been absolutely superb. with its great open world concept, skyrim gives a very great user experience that makes the player feel that they are really in the game. at some points, that game can be almost overwhelming, giving you many things to do at one point, not knowing what to do next. but, this game all around is great, with a great storyline. i reccomend this game very much so, and give it a 9/10.",1
"great game with so much to do. worth replaying again and again.",3
"the game is the best of its genre. the only issue i have is with the script fails and bugs that can occur during gameplay and the point that bethesda hasnt made sufficient effort to patch and fix them. otherwise u can get the unofficial skyrim patch from the nexus that will fix the most common bugs altough they cant remove the main core ones. overall 9/10 for this great piece of art. :)",1

"deep world with an endless list of things to do. its a great exploration experience in which the non-planned found-by-mistake side-quests are usually the best. the only black spot is its combat. its too simple and repetitive, and you end up facing all confrontations with the same strategy and skills. if core combat was more polished and deep, it would be my game. when i got bored of the vanilla game, i started modding. i spent half of my playtime applying mods. and everything changed when i started using an enb, made the game look astonishlingly beautiful. totally recommended, specially with mods. modding database:",1

"its really laggy . the animation is okay if its not laggy",1
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",2

"having spent many hours (days, weeks :-) playing skyrim, i finally feel qualified to report that it is without doubt one of the best games available on steam. the vanilla game is very good but where this addition excels is in the mods and the modding community attached to it. with over 8,000 mods, you can play as anyone from an immortal god sent to save the planet, to a serial  and murderer intent on destroying it (i have been both). and anyone or anything you can think of in between! be warned though, this one will consume you and your time. having cut me teeth on tes iv oblivion, i had high hopes for this sequal and it did not disappoint. if you consider yourself a true gamer or have ever wondered what it would be like to really live another life (within or outside the law), skyrim is a must have!",4
"a first class game, that is full of quests and brilliant addons.",7

"epic. mods make it better to boot. but it does get stale after a while, theres a critical element to replayability missing from skyrim... for me its the useless repetitiveness of dungeons etc no matter how differently theyre laid out... but still one of the better gaming experiences of my life. you cant *not* experience skyrim...",4

"skyrim has been around for a little more than two years and it remains high up on my favorites list as you can explore the vast and interactive new world of elves, orcs, and dragons (wyverns). as the dragonborn you hav ethe power of the voice to stop alduin a world eating dragon from doing what he do and save tamriel. oh and theres a civil war and a ton of factions too.",2

"i played this game for a number of hours, and i definitely will get around to playing it a whole lot more. leveled a character and completed it with one type of skills, but the game can be played in many different ways. definitely a unique experience and lives up to its predecessors. 9/10.",1
"this game is very fun, although it is difficult in a few place it only takes about 10 mins to figure out to do. i highly recommend to get some graphic enhancer mods from the steam workshop before playing.",1
"this game is absolutely astonishing. the amount of detail, time, effort, and emotion that developers have put into this is breathtaking. its full of surprises and easter eggs, and subliminaly tells you more about yourself. 100% worth buying.",1

"the elder scrolls five ( skyrim ) is one of the most interesting, fun and enjoyable game i have ever played. as it was released in 2011 and still is better than todays games such as battlefield and call of duty and what not, skyrim was just very amusing to play. the thrill of slaying a dragon as it breathes fire/ice around you, the excitement of rushing into caves and slaying the undead or even turning into a werewolf and slaying all of the innocent civilians of whiterun. endless things to do in this game. i myself have completed the main story line as a imperial then khajit, completed the dark brotherhood, got all daedric items and still find new stuff to do everyday! seriously a must have. i will give it a 9/1o as it was a brilliant game and the best game of 2o11. ( giving it a 9 as it was not as good as the previous elder scrolls but you know, what is? )",2
"a game that was quickly accepted as a timeless classic.",1
"an awesome game, highly recommended for any rpg fans. the elderscrolls series is about the most open-world, do-what-you-want-when-you-want kind of game. because of this, the main-story can suffer somewhat because there is no need to follow and you can just never do it if you want...but thats the beauty of an open-world game. the sidequests and wandering around beautiful and very varied landscapes playing different roles and doing whatever you want lends itself to 100+ hours of fun...all for relatively cheap now-a-days.",2

"if you like rpg games with never ending side quests this game is definitely for you, if you dont like it at all main story line took me about 25hours. summer sale for 2.45 totally worth it.",2

"if you havent got this yet, you are seriously missing out",2
"what i love most about this game is the pure openness. to be able to actually escape into a world where im not required to act on any specific quest line, im not requried to choose a side or be forced into a black and white, good versus evil mentality. the freedom of this game, letting me be anything from lawful good to chaotic evil, warrior and mage, just whatever i feel like being. that is what i find amazing.",1
"if you want to put youself into a world that fantasy and dragon slaying never stops,thats the perfect game for you.amazing graphics and atmosphere,extremely huge map,thousends of quests and a story that sticks uniquely with the previous elder scrolls.i believe its one of the best titles out there that every gamer must have.if you like fantasy and creatures than this game is for you!",1

"nice graphics, open world, good fighting system, much to do. but the story isnt made for elder scrolls noobs like me and the story wasnt really compelling. also i found this game to be pretty short when it comes to the main quests. ive only played 5 or 6 of them and im near to the end now but my character is by far not complete in my eyes. i dont find the side quests pleasing enough so this game seems to stay unfinished - because its overwhelming (and therefore boring). also with smithing, alchemy and enchanting you can create much to powerfull weapons, armor and potions... you can kill a dragon with one arrow if you like to. so you can overcome the pretty hard enemys in the beginning in no time. when i think about it maybe i spoiled my fun with leveling and stufff. im a bit undecided. =) in every point of view: 8 of 10 stars.",3

"skyrim... possibly one of the most talked about games at where i work, where my brother is educated, and nearly every corner of the internet. *contains spoilers: do not read unless you already know/dont care* after you create your character, choosing from a decent amount of races to choose from, youre head is officially on the chopping block. literally. before your near-trip to oblivion, a dragon (something that the nords of skyrim think is no more than a legend) pretty much saves you... while trying to murder everything within hells half acre. after running to safety, you are pushed to try and survive, thanks from some help of an imperial solider (whos name is not remembered....) who then makes a mutual-survival pact with you in the helegen keep. utilize some nearby armour and a weapon (and depending on what race you choose, some magic. all races start with flames and healing. others have bonus spells) you set on a complete escape. after a while of fending off stormcloaks, spiders, and other things, you meet the light that is freedom. from here on, your destiny is to slay the dragons. once and for all. how you get there... is up to you. 10/10",1

"another bethesda game that has entertained me for some time. what i like about bgs games are the ability to mod them. skyrim with mods really makes the game, which is well done as a vanilla standalone, even more enjoyable. this game is an open world rpg set in a fantasy world. skyrim has done well with its open world by introducing a lot of side quests and areas to explore. i have played over 100 hours in this game and i have still not beaten the main quest line! do recommend.",1
"expected it to be a lot better than this. boring...",1
"great game, great community; what more can be said about it that hasnt already been said!",1
"great fun but if u are just a casual gamer no point in buying this game , its quite tedious and time consuming however once u lvl up its kinda worth it",1

"oh where to start. this game will never end even if you beat the main game and the dlcs. with my play time i only just scratch the service (but enough to give this simple review). even if you manage to complete all the quest that the game has to offer. there is even more with mods, and with so many mods to choose from. weapons, npc, followers, armor and even the mods can be so large that they can be their own dlc. some mods even change the look of skyrim that youll forget your playing the same game as before, and others that even fix what the bethesda miss or didnt even bother to fix i mean this game has no end. even if it did, youll never reach it (unless you count the main story). i highly reccomend playing the entire game first before installing any mods. and watch the months go by while defending skyrim from a greater threat than dragons,... macho men, thomas, & so much more in the modding community",1
"guys, this is the game that never ends. this game is for the casual gamer, and for the most hard core.",1
"i was playing this game when it first came out and here we are in 2014 and i am still not bored of it. there is literally so much to do and so many ways to play this game however you want to. i have spent hours, weeks, months on this game (on all platforms) and my time was very well spent in my opinion. even with completing the game so many times and getting all of the achievements, i still find myself having an urge to open it up and play. have a social life? you wont after this! lol, just remember to call your loved ones once in a while and let them know you are still alive. :p",3
"before writing this review biased, i decided to read some bad reviews of this game. before reading them, i thought but what could be wrong with this game? well, the reviews made some fair arguments. the melee combat is arguably boring. the choices you have are choosing what to say to npcs to learn about the story. however, i am still not going to say this is a bad game, because i enjoy it very much. all the sidequests and even the main quest was fun. i enjoyed the variety of spells i could cast. metascore was right. i like this game a lot, and i do highly reccomend it.",1
"one of my favorite games of all time. no restrictions on what you can do like in the previous elder scrolls games. a little glitchy at certain points, but nothing that cant be fixed with the command console and a wikia site. (besides, bethesda is always updating the game to fix those problems.) and with them releasing dlcs like dawnguard now its only going to get better. no two people can play it the exact same way, theres just that much out there. for mods, id recommend: berts breezehome remodel (available via skyrim nexus) spend dragon souls for perks (perfect for when youve gotten all the shouts and have leftover dragon souls) realistic map + roads!",8
"yargh!!! thar be dragons here!!! beautifully built world full of monsters and weapons to kill them with... brilliant idea! plus there is a free dlc availble to boost the graphics of the game to make them look even more realistic (own computer allowing) :p",1
"very fun game i definately reccomend buying this even if its not in the sale as you will spend hours on end playing this!!",2
"the best game ever and has some of the best mods!!!",1
"this is the most beautiful thing in gaming history. the only bad thing about it is how you have to say goodbye to your life after starting it.",1
"favorite game ever so good much fun. but seriously cant wait fpr the sequel and enjoy great gameplay",1
"if you dont have this game. you porobibly have a girlfriend or somthing. yuck",2
"you will forget everything you ever cared for. you will stay in your computer the whole day wasting your life. it will rip your soul apart and tear you into absolutely nothing. 10/10",2
"where do i start....? amazing game wth amazing graphics and features. everything is easy to access and i love playing it.",1
"this is one of may favorite games to play, the mods are fantastic and am looking forward to future mods",2
"one of the most epic games ever!! :o :d: (yes, you should buy it now...)",1
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",8
"this game is a 8/10, got it on the sale, it is truely an experience, and when your bored after 30/40/50 hours in the base game, get some mods that look fun, console version isnt bad either.",1
"great game, no other game like it and it has its plus because you can do more than you think in skyrim. totally worth ever penny.",3
"tons of vanilla content + tons of replayability with mods + dragons = such an awesome game.",2
"i <3 this game! especially with mods its endless fun!",2
"one, if not the best game i have ever played. there always seems to be something to do in this game. starting a new game is not a problem either, since theres so many diffrent ways to play this game, it almost seems like a whole new game. the addition of mods is also a big plus to the pc version. there is just something about this game that keeps pulling me back. at this time i have over 500+ hours of gameplay and i dont regret any secound of it. 10/10",4
"what is there to say? its elder scrolls! its skyrim! a large open world, tons of places to explore, plenty of armor and weapon sets, and enough quests to keep you busy for a while. even better, modding! with tons of mods, you can keep busy forever. you can use the steam workshop or, as i prefer, the nexus site. the fight against the thalmor series, immersive armor and weapons, frostfall, skyui, and even 2k textures! what are you waiting for? its on sale constantly!",1
"its an elder scrolls game, do you really even need to think about buying this game? just buy the game, i got this game for 360 on its release, back then my laptop could not handle it, now it can, so a veryyyyy late review, but still, must buy, and if you are new to elder scrolls, then just buy morrowind and oblivion aswell, just because you wont regret it at all!, enjoy!",1
"the pc version of this game has probably taken up more of my time than any before it (baldurs gate ii being the only possible exception). but the thing that makes this game so amazing isnt the story (although it is quite good) and it isnt the combat or the exploration (both amazing in their own right), its the mods. the ability to be anything, to do anything, to change the game and the starting point completely makes for an amazingly complex game and story. - this game is great on its own - make the hud transparent for true immersion - it is limitless with mods -> frostfall - cold places should require warm clothing -> live another life - dont want to be the prophisized hero? dont be -> imps improved needs - this is basically a hopped up version of harcore mode from fallout new vegas",3
"i only started playing this on on pc but when i had my ps3 i must of played over 500 hours on this game... its a great game and if you have the money you should deffinately buy it :3",1
"this is one of my favorite games. i think everyone should play it. its really fun, though it does contain a few glitches. glitches are to be expected, and i havent found any that are particularly gamebreaking. because of the massiveness of the world and the high quality graphics, it requires a decent computer to run, but like the glitches, this is to be expected. for the most part, it is a pretty amazing game with beautiful scenery and fun quests. only real gripe i have is the blockiness of the faces sometimes, especially on the female characters. it can be really annoying. luckily theres a fix on the skyrim nexus, but still.",1
">murdered nazeem in the middle of town >carried him up to the cloud district >threw his corpse down into some nearby water >retrieved his corpse >carried him back to the middle of town >guards see me, dont care >left nazeems corpse bent over a well >guard hard staring me whole time >decide to leave market place >accidentally hit e while looking at tomato >get sent to jail for stealing tomato 10/10",2
"really? you have to read a recommendation to decide whether or not to get this game? just buy it! buy it now!",2
"i absoloutely hate this game and that is why i have not under any circumstances managed to put in almost 200 hours on the steam version and 150 hours on the xbox version. i dont recommend the workshop items because they only make the game even better and i cannot possibly recommend on more than several occasions that everybody should probably own this game.",2
"ive played this for over 600 hours... doesnt that say it all? immersive, huge and stunningly beautiful, skyrim is one of the great crpgs available. while its individual quests and characters may not be memorable, the sheer expanse of the gameworld more than makes up for the lack. and with the addition of user-made mods and add-ons, the adventure never needs to end.",5
"i havent even started the game yet because the title screen music is so glorious.",1
"fun on its own, but mod the  of it. get a beast computer just so you can mod this game; worth it.",1
"time spent on this game on pc so far: 2 hours time spent on this game on console: over 400 hours time spent wondering whether i should really buy this game twice just to experience better graphics, mods and ui: 10.3 minutes time spent regretting the decision: 0 seconds",1
"the point at which i screamed at my computer  off dragon i am trying to pick flowers, was the point at which i realised this was the best game ever.",2
"im not going to write a big review for this game, because its been talked about so much by pretty much everyone already. the amount of playtime you can get from this game is staggering. the atmosphere and immersion is also awesome. based on that alone, the game is worth it any way you put it. that said, the game has a lot of problems. combat becomes boring real fast. most places you visit looks just like everything youve already seen. the amount quests is just insane, and youre going to be really dissapointed eventually as you discover youre never going to finish them all, without ruining the experience along the way. and the road is long. incredibly long. i dont think im even close to finishing this game. the problem is that i dont think i can find the motivation to go on. there are a lot of mods available to offer tweaks and different experiences alltogether, but the base game is what it is. i prefer the newer fallout games over this one, but even though there are lots of stuff that annoy me about skyrim, its an undeniably successful game that deserves being played. its worth it. im really looking forward to the next game from bethesda.",1
"one of the best games ever made... and interesting story and gameplay . i recommend buy or play this game. *like",1
"probably one of the best buys ive ever made in my short gaming career. a solid playthrough altogether, the possibilities with mods are literally endless, and you will find yourself sinking hundreds of hours into what i beleive to be a fantastic buy.",4
"no mods= good, but quite meh. mods= the best game ever",1
"i have played many many hours on this game and loved every minute of it. the game is huge, vast amounts of land to cover, great characters you encounter. the towns are always a good stop for supplies, rest and getting new quests. the real joy in skyrim is the combat, wether you play as a warrior, using 1 or two handed weapons, or stealth and archery there are unique actions that always make the combat a joy to play. stealth really works well in this game, become a thief or a killer hiding in the shadows, there is a great selection of weapons and armours to find and upgrade. being the dragonborn really adds a great element to the game with shouts. i could not even remember all the great moments and fun in the game, its huge and just a major achievement in gaming. skyrim is amazing.",10
"stunningly beatifull and great storyline too, get it.",1
"all of oblivions flaws were perfected in the elder scrolls v: skyrim. the magic system is much more appealing than it was in oblivion and the various approaches to a battle are more balanced than ever. the music is incredible to say the least and the graphics are mind-blowing. bethesda also improved their reputation by removing the technical issues that are normally sprinkled in their games. this is an easy recommendation to any gamer out there looking for an awesome game. gameplay: 19/20 ... awesome (the bugs with the dragons and the quantity over quality concept is annoying) story: 8/10 ... great graphics: 5/5 ... perfect sound/music: 5/5 ... flawless (so epic...) controls 5/5 ... perfect overall: 93% (42/45) ... awesome",3
"you need to buy this game and all the dlcs. its really cheap and its the best game ever made!",2
"i dont even know why im doing this. this game doesnt even need a review. its freaking skyrim. you know, the one with fus ro dah and stuff? yeah, that one. if thats not enough, then i must remember you the mods. thousands of them. skyrims community is pretty big you know. stop reading reviews and play this.",1
"moddings great, if you havent got it yet, buy it now, its amazing",3
"love this game, playing the 2nd time. hours of fun!!",1
"i remember days like this when my father took me to the forest and we ate wild blueberries. more than 20 years ago. i was just a boy of four or five. the leaves were so dark and green then. the grass smelled sweet with the spring wind",2
"its only the best open world rpg i have ever played. and ive been around since the stone age.",1
"really enjoyable. just love this game. you get plenty content for little money. if you dont know the game: buy it! if you thought about buying it: buy it! (it is worth it)",1
"great game with minor flaws. it will rob you of many hours of your time.",1
"i turned into a wereolf and killed a dragon with my bare wolf hands. things you would only hear about in tales. 10/10",2
"amazing game! especially with all the mods you can get!",1
"i accidentlye deleted the other review time ot make a new one arrwo + knee lol im funny",4
