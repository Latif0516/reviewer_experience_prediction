"the best strategy games/series... one of the best games. will keep you entertained for hundreds of hours. puts the best of military strategy together with things like cultural and technological strategy and adds diplomacy (a little lacking but game play makes up for it) to create one of, if not the, best games i have ever played. the internal improvements, such as wonders and buildings, and choosing how to shape your civilization towards a certain victory condition even adds to the strategy. throw in the goty edition, along with g&k and bnw and you have a highly developed and emerged strategy game that will give you thousands of hours of entertainment. each civilization gives you a completely different experience and there are hundreds upon hundreds of combinations you can try. the dlc may get a little pricey, and the ai has some issues, but it is still, by far, one of my favorite games.",3
"hours of fun both against ai and against friends. great for casual and more competitive gaming.",2
"this is game is meant to destroy your life from the inside out while you slowly take over a virtual world. nuff said.",1
"this is good, you should all buy it. be sure to get the expansions, they add quite a bit.",1
"with this game you can play as britain and retake what is truly ours.... the world! apart from that you can nuke whoever you want so enjoy!",1
"one of the best 4x turn-based strategy games yet made, deep and enjoyable, particularly with gods and kings and brave new world expansions.",5
"as you can see at my profile - i played just 3 hours, so, you can ask me why did you write this rewiew? go f*ck yourself! but please!.. i played this game for a long time, but in a profile of my best friend, its not very important!.. so, what can i tell you about this game? does this game can be so expensive? does this game can have a dlc? yes, of course! this game is awesome! i can make the great revolution in korea! i can build a pyramide in russia! this is f*cking awesome! more better than other strategy games (beside a supreme commander 2)! i reccomend this game for all people and gamers at this world! really! its true! p.s. dlc with korea is awesome! :3",1
"ive been playing sid meiers civilization games since the first one came out in the early 1990s. the series has given me hours of entertainment and more than a few nights of missed sleep. civilization v was a bit shaky at launch, but the developers seem to have worked out the bugs, and it is now an excellent game.",1
"if you love strategy games and have 50 hours to waste, buy this game.",1
"its civilization. sid meiers. great game, long play time, not a killer on the dlc.",1
"really great game to play with a group of mates. better over lan however as it can take a while to do all the turns.",1
"i hate this game... i just need one more turn and its 3:00am",2
"i came from playing civilization revolution on ps3 to this, and this game is absolutely amazing. most of my hours on record are with gods & kings, but brave new world adds a whole new dimension and makes going for the culture victory fun and rewarding. guiding the many unique civilizations through 6000+ years of recorded history is rewarding in itself, but then throw on the different victory conditions and the mulitple options you have every time you set up a new game, and you are almost guaranteed to have an exciting and one of a kind game every time.",4
"this is one of the best turn-based strategy games i have ever had the pleasure of playing. a must-buy for the fans and a great way for newcomers to finally get familiar with the series.",2
"far too often has been the cause of 6am bedtimes. fantastic",1
"got nuked by ghandi when i was still in the ancient era. 10/10",1
"i like role playing as the glorious female leader of carthage.",1
"without a doubt one of the classiest games ever made, sid meiers civilization v is an epic experience through the ages of man; it has kept me returning and returning, always longing for more in a way that its predecessor did not. if you dont own this game, then buy it. if you do own this game, then send me an invite and lets conquer the world.",2
"a great addition to the civilization game family. very fun and creative in game play. totally worth the money.",1
"clearly this game is a clever disguise for a time vampire. just one more turn.",2
"amazing game. not only does civ v rise up to the expectations of series, it exceeeds them.while the army stacking may be a small flaw, other features including simplified diplomacy and improved interface make the issue almost non-existant. if you played a perivous issue of the series or are a fan of strategy in any sort, pick up a copy of this game asap.",1
"its like youre playing god, but more sadistic and warmongering.",1
"for those who loves 4x games. this will make you spend time. not a game that you can play forever. but this game wont make you sleepy... for those people who need to turn their day/night time cycle... then i recomend this!",1
"beware, this game warps time. what seems like 2 hours is actually 5 days",1
"fantastic game. be prepared to spend many many hours on a single round.",1
"first civ game ive ever played, an my god do i understand what the big deal is about. i think i got this 4 days ago and have probably clocked up 30+ hours! if its on sale get it! if its not then just pay more and still get it.",1
"a really addicting turn-based strategy game on building and expanding your civilization. it offers hours and hours of fun giving you a rise of plans to conquer the world. this game willl keep you saying just one more turn.",1
"you can kill native americans as you spread your civilization towards the west. merica 10/10",2
"ill be honest, i was pretty skeptical of this game when i first bought it. id been playing civ games since i was a kid, and the switch from square to hex grid was kinda weird, and gave it more of a board game feel. still, the game forces you to think more tactically than its predecessors did, because you cannot stack units like you used to be able to. on its own, the base game is fairly weak, but if you get either of the expansions, it definitely jumps to the front of the line in the civilization series. the online multiplayer is incredibly depressing, however, so take that into account.",3
"this is one of the great turn based rts that i ever played with. owning this game will never make you regrets because the every game you start there is a different situations that you might encounter and always not predictable specially if you are playing deity with 12 or more civiulizations to compete. the only thing that makes my game hard to finish is to win science victory in deity level. its very hard and awesome. 9/10",1
"civ v and the civ games in general are really great strategy games!",1
"waited thousand of years. discovered atomic theory. it could be used to provide great prosperity to the human race. used it to nuke ghandi repeatedly. 11/10 would nuke again.",1
"fun game good time sink, can be hard to get into at first and learn everything. if you like in depth stragty games go for it",1
"wish it had the civ iv sound of it. baba yetu, and leonard nemoy but great game still similar no stacking of units like in iv, the expansion packs are worth it also. the scenarios are hard, and the achievements are (good luck) impossible to get them all.",2
"civ 5 is awesome. i sink hooooours into this without realising. just be aware that it handles diplomacy like an idiot.",3
"dropped 32 nukes on the iroquois, didnt even take there cities. won a diplomatic victory. 10/10 would irrationaly nuke again.",1
"with a more active community and competative servers, this could be one of the best strategy in our time",1
"culture, science, religion... gold.. these are the stuff of civilization. an excellent marriage of strategy, turn-based combat, and resource managment. lose sight of your civilizations goal... and neighbouring leaders may leave you in the dust. leaders come and go... cities crumble... so too will the tangible relationships of your family and friends as you whisper to yourself just one more turn",1
"this game is very time consuming but you meet tons of new people, and develop skills like strategies, and diplomatic abilities, this game is like life, risk, chess, and facebook all thrown in a blender to get this game.",1
"japan was all up in my , so i researched nuclear fission and made rice krispies.",1
"the best game from all civilizations, and this game have one shortage -it;s that you cant fly into space",2
"a very in-depth game that accepts new players new to civilization. it holds your hand at first, and when you conquer your first city, it feels great. its good, long and great fun.",1
"even after all these years this game still holds up and is worth every peny.",1
"great strategy game. it may take a while to get into the multiplayer but if you have a group of friends it is excellent. singleplayer is also entertaining.",1
"money, power, world domination of the commonwealth",1
"started the cold war with me playing as the us and my friend playing as russia. the only difference was, russia didnt have nukes, and the us had no qualms about using theirs. 9/10 would nuke again.",1
"way to many hours worrying about things that dont matter.",1
"its like chess with more buttons, good timewaster, but almost too tedious as the games can be rather long or chase-worthy without a good partner and nemesie, can get strategically heated but moments are too far in between, still a good experience.",1
"holy cow i spend too much time playing this but its really a good time-waster. i doesnt even feel like you are wasting time since the gameplay is so rich and satisfying.",1
"lessons learned from this game: one more turn is always a lie",1
"dropped an atomic bomb on egypts captial then won the space race as arabia. 10/10",1
"napoleon and i became friends, then ghandi gave napoleon uranium.we never spoke again 10/10",1
"awesome game i highly recommand this game if you like turned based strategy game",1
"this game is really cool.shows alot of potential and is work into it.i reccomend this game to everyone that likes stragety games.",1
"this is based on a game where you can expand you can kill and you can recruit",1
"you wont have a life after purchasing this game. 10/10 kill me",1
"amazing game, endless amounts of fun. with civ you can play for 6 hours solid and not even get board. i would recommend this game to anyone, for the people who dont normally play turn-based games spend about 1/2 an hour playing it and you have learn all the basics needed to have a really good time. should buy if you have the cash!",3
"you will lose track of time playing this game. endless and indepth. fun every time.",1
"great game! tons of fun to play with friends. way to easy to just hit next turn. way to hard to put down.",1
"the game is great. not as better as age of empires but still a great game. money well spent on this game.",1
"with all the expansions and dlc, civ 5 is not acutally that bad of a game, and is quite fun. plus it has mods. mods are awesome, and some of them are quite good, others are quite bad.",1
"i played this game for a little while and i loved it. there is a lot of strategic gameplay and several different ways to win and many foes to face on your adventures.",1
"got nuked by ghandi, he killed millions of my citizens.... if youre reading this send help. dont trust ghandi he will borrow your uranium and by borrow i mean turn it into a nuke and give it back in the form of a missile. 10/10 would give ghandi uranium again.",1
"damn, frikin shtty city-states are all like: oh! you better give us money or well end this friendship! dude, wtf you started the friendship jeeze but good game, just kill city-states as soon as you see them",1
"game is absolutely amazing and continues to evolve due to steamworks support.",2
"amazing game especially with friends. best if you get the dlc.",3
"this game showed me my passive aggressive need to rule and conquer the world. ign - 10/10",1
"awesome, and even more awesome way to game with mod enhancements. many ways to alter ur view of play.",4
"such an underrated game that nobodys ever heard of!! good thing i wrote this review to get the word out.",1
"if you love history and want a game thats semi-realistic but still fun, this is the game for you. i know! i know! its not very realistic, but the tiny bit of realism makes it very enjoyable, even if you dont like history.",1
"okay, first you need to know that ive played everyone of the pc-based civilization games since sid meiers civilization first appeared back in 1991. with that said, ive enjoyed each installment in this genre and each has had its pros and cons. civ v is probably one of the strongest entries by a long shot even while it has a number of players of the series critical of several major changes that were made both in game play and with the units and combat. personally, while i was initially critical, too, of some of these changes, with time i have come to enjoy the current version better than most of the previous versions. the dlc/add-ons as well as the thriving gamer modding community for civ v ensure that it will last a good long while on many players systems.",2
"ive never been into rts or anything of the sort, so i figured i wouldnt enjoy civilization or similar games. but i was very very wrong. i highly recommend this game! :d",1
"this incredible 4x strategy game is the gold standard for the genre. fantastic graphics, great design and balance and a ton of replayability. if you are a fan of strategy games, pick this one up!",2
"yes... please buy this game... conquer the world!!! it seriously is a ton of fun to paly if you enjoy strategizing and planning out your attack. and also being able to see your army grow and crush everything.",1
"this is definitely one of the best strategy games that i ever played. its dlcs expand the contents of the game dramatically and make the game worthy playing again and again to try different strategies. one thing still need to be improved is ai takes too much time every turn in late game, especially when aircraft comes out.",2
"this game made me think strategy games are  anymore, ghandi has nukes too. 11/10 would bang.",1
"pretty much perfect for what its meant to do, you can tell this is a polished game, i heard it was bad at launch, but those problems are gone now. everything from the unique units to the soundtrack says that these guys know how to make a turn based strategy. this game is one of those easy-to-learn, hard-to-master games. you can have a great time and compete with only the most basic of civ knowledge, but at the same time, even after playing for 100s of hours you could still discover new concepts that bring more depth, like swapping works of art, or managing specialists. i do recommend all the dlc, it adds so much, expensive i know but this game usually comes up every sale.",4
"first off, this game is amazing. you can sink so much time into this and just want to keep going for hours more. i would suggest getting the dlc as it expands on the game wonderfully. but my base review is that this game is definitely a buy.",2
"a very good strategy game but the beginning is alot boring because dont have much to do but when u reach the catapult tecnology begin the action because only then you can capture a enemy city",2
"best strategy game ever. this game is beautiful, it is amazing. why is it so good? because, the detail is amazing, plus the maps you play on are amazing, each civilization has it own unique benefit. if anybody is think about buying it, it is worth your money. one of the best games ive ever played",1
"the procrastinators guide to never getting any thing done. 10/10 would play a quick match again.",1
"this was a very nice game, until i played with conner. my capital ;n;",1
"10/10 theres no better feeling than a ban on further nuclear weapon development when youre the only one that has them.",1
"civilization v is an amazing game that provides all of my strategy-gaming needs. you get to pick from many different civilizations and build them up to win several different victories. it can be difficult when needed, or extremely easy when youre just playing to mess around. i recommend this game to anyone who loves strategy!",1
"strategy games have has a large area in my heart, keeping me locked with them, this is just another good game, by the best strategy maker sid meier! he is a good strategy maker, in my eyes, since i have most of his games, and i still want moar. i recommend this to you, because its a fine game, long game sessions, but its calm, relaxing, and a true time spender.",1
"the best strategy game i have ever played and by far the most addicting, if you are willing to sit down for a few hours, this game is amazing.",1
"endless fun when playing against muslim, communist america!",3
"this game is great for people who are looking for a long strategy game to play. very indept and very enjoyable.",1
"laid back, slow-pased strategy game. its a bit of a combination between the board games: risk, and colonists of catan. for me its the ideal game to pass a weekend where you just dont feel like getting away from your computer. even if its still 30 euros. very much worth it.",1
"fantastic game. love being able to dominate the world. :d",2
"this is a major time sink for me. great to waste your holidays away!",1
"simply incredible. id never played a civilization game before civ 5; its easy to learn and great fun to play. recommend to all strategy fans",2
"great game! i always have great time playing it....",4
"the ai is constantly trying to stab you in the back and barbarians can have the most cutting edge weaponry on the planet. 10/10.",1
"a limitless gaming time. so many possibilities and having fun online or single player(or lan). one of the best games in that category!",1
"highly, fun turn base easy to understand and hours and hours of play.",1
"i beat ghandi in a nuclear war but lost to korea in science...fml 10/10",1
"fun? yes. perfect? almost. maybe. depends on what you want out of a game. i think the game is really good and very enjoyable. some factions might be a bit redundant, sometimes barbarians wreck your early game when sometimes they dont bother to show up, certain aspects are even plain stupid like the spying system but all in all the gameplay is solid. my only critique would be that the game options are a bit to limited. i always wanted to play between certain eras for example. say you can only play from the stone age (or whatever that early age is called) untill the medieval era. sure a technological victory or diplomatic victory would be booted out of the door but if thats my decision why not let me? i think it would open up a world of possibilities, new tactics, and lots more fun. 8/10, prepare to sink a lot of hours in this one.",1
"i very much enjoy this turn based strategy game with the variation of civilizations and game play! higly recomended",2
"this game is amazing, theres many civilization to choose from and each have their own gameplay particularities. when you start a game, many strategies and win option are viable and you really feel like you decide what to do. at this point the game is well balanced and is a must play.",4
"if you like rts games i would vey much give it a try.",1
"steam wants my opinion. ive seen empires rise and fall (mostly mine). i tried to stop. one more turn i will say for 80 more turns. then bam its 4 a.m. the world has forgotten about you. you have a final in an hour. you know? the final you said you needed a break in studying? but you know what? one more turn? 10/10 would conquer germany with poland again highly recommended",1
"too many dlcs that contain features that should have been included in the game to start with.",1
"an easy way to spend hours alone or with friends! this is an overall awesome multiplayer strategy game.",1
"ive been playing civ since it first came out. this version works well with steam and on the mac. the units and action are enjoyable. lots of content included in the basic version. theres a slew of downloadable content. my only complaint are some interface bits that could be better explained. looking forward to downloading all of the dlcs.",1
"my god is this game a beauty. i honestly have no explanation for how good it is other than nukes. exploration. conquest. 10/10",1
"just check my status on this game.. sunk hours and hours. nothing else to add.",2
"25h on record, almost finished my first game! thats some value there.",1
"it is just to good! i bought it last weekend and already have 30 hours in it. if u can buy this game",1
"awsome!!!!!!!!! its sooo good that i played it for hours, and never trust most of the other leaders some times they can really stab you in the back so hard that you lose the game.",1
"i love this game! i am a huge history nut and being able to relieve great parts from history as great leaders was real good fun. i have the base civ 5 game & looking into getting the complete edition which incl. all dlcs and scenarios. this is the best game out of the civ. franchise by far! great fun & i cannot wait to play it with friends.",1
"this is an interesting game, well done but also quite long. im impressed by the massive gameplay even if its a bit cahotic.",1
"not hard to recommend, really; it has sid meiers name on it and its a civilization game. oh, and it now uses hexes instead of squares, has a skill tree for social policy and counts roads as part of your upkeep. really, the only downside i experienced was the intense feeling of racial guilt after conquering the iroquois.",2
"not just a strategy game but it is an experience. you will lose yourself in the intrigue and strategy of this as you try and build your civilzation into the greatest on the planet. be you a warlord, diplomat, or economic savant, you can play your way and build a nation in your own image. do you have what it takes to build the greatest civilzation known to mankind? can you build a civilzation that withstands the tests of time?!",1
"just like civilization revoulution but more detailed more  thrown into it, longer, harder, more relistic",1
"best strategy game ever you go through all the ages and battle people! it is worth the money. i enjoy the wonderful gameplay and it has been a impact of my gaming life. it is anoter strategy game i can enjoy and love anoter civ to add to your collection of te civ francise. sorry about slopiness a few keys were broke in te writin of te review!",1
"for some reason no matter how many times i repeat this game, it never gets old. everyone i know who has played it, including me has loved it. just buy it when it goes on sale.",1
"one of the best strategy games on the market. you will definitely lose hours of your life and you wont even be mad.",1
"i love this game. it is the type of game that you can take a break from and come back to it weeks later and feel as if it were your first time. there is an infinite amount of ways to adjust the difficulty and no two games ever play the same. you may strive for world dominance and yet find yourself a cultural empire that is winning the hearts and minds of the youth around the world. a must buy if you like strategy games. just check out my hours logged...",3
"civilization v is a great rts with many historical figures to play and dive into with their individual abilities, and in depth gameplay mechanics.",2
"friend got me this, and got me into this, and i like this! :) this is fun.",1
"this game is perfect for the someone who hates the outdoors, free time and other people. buy this game and those three things will be distant memories. just remember to eat and sleep. luckily thanks to the games turn based nature and continuing memory leaks you can most likely do both between turns. this game is the equivalent of digital heroin. go watch the movie train spotting and if that kind of lifestyle appeals to you buy this game.",2
"doc! doc! it worked doc! it seems we have traveled 100 hours in what seemed like 5 minitues doc!",1
"diplomacy, culture and science victories can be summarized in clicking on the right buildings until you win only fun if you win via domination",1
"this one of the best games ive played. i would recommend completely as long as you are okay with the small consequence of your life being consumed by its amazingness.",1
"have over 800 hours still going strong, saw that beyond earth came out saw the reviews played 15 hours of civ 5, just keep playing this untill the hot fix or they release dlc (everyones least favorite letters at this point)",4
"really fun game, makes you think, would advise anyone who likes chess to play this game.",1
"i think....i love this game. diplomatic options were sorely limited and happiness was a thing that i though needed a ton of work but, over all it is an awesome incarnation of the series. it is incredibly difficult to please me as im always wanting more so take my opinion for what it is....",4
"civ5 is a fun game to play when you have lots of time and its better with friends",1
"love the replay value and the interesting aspects in the game. the technology tree, geography, and different civilizations keeps it fresh every play through. a standard game takes about 5-8 hours so you get a pretty good bang for your buck, and its not too hard to learn. i would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of turn based strategy games.",1
"do not buy if you have: 1. school 2. a spouse 3. a life they will get neglected.",1
"so many ways to play, so many ways to win. the ai seems much improved in the brave new world dlc. stupid bug in the multiplayer when trading to watch out for.",1
"my allied ai decided to nuked me while i was busy having war with other countries. 11/10",1
"started playing it a week ago. i have a total of 26 hours, and my wife is giving me worried looks, so i have to say that this game is awesome. so many strategies and things you have to take into consideration, that i feel like im only scratching the surface.",1
"this is the perfect strategy game ever created...yet. civ v can be incredibly relaxing as you take a huge  time planning and thinking about each turn. or it can be as mindblowingly intense as you watch your own hand crafted civilization fall to the hands of your long time friends (both ai or irl).",1
"love playing rts games. its not a surprise when i lose full days in this game.",1
"very fun, need a long time to have a good game though",1
"its a great game handles well and is ust amazing with other people",1
"this is a game that will entertain you and you will never want to stop. i recomend this to anyone who like openworld and the civilization series",1
"would recommend to anyone who likes the idea of rebuilding or building an empire.",2
"will take a day to complete. it is possible that your whole life will disappear into this game.",3
"base game was okay, but with expansions it became soooooooooooo much better.",2
"great game, civilization is always getting better with age :)",2
"if you enjoy exacting revenge on schizophrenic backstabbing ai then this is the game for you.",2
"ally with ghandi they said, alexander wont declare war they said.. tsk-tsk.",1
"the complete edition of civ 5 is really a must-have. with the addition of bnw, the game finally feels like a finished, fleshed-out product. the ai of your foes is fixed and the ideologies get the attention they deserve. often i felt i was repeating actual history when faced with in-game dilemmas. 5 out of 5",2
"i love it! simple to learn, but replayable. i havent even gotten around to getting brave new world because i am still enjoying the reular version, even though it is highly rated. this is like risk meets some tycoon game meets, uhh ehh... something completely epic! i am not exagerating. the only problem is that bnw is so higly liked that it can be difficult on occasion to find a multiplayer game.",2
"the fact that this game involves history, evolution, diplomacy, and so much more is stunning.this game is absolutley fantastic.i reccomend this game to those of you that enjoy adventure.geronimo.",1
"one of the best stratgies games out their... theirs politices and everything you wish.. with war cost and city happeness",1
"great game! it is kind of a slow game for multiplayer but the single player gameplay is great. i would reccomend this to anyone.",2
"look all i want to do is play the games i purchased not deal with steam bull",2
"this game is awesome. you can be a noob and still have fun and dominate or be crushed. even though this game was released in 2010 it is still one of the most amazing sid meies games to play. i am very glad i got this on sale. 10/10",1
"one of the best games of its kind, another success from sid meier",2
"do not believe what the history books tell you. ghandi and mother taresa are actually demons from hell. they are the most likely to take over your civ and just  with you in general. do not trust these two.",1
"this is a fun game that makes you wish you were a banana-republic dictator. you too can create a world where the mayans rule the world with blood sacrifices!",1
"one of the best games ive played in a while. the bnw dlc adds some interesting gameplay elements in addtion to finely tuning the rest of the game.",2
"buy it. just do it. tis worth every penny from the hours of gameplay you gain from it",1
"i would highly recomend this game to any person mainly. i have spent many hours playing with friends exploring the brave new world expansion including world congress and religion. me and my friends very much enjoy this expansionas it adds so many new features to the game. highly recomend. once bought just sign your life away. youll love it.",1
"completely addictive once you get into it. expansions and additions contribute even more hours worth of gameplay.",1
"its the best turn-based strategy game ive played so far. 20 years of gaming. anything better than this is going to blow my mind. $30 is a fair price. youll find yourself coming to this game for years. for me, this is a game ill play with friends until were all dead (in rl).",1
"awesome turn-based game. just one more turn is what you say late at night :)",1
"i thought i wouldent like this but a few friends convinced me and omg its amazing. even single player is so much fun that i completly recomend it especially at 7.50$ at that price its a steal",1
"after months of patching, it has finally become a good successor to a classic franchise.",1
"the civilization series is on that i always come back to when i get bored with the latest and greatest game. its one of the few remaining series that knows what it does best. i am really enjoy playing this game.",1
"great game. very addictive and is a great way to learn history! now i know the great pryamids were built in moscow, russia not in egypt.",1
"great game if you are looking to destroy hours of your time. for achievement hunters like myself, there is always one more thing to do; and the multiple offical mods are fun (not to mention the unoffical ones). pick your favorite historical figure and mess up history like a kitten with a ball of yarn!",3
"this game became my life i play it almost everyday. i highly recommend this game, but be prepared to cancel all other activities. this game will become your everything start easy then work your way up. prepare to lose yourself in this truly amazing game.",2
"this game (as you can probably tell by how much ive played it) is quite addicting. its beginner friendly but still has advanced aspects for more experienced players. the major downside is that if you only buy the base game, its quite repetitive; i recommend to purchase the complete edition. the game also has a workshop, which adds more variety to the game. i once used a mod which spawned all the civilizations in true geographical areas which actually taught me some true locations of countries which i didnt previously know. overall, good game, 10/10, could ruin your life :)",2
"i will play a quick round of civ after 16 hours:where did the sun go? ez awzum brah 8.5/10 worth ur money",2
"i thought i would play for an hour, then got off 2 days later...worth it",1
"this is a phenomenal turn play statagy game, well worth the money you would pay for it, it runs great not glitchy at all for me and its just hours upon hours of a good time.",3
"fabulous, deep, engrossing. the move to a single unit per tile is a double edged sword - on the one hand, it makes you consider how to best use your army (rather than the stack of doom seen in earlier iterations of the series), but on the other, the ai does not use it effectively (pre-brave new world - this may have improved it but i havent played with this expansion), and it can be easy to crush the ai militarily. that aside, the game is otherwise outstanding.",1
"if you are one of those achievment hunters, this is a must buy, but notice, nobody is telling you it would be easy ;)",1
"without expansions, i think that civ v is not that great of a game. with the addition of gods and kings and brave new world, civ v has turned into an excellent game. every victory condition is now fun to play, unlike before the expansions, particularly in the case of the cultural victory. the ai, while not perfect, has siginificantly improved from its base state. the addition of the world congress is awesome to say the least, and the religion mechanics are fun to mess around with. overall i would say that the game is to the point where it is at the very least on par with civ iv, and better in some aspects. remember, the complete edition is the only way to play this game, and is totally worth it. i even feel satisfied that i bought original goty edition the expansions individually years ago. its tons of fun. just watch out for ghandi. that dude loves nukes.",1
"i set up a game to reinact ww2. it was an 8 player game with the chinese, japanese, germans, russians, polish, americans, british and i played the french. i minded my own business until just before the modern era, the germans unloaded a full scale assault on paris. i wasnt surprised. everything was going according to plan until the americans backstabbed me at orleans. it was completely uncalled for. the historical inaccuracies really bring this game down from a 10/10 to a 5/10. would not recommend ever playing the french. much betrayal, such conspiracy, so war.",1
"a great game and fun to play in single and multiplayer",3
"money, power, world domination of the commonwealth",1
"this game makes my history teacher hate me. gandhi beat up alexander the great last night with the help of attila the hun and george washington, though queen elizabeth and oda nobunaga tried their best to help him.",1
"this game has made me late for too many things. it always starts with, just one more turn. next thing i know, im getting nuked by ghandi four hours later.",2
"best turn based strategy game ive played, has a mix of everything that most strategists probaly like if they like games like hearts of iron and europa universalis 4, but want a turned bas alternative,",1
"this game is amazing, i dont care of im  at it, it is worth it!",1
"my first game on steam, and by far, one of the best games i have played. when i first got this civ v i almost cried myself to sleep. i felt as if it was slow, a waste of money and at the time i was more intereted in rtss. after the rts craze ended, i stumbled across this game again. after 10 minutes of playing, i thought why did i ever say no. it is pretty obvious to see that this game was well planed out, nice animations and graphics, suits playing styles (diplomatic, economic, military, science and even cross styles have advantages.) and hud is very nice too. the menus are easy to navigate and ingame. multiplayer is its only downfall, tbs, what did i expect. enough said. this game is fun and a massive time consumer. if you have enough time on your hands, then this is deffinitly for you. 9/10",1
"one of the best strategy games ive played. immensely time consuming but great fun. 10/10",1
"a really great game. dont be put off that its a strategy game and turn based. easily one of my favourite games of all time and im a massive fps/rpg fan. i want to give this a ten but the only thing thats stopping me is the learning curve and how the game can take up alot of your time but you know what... it. 10/10 shag",1
"such a amazing game although not being visualy appeling all that much ti is quite fun i would only recommend up to 10+ though beacuse of how much the games go on for",1
"too fun. word of advice though. if you ever see ghandi, kill him. hes a warmongering .",1
"spent 8 hours building up my civilization, wiped out in 1 minute with a nuke. 10/10 would reccommend",1
"this turned based strategy game will suck away your life. would recommend.",1
"i liked the game. and i never liked any other strategy games this much!",1
"yet another fantastic game from firaxis. sids games all have this one more turn charm, which will eventually get you to play till 6 am in your underwear and desperatley needing sleep. every civ is unique and has its own playstyle, and the difficulty levels are balanced. this game is one of the games i love and will keep playing until i move out or have better things to do. 9/10 would kiss again",2
"amazing game, great to play alone and with friends, the dlc adds so much to the game as well, so much fun, my game of 2013",2
"does civilization v really need a review at this point? have you pressed end turn? press end turn. have you pressed end turn once more? press end turn. have you made your friends not desire to play the game with you anymore? press end turn. continue infinitely. (or at least until beyond earth comes out.) best game mechanic ever. 11/10.",1
"great game if you got all the lads round playing it for 48 hours straight and dont have nowt on for the weekend cause this game will take it up",1
"great game, civ 5 + gods & kings can be got fairl cheaply. just wait for the 20 brave new world to come down.",1
"if you dont have this game, i feel bad for you son, i got 99 problems but ghandi aint one... however the zulus are at least 9 of them...",1
"i hate this game. it steals 5-8 hours of my life whenever i play it.",1
"have spent the last day trying to get this game to play, with no help from steam! i suggest you take the game back where you bought it, and get your money back.",1
"make sure you have all the dlc. then make sure you have a whole day to play, because you wont be able to stop when you get started.",2
"awesome and addicting game, games do take a while tho",1
"i just came out here to have a good time with ghandi and honestly im feeling so attacked right now.",1
"after loosing complete faith in the civilization series when civ v vanilla was released, it was very pleasing indeed to give it another try after a brave new world expansion pack was released. just.....one....more...turn.... - oh how i have missed that feeling",2
"i dont understand how i have played this game for so long in the two days i have had it. this takes me back to age of empres: age of kings but just adds more visuals and a such a good games mechanics formula that i cannot even comprehend how addictive this game is and how long a game of civ actually lasts. it feels like i am living out the civilisation with how many hours i spend making scenarios happen like americans vs native americans and england vs germany. will not be able to put this game down any time soon.",1
"probably my second favorite game on the pc. makes you feel important.",2
"i would reccomend this game to anyone, but if you do get this this game i would strongly recommend that also got the gods and kings and the brave new world dlc.",2
"this fun til later you get bum  by barbarians with airplanes and assault rifles while your at war with beaners. 10/10 would civ again",1
"even if youve never played the civilization series, this game is a must have for any turn-based strategy fan. dozens of empires for you to choose from consisting of their own unique bonuses and several unique units. no two game plays will be the same. you can either play a short match (1-2 hours) or one that could last days up against the ai or online multiplayer. amazing graphics, an absolutely stunning soundtrack, and immense depth are just scrapes off the surface of what this game truly presents.",1
"this game is a perfect play for any youtuber/streamer to do a long stream on. each game is around 6 hours long and is tense every minute of it. this game provides the player the perfect control over a country and grow it to the top. it is a turn based game that requires strategy all the time! you start out at around 3000 b.c. and play until everyone gets blown-up or until the 330th turn! rate out of 10: 8.9",2
"a must have for any strategy fan. this game emerses you in a world of vast possibilities and concequences alike. prepare your army for conquest or engage in an array of diplomatic missions as you embark on your journey in becoming the greatest leader the world has ever seen in sid meiers masterpiece.",2
"my friends were taking washington, and i decided to intervene and do the last bit of damage. i lost two friends, but i now own washington. 9/11",1
"so this game needs to be reviewed as it is one of the greatested experiences ive ever had in gaming. this game is smooth and true to the franchise in every way. the dlcs add and change so much they almost feel like a whole new game. civ 5 brings to the table a fantastic turnbased experience that i can sit down and play for hours. trial and error, new straegies, different paths you can take will completely changed how the game will turn out. smart ai adds to the games sense of running a real country in a real world. the single player on its own makes this game great but like many other games nothing beats playing it with a friend. if you have the money i reomend picking this game up with all its dlc its well worth a look.",1
"if you live with your girlfriend or wife or both ( god help you:) i hope you have a strong relationship....youll need it!",3
"amazing game and i absolutely love it. the only reason i say no is because they wont let you upgrade to the complete edition and instead make you rebuy the game and i dont have that kind of cash to splash, which really sucks cause the dlc looks amazing.",1
"one of the best strategy games i have ever played! the turn-based gameplay might not be suited for everyone, but you get used to it very quick and the gameplay is just awesome. there are unlimited ways how to envolve your culture and rule in peace or conquer wit the iron fist.",1
"if you liked all the other civ games, then you will not be disapointed. the depth is insane, however, single player is not where this game shines, got a friend who likes historical turn based strategy? then go for it, if not....",1
"i feel like the vanilla version of civ v was a step back from iv, but after the expansion packs, it has become a full civilization in my book. still not as good as civ iv, which i consider to be the best so far, but still good nonetheless. and it looks amazing.",2
"blew my mind, loved it right away when i learned i could create chaos.",1
"awesome game but can take a while with a lot of enemies ;p",1
"civilization series were always the most addicting, difficult and rewarding games ever. civilization 5, alone or with gods and kings & brave new world is the most time consuming devil that posses your time and will never give it back. although your only way to resist is to click next turn and bring glory to your civilization. most complex game with many victory types, strategies, difficulty levels (from easiest for even strategy noobies to most experienced generales who were raised with rts by their sides), units, resources, everything... this game has everything that us - nerds love. and you can read a book in one time while playing on huge map around atomic era :d",1
"civilization v is in my opinion the best turn-based empire building game to date. with over 20 civ with their own unique units, buildings and perks you will not be running out of a new strategy to try anytime soon. although i do recommend picking up the two expansion packs gods and kings and brave new world.",1
"ive played all of the civilization games. but this game upd the bar once again. it will keep you glued to your screen. graphics 4/5 gameplay 5/5",1
"probably my favorite game ever. took some time to get used to changes from iv, but i said the same about iv from iii...",4
"requires a bit more careful planning, thought, diplomacy and time than other games ive played. bit of a time sink, but damn is it satisfying to one-up england with a people they suppressed and screwed around historically.",1
"a quite addicting 4x that has a fair amount of factions to pick from, would recommend to but the complete edition because it feels somewhat incomplete without the dlc.",3
"this game is highly addictive. since getting this game ive lost my dog, my job, my hygiene and im getting evicted some time next month. however, i was able to secure a domination victory for murica. so ive got that going for me, which is nice.",1
"if you like previous entires in the series, youll likely enjoy this one as well. the fourth game still stands tall as my favorite, however civ v is a pretty fun entry. sometimes it feels like it could use a little more depth, and id like some advancement beyond the information age, but overall im quite happy with the game.",1
"once you start a game, youll lose your mind. just. one. more. turn.",1
"10/10 spent many hrs taking over the world... its oddly satisfying to wipe out an entire civilization and then move on to the next one!",1
"a really cool game that is extremly addictive. would recommend this game to anyone who loves turn-based strategy games.",3
"have too much free time that you want to inexplicably disappear? this is the game for you!",1
"great game! did a great job on this one it still had the feel of civilization 4, but had some new tricks and additions which helped gameplay.",1
"amazing turn base stategy game. with facts and wonders you probably did not know!! if you like a stategy game with historical info i reccomend it so get it yea",2
"very great game! too bad im too stupid to know how to play xd",1
"this game is awesome, i highly recomend getting it.",1
"wonderful game, fun by yourself or with a group of friends. however, i recommend turning on quick movement and quick combat (personal preference, if you play with these options off then the camera pans to a unit whenever theres some kind of combat, and it can get annoying :p). 10/10 , dlc is also worth it.",1
"10/10 lots of fun, takes alot of time out of my day",1
"i been playing thi game since it came out. and now its original and have many other feature like mod,and expension packs! this game is really recomanded for those who like rpg games,like c&c.",1
"if you enjoy destroying your enemies with xcom squads and giant death robots, forcefully convincing other nations to listen to your pop music and wear your blue jeans, or just want say screw you guys, im going to alpha centauri and hop in a rocket ship, this is the game for you.",2
"great game, i will invariably spend hours on this game in the future with my mates.",1
"this is a game for everyone. it is so very addicting in the combinations of playing with each character. additionally, changing the definitions of a cultural victory has increased the game length because there are no more quick and easy culture wins. the addition of trade routes make barbarians just that more annoying.",1
"this one time barbarians took my settler the very first round so i lost instantly........its very fun.",1
"highly addictive turn based strategy game. will have you up all night and you wont even realize. i bought this game and started playing at 8pm... next thing i knew it was 7am and the sun was coming up. try the demo but it doesnt do it justice.",1
"such an amazing game! i give it 5 out of 5, great replay value! my friend and i play this game all the time.",1
"just one more turn! no, you wont close your game after this turn, the turn after, and the turn after the turn! its just addicting that you wont even pay attention to how long you have spent in the last session.",2
"just to let you know, gandhi may have preached world peace. in this, hes koo-koo nuke-oo. in short: dont trust gandhi",1
"amazingly fun game. play with family and friends on an epic long game or a quick paced game and build your civ the way you want it. hundreds of hours of replayability, play it dozens upon dozens of different ways. find your favorite civ rulers, exploit their major strengths and back up those weakness. build ancient, medieval and even modern wonders to boost your empires glory! destroy your enemies or be diplomatic and take another route to victory, so many ways to win, but just playing this game is a win. 10/10",2
"i love to nuke ghandi in this game bacause he is a warmonger  (rhymes with punt)",1
"awesome game. i wish there was a more efficient way to play with friends.",1
"definitely a game that will keep you playing for hours on end if youre into strategy. the mass number of civilizations to choose from and the multiple ways to win give it a real depth to keep gameplay going.",1
"ive played all fo the sm civ games.... am still a fan. if you like empire building games, youll love all of the civ games.",1
"if you love empire-building games and turn-based combat games, youll love this game. its an all-around improvement on the previous civ games, and they seem to get better with every new version of the series. the only thing i dont like about civ v is that i cant combine my troops into an army (which was a feature in a previous installment of the franchise). i hope the next version offers the option again.",1
"great game if you like strategy and wars games. you dont need to like turn-based games to like this one.",1
"a very addicting and absolutely fantastic game! if you can pick up both map packs with the game itself for a reduced price it is definitely worth getting.. the content and ai tweaks and changes make a big difference when playing. even though i have played (only) 103 hrs when writing this review, there are still many, many different civilisations i have yet to play. if you are new to civilisation games, there are many tutorials on steam to look through. the in-game tutorials are pretty decent as well.",2
"fantastic, watch the hours of your life wash away before your eyes as another classic civ sucks you in. even better with gods & kings.",2
"ive wasted too many hours playing this game. like yo, its addicting. seriously. in the best possible way. a wait and rage fest. get this baby.",1
"easily my favorite game, even before the addition of g&k and bnw. there are just so many different ways of playing, and each time you play, something new happens. evey time you make a move the opposing nations respond in kind. you get to pick a civilization and guide it through history to whatever end you decide. you are in control of all aspects of your nation, from culture to military strategy, scientific research to religion, and city location to resource managment.",1
"brilliant all round really, excellent if you just wish to pass the time, or if youre up for more of a challenge! 5 stars!!",1
"one of the best strategic games i have played. hell, this is the best ever. you can play it for years and you will not get bored, theres always something new to see or achieve. just one more turn...",2
"best. game. ever. games might take a while, but its amazing once you get into it.",1
"if you want a game to waste your time in get this game.",4
"if you like strategy this game is a realy good one plus you can get lots of mods for free that are fun to play if you ever get bored of the normal game but if you want the game to be amazing you have to get g&k and a brave new world!!! totaly worth it if you like strategy games.",2
"had 2 cities, versus a civilization with easily 7. duel map. they were technologically scores ahead of me. i mass produced privateers and attacked their costal capital. within 3 turns, shaka offered 4 of his cities to me to end my onslaught. 10/10 would force my privates in again.",1
"extremely addictive and easy to put multiple hours in on a single sitting. great game with single player and even better when playing with friends. the initial loading screen is my only complaint as it is quite long.",2
"a great strategy game that involves your thinking skills to achieve world domination! incredible looking game that had me interested the moment i looked at it! great job!",1
"just.one.more.turn.the workers need you.they look up to you. the king of 4x games.",1
"as a long time player of the civilization series i was impressed by this addition. this is a big step up from their last game and a truly great game to start the series on.",2
"as a hardcore strategy gamer who is no stranger to planning out my empires production dozens of turns in advance, ive already turned to civ v for my world-conquering needs  but at the same time, if anything is going to rear a new generation of strategy gamers like the very first civilization did for me, its this. finally, civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have ever played.",1
"this is a game that just keeps on giving. hundreds of hours into it and still enjoying every match. dont buy it for the multiplayer tho, while it is really fun to play with friends its sadly very broken and has heavy lag that really gets annoying later in the game.",2
"the pinnacle in round based empire building. spent far too many hours on this one :p",1
"tacking on the noobs part kind of nullifies the whole gg part",1
"this game is fantastic! it is a brilliant strategy game, in which you keep a certain civilisation (or civilization) afloat for as long as you can. you do research, get culture, plan stuff out, build wonders, its just marvelous! go play it!",1
"love this game <3 - tottally worth it especially when it was on sale with all the dlcs :d 10/10",1
"ive logged 250+ hours on this game and thats still noob status. maybe someday i will see my family again, but the war rages on and there are lands not under my grasp. just one more turn...",2
"i can conquer the world with a massive army led by a warmongerer, like me. 100/100 goty 5/5 stars",1
"civ v is another great game from the long line of sid meier. utilizing past titles and some newfound ideas, the game comes together to make an even more realistic civ building game. the variety of difficulty settings keep the game interesting and challenging for people of all levels of experience. i look forward to the next civ game.",1
"this game is a very fun game to play with your friends and there is a tone of replayabilaty so you will never play the same game twice.",1
"the learning curve has some steep spots on this one - at difficulty 3, no matter how much i harass someone, they wont declare war on me, while at level 4, people are trying to wipe me off the map early and often. (ive been told i have abysmally bad luck when it comes to spawning next to warmongers.) but it just makes it that much more rewarding when you manage to hold off everyone long enough to win.",3
"civilization v is a very fun strategy game. you choose a country which you are the great leader of such as george washington for u.s.a, and elizabeth for england. you try to build a strong civilization. you can win five different ways: using diplomacy, using millitary, using science, using culture, or just having your civilization have the highest score by 2050.",1
"definitely worth the purchase, the gold edition expands the game extensively and allows for endless replay",1
"are you inteligent? no? ---------- dont buy this game. l yes? l l l do you have a lot of time? no? ---------- dont buy this game. l yes? l l l buy this game.",1
"great game! if you are fans of strategy games, youre in for a treat! very in depth gameplay but also very easy to pick up. since it is on sale for the steam sale i say it is a must buy!!!",1
"if you like turn-based strategy games you should have it already",1
"holy ing ! why are we not funding this?!?!?!?!?!?!?1",1
"its basically the classic 4k game revamped! graphics, gameplay, and the feel that youre actually running an empire. thats a true experience that civilization v can give. i also recommend both gods and kings as well as the brave new world expansion. :)",1
"this game was awesome i had fun playing it for a day for the free weekend, i wish i could get enough money to get back this game permenetly",1
"now im not saying its a bad game, but you better have nothing else to do for the entire day because this game takes forever to finish a match. but if your playing single player, you could obviously save the game and continue it later, in multiplayer its really hard to finish a complete match. but if you just want to pass some time then buy it",1
"who doesnt want to take over russia and germany and china?",1
"best strategy game ever buy it now or die of being bored!",1
"great game! very good replayability. steam workshop mods really make for an excellent buy.",2
"best time sink ever. i spend way more time than i playing it than i should. can not recommend any higher.",1
"decent base game,get the 2 expantion packs to get the full experience.",2
"a good game you can definatly waste your time with. even fun in singleplayer",1
"if you had a very very good board game that you loved to play all the time and it was made into a video game, civ v would be a lot like that. highly recommended strategy game with plenty of depth and difficulty. pretty addicting though.",1
"so.... here is the turth people. i have over 20 strategy games. and when i am tired of the latest and greatest... i always come back to civilizations 5. brilliant game... you will not be disappointed.",3
"i miss my family, i miss feeling in my legs. does the sun still shine? hey, next turn already! ok!",1
"this might sound like apocrypha, but when combined with the expansions and dlc, civ v has become my favourite game in the series. the gameplay mechanics and additional civilizations added by the expansions and dlc make it a rich and rewarding experience. i have a particular soft spot for the aesthetic style of the game, which feels like a beautiful board game. ive spent many hours playing this installment and dont regret a second of it.",2
"one of the best turn based strategy games ive played. buy it.",1
"one of the best turn-based strategy game ever made. truely 10/10",1
"i thoroughly recommend sid meiers civilization v, as it provides literally hundreds of hours of captivating entertainment at the expense of a mere 40 earth dollars. you can have endless fun attacking your (not really) best friends with nuclear weapons of mass destruction, destroying all of their tiresome efforts in one fell swoop. i dont recommend doing that last part too much, as, judging from personal experience, it can tend to provoke suicidal thoughts in the victims mind. other than that, its pretty  and overpriced.",1
"one of best strategy games ever, gotta love it, especially dem nukes.",1
"if you have never played civilization, dont start unless you have a free weekend. before you know it, it will be sunday night and you will be wondering why ghandi hates me so much.",2
"is it good .....yes ..... this 9 hours is form 1 day of playing im ashamed.... 10/10 like crack",1
"the strategic game play is very intricate, i would advise playing with the expansion packs to further increase the realism of this game.",1
"playing the marathon length while tuning the rate of technology discoveries (slower obviously) gives you plenty of time to actually play in each era and makes the game even more fantastic",1
"can feel a little boring/slow at times, but over all a great game. 4/5",2
"ive been confined in my household on a sunny day for four hours, playing this game. thats not like me, i do go outside sometimes, but, just, one, more, turn.... seriously, it sounds kinda stupid that a low paced strategy game has addiction? ever wanna take control of a nations politics? trading? resources? warfare? nuclear warfare? randomly generated maps? religions, news, and hunting? what about making a city grow? like simcity? yeah, you know what i mean. dont forget tactics to warfare and strategies. dont forget the sandbox and modding experience for this game. my addiction to this game is settled, ill be playing this for a long time...",1
"it is a fun and stratigic game on surviving in the new age its kinda like rust but much better and awsome, hope you will get this game or try it.",1
"infact one of my favorite games, this game lets you customize your own empire through power or diplomancy. even science and culture. however without the gods and kings and brave new world expansions (also babylon) the game gets boring. however with the 2 expansions the game is a masterpeice. civ5 vanilla: 5/10 civ5 expansions: 10/10 (also buy complete instead of paying for dlcs later, 50$ for complete yet around 100$ for all the dlc sepreatly)",3
"an addictive and fun turn based strategy game in which you grow a civilazation from the beginning of mankind to the future. more than worth $20 and offers cheap dlcs, i bought the denmark vikings dlc and love it.",1
"one of my favorite games ever. civ v features such great variety that you can play for 600 hours (like i have) and it still feels fresh. the game is well rounded and each of the victory options is obtainable in an enjoyable fashion. each civ for the most part feels different, and most are tailored to a specific victory type. the ai is strong and on higher difficulties very capable of beating you, however its through boosts not skill.",4
"my machine is well exceeds the specs that this game requires. i have never gotten it to run. i think that says it all.",1
"take over monaco with tanks as genghis khan, carpet bomb carthage as boudacia, the options in this game are dizzying and then theres the dlc, if you like your rts games detailed then this just might be the one for you. hours of your life flutter by like leaves on the wind of time (lol) playing this game, seriously though, be carefull, got a dead leg playing this game..........was on it for half a day id say,",1
"while many of the dlcs should have been included from the start, or given away for free, the overall experience is awing. the game draws you in and steals hours & days of your life. and while the game itself is worth the play, it is the modding community that really offers the replayability. some mods (such as faerun) completely transform the game, while others add new content (civilizations, maps, scenarios, tools) within the confines of the current layout. having sunk so many hours into the game, i still find myself going back for more.",1
"fun, quite easy to learn strategy game. the game is fun in singleplayer, but becomes so much better in multiplayer where you can destroy all of you friends wonderful cities :d, also the dlc are must have because they bring so much more to the base game!",1
"buy this game. just do it. it may ruin your life and cause you to lose all sense of the passage of time, but its worth it! also, watch out for gandhi!",3
"a video-game boardgame that accurately pays homage to and makes fun of real-life cultures by quite nearly replicating some of the most believeable and unbelieveable events of human history. cautionary for the impatient, this game takes a long time to play!",1
"having started my civ career at a young age i felt that the game was overly complex and hard to grasp the city management and such. years later i pick up the fifth iteration, and with such happiness, understand now why this game has the lineage that it does. only recently have i invested serious time and i am dumbfounded as to why i havent sooner. grab a couple of friends and start playing. my only issue with this game is that there is no real world clock to make you aware of how many hours youve been sitting and enjoying your time. grab this, the expansions, and go lose yourself.",1
"this game is an absolutely blast! requires some patience though because games tend to last a while. luckily, there is a save feature. you could be playing the same game for weeks!",1
"i find it hard to believe anyone is really reading reviews for this, as this is one of those games that i feel you either are already intimately familiar with, or want nothing to do with. that being said, if you are into strategy games and have never played this, i would advise you to get this the next time steam throws it on sale. if strategy is not your thing...dont.",1
"i have been playing civilization games since i was about 8 and have always been impressed. it has only gotten better over the years. if you like turned-based strategy games with multiple ways and fun interactiveness, then this is the game for you.",1
"adhdsoighsdogih this game is awesome! beware though that the graphics can be fairly demanding on your cp but a deffinit must for any gamer who loves turn bases stratagy games or loves the civ series. this is a deffinite thumbs up!",1
"might makes right. the american military shall consume all your resources and smother your puny nation in the warm embrace of manifest destiny.",1
"one of the best games on the market without question,even if you are new to turn based games civilization 5 is a simple and addictive experience that you will be playing for hours on end. 9/10",1
"a strategic game that requires planning ahead and cunning. this game requires you to think of how the world will react to your actions of taking over a country, or trading with an enemy country. espionage, religon, trade, culture and more in a game that will not allow you to stop playing. be warned that you can be playing this game and then youll realize that its 3:00 a.m.",1
"just as ridiculously frickin addictive as all the others. sigh.",4
"this game lets you nuke everyone 10/10 very realistic",2
"this game has stolen my life from me! 5/5 would buy again",2
"there are few games are enthralling and immersing as civilization 5. ive spent well over 500 hours on this game already, and plan to keep playing it. it never gets dull, and with mods and dlc content always coming its constantly improving itself.",4
"it may seem like another re-hash of the old civilization games of yore, but once you start playing, this game will get its hooks very, very deep into you, thanks to its massive amount of improvements, streamlined, but improved experience, and hands down the best civilization yet.",1
"this game has hooked me in for many long sessions of just one more turn. it helps that its very easy to play in windowed mode whilst skyping my girlfriend. a friend bought me this as a christmas gift. hes since had to issue an apology to my girlfriend. if it can damage my wonderful relationship, think of how much it could drain your life too!",1
"engrossing turn-based empire-builder with simultaneous-turn multiplayer, an excellent game.",1
"this game is amazing. i was really hesitant to it as i have not been a huge fan of these rts type games. however, civ 5 is still an extremely fun game that everyone should play.",1
"good game is all i can say; scratch that: awesome game!!",1
"awesome game that can be played over and over again.",1
"a game that revolutionizes turn-based stradegy games. adding new features never seen before in tbs like hexagonal tiles, which create new combat scenarios and make gameplay smoother, and the greatest dimplomatic choices seen in a stradegy. with many different civilizations to choose from and each one of them being unique with great abilities, like washingtons ability to have units see one tile ahead than normal units or caesers ability to have production 50%+ in the capital. multiplayer is great experience although setting up a match can be confusing to newcomers. games can last from 4-24 hours giving tons of gameplay oppurtunity. sid meiers civilization v is not only one of the most revolutionary turn based stradegy games, but one of the best.",1
"absolutely addicting game!! i run this on a 60in led and the picture is beautiful.",2
"very good game. sady, it eats into my free time and leaves me with no time to play anything else in my library. 10/10",2
"i have spent way too much time in this game and have survived the trial and error that was multiplayer. it now works, but put in place a pact to finish games you start and be cut-throat.",5
"i would highly reccomend this game to any intellgient hardcore gamer. it opened a world of strategy games to me, and i am so grateful for that. before this game i had never played rts or tbs gmaes, and this was accessible enough for me to undertsnad it, but complex enough to challenge me. and whiile it is not overwhelming, the better you get the more complex you can make the game so it doesnt get boring with exerience, this is a genius masterstroke of game making. i can say with complete confidence that this is by far the best turn based strategy game of all time, and it is in my top 5 strategy games, wich is impressive because every other strategy game in my top 10 is rts.",2
"ever wanted to waste a week of your life without knowing that you did? here is your answer.",1
"i recommand this game for anyone really but especially europe board game players and stratagy",1
"one of the best games i have played! when the new expansion came out, the whole game play was changed! making the game more refreshing and more enjoyable!",1
"one of the best strategy games. you can play it for hours and you still are excited. :)",1
"10/10 would play until 6 in the morning everyday again",1
"this if the first civ same i have played and absolutely loved it. over a week later and the game is still going and not many games have kept my attention and intrigue this long.",1
"this game has eaten too much of my time you can start a game at 5pm, play for what seems like an hour, then check the time and have it at 2am highly addictive and amazingly well put together, this is a must for all game strategists library.",5
"so. good. streamlined nicely for casual players, but fully capable of supporting advanced players. the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay immersive and guaranteed to make you keep uttering the phrase thats practically the series trademark: just one more turn until three in the morning. if youre at all interested in turn-based strategy youve just found its crown. play it.",2
"this is my favorite game ever! the possibilities are endless.",5
"one of those games that you promise to try for five minuites. only to find yourself still playing it seven hours later. very addictiing, pretty fun and great for people new to the civilization series while challenging for the pros. 10/10",1
"my recommend to this game is just try it it is ing awesome :d",1
"having played every iteration of the civilization franchise since the first one in 1991, i can honestly say this is the best one ever made, and not just because of improved graphics, im talking about gameplay balance and the feeling it gives you that this is a huge, deep, complex world. my one and only gripe is the excessively long load times--i had to install it on the ssd and even there it takes 15 seconds to load but thats better than 2-3 minutes.",1
"if youre a fan of turn based strategy games, 4x or just loved civ 4, this is well worth the money! now that it has seen some patchy love, it has only gotten better.",1
"i nuked an enemy 22 times and my friend called me a nuclear psychopath...yeah its pretty fun (other playstyles are available).",2
"one of the best strategy games ive played in a long time. thank you civ.",1
"this is probably one of the best games i have ever played and with my total of 60+ games (console and pc) this is definetally #1. i think everyone should own this fine masterpice of a game. the single player and multiplayer options are very well balanced.",1
"i love this game. love it. just play it and youll get the gist. (unless you dont like strategy then fair enough)",1
"i dominated the world because all other countries bought jeans and listened to music from my country. some dude refused to stop spying on me even though i had four atom bombs stationed near his capital. 11/10",1
"this game is highly addicting, but is f*cking amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"love this game. infinite replayability! the mod engine is superb as well, allowing some impressive customizations.",3
"keep your friends close, and your enemies even closer.",1
"as the dlc has moved on, the game has improved. still think civ ii was the best, though...",1
"an amazing game if you are into strategy. my love for this game is mainly because you get to build a civilization from the times of cave men to the times that have yet to be seen. during this time you do not only build your empire but you see the technology that society has discovered and the world views that the world has lived by. 10/10 - ign",2
"civilization v is probably one of the most complete, detailed and fascinating strategy game ive ever played. i highly recommend it.",2
"my definition of a perfect game! takes quite some time to get used to and learn, but once you do, there is no limit to how many hours you will want to play this game! spent 100+ hours on the campaign edition (not through steam)",1
"now i understand how that chinese guy died playing wow...",1
"this is a great game, you win if you focus on science",1
"the newest iteration of one of the greatest series in gaming. 250+ hours on my steam version, which is one of three versions that ive sunk a lot of time into.",2
"this game is pretty addicting. at first, i was skeptical because i usually dont play these types of games, but when you get into it, you just have to keep going.",2
"this game is one of the best games that i have in my steam library. civilisation v has amazing graphics, great story and most importantly, a great freedom in choice. (war or peace, you decide.) this game is has a random gameplay each save you make. one amazing game, something that couldnt be beaten in a long, long time...",1
"awesome game. warning! this game will cause loss of track of time , also extream fun and addivtive!",1
"this game is so much fun i would bye this game again and again.",1
"the game is awesome, ive never played such a realistic strategy game",2
"interesting game, would no doubt get much better in multiplayer. can take a very long time, and doesnt run too well as the game progresses. sometimes gets a bit boring.",1
"its gettin hot in here, so take of all yo clothes. i won.",2
"this game will ruin your social life, but will leave you very satisfied afterwards",1
"youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you, but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter. 20/10",1
"great game. very indepth andd quite extensive research trees. by far the best civ yet.",1
"i really recommend this game, its always fun to play a couple of hours, and rule the world",1
"this game is another brilliant edition of the civ franchise. plenty of dlc, plenty of different countries and victory types. this game will suck you in and spit you out after playing it for 13 hours straight.",4
"this is a very good game if you like turn-based strategy. very much worth the $50 for all the dlc.",4
"hardcore strategy freeks this is a must buy but i cant recomand this for anyone else youll be irritated by its pacing and how nearly every match becomes a battle for who can aquire the most uranium.",2
"currently burning the cybermens cities to the ground and plundering their cyborg technologies to further enhance the tech level of tokyo-3 9/10 the fact that i spent days on this game scares me",2
"this game is a unique strategy game with original ideas and features and its verry joyful; also you meet legendary people who ruled different countries from different eras, this game and concept of it its just amazing, recommand !",1
"this game is great. ive never played the previous civ games, so this game was quite intimidating. there is so much data presented, it is hard to figure out which is important and which isnt. it will take you some time to learn how to have fun with this game, as the pacing seems glacially slow when you dont know what you are doing. by the time youve beaten a few games, youll be having a great time playing. i love playing each new scenario and learning mechanics i didnt understand before. it makes me excited to play the next game to try out a new strategy! touch support on this game is really great too.",1
"best turn based game ever you can play for hours and hours with a friend or alone",1
"wonderful 4x strategy game that allows for many different approaches and play styles. fun to play, difficult to master.",4
"excellent game, first game of mine from civilization series and i have really enjoyed my time playing this game.",2
"great game, cannot wait for the next one to come out!",2
"i spent so many nights playing for just one more turn. this is easily one of my favorite versions of civ.",1
"its a awsome game with in depth strategy tactics a must have",1
"awsome. i got this game for my laptop and its has never disapoited me. integrated mod tools give me the personal touch i love in a game and the dlc scinarios give me the epic flavor of an expertly developed game",1
"very fun and worth the money if you can get it on sale. the combat is much more enjoyable than civ 4 (no more making huge stacks of units on one tile and rolling around the map... no more 500 year sieges on cities with 30 units stacked in them). i like how the terrain matters much more for both combat and empire infastructure planning (no more having a road to every tile unless you want to be bankrupt). embarking is a nice feature which means you dont have to wait for transport boats to go to sea... other than that its basically just another civ game. entertaining but not head of the pack by any means.",1
"played 375 hours of civ 5 and i dont regret it! 10/10",2
"i bought this to see up catherine the greats skirt. i was sorely disapointed.",3
"very cool strategy game, played it for long time and still playing",2
"civilzation v is one of if not the best turn based stratergies ever. not only does it include difficult choices that have a direct impact on empire but it also opens up a whole new world of imagination where you can create and mould the world as you see fit diplomaitcaly or forcefully. create your own alternate reality today and buy this game. 10/10",2
"seriously... this game was made by the devil to make people have so much fun they forget to go to bed, and then church, and then just one more turn...",2
"this is an amazing game. you can easily spend hours on end playing and it has matches that can last easily over 20 hours. with varying difficulty levels, it allows both casual and hardcore gamers a tough experience. although, the game is a bit incomplete and unbalanced without the expansions, it is still a good base game. i strongly recommend getting brave new world and gods and kings along with the game. it adds so much more functionality and realism to it. ive sunk many hours into it and it is by far one of my favourite games of all time. with hours of replayability, you can entertain yourself forever with this game.",2
"so....awesome... mutliplayer is nice (and can be saved!)",2
"very addicting and fun. complex but not enough for it to be hard to learn how to play. 10/10",1
"civ v is the most addicting game ive ever played. its the most intense, and deep strategy game ive ever played.",2
"i want to play as king aboka why is king aboka not in this game",1
"verry good and an enjoyable game with a friend or two, either team up or play seperate against eachother , win by economy , religion or culture! you decide your outcome play with your favorite conqueror of the ages like, napoleon , alexander the great , ceasar , queen elizibeth and all the others.",1
"addicting strategic game, will keep you busy for hours.",1
"didnt even think i liked strategy games. 60 hrs later, here i am. touchscreen version is even better, perfect time-waster.",3
"i see your amassing a rather large army near my border, i hope you arent planning anything nah man, im just passing through mwahahahahahaha",1
"fantastic game, combining strategy, histry, and tonnes of fun. instant classic with beautiful visuals.",1
"do you have no life and yet want to control the lives of an entire clivilization? if yes, then this is the game for you. another great installment of the sid meiers product line.",1
"heavy game, hard to play, alot of content + mods for even more content. 10/10",2
"great game hour of fun and i cant stop playing it when i do play it and i cant find much that i dont like it",1
"the temptation that is a steam sale is too much for one with a will as weak as mine. at first you remember the strategy games you used to play, cnc, starcraft, lotr b4me. you then run the game to get serenaded by its wonderfully, eloquent intro. you then play the tutorial, as this game is more in depth than justin biebers social life. never did i think this game would suck up so many hours of my time. a tutorial, which took me a good 12 hours as i went and read what things do, and think of what i should do depending on the situation. you will learn to hate barbarians, you will learn to hate them, and then you will destroy them. the satisfaction of getting the barbarians away from your capital, and saving your first workers is just too much. if you play this game you will forget what day of the week it is, and realize that you got fired from your job for playing civ 5 for 3 days.",1
"modern chess you can customize it to make the match you want.",1
"i dont even like these kind of games, and this game is amazing.",1
"this is a surprisingly enjoyable and highly addictive game. i didnt expect to find it as absorbing as i did, but it is much better tutorialised than previous games in the series, making it more accessible. just... one... more... turn...",1
"a more comprehensive and engaging civ experience than ever before. with the steam community churning out so many mods, civ 5 has achieved infinite replayability. i give it a whole-hearted recommendation.",1
"this game is just awsome! civv worths every cent that youll spend with it. the strategy is complex at the same time its easy to understand the basics -thanks friendly interface, you rock -, basically you will develop hour by hour your gameplay untill you see yourself completly in love with this game. the fact that this franchise uses the turn gaming style makes civv the best game for who just dont like the crazy speed of aoe or starcraft. ps: this is awsome to play at work, as you can minimize the window and stop playing without getting killed or losing smtg. my recommendation about civv?: -why are you still reading this and isnt playing the game? hahaha",1
"this game is very enjoyable and a very fun game... it can be historical with the quotes and stuff at times and i was just talking to my teacher about this game how it deals of what were doing and stuff... fantastic... you can even make the religion of spain soccer... i also played as america and ended up in the middle east with alexander the great... im dead... i also ended up in canada with britain and germany forming a alliance... great game, challenging ai and even works with a touchscreen! o.m.g.! lets cross our fingers for a mobile sid 5!",1
"turn based strategy at its best. must buy if you enjoy the genre.",1
"we nuked china 50 times and they were still kicking. 10/10",1
"an excellent game spoiled badley by the fact that it crashes more than a zx80 on a warm day !",2
"the pinnacle of civilization games. it is so good.",4
"its a fun game, but it crashes, a lot. the crashes are very random and ive tried many of the commonly recommended fixes and to no avail. sometimes it will run fine for hours, other times it crashes every few minutes.",1
"great game. fun for more than 100 hours. highly recommend getting brave new world expansion for added replay value, gameplay, and ui experience. 10/10!",1
"awesome stragetic gameplay if you see this then buy this and you will be an happy man... or woman",1
"civ v is truly a fantastic game. if you are into strategy and fun gameplay you will love this game. it never gets boring because there are endless amounts of things you can do! definitely a great buy, but if you are getting it make sure you get gold edition!",1
"ive already lost several days to this game so far. please send help.",1
"fun game. a strategy with a turn based system, gamers that enjoy slower pace should go for this game. 8/10",2
"great game, worth the money, keep you busy for weeks...",5
"a really great game. take control of your favorite civilization and compete against others for victory. amazing multiplayer experience, truly fun to play with friends. i seriously recommend at least the gold edition, as the vanilla game isnt quite good compared to what it is now with all the expansions and dlc. it also goes on sale often, and i think that for the price you pay when it is on sale, its an experience that cannot be overlooked.",1
"one of those games that you promise to try for five minuites. only to find yourself still playing it seven hours later. very addictiing, pretty fun and great for people new to the civilization series while challenging for the pros. 10/10",1
"this game is brilliant if you like strategy games, however it is not for everyone. there is one problem, its addictive. if you get a chance play the demo or if a friend has it ask to play as it is much better to play than watch.",2
"complete edition: almost a masterpiece! the only problem i have is boring, strategic ai, that makes me completely feel like im playing by myself. thankfully, the rest of the game is so wonderful that its easily worth the purchase! and surprisingly the new mechanics are so easy to learn, which i was intimidated about before playing. yes there is multiplayer, and yes during the regular waking hours there are people willing to play (if you set your steams region to a big city in the real world), but multiplayer on med-large maps is unplayable as people bail out off the game 90% of the time. what would have kept people to play was an official world-wide tourney ladder & visible scoreboard. a true 8/10 buy with confidence on sale.",1
"had trade agreement with the romans. the romans then declared war on me and nuked one of my cities causing the trade agreement to end. 3 turns later, the romans go bankrupt and their empire colapses 10/10 would play again",1
"great game to play with others or even solo just watch out for just one more turn syndrome. that one more turn can cost you hours! go buy it and play it!",1
"this game is quite fun and is always a good place to spend free time. 10/10 would buy again.",1
"this game is amazing turn-based game, the graphics are amazing. lag is minimal plus, with dlc you have even more possibilities. the game is a challenging game from playing as the ancient egyptians to the great united states you have hours of gameplay ahead of you. so what are you waiting for buy the game and stop watching me talk about how good it is. flynn approves! 9/10",1
"this game is like crack, but a video game 25/10 would buy again",1
"just one more turn.... civ 5 plus both expansions is the best civilization to date in my opinion. great user interface, best tactical combat of the series, fantastic looking graphics wise, and most importantly very fun and addicting. all eras now seem wonderfully fleshed out (thanks to the expansions) and the game now feels as complete as civ 4 did wth beyond the sword.",2
"really nice game, could play for hours. graphics are nice, learn a bit of sketchy history while you play. has a multiplayer version which is great but after playing for a couple hours the games sometimes break and go out of sync and start crashing.",1
"user friendly for those who are fairly unfamiliar with the rts genre and gameplay. its addicting, enough to the point where id be up till 3am and not realize it; just blankly looking at my screen and yelling ing god damn alexander stop trying to start a war with me. it is amazingly fun and the games can go on for a very long time, i think my first game lasted about 9~10 hours. its an rts fans staple and for good reason.",1
"ive put a good few hours into this game, and i must say, if you want an awesome looking game with satisfactory strategic gameplay and a good challenge, go ahead and get it. countless replayability and good mods make this game that much better too. 8.5/10",1
"great game, but be warned: you will put so much time into this game very quickly.",1
"so last night i went and tried the game out because ive had it for a bit. i started it at 2am ish and the next time i looked at the clock it was 4:30am! that hasnt happened in a while for me and a game. stratagey is gread! the tile and turn based systems work flawlessly. its overall a really great and addicting game",1
"it is soo worth the money to buy it. hours of fun with friends and by my self soo worth it",2
"if you want to ruin someones life, give them this game.",1
"this, is one of the best video games, i have ever played",1
"protip to hex editors, to find your gold value, multiply by 100.",1
"a very fun and addictive tile-based/turn-based simulation like game where you get to choose a civilization to play as and walk it through the different eras of history. theres tons of civilizations to choose from, and several ways to win, from killing everyone else to going to the moon. the fun never stops (but its a bit tricky when two civilizations that are both stronger than you attack you at the same time) in this great game.",1
"lovely! i havent seen sunlight in  three days, i think? cant get over how khan is actually very nice even without random ai, how war gets him to actually respect you, unlike other leaders. 9/10, but i jsut have the basic version, so... planning on expanding upon that. so, sid, shut up and take my money!",1
"best game i ever played, very similar to age of empires which i played as a kid 10/10 a++++++++++",1
"this game is a well made strategy game.its well worth the money to purchase this game if you like to try out the variety in civilizations to play as or if you like to play competetive.a list of pros and cons. pros: random map generator good engine ability to select what era you start in players normally always on multiplayer lots of dlc content during steam sales its cheap cons: mod button not on mac unless you edit the game files without dlc its bland sometimes it takes too long for something. overall the game gets a 7.9/10",2
"with the brave new world expansion this becomes literally the best point in the series. no stacks of doom, trading, religion, tourism...only thing missing is that espionage could be a bit more fleshed out, with spy units that could poison water and sabotage and whatnot.",1
"strategy masterpiece. well balanced, expansive, addictive and thoroughly replayable. really feels epic, like you are nurturing a powerful civilization from its roots to world domination. highly recommended.",1
"i was playing a simple game. my ma came and asked: how long have you been here? 5min. and now is ing 2 am, you started playing it at 8 pm, so you call this 5min?! time killer.10/10.",1
"its the comprehensive startegy game, if you havent already played it, slap yourself in the face then buy it. you wont regret it (the game that is, you may regret the slap in the face)",1
"amazing game with lots of depth. i find myself saying just one more turn... and then playing for another hour. i never regret it though, thats how good this game is.",1
"this game is not for me. it lacks action and pretty graphics to captivate me. dont get me wrong i like rts games but this too much turn based. that said its a solid game if you are fan of turn based strategy.",1
"very fun to play, endless replayability, amazing dlc, decent multiplayer, and it usually never gets boring",1
"this games features turn based strategy gameplay. its many opportunities for building your envisionment of a perfect civilization will leave you planning, acting, and doing for hours.",4
"only in civilization can attila the hun be the most diplomatic leader known to man.",1
"just one more turn. youll find yourself saying this a lot while playing civilization. lots of fun to grow a civilization from nothing to a full empire. its amazing how deep this game can get when you get into it. a must for any turn based strategy fan, and even the ones who arent fan of the genre.",1
"defently the best civ game i have played to date, gd visule and sound, gd gameplay and multiplayer works like a charm, can be glitchy sometimes but overall it is a very gd game",1
"wow is what i said after i finally beat this game this game makes you start off with nothing aand lets you create step by step and at the start peaceful times none around at the end your warriors have to fight off 2 or 3 civs just to survive and you can make freindships but in this you cant trust your allies they turn on you any chance they get annd number one rule dont trust washington the ottomans or spain",1
"the original civ and civ ii were some of the of the most fun games i played as a kid. i coudnt be happier with this latest addition to the francise! (also it no longer takes 12 hard discs 8 hours to instal!).",1
"civilization v had a lot of issues when it first launched, which resulted in that i dropped out of the game, because it wasnt any fun compared to the predecessor. when i picked up the game after it was on sale and my friend asked me if it was worth it, i immediately saw a lot of improvements. id reccomend this game if youre prepared to get the major dlcs (gods and kings and brave new world). the rest of the dlcs are just for fun :)",1
"awesome game, it is definitely my favorite game ever.",2
"this game has taken a lot of my time; probably not even close to as much as other people who play this. it is a very accessable game but also can be complexed. i recommend getting the expansions as the final expansion adds more importance to faith and culture. this game can be addictive though. i played 3 playthroughs; by the end of the 3rd night, i had 20+ hours into it.",1
"finally available for linux, and works even better than on windows! :)",1
"civilization 5 is the primary reason of my having a steam account 10/10",2
"the best game out there if you want to feel like hitler. 10/10 great hitler simulator.",1
"the amount of hours of fun i get out of this are awesome, best with parties though",1
"fantastic game, doesnt take a bunch of skill to have fun",1
"in civilization v, you play in an alternate dimension where earth seems to have been taken over by gandhi, who intially lures you in with promises of friendship and wealth - only to be anally ed by him when you realize he has the nuclear missile by 1850 ad. 10/10",1
"get brave new world then play 10/10 best game love it, bye bye. :*",1
"this is a very entertaining game. i find it very challenging, though that may say more about me as a player than it does about the game. its a very good game from a genre i dont typically enjoy.",1
"one more turn will become your mantra. and all of a sudden, it will time to shower, shave, and go to work.",1
"first of all i am a huge fun of the game since the very first cilivization ... now about ver v : graphics look good - but the game is so complicated and the controls are so hidden that if i didt already know the shortcuts i would have missed on half the option!!! panthen->religion->paths.. so many govermnet types with so so many different options ... already tired explaining ..bye",1
"i had a peaceful nation on my own continent. the ioquois show up with warships and took my land. 10/10 would get smallpox again",2
"what a great game. it enables you to play as civilizations from the past. as well as you can play it 100 times and each time will be different. the only thing that i would add is a canadian civilization.",3
"was only going to play it for an hour or so but spent hours on ends playing it so good!!",1
"amazing game! the best, most rich version of civilization ive ever played.",1
"as much replayability as tes skyrim (witout needing any mods) this game is seirously worth the money. the game is fun, and extremely coustimizable. only downside is that the dlc is expensive",1
"why cant i stop playing civ v? someone, please, make me stop playing civ v.",3
"great game for spending 30 hours striaght and having fun teh whole time...",2
"very good game. good value for the price. i have been playing several full games with different starting civilizations, trying new tactics each time. each type of victory is a goal to achieve in itself and some can be harder to achieve than others. the ais are not super smart, but can still be provide a challenge sometime.",1
"this is the best stratagy game there is! its a bit expensive but its well worth it.",1
"if you have the time to invest, this game has the entertainment returns to give. build an empire, build an army, make friends and destroy your enemies. what feels like minutes with be hours building your world and make sure someone else doesnt rip it from you.",1
"this game is fantastic, and i love it. 4/5 for me. one problem though. literally 90% of the workshop items require the dlc brave new world. this is an extra 30 dollars. dont get it if you want mods, but dont want to spend an extra $30. other than that, fantastc game",1
"*looks at clock* oh ok its 16:30 i have got plenty of time *15 minutes later looks again, its 5:30*",1
"as addictive as previous civilization games. i wish they would fix the glitches with the achievents and the expansion packs! spending way too many hours playing.",5
"well worth the price. ive already gotten my moneys worth from this game and am nowhere near done playing it, i forsee dropping over 1000 hours in this game.",1
"very good strategy turn based game, but it can take a lot of your free time...",1
"this is a great stratagy game, very addicting. honestly one of the best games ive ever played!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"i catatafish think this game is great, if you are new to the series all youll need is the base game. if our a fan of the series i suggest getting the dlc aswell.",1
"this is an amazing and very well-made game. all of the aspects in the game (such as production) are linked to each other (building the great library for science, building a worker for happiness, etc) in such a way that every choice you make will shape the outcome of the game. it also offers wide range of potential playing styles, so that no matter what mood youre in you still want to play the game. because of this, it has amazing replay value and appeals to a large amount of people. 9/10 (the multiplayer is weird) 0/10 if youre playing with ghandis ai.",2
"this game is amazing. it might seem as if each time you play its going to be the same but no matter what the game will always be diffrenet. the first day i got this game i played for 10 hours straight. this game is amazing. its like a board game but has so many more features.",1
"a stronk game! more stronker with friends! conquer puny nations with stronk wallachian clay! stronk countries are stronkest! stronk! aka- reccomended",1
"so unbelievably addictive, but it shouldnt have taken two major expansions to bring it up to the same standard as civ iv.",1
"stay calm and dont trust ghandi or hiawatha youll pay for it if you do 10/10 30 mins becomes 4 hours just juan more turn you say, that becomes 2, then 5, then 10, then before you know it 100",1
"this game is by far one of the best game i have ever played. vanilla is outstanding and is different each time you play, mods make the game more fun by adding new things to the mix, renovating existing ones, and bringing back aspects of other civ games into this one. i never played the older civilization games other than this, but i can say that this game will please every fan of the old civs. while the games are long, taking many hours to get through one civilization, it is immersive and dynamic, and full of surprises from the somewhat quirky ai. i love all 2k games, but this and xcom are tied. if youre looking for a quick fix, civ 5 is not your game. but if you enjoy seeing the hard-earned results of long playthroughs ending in victory, this is definitely for you",2
"civilaztion is a game where you are pitted against other nations to see who can become the strongest, smartest, and wealthiest. or, you can just beat the absolute crap out of the other players. i love it.",1
"this game is practically endless and addictive. i have played over 200 hours of this game just to show you how addictive this game really is. it is a great game for any gamer looking for a turned base strategy game.",2
"wow this game is truly astounding! as a gamer i like variety of games but, i have never been a true fan of turn-based strategy games. i decided to give it a try and now this is all i have played for the past 2 weeks. this game challenges your mind, you can research technology from increasing your military power, scientific knowledge, economics and more. it leaves you wondering should i focus on military incase of attack or focus on economics to expand my empire? it really can kick your  should you choose wrong. overal i give it a 10/10. get it",1
"this game is the best strategy game i have ever played, i truly think it is a great game to get have fun!",1
". every time i play this game, i like it more. i wish sitting down to a session didnt glue me to the chair (by my own choice)",1
"4 **** i struggle to understand a lot of civs concepts but i can recognize a good game when i see it. this title has a lot going for it, its better than 4 in my opinion. so if you like this sort of thing give it a go.",1
"great game, its always fun to see your civilization evolve from sticks and stones up to the nukes! this game can be fun in solo but also with friends which makes it even better because you can trade tactics together and do research agreements to speed up your domination!",1
"10/10 great game play, you can betrail your friends :d",1
"so good, just cant stop. youll find yourself saying :ok ill just play 10 more turns then im done and the next thing you know, the sun is coming up. youll want to go eat or get a drink as soo as you finish this wonder, but an hour has gone by. if you need to be a productive person do not play this game, it is highly addictive. personally, i uninstall it during exam week because i have done accidental all nighters on this game with the just one more turn mindset. 8/10 gameplay 9/10 graphics/u.i. 6/10 music 10/10 replayability 9/10 steam workshop support (there is literally every civ you could want from patrick star to hitler) 8.4/10 buy this game (during the sale with all the dlc)",5
"good game, worth it. stays true to the civ legacy while also innovating itself! enjoying it a lot!",1
"ive only played a few hours into this game, playing on an easy difficulty to get the jists of things. its amazing the amount of content in this game, it keeps on suprising me!",1
"honestly one of the greatest games ive ever played, far too much of my time has been spent on this masterpiece.",1
"the kind of game you can play all day. i cant wait until 6 comes out in the next few years. one of the best games i have ever played.",1
"i love this game, it was a little challenging when i firt started, but after this its so fun!",1
"nuclear missiles giant death robots homicidal gandhi 10/10",1
"10/10 would bang again. seriously though this game is great to play with friends or without. dont like how the game is stock? this game is very mod friendly so if you wanna mod the  out of it, whats stopping you?",2
"this game is amazing. have played over 200 hours and would highly recomend this game to anyone interested in this genre or looking for a new game. it is fun to play with friends and also solo.",2
"top 10 things to know- 1) ghandi= happiness and peace (thermonuclear warfare and death) for everyone! 2) war is best 3) only make the game last for a long time if you want the ai to hate you 4) the ai declares war for no good reason 5) one...more...turn... 6) ceasar=extreme backstabber...i think he wants what was don to him to happen to everyone 7) dem stealth bombers tho 8) dem nukes tho 9) prepare to pledge your life to the all-powerful next-turn button 10) backstabbing simulator 20something serious review- this is a great 4x strategy game, and if thats what youre looking for, buy it. it has a fully functional multiplayer as well as singleplayer. you essentially play as different civilizations from history and try to win using various different methods, which are explained in the tutorial.",2

"rescued a city form the french... gave the city back to them... expected them to worship me... dethroned me 10/10",1
"sid meier is a genius. this is a fact. civ 5 is unquestionably the best development of the series since civ 2. civ 1 is of course legend. i was less impressed by civ 3 and 4, but hey they are still great games. by this game, by all of them. you wont be disappointed.",1
"this game is such a huge waste of time, you start playing it and next thing you know, a whole week has passed and youve grown a beard and have poostains all over you. i wouldnt want to waste my time any other way. im currently sat in hospital for not eating or drinking for a whole week while playing this game but it was worth it. its my turn now so i must go, i would write more but gandhi is currently launching nukes at my cities.",1
"i had to purchase the game 2 times in order to make it work properly with the dlc but i guess thats steam? who knows... been through hell for this but the game is good",1
"this is a great game and a must have for pc players. it is easy to get the hang of. get the complete edition the normal civ v is ok. the complete edition is what makes it a really good game. 9/10 only due to the fact you need to get the main dlcs.",1
"i havent played civ since the original. its basically the same game as i remember, with everything extended (as it should, after so many iterations and years). most importantly, its got that same crack feeling to it: you cant just stop playing a game without severe reasons. one more turn. one more turn. ok, now my house is on fire. i should really stop. one more turn ...",1
"took over middle east, africa and named the cities and put anti chink names as the cities 8/8 would take over er land again",1
"civilisation v is a quite complex (and lengthy) strategy game. if you are into strategy games and have several hours to kill, then civ v is my prefered game of choice. despite what you may hear, even the worst of computers can run civ. however the problem with civ v is that for it to be a decent game you need to get dlc. i personally suggest saving up about 30-40 and buying all the dlc in the summer sale, where it is much cheaper.",1
"excellent replayability. addicting, especially multiplayer.",1
"this is the one game that any of my friends or i can rack up 100s of hours of gametime on and still be dying to play more. this is the epitome of the easy to learn, difficult to master mantra. the many different civs to choose from, multiple win conditions, and map generator mean that this game never quite plays out the same twice. the permutations are endless. definitely buy the expansions, as they add new units and mechanics that are fun, interesting, and well-balanced as well as fine-tune existing units and civs.",4
"civilization has long been one of my favorite franchises, ever since i played the first one as a kid. they went through a weak period with iii, but iv was great and v is the best entry in the series yet.",1
"great mechanics with lots of replay value. any strategy fan will enjoy what civ v has to offer. the expansions also add lots of content.",1
"soooooooooo much fun!!!!! definatly an all around must have. if you dont have it ... ...buy it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"civ 5 is an amazing high definition strategy game which requires a lot of thinking and skill. i have been led into massive wars and online multiplayer with friends is just pure fun. you start in the ancient era and can end up researching all the way into the future era! massive full scale wars never fail to impress me and the multiple different ways of winning is very interesting. i still have yet to go through all the paths of winning! 9.2/10",1
"wow. ive played this for, like, 50 hours, but only actually opened the game 7 times. wow.",1
"the best civilization ever, also the best strategy game i have ever played. i recommend using both gods and kings and brave new world expansion packs for the full civilization feeling. just one more turn.....",4
"the ole fall back game... its just good and always there :-)",1
"best game ever, i was very relucant to buy this game because there isnt a mac demo so i didnt know if i was wasting my money, but now i have bought the game i would pay 30 to buy this game,",1
"it is a fun game . . . but only with both expansions.",2
"my favorite game of all time. i have wasted alot of my life playing this, so you can trust me when i say its good.",2
"this game will drag on and on, its not entirely fun as all nations will eventually be te same overall, with less stategy and more power play that anything else. but if you like micro manageing and controling a nation its yours to mess around with. i must warn you though, it is not worth the money",1
"choose a country, and run it your way! would you like to be the most technologically advanced, or the most cultural? would you have a large workforce capable of building world wonders the quickest? would you be friendly, or would you attempt world domination? would you place your cites in a place it in a place with good resources or fertile land? this game is incredibly detailed and addicting. the dlc add more objectives such as religion and trade routes.",2
"in this game, you play a cruel warlord, bent on world domination, using your ability of immortality to lead your nation. you make your people happy by giving them luxuries, to distract them from the cruel and constant warring of nations, who cearly have no care for their people, but only care for regular income, and further destruction and annexation of each others territory. this game paints a harsh depiction of a dystopian nightmare world, were territory and military prowess are all that matter.",1
"spent and hour and thirty minutes trying to set up a game with 8 other friends, finally clearing the pregame lobby the game crashed for everyone -awards awarded- best time ive spent in a lobby recognized the true meaning of friendship as we didnt need a game to have fun single player is great tho 10/10",1
"highly addicting game. another must own game. got it on sale couldnt pass it up.",1
"possibly (definately) the greatest strategy game ever , beautiful graphics, great longetivity, and the best point of all, you can play as ethiopia!",1
"another addicting civ game. the amount of dlc is overwhelming, but doesnt bring much to the table. worth picking up on sale, otherwise dont feel like you have to have it all.",3
"incredible game for the casual or veteran tbs gamer. combines easy-to-use interface with dynamic (for the most part) environments and world domination aspects. playing with friends is even better than playing alone. allows creation and download of community-made mods for more interesting gameplay. vanilla is nothing compared to brave new world. if you like civ v in its original form, you should definitely buy bnw.",1
"great game, easy to get lost in it and lose track of time.",1
"civilization v is a solid game. not too much more to say. its fun to play vanilla, with many different ways of achieving victory (culture, science, and domination, for example) and no two games turn out quite the same. then when you include mods into the equation, and you get even more playtime and fun. i recently played a match as the kingdom of rohan on an 80x80 hex map of middle earth, and man was that fun. there are also mods that add enhanced functionality, unique units, gui tweaks, and a whole slew of other changes that serve to spice up the experience. definitely a solid pick up. however, id definitely advise getting gods and kings with it at the very least. the gods and kings expansion adds a lot of content to the game that was sorely needed, and they have added even more content to it with the newest expansion brave new world.",1
"while i love the game, i wish they wouldve captured the personality of the leaders more in actual gameplay. ghandi gets pretty aggressive, and im pretty sure he didnt roll like that.",1
"very addicting, be prepared to sink a hundred hours, that you didnt mean to, into this game.",1
"civilization v is a fantastic entry in the series, which avoids the trap of getting stagnant thanks to some important novelties on combat system, interface and general design, designed to create a 4x of elegant and clean mechanics.",1
"probably one of my favorite games. the dlcs are awesome but even the vanilla version of the game is great. 300+ hours over the course of 2 years",2
"this game is great really recomend it but it is a game where its alot more fun to play with friends rather than by yourself.",2
"probably the best strategy game out there if you are looking for a good game to buy, this is your best choice!",1
"good luck not spending at least 10 hours at a time playing this game. easily one of the best strategy games of all time.",1
"perhaps one of the most addictive games ive ever played. i have found this game to be a worthy succcessor to the civilication series, if you dont have it, get it, if you do, why are you screenshotting this just for reddit karma? seriously, its a great game.",2
"i love turn based strategy games and this is one of the best without containing too much detail like some of the other games. these type of games are great for those who are looking to be able to walk away from the game at a moments notice without any problem (except if playing multiplayer).",2
"this game is a must-buy for fans of the civilization franchise, and i highly recommend picking it up if you even think you might be interested in this kind of strategy game. ive only played the gold edition, which comes with the base game plus the gods + kings expansion. at the very least, i suggest getting this expansion; after playing this game with religion, i cant go back. i dont have the other expansion (brave new world), so i cant comment on it. vererans will know how the game works; you can choose how you want to play and how you want to win. the interface is very well laid out, the music is perfect, and the graphics look great. the opponent ai can sometimes be a little aggressive and will refuse to make trades that are clearly in their favor, but other than that the gameplay is fantastic. overall, i believe that civilization v is worth every cent of your purchase!",2
"i recommend dis gaem but ily needs to ing preesss end turn what a ing wangus",4
"i will always love civ games, but civ 5 kind of takes a step back. its not that challenging and its a lot the same as 4, but i liked 4 more. i do reccommend it though but if ur a civ fanatic like myself, its getting to be a lot of the same old.",1
"its too confusing with all the mods targeted towards you having all the same cost as game itself expansions, gods and kings + brave new world, so i recommend not buying this neverending wallet puller in order to get the content we want from civilization.",2
"civ v gods and kings is a good game to play although it an older virsion than brave new world dlc its a great virsion",1
"had no idea what i was doing but i think i won 10/10 would be confused again",1
"the dull technology is anti-historical .every nation has similar tech .you are mongols of steppes -no problem . you can still build lighthouse of alexandria or collosus of rhodes -both monuments strictly made by very prosperous sea-faring nations. it is ridiculous . further more you can not set era when you want to halt the advancement. i dont feel playing modern era ,but i can not do nothing about it . even more the scenarios are awful . some of them as short as only 70 turns long. they simple threw some uncooked pseudo historic technology into the pot because it would take few dollars !!! to give every nation the tech it really could have access before the modern era. there are lot of people whoo does not care about anything for them this game is perfect . if you feel like doubtful about central american civilisations having cavalry or other nonsense then this game is not for you.",1
"this is a great game you can spend hours playing either casually or competitively. this is the best turn based strategy game i have ever played and would recommend it to everyone even if the genre is not one you would normally play.",3
"when you think you play this game for 3 hours and then you realize you already waste your time for 3 days",1
"this is one of my favorite games of all time, if your looking for a game with great gameplay, awsome multiplayer, and hours upon hours of fun... buy this game!",1
"this game is so addictive and can be played for hours and hours on end.",1
"amazing turn base stategy game. with facts and wonders you probably did not know!! if you like a stategy game with historical info i reccomend it so get it yea",2
"overall, i would recommend civ 5 to anyone who enjoys strategy games, aside from the hardcore turn-based strategy lovers. the game is quite easy to pick-up, and it is play style is pretty intuitive. while accessible to the new tbs player, the hardcore tbs players may find this game a bit superficial, as it certainly has room for more depth and complexity to enhance the immersive feel of the game. the game has great community support with tons of mods being added constantly for this game, which can help to add to some of the lack of immersiveness with the vanilla version or even with the 2 firaxis expansions. given the 235 hours that i have put into this game, i would definitely recommend this game.",2
"yeah so 340 hours logged and i still get the urge to play it every couple of weeks. this is one of a handful of must have pc games and one of the greatest games of all time.",3
"it wasnt until the release of brave new world that civ 5 overtook civ 4 to become my favorite turn-based of all time.",2
"i love the entire civilization franchise; civ 5 is no different. its an amazing ton of fun to build your own empire. with the expansion packs of gods and king and brave new world (in addition to the other civs), the game becomes full - i highly recommend them as well. new to the game are city-states and a one unit per tile rule. this adds a great amount of strategy when thinking how to manage your military or dealing with other civilizations.",4
"trully an astonishing work of art. great graphics and the gameplay is just spectalur! america approves this game for children under the age of 3 :)",1
"america adopted fascism, france created judaism, denmark built the great wall of china, communism was voted as the world ideology, the first olympic games were held in poland, the celtic finished the the manhattan project and a native american tribe became the superpower... 10/10 would recommend this game.",2
"fabulous! it has a perfect mix of fun fiction, and intriguing realism! 10/10",2
"highly addicting game.. keep telling myself just one more turn o_o very fun and highly recommended",1
"been a fan of civilization and other sid meiers games since i started playing pc games. this one will not let you down and the vastness of cheap dlc that enhance the base game and throw new challenges make for an easy thumbs-up on this game. buy at whatever price and rack up on the dlc when it goes on sale.",5
"i played all the civilization games and enjoy wasting my time on it.",1
"one of the best games in the category of strategy. you make all decisions on how to win the game, with or without suggestive help. you can make your own history of the world. and the ai are completely unlike what the should be, but i would still conquer the anyways. ghandi wants to spread the peace, nukes = peace, greece always attacks you, and sucks at defending, while england is terrible at being an empire. my only complaint is that when the ai difficulty increase, pretty much only there bonuses increase, but there intelligence is too artificial to be any more of a dumbass when it comes to military strats.",1
"such an addicting game. i honestly lose track of time when i play civ and i end up playing for hours. such an in depth and immersive world there really arent words to describe it. strongly recommend to anyone who plays rts games. one quick hint though . . . never trust france. ever.",1
"this game is one of the best... if not the best turn based strategy games out there... i have been big fan of civ 4... but now that i played civ 5 with all expansions (that brought a lot of fixes) i must say civ 5 is far better... espionage is fun, exploring, lot of different nations and ways of how to play... the game is fun and it is time sink for sure! but game has few downs: some bugs... and on harder playtroughs diplomacy becomes pain as its really easy to get on nerves of npcs and really hard to be good with them (that needs still fixing and balancing) and few ai fixes are needed too... not to mention how ai cheats a lot (having lot of money and being in minus with income, spawing extra military units etc...) only thing i havent tried out yet is multiplayer... but hope in time i will have fun with that too :) but anyway... really good game :)",3
"good game overall, a bit repetitive at times but definitely fun to play!",1
"i dont really like turn based games, but this game is differnent and i love the way there are progression trees for both policies and tech, thus maximizing possibilites for each player in the game. the multiple victory conditions are also good as they variate how people play the game so it is not repetitive and not everyone has the same goals. there are plenty of civilizations to choose from ranging from england to even civilizations like the zulu. unfortunatly i find multiplayer can be a bit poor because the games can last a long time and people like to quit, i find this makes it best to play with your friends as you can save game and continue with them later.",1
"great strategy game, fans of previous civ games will love this one. indepth, semi-complex, but a quick learning curve. amazing time-waster, easy to get lost in a game from start then look at your clock and the next thing you know 5 hours have disappeared!",2
"i was never a big fan of the civilization series, but this one has made me rethink my concepts about the accoladed turn-based strategy classic.",1
"i half to say this game is much better and feels more complete and thought out than its previous versions. almost like the serious version of the civilization series and the additional content makes the game significantly more enjoyable and adds more diversity. i recommend this game to people whom enjoy strategy games or sophisticated game players...yes, quite.",1
"buy the expansion packs. civ 5 vanilla is okay, but the expansion packs (gods & kings, brave new world) make this game as amazing as it should have been at launch.",1
"always addicting, i love how much more in depth this one is than revolution. definitely suggest buying it!",1
"i have sunk a lot of time into this game, by my standards at least. completely reccommend to anybody who likes the genre.",1
"a great strategy game where your action will affect a lot on the game, if you dont mind spending 4 - 8 hours on a advanced stratestic turn based game, then this migth be what you are looking for. 8 / 10",2
"dont buy this should you desire to live a productive life.",1
"great turn-based strategy with elements coming from the most important pieces of history, this game shows the ways civilizations interact in many ways. be an expanding colonial state, a traditional isolationist, a religious nation devoted to the spread of the faith, or many things both different and in-between. replay important wars of history making your own decisions, or blaze your own trail from the dawn of civilization to the modern era.",1
"if you have played the other civilations you will no doubt like this one. if you have never played one but are a fan of city building and tactical combat, this game is for you.",4

"any game where i can columbus columbuss house is a game for me. 10/10",1
"awesome game, totally different feel than four(which i consider the pinnacle of the classic civ style of play). introduces city states love them or hate them. the dlc is way too expensive though. i bought the game pre-release which was a huge mistake and resulted in me paying twice as much for the games content where as people who waited for the complete edition(about two years), get a way better deal still to this day. its cheaper for me to buy the complete edition now which duplicates half the content i already own than to buy the content piece meal which is total bs. good game though.",1
"please i got this game and it is so good. i love how i can just go away and pick it up again. if you like long term strategy games less intense than sc then this is the game for you. i have around 112 hours on this game.",1
"i cannot explain in words how great this game is. twice as fun if plaing with friends.",3
"my friends and i play this for hours on end. say goodbye to your social life. forever.",1
"fun and an easy way to kill some time when you want to simply take over the world.",1

"fun strategy game, enjoyable. except for the warmongering ghandi.",1
"if there is one turn-by-turn strategy game to own, civilization is the one to go for. the first episode was the game i spent more time on, until i discovered mmos. this vth episode is probably the best since then : complex, detailed and with plenty of different civilisations. a must have, more words arent necessary.",2

"solid strategy game, but make sure you have time on your hands if you want to jump into this game. although it is quite time consuming, the size of this game is just unbelievable. a whole variety of civilizations, maps, victory types and military units cause you to mix different strategies to best conform with the current world, which is pretty swell.",1
"make the world burn in a nuclear hellfire muahahahahahha..... *ehm* yah but economical strategems are fun.",4
"absolutely fantastic game. it takes a lot of time that youll be happy you spent having fun.",1
"so much fun. addictive and educational. yep i said it. learn bits of history witht he vanilla setup of the game. learn how leaders like gnadhi n such were. anyways its a great turn based strategy with a indepth game and great military units. shame i never have time b4 conquering the world to make buildings in citys so much",1

"civ 5 is definitely the best one to come out so far. the graphics and the gameplay are awesome! i have pretty much all the dlc and both expansion packs, which really add amazing depth to the game. i started with just the basic game at first though, and instantly i was hooked and have been ever since. i love this game! but dont listen to me, i am but a humble servant...",1

"whew! after a few fun hours its time to turn this off and go to bed. whats that? its time to get up already!? yeah. it happens. with all of its dlc, 50 hours is only scratching the surface. its addicting, its exciting, and its challenging. playing with friends in to the early morning is a common occurence as you to try to out-perform and out-maneuver your opponents. its satisfying when you emerge victourious after an 8 hour game. (lets ignore the disappointment of being defeated after 8 hours). this game is well worth your money as there are many hours of fun to be had. also, the music is pretty darn good.",1
"this is a fantastic game with seemlessly endless fun on offer, the best part is that if you get a little bit bored of it then just try playing as a different civilisation and try a differnet tactic for victory, you will get a differnet experience each time. simply astounding.",2

"highly addicting, customizable, and recommended for both new and veteran strategy game players.",3
"games kindda stale. the new game mechanics are certainly welcome for anyone familiar with the civilization series. with that said, its the same ol cheating ai. your comp opponent with still be in the stone age, but attack with tanks and watch how the next turn all its citites are amazingly teched to modern armies, as well. dimplomacy and trading is still a joke and useless.",1
"you like good turn-based games? you prefer staying at the computer all day? well, civilization v is your choise now +good gameplay +pretty cheap now +add-ons are really cool! new civilizations and game mods are included. expansion packs offer a variety of new features +multiplayer (players vs players or players vs bots etc.) -expansion packs are much more expensive than the game -civilization v without add-ons becomes boring very quickly so if you have some spare time and 2-3 friends playing this game -buy it!",1

"love this game! you will need both expansions to truly appreciate it. the gods and kings expansion added quite a bit to game play but with the latest expansion brave new world, more elements have been included such as trade routes, tourism, etc. that enhance the game even more. all that being said, diplomacy is still poorly executed in the game so beware of this negative aspect and enjoy what is a very good, if not excellent (4x) tbs game.",5

"i love this iteration of civ. i bought the gold pack with extra civs and maps. it has enough depth to keep you coming back again and again. but its simple enough for anyone to get started and play. i like having control over the advanced setup and choosing or limiting modes of victory to change things up. i play civ5 many times more than my other games. you can choose to make the games quick or mathons. either way you can always sit down for a few turns when you have the time, and save the rest for later. this is a very versatile game setup that allows you to customize almost anything. whether you are new to civ, or a domination monster, i highly recommend this game.",3
"one of the greatest (strategy) games ever made... once you start, its not easy to stop xp",1
"just gonna play a quick friday night game aaaaand its monday morning... seriously addictive. crappy ai though.",2
"all and all a good game for anyone with time to play it of course it has a save option but it is time consuming regardless",1
"very good strategy with loads of fun ;) however i need to warn that: - next turn button is bugged; 50% of cases it doesnt do anything, 40% it shows some unit which needs new orders and only at remaining 10% it trully ends turn, - workers forget what they were doing almost every single turn, - game starts up and loads save very slow. other than that its really cool and you probably wont regret buying it ;)",1
"fun fun fun fun, made me look foward to the weekend, until 7:45, when i would get off to eat dinner then cruise on the highway with friends. usually i play on friday.",4
"this game is a must if youre a fan turn based strategy.",1
"i buyed this game on my windows vista laptop before. but i change my os from the windows vista to ubuntu 14.04 x86_64 now. and it still could play through the steam platform. its so great. it is better if this game has the tradational chinese transation version.",1
"lets play a classic game of where did the time go? featuring sid meiers civilization v, glorious mods and even better addons. and now caesar i shall turn your armies into radioactive dust! -- ghandi",1
"i have always had a soft spot in my heart for grand strategy games. this 4x game hits all the right sweet spots. pick a civilization to conquer the world through diplomacy, culture or military might! there are lots of options to gameplay, and many scenarios to try out. i thoroughly enjoyed many of the european ones. there are lots of mods that can bring new blood into the game once you have become bored after many hours of play. i would definetly recomend this game to anyone who enjoys playing complex board games, because that is basically what this is, a giant board game. lots of fun! 5/5",1
"the chain had to break somewhere i guess. civ ii, iii, & iv all brought a new dimension to a solid foundation. whereas, civ v sucked so much that it took all of those progressions and pretty much just flushed them down the toilet. i cant get pass the reminder thrust upon me through the clunky  interface as to how much this game truly sucks. slow, boring, depthless gameplay provide a sad fate for the civilization franchise. we had fun while it lasted sid.",2
"ive been playing the civ franchise from the start, and this is another fine addition to the line.",1
"this is one of the most amazing turned based strategy games ive evr played, althought the multiplayer disappointed me a little bit its still definitly worth the buy!",2
"this games is really addicting. warning: this game will consume your time!",1
"thanks to this game now i just want to see the world on fire",1
"a very strategic-based, turn-based war game... lots of different choices and ways to build your cities and armies, as well as allying with or seiging city-states and lots more too.",1
"as a hardcore strategy gamer who is no stranger to planning out my empires production dozens of turns in advance, ive already turned to civ v for my world-conquering needs  but at the same time, if anything is going to rear a new generation of strategy gamers like the very first civilization did for me, its this.",1
"great game. if you liked previous civs, youll like this. possible to waste weeks on it.",1
"very game good sid meier civilation influence great aspect life bring nice innovation much like thoren school. such is game. 9.4/10 - ign",1
"it is very fun but i was so angry as they made it 75% off the day after i bought it, they do this with about half my games so i have wasted money. it is almost like they do it to annoy me, stupid idiots",1
"i absolutely love this game. it is without a doubt one of the most enjoyable turn-based strategy games i have played in a long while with very indepth strategy behind it. however i cannot recommend this game. why is that? i have had a game breaking bug for the past 3 months that has made it impossible for me to get past the opening cinematics. i cannot enter the loading screen and there has been no attempts to fix this glaring issue and i know i am not alone on this. i have even went as far as to try and fix the problem myself, but to no avail. without this and some other completely terribly game breaking glitches i would highly recommend this, but for now i feel somewhat cheated.",1
"if you like going outside and maintaining healthy relationships. this game is way too addicting for you.",2
"just wait until i get my b-52s guys! 10 destroyed ryans/10",1
"if you already dont have a life, youve got nothing to lose. get it already.",1
"great game, full of stratigic thinking. everytime you start a new game you are restarting history,",3
"from the dawn of mankind, from the point where humans finally band together to create societies, you the player take control of a variety of nations that have actually existed in history, such as china, america, england, russia, germany, and japan to name a few, to write your own version of history alongside other great nations of the earth. researching technologies, adopting social policies, building cities, conquering other empires, these are just some of the powerful decisions and abilities you are able to wield as the leader of your people. you will watch the ascension of your meek, primitive people into what you aspire it to be. a powerful military empire? a technologically advanced society? a flourishing nation of arts and culture? will you be a tyrant? a philosopher? a diplomat? as the narrator states before each match, can you build a civilization to stand the test of time?",5
"this game is addicting, for the reasons that it pleases many audiences of even the most die-hard fps fans.",2
"a fantastically good buy if you are a fan of the civilization series. though it has some differences with previous instalments of the series, it is still a fun game to play. (though the barbarians are a pain in this version.)",1
"if you are into stragety games, this is the game for you really fun betraying your friends, and then crushing them >:)",1
"this game is an epic time devouring modern board game. the orginal civilization gameplay with the new features added by civ 5+ expansion packs gives all new experiences to the old skool world domination urge and lets you develop your empire in new and unique ways.",2
"its got swag! oh, and its an amazing strategy game that involves a lot planning what you will do in the future of the game.",1
"nice graphics, good gameplay. a nice, strategic game.",1
"100s of hours, if not 1000s of hours worth of gameplay",1
"as a monarch ruling under the divine right of kings, i must infallably declare, regardless of my spelling, that this game is very enjoyable. this is a fantastic game for anyone who is into stratagy games. however, i must say that diplomacy in this game is impossible. dont even try. trust no one. beware ghandi. dont blink. blink and youre dead. dont turn your back, dont look away, and dont blink. good luck.",2
"this is the best turn-based game that ive played. it has lots of civs with unique bonuses, good ais, multiple different ways to win, and good graphics. overall, its just about as good as it gets.",1
"be nice and make friends with everyone- spread culture with many wonders- be invaded by agressive warmonger warlord alpha ghandi- 10/10",1
"i really love this game. its great to play by yourself but is even better with friends. my reconmendation is to turn on miltary domination and go china with your friend as japan and dominate the whole world.",1
"civilization 5 is a great stragety game that can entertain for years. there are many things you can do in this game. i recommend it whole heartedly.",3
"the only strategy game i have the patience to play. xd very satisfying to win this game, and you cant quit it once youve gotten started.",1
"got the great library first. gave my friends crabs. 10/10",2
"it is no good without the dlc, if you are going to get gods and kings+brave new world, then go for it, otherwise, no.",1
"its good if you like to click next turn over and over!",1
"when i first got my hands on sid meiers civilization v, my life became a fight. i dont mean i was struggling to guide my civilisation to global renown, languidly picking my way up the research tree, sending little men to die in little wars. it wasnt that kind of fight. i mean i was fighting not to click the icon that led to the game that led without fail or mercy to me entering a kind of strategy fugue, which id emerge from, hungry and dehydrated, between three and seven hours later. to say this game is addictive is like saying that dry toast is edible. of course it is.",1
"i cannot recommend this game enough. no other game allows you to feel as powerful or amazing as this game. id recommend not having a job or anything though, it sucks time into it like a black hole.",3
"a brilliant strategy game for those who want to sit down for half an hour or those that want to sit down for hours on end. overall a really great game, great gameplay, great graphics, great everything. i would highly recommend this to anyone who is even remotely interested in strategy games.",1
"great game , online needs work especialy ability of a host to kick players in a game when hes losing",1
"an amazing game with little faults, sid meiers civilization v is a beautiful crossover of total war and age of empires. play as alexander the great, augustus ceizer or even napolean as you make your way to world peace or world domination! play as an ancient civilization and work you way up through eras which are different ages sorted with different technologies and items. as well as a historical game, civilization v is a strategy turn-based game completely mad on your choices! destroy the french, make peace with the chinese, eliminate the roamans, whatever you want! it also serves as a window to learning more about history, except in a really amusing way! i rate this 9/10 for its amazing gameplay and the re-playability.",1
"im in danger of failing my college classes becuase of this. 10/10",2
"great game if you dont have anything else to do for 14 hours...",1
"dont buy this game. while the price tag may say a monetary amount, it doesnt mention the cost of your social life. im trapped in this game, theres no escape. i cant even tell reality from civ anymore. was the sino-roman war even a real thing? help.",1
"this great game has lots to offer for a small package, i love the gameplah and mechanics. this game is exeddingly good for its price not to mention its preformance. i recondmend this game to anyone who is new to the civilization sereis or is an expereanced player. i give it a 9.5 out of 10.",1
"is a great game, do buy. but get the full edition on sale thats your best bet, ive bought this game three times because i didnt just buy the complete edition on steam the first time around.",1
"great game, 10/10 but fix the mother ing connection issues in multiplayer please!",1
"this is by far one of the best strategy games out there. i believe it is a huge improvement over civ 4. the dlc has touched most of what people had wrong with the game, however the best parts are some of those improvements over civ 4, such as no unit stacking.",1
"accidentally started a world war. consisted of around three nations (rome, byzantium, ethiopia) on my side and two on the other (egypt and germany) with a few neutral bigots watching the mayhem. after around twenty years of fighting germany was a skeleton of what it used to be and egypt frantically sending diplomats to reach a peace agreement as i sent my army and navy to enact a full-fledged invasion of the egyptian mainland. god, i love this game.",2
"with brave new world dlc, this game has truly became the god of turn-base strategy games. if you owned civ 5 already, bnw a must-have dlc. just imagine all your epic experinces playing civ 5 in the past, with this dlc you could easily multiply them by x10. this expansion basically fullfil 90% weakness that civ 5 ever had like boring peace-pursuit gameplay, buggy multiplyer gameplay, lame diplomacy etc. and add many more kick- features such as tourism, more policies, enhanced multiplayer mode, rebalance civils etc. go get it now, civ 5 owners!!!",2
"all i need now is a new alpha centauri game, and ill never have to buy another strategy game again.",2
"great game, but keep in mind youre going to look up and realize 12 hours has gone by and you are only half way done with a civ.",1
"definitely worth every penny... best turn-based strategy ive experienced",1
"this game turned me from an unrully chap to the most civilized dude in all of the northern territiries. highly recommended if you enjoy brewing shrooms in your morning tea.",1
"a fun and creative game that is great for any fan of strategy games. its lack of realism is compensated for by its amazing gameplay.",1
"this is definetly the best strategy game on steam. the sale i got it on let me buy the gold edition for $13. it was well-worth it. my friends kept pressuring me to buy, although, i was unimpressed at first while looking at the gameplay. i thought i would play it for 10 minutes and become bored. but man, was i wrong. the game has great replayability, and the critical thinking of whether you want to declare war, want peace, or trade among other empires. set up your cities with the right amount of troops, workers, and so on of what you please. the games are long and i have yet to take over the planet, but with the suspense of every turn makes you want to keep playing. this game lives up to any expectation of a strategy game.",1
"why are you reading the reviews and not already downloading the game!?",1
"sell the house. sell the car. sell the kids. find someone else. forget it. im never coming back. forget it.- typical civ player an hour after theyve started playing. this game will devour your time, and you will love every minute of it. buy it now.",1
"sid meiers civilization v: the only game that i can play for straight 12 hours. just, one more turn....",1
"civ is awesome please buy it i played it for hours today :d",2
"probably one of the best games ever made... too bad i cant actually play it because of crashes.",1
"a very addicting game. youll find yourself thinking just one more turn indeed... ...to the point of forgetting how much time passed. i found myself thinking this would have a very high learning curve, after hearing all the strategy needed to play a civilization game (this is the first in the civ series that ive played), but soon found out that its not so bad once you get the hang of the gameplay.",1
"ill just play a quick round of civ v 12 hours later where did the sun go? :",1
"the team at feraxis have really out done themselves with this amazingly designed time sink which will leave you telling yourself you must play for one more turn.",1
"one of my favourite games, have not been able to part with it since i bought the game. a real challenge on harder difficulties, with smart, aggresive ais snapping at your heels. never the same scenario twice. would reccomend to all.",2
"civilization is the only game i have been able to pick up and play at random times and then continue to play for days.",2
"it will consume your life and you will be glad it did.",1
"fantastic game. its a perfect mix of medieval/stone age strategy and modern/futuristic strategy. its a very well made game. anyone that likes strategy will like this game. its easy to learn but hard to master.",1
"after 200 hours of playtime in civ 5, im still playing the game a ton and enjoying it. this game has so much diversity and depth to it that you can immerse yourself in it for hours on end. this is arguably the best strategy game ever made and has a lot of replayability. i recommend this game to anyone and you can play multiplayer and enjoy the game with friends.",2
"best way to sit around and waist time, but be carefull, you might get a little mssed up in the head if you play it to much.",1
"an amazing game if you own the expansions. all of them. buy the complete edition or do not buy this game at all. but by far the best civ game once everything else is added.",2
"i have poured a lot of time into this game. it is a perfect game to play while doing something else, like homework, watching tv, or cooking. i imagine i will only stop playing this game when civ 6 comes out.",2
"classic game, can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time? 8/10",2
"this is an extremely fun game, however without the dlc and multiplayer it would be dreadedly boring!",1
"get this game. even if youre not into strategy games, theres something youll enjoy here. its addictive. this and civ 3 are the only games ive played recently where i completely lost track of time for hours on end. theres always something for you to do, and if you somehow get bored with the base game, there are lots of mods for it that add new units, civilizations, scenarios, and even total conversions for various fictional universes, like the future mod and the middle earth mod. at $12.50, its definitely worth it.",1
"good game, played it a bit... stopped because exams xd",1
"ive played it 400+ hours. what more to say? its worth all its dollars, euros and pounds!",3
"with g&k and bnw finally best title in civilization franchise. highly recommended!",1
"this game behaves just like women do: you have to wait for ages, and when it comes to multiplayer-action; the answer is no.",1
"good game. just needs the multiplayer to be fixed thou.",2
"another great civ game from firaxis, sure to keep you busy for years to come. some good improvements over civ 4 while remaining faithful to core civ mechanics.",3
"with intriguing, self-presented stories and endless possibilities in an infinite number of worlds, civilization v is quite simply one of the most fun, interesting and addictive games i have ever played.",1
"amazing game, especially with friends. 10 out of 10. would play again.",1
"best game ever..................if youve got all day with nothing to do... :p",3
"the reasons to play any other game besides this one are very few indeed.",2
"sid meiers civiliation? the hell is that. its a bunch of contrys you can choose from. and you progress by makeing treedies with other (mpcs) (or real players) contrys to fight in war to win. to win you either have to take over every contry, get to the moon. im sure theres other ways but im not positive on everyone. i recomend this game for these reasons",1
"never spent so much time on a game in my life. lost my girlfreind and my gpa dropped 2.5 points. stayed up too late and slept in, then missed my flight to participate in the olympics. ruined my life and future. 10/10",2
"370 hours logged and still not bored of this game. its just such a masterpiece.",4
"the civilization series is one of the best series ever. great diversity, great slighty changing ais, great gameplay all makes for hours and hours of re-playability. plus ghandi will try to nuke you!",2
"i was one of /those/ guys who preordered this ages ago with a deluxe edition. now that steams had a sale, other people /finally/ have it, and i can say i played for fourteen hours and a half continuously with a friend. if your time is valuable, just dont ask people to play with you, and youll be okay. otherwise, this can be really fun, if bloody long about it.",1
"excellent game to pass the time. takes great strategical skill for the harder difficulties. choice game.",1
"you die a hero or you live long enough to become a villain",2
"this game is dangerously addictive. i really dont want to recommend this game but i have had some great moments whilst playing it. the early game is really engrossing. mid game a bit of a muddle late game a bit of a chore. but you will find that you consume yourself and your time learning the mechanics of the game only to discover that you are ultimately micro managing several sets of numbers. (hammers, beakers, etc..) trying to increase them bit by bit. 169.3 hour on civ 5 and that is nothing compared to others. life it too short for a game like this.",1
"do not buy this game if you like having free time. its not a game one simply picks up for an hour or so. it is the video game equivalent of heroin: it will suck away hours of your life at a time, leaving you in a stupor afterwards, thinking only about when you can boot it up next and finally knock off that a-hole suleiman for good. its terrible but, its so, so good.",2
"one of the best strategy game ive play. the game takes a long time to play but is still fun all the way through. i will be putting a lot of hours toward this game and could easily be come one of my most played games on steam. the fact that the game also now works on linux makes it even better.",1
"its an amazing game, with so many mods to play with, 10/10",1
"really awesome game reccomend it just could not stop playing it",1
"one of the best strategy games to date. definitely a classic",1
"woah, i played that for 300 hours? ive been in comas shorter than that",2
"one last turn! fans of the civlization franchise have been screaming since the series inception and civ v is no exception. with many mechanics being overhauled and refined, every bit of the game is even better than the predecessor. fan or not you must check out this game, for it will consume your life (in the best way possible of course).",1
"<----------- look at that snakes mouth scary, just like how scary good civ v is",1
"excelent game in the series, my favorite since call to power. the game complexity is such charming, and youll hardly find any comprehensive material about it. most of times, youll just need to learn on your own. hex tiles and non-stacking military units resulted in a very strategical militar combat planning, as opposed to the death stcks of the game predecessors. graphics are just gorgeous. sometimes you want to go to war just to watch some swords swinging. soundtracks as always are excelent and immersive. infinite city spawn is sadly still a problem, but much better than the other games in the series. recommended!",1
"awesome strategy game that is great for the pros and the beginners.",1
"undoubtedly my favorite game of all time, so i guess its fitting i write a review. civilization v is the perfect game for you if you take pride in accomplishing long term goals, want action and suspense without the need to be constantly at the computer like in a fps or rts, or else want to blow a third world country to the ground with nuclear weapons before coming in with giant death robots to finish the job. or you could make paintings. you decide. thats really the beauty of the game, you can choose your path and every game is different from the last.",3
"slow, strategic, gameplay about building a new civilization (not customizable) in a world. history is remade each time you start a new game. unfortunately, ai is bad, and a feature i found on civilization iv which i expected to have in this game is not here. wish when a player disconnects, we could vote again to either wait for the play, save and continue, or save and quit.",2
"never got those 2d virgin waifus i was promised for getting this...",1
"this is a great game i never play. one more to add to the list.",4
"i highly recommend this game besides the fact that their is blatently no support for errors in this master piece of a rts",2
"great tbs. the best around... mods for it are good and supported.",1
"this is a great game, civ. v is bacically a mix of risk and settlers on steroids.",1
"this is the game that i go to, when i dont know what to play. the rule set has been changing with each dlc. and while it is a relearning process, i think that is what i like about the game.",5
"one of the best strategy games ever. epic gameplay and detail. very deep game. does take some time to understand though as it is a extremely complex game. extremely intense. a game that could be put up for 100$. youre missing out on your life if you dont play this.",1
"awesome game if you have the time, this is arguably the urn based strategy to get and it is my most played steam game even though im more of an fps kind of guy. will definitely find a place in your top games list.",2
"but did you get brave new world? did you? go get it! now!",2
"great game, just get the whole package with dlcs, which isnt really hard because every now and then its on sale. did i mention that poland can into space ?! seriously this game is really addictive. i love it!",2
"brilliant strategy game. surprisingly fun and startlingly addictive.",1
"great game. however, dont play without a clock because you will lose track of time.",1
"an huge and epic piece of round based strategy. in this game you start of with an ancient civilzation and develop it further and further, until you reach the modern times or even the future. i personally find this game very addicting and lots of fun.",1
"one of the best stategy games i have ever played :d",1
"very fun, and challenging. especially deity, which gives everyone a goal to reach.",1
"oh man. 10/10 soon ill nuke england. gg washington founded buddhism.",1
"patch released after 2 years to fix bug makes multiplayer unplayable. gg firaxes.",1
"if you dont have much free time do not buy this game. it will ruin your life. it will be 3 am, you desperately need to sleep and all youll think about is: just one more turn. this game is perfect. its like merging chess with history. absolutely amazing! i was kidding, by all means buy this!",1
"you time travel with this game. started playing it and hours disappeared off the clock like they were minutes with the just one more turn mentality. super addiciting.",1
"always a great game to play to pass time and conquor the world!",1
"love this game, the xcom soldiers feel like cheating though.",1
"absolutely amazing strongly recommend with all dlcs",1
"the base game is a little weak compared to civ 4. with both major pieces of dlc (gods and kings, brave new world) however, civ 5 is the best in the series. the playable civilisations are very varied, the diplomacy and faith systems are solid. city-states add an extra element of risk/reward and trade routes are very lucrative. multiple play styles are viable game winners and fun. the only real negative is the high cost of the dlc. overall the game is fantastic and offers huge replayability. a must have for fans of the civilization series and 4x strategy in general.",2
"holy crap this game is amazing. i recommend this to everyone especially for those who think they do not like tur based games. serioulsy i thought i hated turn based games, but after playing this i am questioning my true purpose and life in general. get it now what are you waiting for?",1
"buy this! its the best! ever! buy this then buy brave new world!",2
"awesome game! i play it all the time and it is an amazing pass-time for college. i cant afford all of the dlc, but im saving up for it, ive heard that its a complete game changer!",2
"i love this game but i suspect it may be a time machine. i have started many a game before bed and before i even have the chance to notice it is already morning.",1
"defeat the iroquis nation in china as russia based in australia but watch out for ghandis nukes.",2
"i have been playing civilization games for a long time, and am very impressed with this version. i have played many hours and enjoy it every time i play it. i would highly recommend this game to anyone.",1
"while civilization v introduces a whole new hexagonal/no-unit-stacking system which may alienate some of the veterans of earlier civ games, the shift also introduces a new challenge for these veterans to master. getting the gods & kings add-on also brings a revamped religion aspect to the game, as well as a whole new batch of civilizations to master. join the fray with your favorite.",1
"great for people who play table-top strategy games like warhammer",1
"it is a really great game and i love it but i was looking at dlcs and i found the packet for 50$ (american) and i got so mad at myself because i realized that there was the packet i could have bought instead so pretty much wasted 30 dollars on the basic game when i could have bought the packet. so this is more to the owners of steam to make something where you can return a game and get your money back. if there is please email me to tell me where it is so i can get the packet instead of buying the packet on top of the basic game i have already downloaded. please",1
"brilliant. best with expansions. best. game. ever.",3
"if you are looking for a relaxing, turn-based, high replay value, time eating game then you have come to the right place. just one more turn.",1
"amazing game. never ceases to show me new ways to play. just watch who you play with. if one of your friends seem like a power hungry, violent , dont play with them.",1
"ghandi was an early friend of mine.. who turned on me and demanded gold, denounced me to all when i denied him the gift, and nuked my cities. ghandi was a real . wurf.",1
"this game is fantastic. i love the new hex tiles, it makes if feel like the settlers of katan board game.also the fact there can only be one military and one civilian unit per tile is great. i play coop with my friends all the time.",1
"a good game to build strategy and learn of some historical figures.",1
"oh civilization v....theres too much to say honestly. if youve played the board game risk before, this is a much more detailed version of that with options other than military domination to lead to victory. if you havent played risk, then this is more like a very complicated version of chess where what you do off the chess board matters too. and if you havent played either of those...this game probably isnt for you. civilization v is a turn-based strategy game at its core, and it is damn good at what it does. however, i do not personally reccommend to purchase this without its dlc bundle, as the main game by itself, doesnt have quite the kick and a lot changes with the dlc additions. i give this game a 9 / 10. definitely worth the pick up if you like strategy or turn-based games.",1
"you need to understand that when i recommend this game, i do it as one recommends heroin. dont let the hours logged fool you, i have another 150 offline at the bare minimum. this is one of those games where you dont stop playing once youve started, the turns are so deliberate, one miscalculation can cost you anything in this tense, albeit slow-paced game. this game can ruin your life if you let it, but it fills that gaping hole in your heart that the death of board games like risk has left.",2
"this game will consume a good chunk of your life. you will constantly find yourself itching for just one more turn and then the next thing you know, 3 days have gone by.",1
"want your weekend to go by in a flash? then this is the game for you. once you play civ 5 you cant put it down.",1
"i just created mulans alternate ending playing as the huns. cant make a man outta you anymore.",1
"pretty fun game so long as you play singleplayer. multiplayer is horribly boring and filled with glitches.",1
"always come back to this, game just satisfies on all levels",5
"very good and interesting game! played out-of-the-box for about three hours before i bought the gold upgrade in the steam sale. although once your civilization gets huge it can get slightly boring it has amazing graphics, especially when you talk to other rulers.",1
"this is the game of realism. prepare to get nuked by ghandi, owned by barbarians on the year 1890 and be friends with russia.",2
"this is a good game but sooo much dlc.... they want all our money",5
"i would reccomend this game purely because its a good brain thinking stratagy game that really gets you thinking.",1
"an amazing 4x strategy game that anyone who likes the genre ghould get.",1
"as a new civ player, i must say that i used to hate this type of strategy games (turn based) and considered my self an rts player instead. now that i tried civ 5, i must say that im hooked to the game and its innovative mechanics. playing against the ai is alaways fun, and the multiplayer experience is fantastic. the amount of customisations you can do to the game is great, especially with the addition of community content. the sound track is brilliant and the options menu has way more options than you could possibly need to tweak. if you are considering giving turn based strategy a go, i defiently recommend this game.",1
"so good, but if you have a friend or two to play it with it becomes ten times better!",2
"no other game quite matches civilization for the level of revilement and repulsion instilled in my partner whenever i play it. i say, one more turn, aware of the damage my lies will cause. she will say, ill leave you! ill call her bluff and hold out my non-dominant hand, looking away from the screen only between turns. shell plead, at least eat something! ill devour whatever meagre portion of food she gives me. assignments become secondary. work becomes secondary. life becomes secondary. holding your bladder for 15 straight hours isnt normal, on civilization it is. 10/10 would destroy life again.",2
"i was incredibly sceptical about this game, being a long time total war player, i didnt know if i was going to be able to adapt to civilizations style of gameplay. but boy was i wrong. civilization 5 is absolutely entralling. the ability to carve out your own story, without any restrictions, and build a vast empire over a beautifully design map is more than enough to entice the most stubborn of rts fans who have refused to move away from their own beloved strategy game. a must own for all strategy fans. 10/10",1
"played as gandhi,ruled the world with nukes. so much for being a pacifist....",1
"just....one....more....turn. seriously dont expect to get any sleep. you will stay up all night trying to crush every one else on the planet.",1
"a really good game, however ive noticed if i dont quick save after a certain amount of time it shuts down on me for no reason.",1
"greece put a city right next to mine so i nuked it then ghandi nuked me, causing a world wide nuclear war where nothing remained but yellow nuclear clouds. then i spent 5 hours scrubbing it with a broom. great simulation",2
"this game is sick. its fun if you need something that takes time and practice to play. you wont be an expert over night, but youll love it either way.",1
"i played this game for over 300 hours. if you like stratigy games, this is the one for you. 345 game hours and i still get fun out of it. millions of achievements and cards(if you collect those) it is worth every penny.",2
"very addictive, if you are free from midnight to 6 in the morning then buy.",1
"go playing this game if you dont know how to waste your time. ps if you love str games.",1
"dont worry, you can always eat/sleep/socialize right after you finish this turn... or after this turn.... okay, after... well, you get the idea. its addicting and time consuming...",1
"an awesome strategy game to play with friends or by yourself. either way youll say im getting off after the next turn but youll still be playing for 100 more. great game cant wait for the next installment!",1
"you want to recreate hitlers regime? maybe become the next stalin? how bout bending queen elizibeth over and ing her in the  with your nuclear diplomacy? civ v is for you.",1
"as someone who is no fan of the other civ games, i went into this with no expectations for enjoyment. i was so wrong! great game and with gods and brave new world it is fully featured to make even the critics enjoy it. just one warning. do not start a game at night, you will not be going to bed if you do!",1
"heyho lets spend like two weeks on one multiplayer session... lets do this yo!",1
"i love this game, but fair warning, its addictive as all get-out",1
"civilization v is a turn based strategy game in which you control a single civilization, competing against other civilizations to win the game. these civilizations are controlled by either the ai or a human player. to win the game you need to acheive one of 4 victorys, domination victory, culture victory, science victory or a score victory. this game has endless replayability which will keep you hooked for many, many hours in which you will never get bored. singleplayer is exellent, multiplayer is flawless and the game gets even better with the expansion packs ! also lots of support from the steam workshop. to sum it up civilization v is a amazing game is by far the best game i own and i would reccomend it to anyone. it is definatly worth the money even the expansion packs (would reccomend buying gold edition). rating: 10/10",2
"broke, buggy, and simply not any fun to play. stick to civ iv - a far superior game in every way. theres nothing redeeming about civ v and i really wish that i hadnt purchased it. i really dont know why magazines gave it such incredible reviews. i really wanted to like this game, having been a fan of the series since i had civ i on a floppy disk - and i gave this game plenty of time for patches, fixes, and gameplay updates and it still stinks. i wont be reinstalling it.",1
"hands down on of the most effective turn-based games ive played in a long time. only downside is in large player matches...fighting against other people eats up a serious amount of time.",2
"i want a new settlement here. but that land has no economic or strategic value! it will once we have fertilizer and artillary! artillery, sir?",3
"i secound the people who say just one more turn... but be wary, it might not work 100% of the time (but it does work)",1
"this game is probably the best turn-based strategy game out there. it is best with all dlcs and expansions. there are many different options when it comes to leaders and strategies to achieve whatever victory you want. the multiplayer is also very good.",1
"i love this game! its easy to approach but hard to master, its thematic, the replayability is great as you branching paths and policy trees can be varied from the very start. striving to get the best, most successful historical civilization is truly addictive!",1
"i love this game -ghandi conquered the whole roman empire -ghandi nuked the life out of me -ghandi defeated a whole load of my samouri i also love that russia gets double the uranium and that there are so many ways to win",2
"planning on getting anything productive done today? nope 10/10",1
"i looooove this game! definitely get it, youll get hours of play.",1
"well worth the price. ive already gotten my moneys worth from this game and am nowhere near done playing it, i forsee dropping over 1000 hours in this game.",1
"ghandi has completed the manhattan project f_ck ghandi has demounced you! f_ckfu_kfuc_ ghandi has declared war on you! r.i.p. 5/5",1
"best rts game ever. first one ive played was tzar, and that was a long time ago. this is so much better. 5 stars",1
"never played a civ game before i played this one and it is a lot of fun. even without the dlc i played about 40 hours and with the expansions it is even more addicting. i bought it when it was on sale, but its definitely worth full price.",2
"good game if you like strategy... unlike most historical strategy games, war is not the priority (unless you go to a domination victory). this game is very random, you can discover the newest technologies with iroquois or babylons, or start in ancient era with america. i reccomend. 9/10",1
"being the first game i ever played in the civilization line, i have to say its really fun. it is long and sometimes can be quite fatigueing, but all in all i very much enjoy the gameplay. it could have more keyboards shortcuts, and ill admit sitting around waiting for things to get done does get tedious and boring. but the payoff in the end is quite satisfactory. i recomment getting the gold edition of this game, its worth it just so you dont have to do all that clicking.",1
"brilliantly designed game with a great multiplayer feature and, while heavy, the game barely every crashes or stops responding. i highly recommend it, but only if you have some friends to play it with. theres no problem with the singleplayer, but it gets boring after a while and i rarely finish a single player game because they take forever and you lose interest around half-way through. still a great game, and sid meier is held very highly in appreciation for this series.",5
"turn based perfection. the house that sid meier built does it every time. creating a civilization and building it through the ages one hex at a time. a+",1
"great strategy game that lets you finally lets you take over the world with ethiopia",2
"civilization 5 is a very good game, no doubt, but there were some flaws that made it not as the first game, civilization revelution.",1
"this is a really well put together game. the actual play is simple, though the strategy is deep. the work they put into the game shows, even down to the tiny details. for new players, the biggest challenge can be learning about all the different units, how some of the resorces affect things, but after playing a game or two you get the hang of it. it is also a good game to play with friends. i also like how you can win by using other methods then conquest like most strategy games.",1
"finally a game that lets me mold ghandi into the masochistic warrior i always knew he wanted to be. 10/10",2
"this game along with civ iv, has taken hudnreds of my gaming hours. if you like strategy games, and dont mind long games, try this game out. now be warned, if you plan on buying civ v, buy the two expansions! they add much needed mechanics that the devs forgot to put in civ v (unfortunately). but once you add the xpacks, this game will take many hours form you too! the game revolves around taking a control of a civilization (from nations like ashurbanipal of assyria all the way to napoleon of france) and, beginning at 4000 bc, you lead it all the way to the future age. you build, expand, and develop cities, and create alternate histories where the americans built the pyramids. i recommend this game to anyone willing to spend countless hours, but it is defiitely worth it!",2
"some would argue that civ v dumbed things down from civ iv. i would argue the opposite - iv had overcomplicated the genre, and i think v has brought back the accessibility of the franchise, whilst stepping up the graphics and ai. one of my favourite games.",4
"an entertaining and addictive empire building game - one turn at a time.",1
"11 hour game of domination to conquer the world, ended up losing a 1v1 against gandhi because he had an army of giant death robots. 11/10",1
"a really good game to buy if you like strategic games .",1
"bestest game ever. get ready to lose all sense of reality and gain lots of awesomeness and fun when you press play now. :) oh, and be weary of that gandhi chap...",5
"ever wanted to rule an empire? ever wanted to burn one? have you ever simply wanted to know what would happen if a massive ancient empire faught a small one wiht a nuke? civ will answer all these questions and more, and although i personally believe its slightly light on the diplomatic side of rulling an empire (sadly dont expect to hiring any assassins) the biggest draw is by far the history for me. any fan of history will love this game, and remember, a great empire, just like a great cake, is easily diminished at the edges (benjamin franklin)",1
"very fun game. many different playstyles to choose from, and a lot of civilizations to chose, and rule with. also great mods out there.",1
"your girlfriends younger, stupider sister. in the right light though... damn!",4
"the game heavily relies on strategy, and is not for the truly devoted. a game can take hours at a time, and it is absolutely fantastic!",1
"i reccomend playing this before bed and studying, it helps you concentrate.",1
"im nowhere near a big fan of strategy games, real time or turn-based, and cant really say im a big fan of any...except this series, which i adore, and this game is no exception. difficulty levels go from 1(tutorial level difficulty here) to 9(i barely won a single game at 5), so anyone can find their sweet spot. if you do not have any interest in history i can almsot guarentee that this game will change that. so many quotes by famous people in history, many leaders and civs to choose from, units go from men with stones tied to stick to the kind of warfare we have now (with a single unit that goes beyond), multiple ways to win...there is a ludicrious amount of content in this game. if you are any sort of fan of history or strategy games or simply just good games, you will get a lot of enjoyment out of this.",5
"what can i say so late about this game that most people have coverd besides me recommending it myself to someone. this game is not to be messed with it will fill your gaming life with hours of fun deserves more attention because its one of the greatest ive played besides a whole list of games out there well worth the hours of your life let alone your cash.",2
"aside from getting nuked by gandhi and getting indoctrinated by the rambo enemy missionaries, this game is more than worth its money.if you dig strategy games and have plenty of time on your hands to build your own empire from scratch on a world stage, then this is for you. only real complaint are the prices on the dlc-s, but thats just my opinion. 9.5/10",2
"love this game! its a must buy! the expansions add so much more and it is an amazing game! 10000000 out of 10",3
"ive played strategy games my whole life and this is the most complete game out there. replay value is very high, pro tip - save often...",1
"fun game. a strategy with a turn based system, gamers that enjoy slower pace should go for this game. 8/10",2
"hands down the best strategy dame to date, especially when you have both expansion packs. brave new world adds mind boggling diplomacy and trade features that make this game top notch.",1
"great game, prepare to lose many hours of your life with it.",1
"i absolutely love this game. if you like turn based strategy games, this is absolutely necessary to your virtual collection!",2
"its the newest version of civ. cant really go wrong. this one is more streamlined for new players, but keeps the core gameplay of the previous games.",1
"absolutely love this game! even better with mods that increase additions in-game i.e wonders,buildings,units etc dlc for it is an absolute must to really appreciate the full extent but also great without!",1
"this is one jewel of a game. this has to be the greatest kingdom managing sim out there, if you get the expansion packs then it is the best. i wish it had most of the expansion pack fetures at start, and that kinda feels like a money grab. but the money is worth it.",1
"super fun game to play. time goes by fast when its you and friends playing with or against each other. a must have for anyone who likes this type of game!",1
"one of the best games ive ever plyed, very relaxing and fun",2
"stupid ai cheats, just like in the earlier games. frustrating to the point of screaming. and still, just ... on... more... turn ;)",1
"really fun game for war strategy and on top of that it gives alot of interesting facts from that time",1
"ive loved every civilization game since i played civilization iii way back in the day. the scope of these games has always impressed me, and civ 5 does not disappoint in this regard. some die hard civ players were taken aback from the hex-combat mechanic of the game, but personally, i think that the change was a step in the right direction, making me not dread waging war with my neighbors (which in previous civ games always felt like a chore.) the base game is fun, but ive found that the two major expansions really have improved the experience (gods and kings and brave new world). brave new world, especially, is an excellent addition to the cultural victory scenarios. civ 5 is the most played game in my small steam collection, and with the wide array of mods and community support, it will probably stay that way for years to come.",2
"it is just to good! i bought it last weekend and already have 30 hours in it. if u can buy this game",1
"build an empire and rule the world... or get destroyed by barbarians",1
"another installment in a series of good games, not only keepign with the same theme but improving some aspects of the gameplay itself.",1
"started from the bottom now im here.. get the  away from me you mothering queer. actually the game is quite fun and its a lot of fun to start from nothing and then take over other civilizations only to be denounced and called a liar and a betrayer, but all is worth when you win the game.",4
"say goodbye to your social life and/or your sleep.",2
"very nice game i am not good at it but i enjoyed it a lot buy it you wont hate it you will love it.",1
"great game with a lot of content and diverse strategies. great for playing with friends. it is very time consuming.",3
"this game is amazing, it is fun alone and amazing with friends. :)",2
"now, im not into drugs - neither as a dealer or a user, but if i was going to compare how it feels to play this game to anything under the sun, it would be a substance called crack cocaine. its heavily addictive, it can keep you up until the early hours of the morning on a high, and of course an overdose can be fatal. in a best case scenario itll be 5am, your 230th turn. youll be in a cold sweat, your heart pounding. your blood vessels clutch tighter than a jews wallet. you hear a knock at the door - its your damn wife. please, come to bed she begs from behind you. you slowly swivel your gaming chair to look at her straight in the eyes, vacant and withdrawn and whisper ...no. she then moves out to live with her mother and leaves you with the god damn kids and a hefty pile of divorce papers. who needs her? youve got civ 5!",1
"gets a bad rep, though not always unwarranted. that said, the latest expansion makes it significantly more playable, and i cant go back to stacks of doom.",1
"now with the release of brave new world i can confidently recommend this game as the go to civilization experience. the systems are inuitive but deep and the gameplay is the same addictive stuff youve come to expect from the series. long live the hex grid!",1
"i love this one over all the rest, you cannot just stack your troops into an unstoppable one tile wide army, you have to use strategy. that being the main difference in the game, the rest is all civilization, boot it up and kiss the next 24 hours goodbye as you time travel.",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. even better with dlc.",3
"cant say this is the best civ, but it certainly is nice for beginner players and for veterans of the series (like myself) this civ is very releaxed and easy to play. the rule changes in it are mostly well done and the depth is great. one of the best turn based games. 95%",1
"this game has destroyed my social life and caused my friends to alienate me. 10/10",1
"i didnt get alot of time to try everything in this game ! but i can tell , this game rocks",1
"this is the best turn-based strategy game i have ever played. pros: beautifully crafted game with lots of depth to it. cons: complex and hard to learn.",1
"over 300 hours playing this game and i still have only seen a portion of the content available. the best turn based, 4x strategy game i have ever played. the expansions are a must as they are literally game changers.",2
"probably one of my favorite games. makes me feel . in a good way.",2
"this game is great, a turn based hex game. you can nuke the whole world, make them succumb to your religion, make them pay you tribute, and much more! totally worth it!",1
"great game well built even if the sequel has come out this game has its perks",2
"absolutely addictive, as deep as the ocean if you want it to be, but accessible even for casual gamers.",1
"i used to be heavily addicted to this game, and i probably still am. real strategic, and its hella fun.",1
"one of my favorite games of all times, it can be equally realistic and ridiculous and is a definite must buy! i have become a little obsessed with the game and i have hundreds of hours of playtime and have still only scratched the surface of what i can do, and what civs i can play as. you can spend hours developing strategies and plans for the ultimate empire, or just dont give a care and nuke everybody. in my time in civ i have been able to: -take over the world as the might warlord ghandi -get my butt kicked by siam within 20 turns -watch the babylonians burn after they dared to defile me -say that ill only play for 2 more turns and end up playing another 200",4
"vary solid game but ends up dragging on in the latter stages of the game plus it seems majority of all the ai civs are overly aggressive and science victory feels the only way to go. 8.5/10 would bang",1
"run the civilizations! its the best! especially if you like seeing ghandi beat george washington with a rock tied to a stick!",1
"one of my favorite games of all time. this is uber perfect. no harsh violence, and you have to think in order to win.",1
"submit your life to the all powerful next turn button. you will never go outside again.",1
"one of the most enjoyable games i have ever played, turn based strategy at its finest",3
"would gift gandhi giant death robots for world domination again 11/10 please, just dont nuke me gandhi.",1
"the game is well made and a lot of fun, however, it has to be said that although its a very good game, of the 200+ hours i currently have spent in the game, about 27 seconds have been in a multplayer where nothing went wrong, if intending to play with friends, please be aware that although possible, it will almost certainly cause problems.",2
"if youre looking for a stratagy game, you came to the right place. civs easy-to-learn hard-to-master controls and mechanics make it one of my favorite stratagy games. i honestly did not expect to enjoy this game as much as i have. the ai is clever and unexpected, the gameplay is fun, especially in single player, and multiplayer is... mostly stable. the game does sometimes randomly disconnect you from games, however its not too difficult to just reconnect. also, in multiplayer turns can go on for quite a while, especially considering some players have more to do than others, so sometimes you end up sitting around doing nothing, however this is a problem with most/all turn based games. all problems aside, its a great stratagy game.",1
"the games great when you are able to get into a position of having a sustainable civilization. however, getting to that point is made borderline impossible considering the ai declares and seemingly keeps a perpetual war going. or, theres the occasional bad luck of getting placed in a very difficult if not impossible part of the world to develop in. these two flaws go hand in hand. all things considered, i like the game but i cant give a good recommendation if one cant even get to a point in which they can actually play the game past the medieval era. sorry.",1
"this is my favorite strategy game on pc. highly recommended!",1
"all the years of playing civ and i still enjoy this game more than i should....",1
"massive. amazing. simply... exceptional. wait, just one more turn.. 9.4/10 ~ curious cat",1
"i get to play germany and create world war 3! this is an epic turn based game and i love to play this in my spare time! i highly reccomend that people buy this game!",1
"it can be a bit frustrating at first when you dont know how to play but after awhile it gets really fun. and even more fun with friends.",1
"built broadway and sydney opera house as england. 10/10",1
"civilization is, by far, the greatest strategy franchise of all time! and civ 5 just adds to the greatness of the franchise. i highly recommend this game, but be prepared to lose a big chunk of your life, because i know youll be hooked.",1
"awesome game! the single player mode is flawless and the bnw expanison pack gives cultural victories more interesting. one major flaw is the multiplayer. the game tends to truggle towards the mid/late game period. player discconnect more often the longer the games goes on and it makes it very hard to complete a full game. however still and amazing game.",2
"this game is amazing esp when playing with friends. will be buying the next installment of the series.",1
"i need to go outside at some point. destroyed my social life and my view of gandhi. 10/10.",1
"i try not to play this game very much....because once i start, i end up one more turning until the sun comes up >.<",1
"this game is probably by far one of the best stratagy game i have played. playing multiplayer is wonderful especially if you have some friends to play it with and it allows you to meet new people that obviousely like the same game as you. i would recomend this game to any person that loves a good strategy game. hence why im trying to convert as many people as i can to this game. have fun!!!!!",2
"its so simple but intricate, its amazing.... if youre an rts guy/girl, get this game! also bnw is really good if anyone says it sucks theyre wrong",1
"this game is just great, and i havent even played it against other people yet.",1
"sid meiers civilization v really changed my opinion about strategy simulation games. this game is very diverse and no two games are alike. you start out as a civilization with one city and you slowly build your way up to be the dominator, the diplomatic leader, or the first to finish the space race. not only all this but it is historically accurate!",1
"i have been playing civ since civ2:tot. tot still remains my favorite as far as interesting game modes and simple mechanics. civ 5 is no louse though. i love to complicated ways i have to work and the mods are absolutely a blast to use and give me back the civ 4 and 3 experience.",4
"you down for some boiling rage? uncontrollable yelling? mistrust of your friends? then definitely buy and play multiplayer civ v. youll hours and days and not even noticed!",1
"a wonderful game, just make sure you have the patience to get to the end for the real fun to begin!",1
"100% addictive. you keep telling yourself one more turn, just one more turn... and then you realise it has been three hour since you said that. oops. if you like strategy based games, turn-based games, or even just want to relax with a conquest game, this is completely and totally worth it.",1
"amazing strategy game. cant describe how much fun you can have and how well thought the game is all around.",1
"this game is very fun and i love to play it with my friends",1
"awsome game!!! been playing since it started and always well worth while!",1
"had this game for a while, a long while, but ive never sat down and written a review for it. until now. if you like turn-based games, then you will love this game. its not as in-depth as it could be, but it is fantastic all the same. get the complete edition, vanilla is ok but each expansion pack does a lot to make it even better. take it from a guy who has spent almost a month of his life playing this game, civ v was and is the best purchase i have ever made. one final thing, the ai in this game is not all that great, but i think its still playable in singelplayer.but the game is easily one of the most addicting games i have ever played, so word of warning: this game will consume your life. you have been warned.",4
"civ 5 is a game which there is much fun to be had. you can easily get 70+ hours with this game. 10/10 must buy",1
"awesome game if you like the civ series :) enough said",1
"you like good turn-based games? you prefer staying at the computer all day? well, civilization v is your choise now +good gameplay +pretty cheap now +add-ons are really cool! new civilizations and game mods are included. expansion packs offer a variety of new features +multiplayer (players vs players or players vs bots etc.) -expansion packs are much more expensive than the game -civilization v without add-ons becomes boring very quickly so if you have some spare time and 2-3 friends playing this game -buy it!",1
"great turn based game taking the time to invest into it, and checking out the comminuty workshop etc makes this a game you should play seriously atleast once then all the fun can happen afterwards great single player, with or without add ons and additions, multiplayer can be fun but prepare to spend alot of time playing it, especially if you choose a slow game pace with 8 players...could be loading and saving the game for months great game though",2
"bought this in the sale as to, essentially, go back to my childhood of playing it with my uncle and dad for hours on end. bought back all my love for the series, sat and played it for nearly 4 hours instead of going to bed (aka between 2 in the morning and 6 in the morning) would recommend this game (any game in the series especially tot) to anyone whos an old hand at stratergy games and even those that are interested by the genre but never played any of this kind of game before :)",1
"great game and totally addicting... has an almost perfect multiplayer, and of course - an immersive and unbelievable singleplayer... the modding community is tremendous... words cant suffice the awesome experiece....",1
"pyramids in the water. hanging gardens in the desert. launching spacecrafts while everyone else is figuring out how to build a working tank. being able to choose between diplomatic, science and cultural victories within turns if each other because of very favourable conditions. how many weekends have i lost to this game? i lost count.",1
"i have been a long time fan of the civilization series, and this game manages to retain the original style and idea of the series while improving on the games design. it is a beautiful game and would recommend it to anybody who doesnt mind using their brain a little bit.",1
"ive played civ5 since i joined steam and played it for over 420+ hours. it was worth every second. most dlc is worth purchasing when on sale. the actual gameplay is awesome! you can be a warmongerous, scientific, political, religous or culture based civilization, or mix of all! plenty of civilizations and units to choose from especially in the dlcs and expansion packs. the workshop and mods for this game is one of the best in a game i have seen. a bit on the expensive side especially considering in civ4 all of the features that were realesed as dlc for civ5 were already included in civ4. graphics are beautiful, gameplay is fun and challenging, steam trading cards and achievments. as well as a brilliant modding community. 9.5/10",3
"truly amazing! the first time i played this game i did not stop playing for 6 hours straight and by then it was 2 a.m. i recommend this game to casual and veteran stratagists alike.",1
"fun but challenging, lots of open worlds to explore and good graphics!",1
"turns out gandhi can make nukes in the 1500s. overall 10/10 great game.",1
"fantastic both as single and multiplayer, so many civilizations for infinite replayabilty, definitely would recommend.",2
"800h +... the trouble is, we think we have time b. (_)",4
"nearly perfect! but you need all the dlc to get the most out of it.",1
"before playing this game, my swag percentage was around 63%. after experiencing this icly sexy masterpiece of strategy gaming, my swag percentage reached the new height of 92%.",1
"addictive as hell. just one more turn. worth getting the expansions.",1
"its a time machine. just one turn since call to power.",2
"sid meiers civilization v is a great game filled with hours apon hours of entertainment. civ v is a turn baised strategy game, it involves skill, knowlage and commitment its also a great game to play with friends. some of my favorite things about this game is the strategy behind it and the mods made by the community. i would also recommend the dlc for this game, the dlc adds a lot of fixes and new mechanics. enjoy - millerman",2
"fantastic game, better with the expansions. so fun to play.",1
"being a fan of all the civ games (i havent tried beyond earth though) civ 5 is one of the best. it does so many things right that when i went back to play civ 4 i couldnt. wars feel important now, and not something you rush into causre you just want everyone dead. at first i didnt like the removale of stacks but i soon liked it. sieges are now.... sieges. they arent my army is bigger so i win. the modding community is so good here. i can play a game where an alliance of lenin, twillight, and pinkie pie have a nuclear war with margret thatcher and fredrick the great. i so highly recommend this",3
"games are long, but fun. multiplayer has some issues, but mostly due to just people quitting the match early.",1
"fantastic game. offers hours of game play and makes time fly by.",1
"like the previous civ games only improved by more dlc and game options",2
"if you have the money o buy the complete edition (with all dlcs and such) its really worthy.",1
"awesome addicting turn based strategy game that everyone should play at least one time in there lifetime. highly recommended.",2
"if you want to rule the world,and raise your empire this game is for you",1
"love the game and all of the dlcs make it playable many times",1
"me and my dad play this game together. this is a great game for long distense multiplayer. this game also feels almost like a board game. i highly recomend this to anyone and everyone!",1
"my computer is incapable of running this game, so i have to steal my friends computers any time i want to play it. it is so very much worth it. prepare to give your life over to it.",1
"this game is like a time machine that only goes forward. many nights have been lost as i engrossed myself in the gameplay.",2
"i played the original civilization. this one is a great improvement. the additional choices for victory allow the player to tailor the victory conditions to his or her playing style. this means if you enjoy management over combat you can play a game that suits your style. the ability to switch leaders also helps. so the game can work for either style",4
"this was one of the first pc games i ever bought and i was strongly encouraged to buy it by my mates. at first, i wasnt sure that i would like this game, however, i have been completely won over buy it and really enjoy it now. the tactics are great and the best thing about this game is the variety, as, not only are there 5 ways to win, but there are so many different ways to win within those categories. almost every game will be different, and for this reason i will continue to play this game and have fun. there are also many more map types to explore and 2 dlc packs which i cannot wait to buy.",1
"if you looking for a good strategy game look no further with 100s of hours just from the game its self plus all the dlc this will eat away all of that spare time you have....oh and also if you like controlling everything take over the world!!!!",1
"great fun by yourself or with friends! if you enjoy managing infrasture and war at the same time, then this is most likely a game for you",2
"best civ game yet! amazing! more ways than ever to destroy the warmongerer gandhi!",1
"everybody signs open borders in the begining, only to bring 5000 troops in ur capital and to invade u *cough*bismarck*cough*that_sob*cough",1
"only play if avaliable to play for more than 10 hours, otherwise dont bother buying.",1
"beware: this game is seriously addictive. you have been warned...",2
"i need to make declarations of friendship with real people for a change... 9/10 amazing game",1
"i picked up civ v complete during the recent summer sale. while a decent game in and of itself, honestly it makes me want to load up civ iv again for a superior experience. if you have civ iv and beyond the sword... just stick with what you have, its better. if not, then civ v is a worthy game in the franchise.",1
"if you are a strategy fan and like turn-based games, buy it. if not, i wouldnt recommend it. doesnt get old very easily.",4
"worth playing to introduce bollywood to the world.",1
"civilization v is one of the best strategy games i know. you can play it over and over again, and its fun every time. i strongly recommend this game and all of its dlc to anyone who wants a good challenge and also, if anyone has the chance, burn that traitorous  ghandi for me.",1
"very fun game which will never get old with all community mods e.g world war ii",1
"i recommand this game for anyone really but especially europe board game players and stratagy",1
"this was hard at first but is still a very great game its a very different rts for those strategy lovers out there",1
"so. addicting. raising a nation and choosing how you will take over the world is such a detailed process that you can take hundreds of different routes to achieve it in this game. the amount of choices and control you have over every aspect of the game is incredible. would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys turn-based strategy. 8.5/10",1
"this game will make you play for hours and hours and hours its nonstop fun!",1
"your girlfriends younger, stupider sister. in the right light though... damn!",4
"hours of possible playtime, and many facits to enjoy",2
"ive been playing the civ series since the beginning, addictive and enjoyable.. makes you think.",1
"one of the best and hardest strategy games ive ever played, but the one downside to this amazing game is that it gets very redundant.",1
"civilization v is honestly one of my favorite stratigy games. it can be fun in single player but when you have friends to play with it gets even more fun. for anyone who likes a got stratigy game then this is a game you should have. there are quite a few difficulty levels you can choose from to make your game more challenging. you have to keep up with so many asspects at once that it can feel a bit overwellming your first few games, but you will get used to it. with the brave new world and gods and kings dlcs it can add a whole lot to the game and almost make you feel like your having to change your play style completly. overall i would recommend buying this game.",1
"seemingly simple on the surface, subtly complex. a great civ game, even though it strays from the gameplay styles of its predecessors.",2
"i was nuked by ghandi and i have never laughed more in my life",1
"one of my all-time favorites. whether its the enjoyable gameplay or the absurd historical situations (where the incas can invent christianity and ghandi can become a warmongering dictator), this game never fails to entertain me.",2
"one of the most addicting games i have ever played. nothing feels better than upgrading your empire and conquering other empires. in game tips make a complex game easy. everything down to the simple gameplay mechanics is great. beware: this game will eat up your time!",1
"excellent game to waste time with. you could easily (accidentally) drop 8 hours into this game in one session.",1
"omg this is my first civ game and wow this is my crack cocaine",1
"many, many, many fun hours in this game. so many different ways to play. if you want to buy this game, get the gold edition, you will have most of the dlc and will have saved over $50 if you bought all the dlc seperate.",1
"best game i have played in a long time! one play through and i have played for over 13 hours!",1
"imo they have changed the game mechanics to much and at times (although a good game) it feels like it shouldnt even be called civilization, if you love the game mechanics that civilization has been famous for and grown on from the 1st game play civilization 4 not this one. civilization 5 is a good game but its not civilization as should be!",1
"careful.. its easy to lose a whole day to this game. if you like any of the civilization games, you have to have this one.",1
"if you like strategy, this is the game for you. having piled a lot of hours into this game i find that you really need lots of friends to play this game online, to get a proper solid experience. i find that you can only dominate the bots a few dozen games until you get bored. also a fantastic thing about it is that it keeps growing and changing, the teams still working on it, and best of all each match can run for several hours (if not days). add to all of that the fact that you can at any time play with one of the many mods available, and youve got a great experience! 10/10",2
"how much more fun can a strategy game get? none! i say when playing this",1
"it would probably take less time to build an actual civilization than finish one game here.",1
"an incredibly diverse turn based strategy game that will glue you to your computer for hours on end.",2
"civ 5 is one of the most fun games that i have played. there is so much replayability in the game. it is totally worth the money. hope you get it then maybe we can play together.",1
"civilization v is probably one of the best games out there, its fun and theres always something knew that you learn everytime you play. i had all civs before this one and i never get tired from playing. i recommend to buy it and try it out you will like it.",1
"this review is for badge points, but it is a good game.",2
"i really loved this game. it had all the features i was looking for in a great game. the trades and borders are all a great touch, however, i do think you should add taxes",1
"this game allowed me to create a jewish-communistic america who, after developing the manhattan project during the time of the civil war , teamed up with sweeden and decemated all of the french empire with giant killer robots and battleships. 11/10 would conquest again",1
"multiplayer with friends: slow sim 2014 with fun small talk and great moments. 10/10 single player: nuke gandi 10/10",1
"i picked up the complete edition during steam summer sale. fully recommend this game to anyone who even remotely enjoys strategy games and has a decent amount of spare time. this was my first real experience with any civilization game and after completing tutorials and one full game so far, i am totally hooked. it will consume your life but youll be perfectly ok with it.",1
"fantastic game potato/10 would bang better than beyond earth by millions of large units of measurement",1
"if you havent had an erection yet, you will know.",1
"this game have entertained me for many hours. because of number of steam achievments you have always something to achieve and when you get bored you can always starts new harder game where you will be really busy to keep up with ai which you can beat in different ways - getting science, domination, cultural, time or diplomatical victory. another really impressive thing is multiplayer option which thanks to turn-based game system is really interesting and well designed. beat your friends and lets see who is tough dictator, good diplomat or sophisticated ruler. aro! civilization v 8/10 gods and kings 8/10 brave new wolrd 9/10",1
"it could be an excellent game if the multiplayer problems were not so annoying. even in lan we have lag and disconnection. it brings nothing but frustration, and thats really sad because the game is great in single player but could be even greater in multiplayer. for what this game gave me i cant recommand it.",1
"great soundtrack, has some sense of education to it for people who are vaguly interested in history. obviously if you play with ghandi he will be historically accurate and stock up on nucleur warheads and put the entire world consisting of 3 continents into a cold war or m.a.d. and when you play as venice make sure you become a real life banker and get loads of bonuses and make sure everyone is denpendant on you for their economy. also the multiplayer experience is not that bad the connections between players can be dodgy so frequent saving is an order, and combat is ok despite the quick animations. if you dont have this game....get it on sale or wait until the next civ gme in a few months....listen to your advisors....exept your military one...dont be like me",3
"this game is a stagedy game and that is perfect for this game. the map scales are perfect, but the only problem is that, if you have bad wifi and play a big map with a lot of players then good luck!",1
"civilisation is a epic stratergy game forcing one to use their wits against other in the race for supremecy",1
"youve first a dull game then youve got nukes... (until gandhi has nukes too, then you are basically death...)",3
"i loved this game and could not stop playing it for 5 hours then the next day 5 more hours and so on",1
"i dont know why everyone thinks im some sort of warmonger, its kill or be killed! all your base are belong to us 10/10",1
"ive been playing civilazation since civ 3, ive played all of them and i have to say...they got it right again. its definatly not the most complicated game ever, longest playing game, and it dosent have the most depth but it has just enough of everything to make everyone from the most casual gamer to the most serious strategist. the mods are great, the ai isnt to smart but smart enough to be fun to play with, and the community is amazing. id recommend this game to all ages and all skills, its rich in history and all around fun! the world is your playground ;) enjoy...",2
"be gandhi overlord of the planet, destroyer of worlds. mod the game, become hobbits, take over middle earth kill nazguls like theres no tommorow.",2
"fun but long strategy game. if you have many hours to burn and you love strategy games, this is a game for you. if you beat the game on normal difficulty, you will want to continue playing on harder skill levels. i have not played multiplayer but the game is fun and challenging.",1
"i recommend the crap out of this game. buying this game is like giving away your soul. great fun. 10/10",1
"yeah this game gets me so in hard that i have to itch my balls to correct its awesomeness!",2
"i had this game for a few days on one of the steam play for 3 days things. before i was expecting it to be very fun because many of my friends had it. then i turned it on and played. it was so much more fun and addicting than i thought it would be. i thought that a turn based rts made of tiles would be pretty dull. but it was amazing! i only got to log 11 hours on it before the event ended. next time it goes on sale i am definatly going to buy it.",1
"civilization v is possibly the best turn based strategy game i have played, i am not the type of person to get into and play strategy games but civilization v has made me see that their not as bad as i thought. if you like strategy games then this would be a game worth getting, i recommend getting the complete edition to enhance your experience on this game.",1
"this is possibly the most awesome game ive ever bought. seriously. you can jump in without ever having played the other civilization games, as it has a full tutorial. there is masses of dlc you can download. though that being said, you can play the game a thousand times, and itd be different every time - so the dlc isnt necessary to enjoy the game.",1
"this game is amazing. it is ( in my personal opinoin) the best game strategy game out there. it is not only really fun to play but it also relates to actual history.",2
"a true continuation of one of the greatest serieses of games.",1
"this game used to be my life! after almost 300 hours of epic turn-based diplomacy, i have started to realize how to actually play!",2
"civ v is a great game but sid meier hates multiplayer. wish this game didnt bomb so badly against other human beings.",3
"been an avid player of civilization series since the very beginning on the amiga. a great addition to the series and a worthwhile buy for anyone who wishes to lose a weekend one does not simply play civilization for an hour",2
"an excellent game. best in the genre. if youre a fan of turn-based strategy and dont own this, what are you waiting for!",3
"game is sick lost many hours of my life to this and never really completed a proper game xd",2
"definetly one of my favourite games. i recommend it to everyone! 10/10",1
"i liked the game. though you have to like a game that takes time to play. :)",1
"never start this game if you have somewhere to be in the next 12 hours :)",2
"this is honestly one of the best games i have ever played. definatley the best strategy game i have ever experianced. the graphics are apropriate for the game and the gripping strategy gameplay is top-notch. i would give it a 9/10.",1
"a very strategic-based, turn-based war game... lots of different choices and ways to build your cities and armies, as well as allying with or seiging city-states and lots more too.",1
"has to be the best so far, esp with dx11 - cant beat some nukes and bombers!!",1
"super solid game. excellent for casual players as well as for those who like to go into more depth. on of the best value for money games i think you can buy and i have thoroughly enojoyed playing it.",1
"great game, has its flaws but makes up for it with its great replayability. its even more fun if you play it with friends.",1
"this game overall is very addicting and a fun game and i 100% recommend it. the only thing i find dumb about it is the fact that if your civilizations borders are too close to another civilization they will eventually attack you no matter what. other than that the game is pretty amazing.",1
"no doubt the best strategy game of all time. many hours have been spent having fun in this game. 10/10",1
"this game is great really recomend it but it is a game where its alot more fun to play with friends rather than by yourself.",2
"really fun game to play. is more of a game that requires knowledge about the game more than skill not like an fps. way better to play with friends. definetly advise getting the complete editition especially brave new world",1
"possibly the best entry in this genre defining franchise. i would absolutely love to see alpha centauri delivered using this engine.",1
"omg this game is so fun! you can take over the world, become the leader of the free world, go to the stars its far the best game ever 12/10",2
"this is a great turn-based strategy game that i would highly recommend.",1
"after many hours of play i can say this game ruined my life.",1
"civilization v is slowly taking my social life away but im fine with that, i got my friends to buy it so theres no need for me to leave the house anymore. i highly reccomend this game, its well worth it to buy the expansions.",1
"(warning) this game has ruined my life!!! its the most amazing and challenging game i have ever played (besides dayz) its that type of game there is famous for destroying friendships. when your are in this game you think you can control it, but when you suddenly discover that its 3 in the morning and you think just one more round, just one more well, after a couple of hundred rounds you are going to commit sucide because gandhi nuked you and bismark destroyed your navy... but you havent played a proper strategy game before you have played civilization 5...",2
"best strategy game to date. i hope the new one lives up to the years of play ive had from this game.",4
"this is the greatest game ive ever played! i love it! i have over 200 hours logged into this game! from the war to the peace! it is my favorite game of all time!",3
"if you like good games or have a soul, youll want to play this.",1
"i could easily lose my entire life to civ. makes for strange conversations trying to explain to people whats happening, so worth it.",1
"ceaser got mad at me and his legionares destoryed my longswordmen but when i got my minutmen out i wiped the floor with him.i made a peace treaty with him to have a age of peace if he would give me all his cites but his current main one (which was not rome cause i took it from him) and i burnt down the cites he gave me and then started a siege on his last remaining city (destroying the truce) that was the end of ceaser.but egypt got mad and called me dishonorible after the actions i took.then i pause and saved and never went on it again.ask jordan nutkicker if you dont belive me!",1
"its a great game, but feels dumbed down compared to the other civ games. still fun though.",1
"iest ai in the world. instead of making them smart, harder difficulties just give the ai stupid amounts of resources and eliminate penalties they might otherwise get for doing stupid . really, really bad",1
"this game is the bees nees especially love how the promote modding definite plus.",4
"awesome game just dont know why i cant play direct x 11...",1
"once you get the complete edition of this game, this is easilly one of the best turn based strategies i have ever played. very addicting, and fun once you have a bunch of friends to play with.",2
"this game is amazing; it looks very realistic and you can change almost everything to make one game (e.g. make the map size up to huge). also its online and this game is perfect for online. it also supports mods which means it si easier to mod it. by modding u can add all kinds of things to the game (e.g.different units like wookie units)",1
"a game intricate enough to make me not desperate to win it. the game play is fun enough on its own, without the added joy of beating someone.",1
"awesome game! first civ game i have ever played and i enjoy it a lot. easy to get into and once you start, you wont be able to stop!",1
"this is a very good and relaxing game. i highly recommend buying this game its worth every cent",1
"this game is a great game if you like being in control, this games lets you control a civilization that faces many threts, including other civiliations and barbarians, this makes the game a fun role playing game while including lots of different features to make it a great game.",3
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",2
"this game is ridiculously addicting. would definitely recommend as it is a great strategy game.",1
"i love all the civ series, and this is just a jewel. great graphics, great improvements with all the dlc and patches. worth every penny.",1
"great game. fun without dlc, and dlc make it feel like a whole new game, or a whole new world (<----pun).",2
"amazing game that i would recomend to everyone. everytime i play its for a couple hundred turns before a break. definitely worth it.",1
"everyone already knows this game is awesome and addictive but i still felt like recommending it anyway",2
"great turn based strategy game, as long as you know how to play...",1
"civilization 5 was the first sid meiers game i ever played, i dont know what to expect. i have loved every minute of civ5, its one of the the few games i can lose so very very badly and with a grin start again only to get nuked off the face of the planet by gandhi. i didnt see gandhi coming like at all. we were so cool with each other then boom nukes everywhere the horror. still have nightmares about it 20/10 everyone join the madness :d",2
"i highly recommend this game if you really like to kill time, literally. just so you know, this is a real time strategy, similar with age of empires, but this one is in turn-based system which i think have made this game much interesting to play. and the ai is hard enough to beat if you didnt set up your strategy well. the best thing that makes this game one of my favorites is civilization v is not all about war, war and war. you can try nuke, nuke and nuke for fun. (note: this is a game which could kill your real life.)",1
"oodles of fun with my friends! when im bored (and i already fapped) i just whip this out and all my problems are solved!",1
"truly a great game. enticing multiplayer that can be saved and finished later. complex gameplay and deep strategy. the only con: annoying french.",1
"greatest strategy game ive ever played, so detailed and submerssive.",4
"originally i was very sceptical - for me version v had come way too fast after civ iv which i liked very. i changed my mind with the gods & kings expansion and now it is by far the most played game in my list. the gameplay is superb and i very much enjoy the co-op mode. there is no excuse not to own and play this game, as it is eternally replayable.",2
"a beautifully well-made, turned-based strategy game, civilization v will capture and enthrall you for hours on end. even for someone like myself who has never played another civilization game before, this game had me addicted about 10 minutes into it and ive played for several hours nonstop, only stopping for real-life necessities. you create your own world, own maps, own cultures, all from scrap and then try to see and make them rise to greatness. i cannot implore you enough to acquire this game. note at 7/14/13: some people on tf2op are selling it for 2 keys so dont miss this oppotunity to pick it up! you will not be disappointed if you love creative, strategic games of any kind. this is a top-notch 9/10 game or higher easily.",1
"dont play this game if you have a schedule tomorrow.",1
"the best strategy game ever created! it is extremely fun and interesting, you will find yourself playing it for hours! the possibilities are endless in civ 5. it is beginner-friendly as there is a bunch of hints and information that the game provides you as you play. setting up a game is easy, there are also many options you can tweak to make your world what you want it to be. the dlc for this game is awesome and it adds even more variety to this game. steam workshop also adds mods to this game that you can download and have even more fun exploring civ 5. make your civilization grow from the ancient era to the future! you will find yourself addicted and going to the next turn and then the next turn. multiplayer with your friends is very fun and you can team up! overall, this game is worth it and i recommend civ 5 to everyone!",1
"if you want a game that has tons of replay value a very in depth technology tree and loads of historical people that youve never heard of then this grand strategy is definitely for you. i bought it and havent regretted it.",1
"ripp off windows tab 8 8 after purchase after load wont run!",1
"great game to play. i can lose myself in this game for hours. just bought the brave new world expansion as well. adding more elements to the game. so many ways to win a game. ai to me doesnt seem completely stupid. fun if your looking to play against the ai, at least for me. havent played much online yet. but i am willing to bet its just as good.",1
"a very good and well-crafted game, especially if you enjoyed the board game risk in you formative years, or indeed the classic video games age of empires and the total war series. a good game to occasionally come back to.",3
"great strategic gameplay, and plenty of value in game time.",1
"great game to play. i can lose myself in this game for hours. just bought the brave new world expansion as well. adding more elements to the game. so many ways to win a game. ai to me doesnt seem completely stupid. fun if your looking to play against the ai, at least for me. havent played much online yet. but i am willing to bet its just as good.",1
"i play this game since it came out and still loving it! i always has to play just one more turn!",3
"in the 100+ hours ive thrown into this game, i can easily say that civ 5 is one of the most addicting strategy games ive ever played. its the turn-based aspect about it that hooks me, i think; i need to just finish this next turn and that turns into 100 or so. ive not been able to delve into absolutely everything yet, all the map types and civs would take probably months of play, or a few nights on a wiki. if youre into a good strategy game and you dont mind putting a lot of time into a match, its good fun.",1
"truly amazing! the first time i played this game i did not stop playing for 6 hours straight and by then it was 2 a.m. i recommend this game to casual and veteran stratagists alike.",1
"play this game if you dont mind losing hours of your life without realizing it. it is highly addictive!",1
"the biggest time drain since taking a dump. youll pop in for a quick match then be playing the same match for the next 32 hours. during the time you will love and cry and finally achieve victory. you will stand victorious above all the nations you crushed on your way here and you will stop and think i could do this. then your political carreer begins. vote drtuv 2020",1
"combat is vastly better than previous incarnations. hopefully the expansion adds more depth.",1
"civ v is a really good game for those strategic, thinking gamers out there. and you dont even need a knowledge of world history because you create it! yes, i know its not an indefinite amount of possibilities (though that is a drawback for some people) it has a bunch of other things. the original game only has a certain amount of civilizations, though, so if you have enough, buy it with an expansion (or two) and as many dlcs as you can afford, because i assure you it is worth it. i would give this a 9/10 because of my tastes. i mean, i love the game, but as a game you control without an indefinite amount of possibilities, i am one of the many people who find that a drawback. other than that, its an amazing game!",1
"i thought ive grown up, someone who can manage his time between his life, work, and entertainment.",1
"started the game up once and stuck for 5 hours straight, great game!",1
"good strategy game but it keeps crashing randomly on windows 8 please fix",1
"highly recomend this game, its just amazing, hours of fun!",2
"not the best civ game ever made but who doesnt like ruling the world???",1
"ive always been a big civ fan since civ ii and over 400+ in im still playing. the hexagonal tiles plus the combat system change plus the changes to great people (g&k) are some really great changes over civ iv that honestly almost make it impossible to ever go back. its biggest problem is the same that its always been - its pretty slow paced. this is a game that can take a month to play through an entire game.",3
"civ 4 is a lot better..... they noobed it good for the casual gamers.....",1
"although the gameplay has been drastically overhauled, civ v is a huge improvement from civ iv. no longer able to stack units, and cities have a base defense value (modified by garrisoned troops or defensive buildings), civ v caters more to the long-term strategist rather than the spreadsheet wielding histobuff. the graphics are much more pleasant, the ambiance retaining the worldly civalization energy that has evolved over 20 years to manifest in this, the game of life.",2
"higly detailed this game is missing lots of stuff i recommend dlc it will get thumbs down alone but with all major dlcs it will get thumbs up cause it makes it a better game.",1
"an excellent game that you will revisit time and time again. great to play with friends playing with them or against them. the expansions make a good amount of difference to the gamelplay, so much that i find myself unable to enjoy playing the standard version of civilization v! i would recommend getting the gold edition whilst the game is on sale, and then purchasing brave new world on top. there are some issues with bugs, including; the game reloading in online games, sometimes when you save a multiplayer game and rejoin there was an issue with not getting the right civ and other small anoiances. overall this is a great game, especially those new to the 4x genre, like i was. the ui is easy great, the mechanics are enjoyable and the game feels very polished. i woulkd recommend this game to anyone!",2
"if you want to ruin your life, buy this game 10/10",1
"i bought the vanilla version of this game about a week ago, and it has sucked every other aspect of my life up. im constantly thinking what new civ to play as, or who im going to wage war against next. the stategy is wholly absosrbing, and i would recommend this game to anyone. not just 4x or strategy players, but anyone at all. i havent even mentioned the expansions yet. apologise in advance to your family, you wont be seeing them for a while. 10/10",2
"played game for an hour however feels like a dumbed down version of the old civ that i have played over the years, so have gone back to civ 4.",1
"this game will eat your time. if you like turn based games or want an amazing time killer, grab civ 5! it feels amazing to build up a nation of nothing and win in more than just the traditional military way. play this with a friend its even better! ill be on this one for a while.",1
"never play this game before an exam. one more turn will end up being 3 hours later.",2
"dropping nukes and atomic bombs as gandhi is deeply satisfying",1
"dont trust ghandi, he will not give you cookies. 10/10",1
"its a great strategy game where you start off as a civilization of your choice and you battle for victory against many other civilizations. the game has different modes and scenarios so no match is the exact same.",1
"i love this game and all others like it thank you.",1
"it was a bit tough to learn all the game mechanics, but once you get the hang of it, its a fun game, especially if you like history.",1
"one of the best time wasters of all time. dont play if you dont have a lot of time in your hands. this will get you hooked.",1
"complex and challenging with variable difficulty setting. i have yet to begin getting into this game. it is a good fun challenge.",1
"this game is one of my favourite games ever, it is really fun to play with friends and solo, if you want a game you can play for a few hours or even an hour, this game is for you, civ 5 described in one word, #fantabulous",1
"are you serious ? you need a review for civilization v and/or expansions ? you had to spend all your life living under a rock, just go, buy and play it if you didn`t already. yes ! it is awesome. just never ever play it for a while before you will go to sleep, it will not going to happen until your wife/fiance will come and slap you. just one more turn syndrome is strong in it, i double dare you !",1
"seriously, this game eats my life and i actually enjoy it. im doomed.",1
"love this game. positives - looks great - wastes time - always fun negatives - cant destroy other peoples religion (as you cant raze capitals)",1
"fun turn-based strategy game, a lot like settlers of catan or risk.",4
"this was my first real civ game, and i love it. the brave new world expansion adds a lot of complexity and a lot of interesting elements to keep the game interesting. ive definitely sunk way too many hours into this game, but its one of my favorite games to binge on. the game takes a lot of time to play, but because it is turn based, you can (supposedly) save at any time and play more later. i enjoy this game for more than just the style of game. i appreciate the historical information woven into the game, and i like that i can play this game while listening to or watching something else. if you like slow, tactical games, i would recommend giving civilization v a try.",2
"i absolutely love civ 5. its an easy, fun, and highly addictive game. with 85 hours in, and many more planned in the future, the game does not fail to ever get boring. for strategy players, if you like strategy, this is your game, without a doubt.",1
"this game is dangerous. you sit down to play for 2 hours after dinner, aaaaaand its 1am. loads of options for nations, strategies, best civ yet.",1
"i have put hundreds of damned hours into this game and there is still more stuff i can do in the game. ive played plenty of games in my life but this is the best one out of all of them.",1
"this game is awesome. i played for a year thinking that i had all the expansions until i realized brave new world had come out a year earlier and it had snuck right past me. brave new world makes the game even more awesome. the game is so much fun, my only grip would be that the multiplayer is a bit laggy, and i wish i could own my own dedicated server for the game,",2
"although ive never been one for rts, civiliztion v is just such a fun experience that i just could not put it down. its the kind of game you get lost in and find yourself playing long after youd think it would be time to stop. its a game that a person of any taste, whether it be someone whom enjoys awesome rts or maybe someone who just likes the experience of being a leader on the world stage, the experience is the same either way, truely amazing. with gameplay like this, its no wonder that the franchise civilization has been around so long yet stayed so relevant. i cant wait to try future installments.",1
"i didnt know if i would like civ or not since ive never played a turn-based game. i am addicted. buy this game",1
"holy  where do i begin? i wont begin anywhere im just going to say that this game is so awesome! i bought it 2 days ago and i already have 20+ hours on it. what am i doing with my life?",1
"hell yeah mane!!! though for real talk this game is very good but be careful because you have to think when playing this game. civ is a very hard and strategic game.",1
"another civilization game and another stroke of genius. this game allowed for a personal approach to civilization development based on my own preference rather than providing a single formula for success. this is a great turn-based game and i strongly reccoment it.",1
"my interest in the civilization series borders on the insane. civ 5 is the first iteration with enough differences between factions that i feel compelled to try different victory strategies and different civilizations. its that awesome.",2
"awesome game, i mean after i got this i palyed if for a solid hour and never got bored. (edit: solid 6 hours aparently time dosnt exist in this world)",1
"likes: realistic, great graphics, smooth play, and historically accurate. dislikes: you cannot ask ai questions (in your own words), too easy to defeat barbarians.",1
"this game is an incredible game that appeals to those who love politics, strategy, and ideals of world domination. build a nation from the ground up and conquer the world with your military, your nations culture, or your amazing diplomatic powers. one of my favorites ever this game has certainly made me into a civilization fan.",1
"very cool strategy game. love it and recommend it to all. you will have tons of fun playing",1
"this is such a fun game and it really makes you think!",1
"i played this game for a long time and failed my exams, it essentially ruined my life forever. 10/10 would fail exams for again.",1
"very long games make 10 hours feel like 2 hours. pretty ridiculous ai difficulties, doesnt seem to get any harder",2
"this game damn its good especially if you like strategy games warning highly addictive. but if this going to be the first game you ever play you are gonna have a bad time",1
"yeah ill play one game......2hours later 11/10 great game",1
"its very hard to stop playing! feels like playing monopoly or risk when played with a couple friends.",1
"insanely addictive, and great for newcomers to the civilization series and to 4x games in general.",1
"civ 5 is very much differnt then the other civs in many smalls ways which makes it a big way. i personally love this game, its hard to seige a castle, but its not impossible, and can even be easy if you know how to do it. it can be as easy or as complicated as you want. as easy because it can all be done automatic and all you need to do is watch, to as complicated because you can micro manage everything, including where your citizens work. civ 5 has a play style for everyone who likes turn based simulations. from dominating everyone, to being the best in a curtain amount of time, to being great friends with everyone. i strongly recommend this game, and as a hint to winning. pick a way of winning and stick to it. there are many ways to win, and if you stick with one, you will win.",2
"this is the best stategy/tactics and tremendously complicated game i have ever played. so, if complex stategy is fun for you, you will love this game.",1
"i could say so many thing about this game, like how addictive, interesting, entretaining and fun it can be. but it would take a lot of time to talk about every aspect of civ 5 that makes it awesome, so im just going to tell you that if you want to play something incredibly good in your computer and get away of all the common or mainstream games, there is no better game than sid meiers civilization v. p.s. buy the dlcs they make the game even cooler. and seriously you cant play this game without the brave new world expansion",1
"one of the most time consuming games i have ever played. spent hours playing through the tutorial.",1
"an absolutely awe-inspiring sequel in quite possibly the worlds most replayable series of games thus far. the only cloud on this games sky is its horrible incompatibility with nvidia hardware/software. all in all though, an amazing game. 9.1/10",3
"this is a very nice game , plss 1 week for free to play , plssss",1
"great game of which is verry fun. getting started is not very easy but you get there...",1
"this might be the most addicting strategy game i had ever played , and i have never played a civ game before , this game is awesome !",1
"civilization v is must have game for people who enjoy strategy games. this game has combinations that will fit any person playing style. the basic things for this game are easy to learn. as you learn the more advanced items, your style will form to it and allow you to us it to the best of your abilities. for those who really like the past cilization games, you will like this one as well. and dont forget about the expandes, they take the gameplay to a whole new level.",2
"its so simple but intricate, its amazing.... if youre an rts guy/girl, get this game! also bnw is really good if anyone says it sucks theyre wrong",1
"this game is extremely addicting and a lot of fun to play.",3
"multiplayer - good experience, although you need a host with good internet speed. controls - doesnt come natural. graphics - good enought for a grand strat. music - not amazing but i didnt expect that from a grand strat. score of 7/10.",1
"my first game, i found 2 ais the names of these are gandhi and atila the hun. we traded and made strong friendships with each other. 20 turns later i saw gandhi had some giant death robots near my border all of a sudden i noticed atila had some submarines with nuclear missiles. in the blink of an eye my people in my capital were screaming and my empire was on fire and i lost my only friends. 10/10 when i see gandhi or atila in my games i now rethink my life, quit civ and start crying",2
"a hugely immersive game with endless replayability. i cant say much for the single player as ive barely touched it, but as a multiplayer game, if you have a solid 12 hours to spend with a few friends its a truly incredible experience of bonds formed and broken within the space of a mouse click. though plagued with a few problems, such as games larger than small running very slowly to begin with, and annoying restarts, it still lends itself to being one of the deepest, exciting and tactical games ive ever played. the dlc massively adds to it too.",1
"i got three things playing this game. time leap, joint stiffness on my hands and waist and a great fun!",1
"very addictive, 34 hours logged in 3 or 4 sessions. gandhi nuked me 10/10 would play again.",1
"in the words of the late great taylor swift: after playing civ 5, civ 4 and i are never, ever, ever getting back together. civ 5 > all things",1
"civilization 5 is a great stragety game that can entertain for years. there are many things you can do in this game. i recommend it whole heartedly.",3
"yea this is a good game, spent way to much time just playing one game. but i just need one more turn",1
"ghandi is a ruthless s.o.b. and will ruin your life 10/10",2
"having not played civ since my old uni days (many a decade ago) i found the latest iteration simple to pick up and get my hands dirty with, the ui is pleasing and aside from some minor gripes well thought out. gameplay is still addictive and the one more turn ethos still permeates through and it is very hard to put down i havent yet played mp as yet as i am just getting my old head round all the mechanics before i dip my toe into that",1
"very fun. you will easily rack up hours on this tbs. friendly to beginners. gods and kings and brave new world are almost mandatory if you want to use mods from the workshop. there is too much dlc, but the core game should keep you happy for hours and the big expansions (gods and kings, for example) are actually substantial.",1
"if youre a casual civilization fan, or if youre just someone looking for a good turn-based strategy game, look no further; civilization v is a great game of this genre, and youll have fun with it. if youre a hardcore civilization fan, you might want to avoid this game, as it is significantly less complex than previous civilization games. for this reason, it was somewhat controversial within the civ community. still, im of the personal opinion that its worth a buy; if youre uncertain, simply wait until its on sale.",1
"what can i say that hasnt already been said about civ v? its amazing... it is probably, hands-down, the best of the genre... entire weekends have come and gone over the span of a single game... it really is a fun title, lots to micro-manage if that is your thing, or just build and destroy and let the ai take care of the finer details. the two expansions add some very new and interesting gameplay elements, totally re-shaping how you play the game. gods and kings adds in religion (which you get to mold and craft as you play through the ages), and brave new world revamps the way trade and diplomacy are carried out. both are highly recommended!! overall, great game. clean design, wonderul hd graphics, hardly any bugs or issues (least with the single-player games, i dont really play this one online, so cannot comment), and lots and lots of replayibility. pick it and start your empire today!!",2
"the game feels finished, and plays well. its an improvement over civ 4 in every way, save mutliplayer, which is awful, lacking mod support, animated leader heads, etc. fleshed out multiplayer would be much appreciated.",3
"highly addictive, typical civ game but more polished.",1
"this is civilisation! intitally i couldnt get into the hex grid which was a departure from the earlier games. however after a while i barely noticed it. the expansions have only added to this. if you havent played this by now and it is your type of game then you need to own this. (and what is wrong with you?) get it at any price.",2
"great game all round and why shouldnt it be?? great visuals, sounds, and elements",1
"far too much fun. basically has all the buildy up games you loved as a child and then combines them all into one huge sploof of awesomeness :d",1
"the most addictive turn-based strategy game ive ever played.",1
"diz gam is like 10.5/10 rly well developed gam wp rito wp",1
"i love the civ franchise! and 5 is no exception! its beautiful, and easy to learn. turn based so you can go at your own pace, very relaxing! even i get tired of frantic shooters and rpgs sometimes. change it up! :)",1
"ghandi-is-an- simulator 2014. 11/10 would get nuked by ghandi again.",1
"very fun and tactical, provides hours of entertainment.",1
"wow - what a fun game - the replayability is great. im well over 200 hours on this one and its new every time. keep the expansion packs going..",4
"one of the best turn based stategy games. if you like stategy and a bit of history, youll like this one :)",2
"stay away, run away and dont look it in the eyes or itll suck your day away",1
"another great addition to the civ library. not quite as polished as civ 4, but once you get the expansions it easily exceeds how great 4 was, even with beyond the sword.",2
"dont buy this game if you like to see the sun, it will suck you in and you will stay in front of the computer for 2 or 3 days before you notice.",2
"(the multiplayer can be buggy and anoyng) funny game to play online,addicted and fun,alot of civilitations and playng styles like you can be diplomatic,go to war,grow your popolation,have fun build all the wonders,explore the seas and get the best economy,build huge armys,rein over barbarians and city-states and get incledbly rich. i love this game,are you ready to write 6000 years of history?",1
"great game. though i miss some of the dynamics of civ 4",1
"great game that feels new every time you start it up. like minecraft, its vanilla and dlc content is just right, and allows for more complex features through modding. if you like diversity in your gameplay, the achievements can make you try something new. definitely recommended. tried to take the austrian city of salzburg with a 19th century armada, only to be obliterated by futuristic flying air ships. 10/10",2
"prepare to lose hours of your life to one game. just one more turn. one more! just one more! mom, bring me some damn nachos! im playing civ v and i just declared war on america, russia, germany, and greece! mom? mommmmmmmmmmmmm!",1
"this has proven to be one of my absolute favourite games. its difficult to put my finger on exactly what is so wonderful about civ v, but i can say that it has the best replayablity value on anything ive ever played. single player is smooth and refined, and every playable civ is perfectly balanced. every map offers a reasonable challenge, and there are multiple ways to win a game. for me, civ v really gets fun in multiplayer with some friends. the multiplayer can be a little touch-and-go, but that was hugely improved in the last few patches. with pitboss multipalyer being run from a stable connection, most of the problems associated with civ vs multiplayer are circumvented. i cannot recommend this game highly enough. if youre waiting to be swayed, get this game. it offers hours upon hours of entertainment.",1
"you start playing at 2pm...nexxt thing you know its 6am...10/10 would waste life again.",1
"awesome game if you dont have midterms to study for (time consuming and drags you in).",1
"i loved the first one back and the day. this one is just as fun but way better.",1
"good game if you got a buncha hours to kill or got friends to play with.",1
"must more than addictive. i find myselfe always saying just one more turn, this is most times 5 hours later. great game. i definately recommend this. also get the complete edition.",1
"a great gamr i think that the hexagonl dimesion adds something to it.",1
"if you dont have this game, youre not a true pc gamer (kidding).",1
"i love the civilization series so much. so intoxicatingly addictive that you just cannot stop playing. i would highly recommend the bnw expansion with 5 as it really improves the game.",2
"classic turn based board game style rts game. really fun and even better with friends. can be pretty much any civilization in history with the help of the workshop and so much dlc that really adds to the game. great game, easy buy too.",1
"does your child stay up to strange hours of the night? does your child talk about improving faith or culture bombing? these may be signs of civilization v addiction civ is a very serious drug, it captivates the user for long hours, forcing them to want just one more turn together, we can stop it. talk to your kids about civ before someone else does",1
"it is a really great game and i love it but i was looking at dlcs and i found the packet for 50$ (american) and i got so mad at myself because i realized that there was the packet i could have bought instead so pretty much wasted 30 dollars on the basic game when i could have bought the packet. so this is more to the owners of steam to make something where you can return a game and get your money back. if there is please email me to tell me where it is so i can get the packet instead of buying the packet on top of the basic game i have already downloaded. please",1
"best game lots of fun lots of love to the creators keep doin what you do",1
"it is very fun game to play. and on higher difficulties a challenge to win the game.",1
"this strategy game stays the king in this genre for a reason. once you take some time to understand its simple core mechanics, it becomes oh so dangerously addicting. i could blame this game for numerous wasted weekends and some nights with no sleep, but i cant. i had too much fun running my own little civilization experiments at increasing difficulty levels, and having so much fun. one peace of advice: a good pc is recommended, because the wait times between turns can get annoying, especially at the late game.",2
"not quite as good at civ iv in some aspects, worlds better than civ iv in others. im still a sucker for some empire earth or age of empires, but as for tbs games in general, civ v has a lot of moving parts, is a very involved game that can take days or a few short hours depending on rules, setup, and play style. good replay value. great with friends.",1
"has a way of sucking you in for hours and hours of play, loads of fun if you enjoy building a society.",2
"this game is equivalent to a time machine, sit down to play one round, and boom! twenty-seven and a half years have gone by! on the bright side, =10 gold per city next to a river!",1
"an incredibly detailed game filled with unique situations and enjoyment. i definately recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of turn based stragegy games.",3
"this game teaches that the worlds leaders are . also, its nearly impossible to stop playing just...one...more...turn..!!",1
"this game is honestly my favourite out of all the games ive played so far. as you can see ive logged 120 hours and plan to log even more with the bnw expansion pack that im getting. the graphics are still awesome and i still get chills every time i nuke a enemy city :d",1
"superb strategy game. plenty of interseting mods to make the game even more unique.",2
"if you like strategy or board games, i would highly recommend this to anyone.",1
"well, ghandi nuked 3 of my cities in one turn. he is a believer in peace, just through mutually assured destruction. 11/10",2
"if you ever played ron you will definitely love this game, some features does not work as good as, but its still an awesome game in the overall panorama, very relaxing to play.",2
"pretty fun game if you like building a civilization from the ground up!",1
"as a vivid turn-based strategy gamer, i would highly recommend civ v. it has a variety of gameplay and a considerable amount of ai difficulties. if anything, check the vods on youtube before you purchase it so that it suits your preferences well. enjoy ;)",1
"...just... one... more... button... this game is epic! well worth the purchase (esp on sale day)! i strongly suggest you get the expansions as they add great elements to the game, as well as some common sense fixes to technology and military progression. ranged/melee ships become available throughout the game. archers can upgrade throughout the game. iron isnt necessary for early seige units. just some really great stuff that makes your gaming experience all the more pleasureable... just... press that button one more time... and watch your days disappear 10/10",4
"this game destroyes my social life almost as fast as ghandi destroyes my cities with nukes. that nig. 69/8 goty sid meier is love, sid meier is life.",2
"it will consume your life and you will be glad it did.",1
"youre sitting on your high horse. you, george washington, has eclipsed everyone in research. you are hailed as a god by your people. nothing could be better. but wait... what the hell? catherine of russia declared war on you? no matter. your mechanized infantry will wipe the floor with her crossbowmen. as you pile into her capital, the nuke sirens go off. wait what? the most advanced of your adversaries is in the at- dear god. you cower in fear as 7. seven atomic bombs pummel you and your people into the dust. soon after, while you are lying in a ditch, watching your palace fall apart, you hear this, a strange indian accent you should have given me that luxury resource 127 turns ago ghandi strikes again. 11/10 ghandi survival simulator",1
"! warning ! highly addictive ! warning ! buy only if you have lots of spare time to sink into this wonderful game ! truly amazing, but get brave new world and gods & kings with it :)",1
"i have to admit that i never thought i would like this game. i was a die hard civ iii fan (and i still love it). but this game is gorgeous and has some great things about it. i found the hex grid hard to get used to, but after getting used to it, its much more intuitive than civ iiis grid. i actually like the fact that i cant stack a hundred things on top of one another (though ive heard people complain about that) because i keep track of my units better that way. one thing i really dont like is the extra restrictions on movement. you cant even go through an enemys space at all, even to pass through and you ship cant risk dangerous deep water (a gambit i am very fond of in civ iii). other than that, i love this game. it may even be my favorite out of the civilization games.",1
"great game. just when you think youre doing good the three leaders youve been trading with declare war on you and pillage you.",1
"this game is amazing, more people need to play it. it is only fun if you are playing with friends, by yourself, it is boring.",2
"with brave new world and gods and kings, civ v is outstanding. montezuma is still a giant, war mongering  head though.",1
"civilization v is a great in depth strategy game that combines elements of war, citybuilding and management of projects and resources to form a dense web of gameplay.there are around 40 civilizations each having a different playstyle to match with your personality and prefered victory.the steam community also embraces that civilization has a free mod kit available for download and they create many downloadable content packs to share with other players of civilization.there is a ton of fun to be had with civilization and i highly recomend it. :d",1
"while this game has extreme depth, tons of replayability, endless entertainment, strong rewards for strategy... i cant help myself from building nukes and destroying the most passive country on the map. every game.",1
"very great and fluid running game. enhance that experience by getting at least the major 2 addons as they offer vast amounts of new content for your money. if you love strategy games, this ones for you.",1
"game of the year. game of all years. this is the half-life 3 of strategy games.",2
"good game with friends but the company doesnt do much to improve the game once it was put out, laggy and so on also the game is typical in that it offered things in civ 4 then sold it as addons in this game lol",3
"if youve never played a civilization game before, the fifth iteration is a good place to start. a game of civlization is similar to a board game. theres no campaign or overarching story. you simply have one goal and thats to win a match. to do this you have many options that involve brute force, economical strategy, scientific advancement or some of the newer methods like influence and trade. the game is one thats easy to get lost in, before you know it, time has simply vanished. to me, that marks a good game.",1
"(note: i played a lot more of this during the elongated time my internet was down) sid meiers civ v is an awesome turn based stratergy game rich in content and only deepened by the vast collection of online mods. gameplay is simple at first but surprisingly deep and addictive. you pick a leader, and you rule your country. you start with only a few units and anciet technology but soon amass yourself with large armies, and highly advanced mordern technology. forging alliances with leaders is fun but the ai is rather idiotic at times and that can be troublesome, but its only a small problem for such a well made game. just one... more... turn",1
"one of the best strategic games i have played ever",1
"this by far is one of the best turn-based strategy game ever imo. it is perfect. you have so many choices you can build a giant peaceful civilization or you can be war mongol, heck you can even be a single city civilization this game is delicious. buy it!",1
"go away mom, how can i eat while my people starve!? 10/10",1
"absolutely amazing game and well worth buying. great fun and very involved. multiplayer could use some tuning though.",1
"a great play for those who are willing to stay on the same game for hours and hours. the game itself has tons of replayability, and has some great, well priced expansion packs that add even more stuff to the game.",1
"the best if its genre by a mile and a half. highly recommended if you like your strategy games with a friendly learning curve, but still with that intricacy that can take a long time to master. (has an in built user friendly modding system in the main menu)",1
"very well made game. still the best of its kind after several years and is a fun new experience every time you play. good game at improving your micromanaging skills as well as macro.",1
"good if the game wouldnt bug out every time i have to launch it",1
"the only game that, through the workshop, i can play as stalin and go up against the likes of an archdemon and adolf hitler. 10/10",1
"this game is an example of pure intelligence and excellence. it is certainly in my top ten games all time! the game is made much better when you buy all of the dlcs.",1
"builds on the franchise with an improved gui and graphics quality. remains true to form, simple yet immersive to start. complexity scales to player experience and desire. expansions offer a whole new element making the game worth a revisit.",4
"this is a very enjoyable game if you have the patience to play it to its full potential",3
"it is a credit to the the francise. addicting formula hasnt changed much. this is the game i go to on default when i am sick of everything else.",3
"being a strategy game, it is one of my all time favourite games of all time. after the hours i have played, i have become hooked, and cant stop playing. good things: the gameplay is fun, you have so many things you can go into, but being the obvious, science, and domination are the main two things to go fourth to. i like that if your computer can not handle the full graphics of the game, or you just want to have a faster, and better view so you can see the resources around you, you can always switch to the strategic view (pressing f10). bad things: it is very time consuming, yet addicting. the amount of time it takes to complete a full game, requires you to play with friends most of the time, and not random people, so you can always save and go back to it any time you want to.",3
"this game is great if you like strategy games, aswell as turn-based games and real-life scenarios. if you are a history geek like i am, you will absolutely love this game!",1
"i need to have a clock visible at all times when playing this game so i dont play for 16 hours straight.",2
"sid meiers civilization v is my fav statergy game, im all into playing statergy or building games but i like this one a bit more. when i first showed my parents this game they said it was age of empires. it took alot of persuding but i finally got there and bought the game then to reliase that i need all the exspantions. so overtimei saved up until i could afford it. im on my 100th hour playing online (played it everyday on the bus offline witch doesnt count ): )",1
"boring game, civ 3 was a lot better, payed 50 dollars for a very boring and limited game with more things added later on with expansion packs when it should of already been in game when released. i miss the early 2000s when games came out complete with everything, what i mean by complete with everything, i mean with everything that should be in the game from release, but now big game companies release expansion packs or dlc when these content should of already been included in a $50 dollars game. this game seems to basic and simple to me, civ 3 is way more immersive and complex.",1
"this game is yet another golden egg given to us by sid meier. his skill at crafting these beautiful games is unmatched. i recomend this game to anyone who loves strategy or any casual gamer.",1
"i am a beginner with the civilization games and the strategy category in general, this game is so addicting it made me totally jumped right in. if you love simulation games and strategy games this would be the best of both worlds. if you also love history and culture, thats even better, because you get a lot of that, learn all the leaders names and stories to show off in front of your friends how much of a historian you are. oh, and last but not least, amazing soundtrack.",1
"i like it a lot when i play it with friends 10/10 but its hard too xd",1
"simple, but still challenging. great mods (canada mod!). worth it.",1
"being a mainly fps or fps/rpg type games fan, i thought id try a different genre so i bought the complete edition on the last steam sale to just see what all the fuss is about. now i know its the most addictive, where did the time go, just one more turn game i have ever played, highly recommended",2
"my advice is to just go for the full game with all of the add ons. adds pretty nifty features to the game and makes it more complete. although to me, i think that they purposely gave us half the game and left the rest as add ons for us to pay more money. meh.",1
"i dropped three nukes on the iroquois nation and they insisted they were winning the war 10/10.",1
"this is a good game but sooo much dlc.... they want all our money",5
"civilization v is, by and large, the best civ game ive played. i have spent countless hours playing this game, the modding community is fantastic, the ability to hotseat with friends is wonderful. this game is an all around gem!",4
"a great strategy game. its different enough from age of empires to make it a unique and refreshing take on this style of game. youll wonder where the hours went after playing a session of this. there are multiple ways to win and hundreds of moves to be made. if you fire up a game today, dont expect to get anything else done until tomorrow.",1
"love this game, its perfect for times when you just wanna get away from the constant hectic nature that is fps games. i love the fact that you can have the computer tottally betray you. catherine and oda were my best friends on my first playthrough, then they betrayed me and tried to sneak attack me. i then proceded to take out my rage by reducing both of them at the same time to 1 city nations. cathrine then betrayed oda and killed him. i cant trust cathrine now. 10/10",1
"there is no reason why this game shouldnt be in everyones library! this is possibly the most addiciting strategy game ive ever stumbled upon! totally worth paying for! its that perfect blend of military strategy and simulation game. youll be on here for god knows how long when you should be studying for that electronics exam (thats me) buy it!! with the dlcs!",1
"10:00 pm: okay, this is my last turn. 4:30 am: god damnit rinse and repeat. 10/10",2
"fantastic game, spend hours on it without even knowing",1
"freaking awesome!!! sid has done it again. he has a legacy me thinks.",1
"stayed up until 5 in the morning, nuking india. just one more turn/10",1
"long time civ fan, since the first game, all the way to new via colonization, alpha centauri, etc. civ iv with rise of mankind mod is still far superior. sadly, even with the expansions this is a much thinner experience, feels watered down. multiplayer is ok but doesnt make up for the lack of depth.",1
"this is one of the best strategy games around and i would definately recommend it to everyone.",2
"i am the king of my nation. i am the ruler of my kingdom. and i will  everything up - oda nobunaga",1
"so many hours of my life wasted in the game... incredibly addicting, but not once could i last long enough to the end of a game. its a lot more fun starting out than it is late game imo.",2
"everybody asks, where have all the hours gone? when recommending this game... to global domination my friends. now, if that doesnt interest the rest of you, go back to your soulless existence and leave me to bask in the glory that is civ 5.",2
"sweet game, i loved strategy games when i was younger. this is better than any of them. i only got this game yesterday and i put 9 hours into it, thats like nearly enough time to complete dishonoreds main story on high chaos. the gameplay mechanics are great and the game makes you feel really good about yourself when you win a war, mostly against ghandi. one word of advice for you. if you are allies with ghandi he will stab you in the back and nuke you. bye. -maiq the liar.",1
"a limitless gaming time. so many possibilities and having fun online or single player(or lan). one of the best games in that category!",1
"probably the best game in the civ series so far. i enjoy playing it and everytime i start the game its hard to quit. i would recommend this game to every fan of the civ series and to everyone searching for a challenge and good gameplay.",1
"great fun game. linux port is very stable. 0 crashes in over 250 hours of play.",3

"you see, tanks have a preset kill limit. knowing their weakness, i sent wave after wave of my own men at them until they reached their limit and shut down",1
"very fun strategy game. it is both appealing to the casual and strategic gamer it also ruined all of my friendships because my friends are stupid back-stabbing jerks 9/10",1
"holy time sink batman, this is one good game. never played much of the first 4, but i really am enjoying this one.",1
"i love this game, but fair warning, its addictive as all get-out",1
"fantastic game, deep gameplay mechanics and a wonderful multiplayer too.",1
"this game is like monopoly, if your doing good the game is great. if your doing bad/ playing with people who take this game way to seriously, its a nightmarishly long experience that you only desperatly just want to quit and you cant flip the board over in frustration either.",1
"great game, this is one my my favorate stragety games of all time. if you are a fan of turn based games then i would definetly reccomend it.",1
"awesome game with the dlc but the standard version is missing a lot of stuff from older civs. buy in bundle if price is reduced, but not only main game.",1
"very deep strategy game with complex systems to master. civ v has done a great job expanding on its concept and reimagining key features from past entries that have really brought this current rendition into the best the series has to offer to date.",1
"this game is verry fun and addicting. a surprising feature i found on it was the ability of hotseat play, which allows more than one person to play this game on the same computer!",1
"sid meiers civilization gameplay: 9.0 graphics: 9 music: 9.5 interface and control: 9 rating: 9",1
"theres nothing more fun than leading china to world domination :)",1
"one of the best strategy games ive ever played.if you like strategy games , you should definetely check this one out. unless you like turn based , i suggest you to reconsider your thoughts about turn base and check it anyway.",1
"a timeless game from a timeless serie. never played so much a game as this one. multiplay is a little difficult because of hardware performances over the net, but otherwise its real cool!",3
"if there is one game on the market that lets you devastate indians on a grand scale, its this one 10/10 would nuke vijayanagara again rip in pepperoni gandhi",3
"good game 10/10 can screw over friends by taking their workers.",1
"great 4x game that has a great easy to learn hard to master gameplay style.",1
"its the perfect game to play with one hand, while eating with the other. sound is not needed at all so watch tv on a second monitor. ive purposely stopped mysef from playing on many occasions because i dont want to still be at my pc 5 hours later. buy it",1
"and it was there george washington led the americans from 2000 bc to 3000 ad. he met many characters such as the man, ghandi, know for his peaceful protests, yet somehow, even after keeping their borders open and friendship constant, betrayed washington and then lost because washington had rockets, and rockets are awesome. by the way you cant play a quick game of civilization. ever.",1
"i honestly left this one alone for a while, as i first got it for free after filling out a game of the year poll. i wanted to play it but i was in a tf2 craze at the time and ignored it for a while. when i did finally get around to it, i found out that its surprisingly addictive and it was all i played or even paid attention to for a while. i dont even play very many strategy games (the closest thing to one ive played full through being pikmin) and this had me hooked almost immediately. the steam workshop support is also pretty amazing. just be aware of one thing. a quick game in this can last up to about 5 hours at its shortest.",2
"simply put, perhaps the best turn-based strategy game ever.",2
"possible side effects for playing this game are: lost sense of time, sleep loss, convincing yourself for just one more turn, anger issues, trust issues, gandhi issues, believing you can be a good leader, complete loss of social life, mental and physical health loss, addiction, and possible hallucinations of hexagons.",2
"it will take over your life, but its worth it....if you win!!",1
"a great game a must have for any civ fan easy to play hard to master",1
"okay, ive got to be at college at 9am tomorrow, ill just have a quick game on civ before i go to bed. 2 hours later damn it ghandi! you will perish! 5 hours later ah , 3 hours sleep it is true story. happend to me the day i wrote this review.",1
"a game where ghandi will nuke all your cities 10/10",1
"sid meiers civilization v is a strategy game, if you like games like age of empires and command and conquer this is definately the game for you, it requires thinking and time. its a very good game, i have playyed it for 4 hours straight with friends who wanted me to get this game, hope by this review you will get it too! i rate it a 8/10 because the graphics could have been a little better. but the gameplay is just fantastic!",1
"after buying this game, im finally happy. you want happiness? buy this game. dont look at the price, dont look at other reviews, dont look at anything...just buy it.",1
"france asked me to go to war with the celts then denounced me for war mongering. 10/10 would recommend",1
"honestly one of the best turn based strategy games out there. if you ever see civilization 5 on sale, i suggest you pick it up immediatly!",3
"700 hours of gameplay and only now i thought of posting a comment. well... 1. never boring. 2. simple if you decide to macromanage; the most complicated game ever - in case you decide to control everything. 3. awesome soundtrack. 4. very detailed graphics. zoom in and you can see the grass grow. later in the game, build nuclear missiles and observe the mushroom cloud. death to your enemies! make sure you purchase the two dlc; the game by itself seems childs play. the dlc add new layers of complexity. its on sale often. last time i checked the complete edition (game + 2 dlc) was 10 euro.",4
"if you want to kill yourself, this game is perfect for you! if not, i dont know.",1
"making secret alliances, declaring war on ghandi, expanding my civilization and taking control is a great feeling and if you like a good strategy game, this game delivers.",1
"if you love strategy and teaming up with your mates to build your empire and crush !!! your enemy i couldnt recommend a better game than this.",1
"really, the best part about brave new world is that its finally addressed every victory condition in the game and made each one not only more equally viable, but also just as busy. weaponizing culture works to bring it more in line with the other conditionsits something you have to work towards and not something you just happen to achieve. on top of that, the diplomacy changes make this system more interesting as well, and it all comes down to one thing: if you have civilization v and want to play more, you owe it to yourself to get this expansion.",1
"if you want an epic, extremely well thought out, well executed game, play this. my friend, who is a major civ junkie, says that civ iii is really the height of the civ series, but from my experience i can say with complete confidence that civ v is totally an incredible game. you have thousands of little levers you can pull to try to make your empire as powerful, inspiring, and in general as amazing as possible, and they all really immerse you into the experience. plus, you can learn a ton about history from the little articles theyve put into the information book in the game. one thing to mention: the game is completely different with the dlc. and playing really is ideal with both expansions. if you can get this with both of them, youre going to enjoy the game a lot more.",1
"this is based on a game where you can expand you can kill and you can recruit",1
"this game is a sleep destroyer, be prepared to lose your life if you start a game. it starts as one more turn, then ends tomorrow . if this game teaches you anything its dont trust the french or gandhi!",2
"addictive game: who doesnt want to go from farm to giant death robot? :d",1
"i cant start the game... i press play on the steam menu i choose the recommended directx 11 and what happens is a black screen pops up and then closes instantly... when i choose directx 9 the same thing happens, no errors pop up and i belive all my system requirement are met for the game. any help??",1
"scumbag ghandi. kill him yearly when you reach riflemen and he still has medieval units. also watch for napoleon - he likes to fight - bring units close to his borders to slow him down.",1
"its fun if you whana do a long game.you whill be angry and happy time to time on the game.but at thy end you whill be happy that you buyd this game because this is the civ you created!!!",2
"great game. is a refined experienced compared with older civs. the latest paths made it a little better, giving us back detailed statistics after the game. the hex-based map for combat was a needed upgrade that made it better. at the same time, you have new and better relatively peaceful options to pursue victory like diplomacy and culture.",1
"solid gameplay, intuitive system, brilliant tips / hints, multitude of gameplay models rolled into one, fast or slow paced. deffinitive game for any past settlers, stronghold, crusader kings, age of empires, age of mythology or any other city build / rts game. best line up of dlc (no surprise as its 2k ....borderlands) this gme will stand the test of time for sure!",1
"all that you need to know about this game is... that it is sid meiers civilization!! come on! you dont need more incentive!",1
">played as jose rizal - philippines (mod) >made friends with spain and japan. >gandi befriended me. >420 nuke-scoped spain and japan. >gandhi nukes me. >rip in peace pilipinas. >feelsbadman.jpg >went to bed crying. >cant control my emotions >palms are heavy >moms spaghetti",1
"yeah b. dont forget to wash behind your ears, that some ripe funk you got.",4
"excellent development over civ iv. missing quite a number of factions though. atleast there are so many mods to choose from :)",1
"this game is the best game ever made. 8/8 m8 that is my r8",1
"sid meiers civlization has always been a game to get you hooked up. if you enjoy the style after a few hours of play, youll soon find out you been playing this game for hundred of hours more. the civilization series has also one of the biggest modding community around; so there is always something new to play. my only critic is the lack or should i say, the absence of space scenarios and more future tech. with this in mind, i give civilization 8.5 out of 10.",3
"i say, playing as oda nobunaga and getting george cromwell born in the land of the rising sun really made me smile. and gandhi nuked osaka twice.",1
"great fun civ v has great single palyer and for me runs smoothly. however multiplayer on the other had is terrible. you cant stay in a single, well functioning game for more than 10 turns at the most. i would recommend for people who will play it single player but would recommending not buying it for multiplayer until a patch is released.",3
"being an avid sid meiers lover, i have to say that this game could have been better. it was great, but i feel they dumbed it down too much.",1
"this game is really addicting and well worth the $13.74 cad, keeps you busy and has many options to chose from and more than one way on how to play the game. the complete edition is what i got and its very fun to play. the only annoying parts i see in the game is when you use any nuclear bombs near a mountain the fallout stays there and you cannot use any of the workers to clear it. perhaps theres a mod to get rid of it? i kinda only wished there was more civilizations to pick from when youre setting up the game because with only few to pick some even with the dlcs. it seems like theres a lot more missing that the game could had placed in. this game is one of my most favorite games on steam right now. im glad i got to purchase it when it was only 60-70% off.",1
"hands down the best turn-based strategy game. you will come back over and over to this game. the nuances you will discover are incredible and make the game 150% replayable. just watch out because just one more turn will always end up four hours later wondering what time it is.",1
"ill be the thousandth person to say how addictive this game is, but its digital heroin. anyways, its awesome, and well worth the money.",2
"i really like the new civilization. some people were critical because they simplified parts of the game and didnt add anything revolutionary. i think they did a good job of streamlining it while keeping core gameplay elements the same.",1
"this game is great! i can spend days playing this game without getting bored, it keeps you at the edge of your seat with each moves of the ai or other players if you play online. very strategic.",1
"this is a turn-based game which you probably already know.it doesnt have the smartest ai.but it has a ton of replay value.tons of fun.if you do buy this game buy the complete edition.ive had the burden to buy most of the content that didnt come with the game.",1
"do i recommend this game. hell yes. this is one of the greatest games i have played and playing it with friends is even more fun. you can choose from many civilizations from the aztecs to russia and almost anyone else you can think of. so in total. yes i would reccoment this game to anyone and everyone.",1
"this is by far my favourite pc game, with over 500 hours played. it captures historical events whilst creating a new world. an interesting and fun time waster :) idk 5 stars or some  :)",3
"this game is awesome!!! not as awesome as civilization 2 but still , will beat any tbs game any time of the day.",1
"love the graphics compared to civ iv! and as always, an awesome soundtrack xx",1
"thsi is easily one of the best strategy games ive ever played",3
"i love this game. it uses indepth stragety with historical traits that are spot on and fun to learn about.",1
"the best game i have ever played. a really good turn-based strategy. you can play it over and over and over... again. you just cant stop playing. with all the expansions its just awesome.",2
"really great game, has amazing graphics and is a great step up from civ 4",1
"civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have ever played. there are some issues but those are so minor in comparison to all the great things firaxis has done to not only make this accessible to new players but even returning players as well. i can say with great confidence that you will not get a better game of strategy right now then what civilization v has to offer, it is just that good. [9/10]",1
"nothing better than beating up on the americans. bs seal of approval and a solid way to waste a weekend and feel unproductive.",1
"wish it had the civ iv sound of it. baba yetu, and leonard nemoy but great game still similar no stacking of units like in iv, the expansion packs are worth it also. the scenarios are hard, and the achievements are (good luck) impossible to get them all.",2
"if you see ghandi, no matter how early in game destroy him at that moment if you dont he will nuke your  into oblivion 5 times over.",1
"a true classic for all strategy lovers. ive never seen a game so complex and amazing looking. the movements are smooth but later in game the game start to slowly get an fps drop due to the vast amount of units. i guess that is natural, as most games would fail to get that right as well. the ai is smart, difficulty is at the right level to what you choose... maybe a little too good.",2
"great game. makes you think. lets you have fun. i recommend this game for anybody who likes strategic games, anybody in general. even if you dont like strategic games, at least give this game a couple goes.",1
"to be honest, civ 5 is one of the best games ive ever played. its music is compelling, catchy, and epic. the actualy gameplay itself is easy to learn, and it requires hard-thinking and well thought out strategies to win the game. the variety of different civiliazations is awesome, which each having their own unique skills. its enjoyable, fun, thrilling and addictive. now get ready to lose some sleep when you delve in to the world of sid meiers civilization v. personal rating: 9.5/10",1

"even if you dont have any of the dlc, this game is fantastic. completely a great experience all the way through. normally, im not too into strategy, but this game sparked my interest. again, a truly fantastic experience. one bad thing though, in order to get the whole enjoyment out of the game, you need to put a lot of money, time, and effort into it. one minor blotch on a utterly fantastic game. [9.75/10]",1
"i used to play the  out of civ 3. when this game first came out, i really liked it, but it seemed unpolished. now, with god and kings and brave new world, i cannot see myself ever wanting to play a past version of civ again.",2
"hmm i have a life ill stop next turn... oops how did 25 turns pass oh well i guess ill stop next turn next turn next turn next turn next turn next turn next turn next turn next. turn.",1
"extremely addictive. occasionally relaxing, occasionally infuriating.",2
"a bit slow, but fun and rewarding when you get something accomplished or look back at all the progress youve made. but i speak as someone with no multiplayer experience in this game. so... yeah.",1
"this game never gets old. i cant even count how many play throughs ive had with this game. the civilization series is, hands down, the best game series of all time imo.",2
"really enjoying civ 5, after buying it for the summer sale. its quite different from previous games, but i still love it!",1
"civ v is a truly amazing game that once you started simply cannot stop. theres no such thing as a short civ game. you sit down at 4pm thinking youll only play for an hour, then you glance over at the clock and notice youve spent the last 4 hours locked in a slow-moving land war against france. i feel like civ is perhaps the best strategy games i have ever played, or at the very least in the top three.",1
"germany has found the new religion islam in the holy city of berlin -10/10",1
"what a surprise! ive never played civ until three days ago. i still wondering why didnt i install the game and played it right away after my purchase. this is a great great game. even if youre not a fan of strategy games or so you should play this civ v.",1
"once you get the complete edition of this game, this is easilly one of the best turn based strategies i have ever played. very addicting, and fun once you have a bunch of friends to play with.",2
"as addicting to me as civ 2 was back in college. i think about it, i dream about it, and i totally dont trust napoleon.",1
"best strategy game out there. addicting gameplay with so many different things to build and go for, and a ton of dlc. this game is a must have for strat gamers!",5
"starting a game at midnight is definitely a poor choice. youll tell yourself that youre going to just save your game and pick it up in the morning. that wont happen.",1
"words cannot describe this.. just play it and youll see for yourself!",1
"very fun game with dlc. the randomization helps make every round different.",1
"this was my first civ game so i cant compare it to past games, but ive thoroughly enjoyed this game since it first came out. each expansion has added a ton to the game. the first gods & kings expansion gave civ v a lot of depth and introduced a lot of new elements, i wouldnt buy any less than the gold edition for a new buyer. then the brave new world expansion added even more, so if youre able just buy it all.",1
"if you enjoy playing risk or settlers of catan, pick this game up. it sets up compelling, friendship destroying conflicts that will have your group debating for days.",1
"this game is absolutelty fantastic, and has a huge replay value.",3
"ill just play for a little .....next thing you know the day is over, its 4am, and you forgot to feed the dog.",1
"definitly one of the best games ive ever played! a very extensive game, youll have a lot of fun playing it!",1
"a very good and engaging game, warning!! multiplayer may destroy friendships!",1
"10/10 would play more if my computer could run it. recommend it if you have a better pc than me.",1
"great turn based strategy game, they removed the issue with stacking units from older civilization games and some new improvements to gameplay, but dlcs are way too expensive.. they cost more than the base game...",1
"civilization v is one of these games that can eat time like no others. i fell into civilization many years ago with the first game, and follow them without failing ever since, with never a bit of regret.",1
"great game you can come back to time and time and time again",3
"the world is full of mondays. and hexagons. and giant death robots. at least when people get futuristic technology. until then... well... we are frolicking about with clubs and spears blind in some clouds... life. ahh i love it. actually i hate it. i only love it when i get giant death robots and blow up the world! burn hahahahahaha buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurn! hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ahem. yeah. get it.",1
"since i bought the game i was very impressed by how good the graphics were but it does require a high spec computer in order to run with little or no lag.",1
"this is a great game to pass the time, and play with your friends! favorite game thus far! a must have!",2
"i played this game for 50 hours in the first three days of owning it. it is one of those games where once you get a basic grasp on gameplay you play a lot, then you start ignoring your friends and girlfriend, and in the end you stop eating until someone comes into your room two days later to find out if you are alive or not...so i highly recommend this game!",1
"one of my favourite games, if not my favourite. 10/10 would nuke france whilst being ghandi the ruffless dictator.",2
"a perfect continuation to an excellent franchise. it addresses problematic parts of older versions to streamline game play.",1
"its streamlined but that doesnt mean its bad. troop management on the field is more important now with the stacking roops being gone and cities being able to defend themselves.",1
"extraordinary game. way better than an rts. the only complaint is that it takes a looooong time to finish a game, usually.",3
"me like yes good 4 stars out of 2 thumbs thanks obama",1
"simply put, one of the most robust turn based strategy games to date. plenty of achievements to keep anybody occupied. many different styles of play and ways to customize your experience. a must for any 4x lover.",5
"absolutely love this game. so much hours of replayability - i totally feel like i could play this for ten times what ive already put into it in terms of hours. really awesome gameplay that is incredibly intuitive and streamlined.",1
"fantastic game!!! ive spend countless more hours than my hectic study schedule allows for!! love it!",1
"personally i am a huge history buff and yet i had never played any of the civilization games. i purchased it skeptically (after purchasing microsofts similar game) and was blown away with civilization. if your into history, great game play and fresh expansions (with a decent steam community behind it) - get this game!",1
"always been a huge fan of the game series and always will be with the depth and character it brings to the strategy genre! :)",1
"i highly reccomend this game its the best game on steam",3
"the only civilization game ive played before i played civilization v was civ.exe aka civilization. like, the first one. that is how old school i am. but enough about me, this is about civilization v. the first thing that hit me about civilization v (after figuring out how to prevent it from crashing during the intro video, that is) was how crappy the graphics are. everything is like little men and cities and vehicles that stuff. thats disgusting. civilization had little squares for everything (except planes - they were circles). cities were squares, men were squares, tanks, boats, catapults, missiles. everything was squares and that is how it should be. but its ok because civilization v has this strategic view that makes everything squares like they should be. once i found that setting i was able to enjoy the rest of this games bugs in style.",2
"the best strategy game ive ever played, as long as you have brave new world. great online gameplay with friends, great offline gameplay with mods, its fun and all that shiz but it takes forever. a+/10",1
"every want to take over half a continent, or name all your cities tick? in this game you can, as you strategise on the plan for your civilization, wether it is building the notre dame or conquering every civilization in sight. it is rather hard to finish a game, one game can last for hours. i rate this 8 curries out of 10 curries",1
"i bought this game and played a match. its been 15 hours so far.",1
"this is a very fun and intuitive piece of software 100/101 must buy.",1
"after 300hours of playing this i can say. dude. get the game. i managed to play this 300 hours without getting bored dude. its epic. its fun. its interesting. and guess what! you actually learn stuff too. so your parents will like if you play this aswell. go play. be happy! i am not asking. i am commanding. this game is too sweet to not be played",2
"brilliant game! you can play one round about 5~10 hour`s. its addictive! a lot of variants to win, such as space program. get it! 9.5/10",1
"great game overall. playing with friends is the most fun, but adding in content from the workshop is great too.",1
"i took over a friends town and named it dongersrgr8 9/10",1
"play this game if you like micromanaging numbers and the feeling of success when your numbers are higher than your opponents. the only non-numbers thing is positioning (of cities and units). and i suppose diplomacy. the gameplay is very good though. it has a moderately steep learning curve, but once you understand the mechanics and learn the costs of everything you will start to think more strategically and thats when it becomes fun.",1
"with the new content from the dlcs this game got interesting again. its much more complex now than it used to be. the developers seem to have taken note of what the players thought of the game, its better than ever! :d",2
"without the dlcs, its a good game. with the dlcs, its the best turn based stratagy game out there.",3
"fantastic statagy game. breathes fresh air into the series, but holds true to core mechanics of past games",1
"a fantastic game, i love to become the ruler of the world.",4
"for those who have never played civ before the interface is streamlined and gameplay tightened and this is a great game to start with. for those that have played this will be a refreashing experience in that this is unlike any game before it. you may find it lacking in research and civics areas but it is just different. i know different is scary but it is worth it for the new and improved, more tactical, combat where the grid is now hexes, cities must be sieged, and only 1 combat unit per tile. (no more stupid large stacks of units) give it a shot! i highly recommend it!",2
"civ 5 continues to top the rankings because of its dynamic replayability. take control of over thirty civilizations and attempt to forge for own empire is awesome. since maps are randomized, essentially every game is different yet exciting.",3
"civilization five in my opinion the best in the series it completly balances the game and is even better with brave new world.",2
"one a scale of 1-10 id give it a 9; it is a great game overall, but it doesnt account for the little things that make history dynamic, such as internal revolutions creating brand new nations, and it could use a bit more in the diplomacy, no removal, just addition.",1
"civilization v is one of the best strategy games i know. you can play it over and over again, and its fun every time. i strongly recommend this game and all of its dlc to anyone who wants a good challenge and also, if anyone has the chance, burn that traitorous  ghandi for me.",1
"great game i enjoy it each time i play, it makes you think",4

"fantastic game - once you get past the learning curve that is!",2
"its great very good if u want to make an empire or just farm and study tech, its just great and make sure u get brave new world its even a better game with it!",1
"this game is a really good game. there are a few people that hate on it, but as you can see, the reviews are overwhelmingly positive. the graphics arent bad. at all. you can see the soldier units move and attack each other, you can see the workers making whatever youre improving, and you can even see the wonder buildings inside of your city. very cool. i really like how this was made. the only thing i have a problem with is that in late-game, it gets really laggy, but thats probably because im on a 5 year old mac laptop. but it still runs really well early game, and i really like it. i feel like the money i paid for civilization 5 was well spent because i can get a lot of hours of playing from this game. there are many different things you can do, paths you can take, and things you can build. every game is different, which is why i really like this game. id reccomend this game. 11/10.",1
"one time i peed in someones pool while standing on the outside of it. good game.",1
"a very long addictive gameplay! its really fun and worth the wait (turned based)",1
"very fun and well made turn based strategy. lacks a bit on variety departement, still 9/10.",1
"this game is freaking awesome! it is the flagship of its genre, i have nothing bad to say about it, in its current state. the unfortunate thing about games like these is that they dont get amazing until they get like two expansions come out. in this case the expainsions g&k and bnw make the game a true masterpice. now i will admit that civ v isnt as committed to historical accuracy as europa iv, and its not as complex. however its so much fun to play. so much so, that your significant other may begin to resent the amount of time you spend playing it. the senarios are also great, especially if you only have time for a 100 turn game. i like the scramble for africa one myself.",3
"great turn based strategy, with some interesting new gameplay mechanics compared to the previous games.",2
"i dont have bnw, but gods and kings is amazing. anyone who likes turn based games this is the game for you. :d",3
"one of the best strategy games ever. though the ai is sometimes stupid.",1
"probably the best game i own. many hours spent on this wonderful game. not only the gameplay, but also the amazing community. 10/10",2
"the game engages you in a way that hours would pass at a moment. even a simple four player island map at quick settings costed me around 7 hours.",1
"jam alert, this is my jammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm",1
"very good strategy game.exceeded my expectatons.solid gameplay and easy to learn.9/10",1
"a classic revamped well, my last play of this game was civ2, so im jumping to this, no longer need to have roads everywhere, a more intuitive system, you can play many different ways with many different advantages. still this feels quite military based, almost forced, a great new and polished version of a classic. the simple view is a perfect idea for lower end computers too! speeds up gameplay alot. the addition of marathon mode is quite highly recommend to try, it really feels like you grow with your empire, then play a standard game and you can see how much you learn playing a very long game. i would recommend this for beginner to advanced players, it can suite the toughest, and the newest to gaming.",1
"one of the best games i have ever played, hours of fun with this. a must buy!!!",2
"an awesome game. i dont recommend to the restless.",3
"it took me a while to get used to the whole turn based thing, but now i realize that its addicting as hell and therefore great for the developers, so thumbs up for that. unlike other strategy games ive tried its not that much to organize and gather, which makes it easier to focus on the strategy/occupying land/backstabbing/building armies part  and i guess that deserves a thumbs up as well. and as others already pointed out: beware of gandhi.",1
"nice game, it will let you to understand real historical actions (wars, coups etc.) and you will have a great time, especially playing with friends :)",2
"this game is a beast strategy game with great graphic and is just fun :d",1
"play gandhi and rule over the world with nukes / play against gandhi and get rekt. 10/10",1
"all civs have been fun to play, but this one steps it up. there is always so much to do and manage when playing this game. micro your individual cities while having to macro your entire civilization is a fun challenge. with so many different ways to win other then build a lot of military and attack, many types of people would be attracted to try this game. multiplayer with friends is also a great way to lose an afternoon.",2
"best game ever, just finnished my first game as the dutch and going back for a second!!!",1
"amazing game worth the money and id completley recomend it!",1
"the perfect game for the sort of person thats always wanted to found sikhism in stockholm, then conquer kyoto and build the mosque of dijenne there in 1456.",1
"awesome game, very deep and satisfying! it was worth every penny! very fun to play with friends and alone, but kinda lacks the giant freaking huge maps that the previous games had, in my opinion. but that might just be my brain playing tricks on my! anyway, totally worth it! buy it!!",1
"an all time favorite. removing stacked units has really changed the strategy in this game compared to previous iterations.",3
"stays true to the series, a worthy new title in the civ lineup.",2
"this is civ5, a game where you conquer people and nuke stuff. at least according to me. for the uninformed, its a hexagon-grid turn-based strategy with a focus on combat, diplomacy, city management, and hurling nuclear weapons at people. no story here, folks, you make the story yourself. +good visuals. +stupid amount of mods. +map editor and modding tools. +scenarios are pretty cool. -ai is irrational in terms of diplomacy. -multiplayer exists, but its pretty bad. -no story except for what you make.",2
"a bit doubtful as to whether i would like this game before i first played it, and in the first two days after buying it i played about 19 hours of it. this is a fantastic game.",3
"ive lost many hours to this game, literally makes time flow faster.",1
"dunno if, like me, youve played many of the previous incarnations of civilization before. they all follow the similar sorta premise. for me, each one seems to have a slightly different tilt than the last one, so, until you get used to it, it always seems slightly worse than the previous edition. i gotta say though, that this one seems to be (once, as i said, you get used to it) an even more well-rounded game, offering several different avenues for victory (although the domination type is likely all that most people aspire towards). the one downside id say is that it eats away at my day all too easily. you can never just sit down for a few minutes with it, and even when you plan to do that you end up looking at the time several hours later. either way, definitely a game worth playing assuming you can invest time in it.",1
"this is a great game. i cannot say enough good things about it. best 4x ever.",3
"this game is really awesome but i have never really played rtss before so im kind of awful. fun though, id tell my friends to try it if they havent already.",1
"best strategy simulator out there. the dlc makes brilliant changes to gameplay. highly recommended",1
"one of the best games in my steam inventory, combines history with fun tactical gaming to produce a game which will have you hooked for hours. on its own civ v is a good game but with the dlcs it is a masterpiece which truely reflects the rise of real civilisations. huge number of civs to play as combined with many different map moads means that you wont be bored for the first few days you buy this game. so in short an absolutly great game which i would recommend to anyone who is looking for a game about building might nations.",2
"day 1: as kamehameha (polynesian) ive nuked babilon with my bombers. totally worth it. warning: this game is a hell of a drug. play responsibly.",1
"i have owned this for a year and made it through 2 or 3 games. in other words, a reputable sequel to the predecessors.",1
"a great game that you can spend hours just playing through one match and end up getting rocked by another civilization. watch out for ghandi especially because he is a sneaky one. i would suggest at some point in time in trying out the game difficulty diety because it is quite the challenge. i never played a civ game until recently and have enjoyed everything about the game and expansions of the game. a casual strategy game that can get intense at any moment.",5
"after a long series of backstabbings, had the pleasure of dancing on gandhis corpse. vishnu/10",1
"in what other game can you spread the great religion of herpes across the land?",2
"good game, does consume a lot of time. mods and the dlc improve the game greatly",2
"this game is so fun and addicting to play, it will take your hours away without you even thinking about it. defintely recommend picking it up.",1
"i absolutely loathe turn-based strategy games, but civ was a ton of fun for me. if youre afraid of the slowness, there are a lot of easy ways to turn up the speed. if youre not very much into strategy games, this game allows you to enjoy the strategy experience casually by giving you achievable yet challenging tasks. just make sure to turn the difficulty down a bit and the pacing up a bit. the tutorial and ui are very well-designed and are great for civ beginners. id recommend this over civ 4 unless youre into strategy games already...",1
"what can i say about this game that hasnt already been said. stay away. it will consume your very being. your soul. once, i sat down to play civ at 9am in the morning, and when i looked up after a while i noticed that the clock read 10. wow, that was a lot of game for a hour! too bad it was 10pm. 10/10 would play again",1
"one more turn well that turns into 4 more turns which turns into im really getting tired of you eyeballing me like that england.....the world descends into war, and if youve done it right, you rule the world. you never quite know what youre gonna get and early on you just might get quick attacked and well game over these dudes with junky swords and no armor just wrecked your only city and thats it, all that is left of you is what will be in the archaeological records. im a firm believer of spreading like the plague in this game, then once everyones mad about you grabbing up all the land, build an army and enact your own manifest destiny, the others will either fall in line or theyll talk smack about you and spy on you giving you an excuse to go after them....this game....just buy it!",2
"ok sid this game is nice and all but youre not getting any of those dlc funbux from me until multiplayer ing works",1
"great game, played for years. as soon as i tried to utilize the steam cloud functions though, the entire thing crashed. now, every time i try to load or save a game the program crashes to desktop. ive been in communication with steam support for 9 days now and they keep giving me the runaround with solutions that are not affecting my problem at all. 2k support didnt even bother responding to my request. whats more, right before all this happened i encouraged two friends to buy this game, now i cant play with them at all. im terribly vexed.",2
"at first i thought very little, but with time i came to love it!!",1
"while vanilla civilization v was a solid entry to the venerable series, the expansion brave new world really makes the game shine. id go as far to say that civ v: brave new world is a contender for best game expansion of 2013. the expansion reinvents how culture works in civ v and offers more interesting gameplay choices when it comes to trading and diplomacy. the only real criticism you could make is that they shouldve had these in the game in the first place! but thats just the way it is with civ expansions isnt it? :)",3
"this game is so fun and addicting to play, it will take your hours away without you even thinking about it. defintely recommend picking it up.",1
"ive loved every civilization game since i played civilization iii way back in the day. the scope of these games has always impressed me, and civ 5 does not disappoint in this regard. some die hard civ players were taken aback from the hex-combat mechanic of the game, but personally, i think that the change was a step in the right direction, making me not dread waging war with my neighbors (which in previous civ games always felt like a chore.) the base game is fun, but ive found that the two major expansions really have improved the experience (gods and kings and brave new world). brave new world, especially, is an excellent addition to the cultural victory scenarios. civ 5 is the most played game in my small steam collection, and with the wide array of mods and community support, it will probably stay that way for years to come.",2
"while i still prefer some aspects of civilization iv (culture, religion), the game play and combat mechanics improvements (stacking, etc.) made in civilization v make it hard to go back.",1
"this game is one of the best games ive ever played great improvement from civ 4",1
"if you are looking for a good civ game, look no further. i may catch some flak for this but beyond earth really seemed to tank in ratings and reviews are not very positive and rather mixed but leaning towards negative.",1
"great game, played over 600 hours and have had it for a year.",3
"lots of fun and challenge in one game. i had a great time with the basic game so i can only imagine how great this game is with dlc! my country was super badass and commoners loved me not to mention the annoying neigbring country kept trying to attack my border cities but failed every time! lol in the end there was no winner. expect me.",1
"the usual addictive civilization, definately a must for the civilization series. i just would love to see the game go a bit more ahead to the future.",1
"its a great addition to the civ series. though i cant wait for the new one to hit this oct",1
"one of the best games i have played! when the new expansion came out, the whole game play was changed! making the game more refreshing and more enjoyable!",1
"this game is one of the best strategy games out there. its from the master of turn based strategy, sid meier. i give it 12 out of 10. a definitive must have!",4
"at first i thought it was just going to be another one of those rts games, but now that i see it, and play i have done a complete 360. if anything, this is a smart game. its lush and challanging, and i have so much respect for that.",1
"i havent even finished a match, i just keep restarting because i have a fetish for the opening moves. 10/10 fulfills my niche desires",2
"civ 5 is one of the greatest games i have ever played!!!",1
"awesome game.i have over 300 hours on this game, and i still find myself up at 2 am playing. with multiple methods of victory, and a vast array of civilization sporting their own unique traits civ. 5 offers almost endless replay-ability with an entire. the game also goes pretty in depth with the background information with all the civilizations, technology, and units in game which as a history lover i appreciated. also, the dlc refines some aspects of the game already there, adds more civilizations, and adds even more features. strongly recommended to even rts lover. 10/10 buy this",3
"dont play before going to bed. youll end up....not going to bed for a good while",1
"started the game up once and stuck for 5 hours straight, great game!",1
"the all-time champion of strategy games. though not its most complex entry, the best balance of complexity and speed.",2
"the best strategy game ive ever played, multiple aspects that make this game fun and entertaing.",1
"a lot of fun with bnw and g&k expansions. get a buddy or two, and see who can spread their ly named religion the furthest, create an absurd amount of natural wonders, or accumulate a dragons hoard of cash.",1
"its a very fun and strategic game good for people who like strategy beacuse thats the main focus of the game",1
"really good game. but beware. once you go in... you wont come out for a loooooong time.",1
"this is a real time strategy on such a scale i cant even beging to compliment it. the graphics are simply amazing, wonders are well detailed. the histoical information in the civilopedia is great for light reading, and the thought put into the units was wonderful. i mean, how many people knew about turtle ships and galeasses before playing this game. also the sense of reality in the diplomatic relationships between civs is relativly realistic. it is a challenging game, but not impossible. i like the five ways to achive victory as well. overall 10/10 stars and i cant wait to see how their latest game civiliation, beyond earth turns out!",2
"a great game, great strategy. if you desire to be the ruler of the world via conquest or diplomacy. wish to form a more cultured world or to simply leave your enemies on earth while you travel to a distant star. this is the game to play.",2
"a great way to get bollocked by ghandi and bollock others as ghandi.",1
"great game --- more about strategy, and has many factors and different parts of the game you have to think about, rather than rome total war ii where you only command armies.",1
"even after 850+ hours i still love this game! if i want a simple time sink or a super stressful tactical slug fest i can find it here. i would suggest this for all ages by the way.",5
"the best civilization of the whole franchise so far! totally recommended to even gamers with no experience in strategy at all. very friendly and informative menus coming with awesome graffics and the characteristical just one more turn gameplay! a must get for everyone! p.s. thanks man for gifting it to me <3",1
"this game is great for all kinds of players. for those that like to be a war mongering leader, to those who want to out class their opponents in technology, and even for the peace lover who wants to win by diplomacy or culture. with all the expansions there are so many choices for civilizations and ways to play, the replay value is amazing. i love to personally play team games with my frineds online, but the options for freestyle single player or situation games makes this a game that i cant get enough of.",2
"i cannot give any kind of review. i am not able to play due to the game doesnt proceed past the intro when it starts skipping like a broken record. yes, i have all the minimum requirements necessary plus more. i should be able to run and play several games at the same time however, as i said, i cannot even access this one. best of luck to anyone who is able to play this game.",1
"hours of fun both against ai and against friends. great for casual and more competitive gaming.",2
"i dont know what people are talking about im playing right now andi havent lost track of the time or been attacked by gahndi once oh give me a second i just gotta move this unit .................... holy crud its 2:00 now and ive been nuked by gahndi",1
"this is a very good strategy game, but they need to put down the turns of the npcs!!",1
"the year is 1470 ad. ghandi declared war against george washington, king ramses ii and napoleon. 10/10. history books are now obsolete.",1
"its not fast paced but is very strategic. i like it and if thats what you are interested in then you will too. it is filled with real history and leaders. the graphics are great! i also realy like the hexagons rather than the boxes from old civ games. some reviews say that its like watching paint dry but i would disagree. its not action filled, but the point is to give you time to develop your strategy.",1
"a great civilization. with easy to get basic gameplay, but quite challenging on higher difficulty levels. i enjoyed playing it for hours, but finally got bored of the non sense of the ai. its just too bad you cant unify the world by becoming ally with every other civilisation, you can just bribe city state to vote for you when youre rich enough. or easily kill everyone else quite quickly when you get a sufficient edge on them, or wait to build the spaceship if youre not bored or really stuck.",1
"amazing!! civ 5 requires you to think strategically and lightning fast reflexes wont help when youre in a world war. its all in the mind",1
"if you think youve wasted enough time, and you havent played civ, then there is clearly alot of time left to be wasted. alot of time.......alot. of. time. all of the time.",1
"civilization v is a very slow paced game that can take days to complete. singleplayer is one of the most boring experiences i have had in a game. grab a few friends to play with and this is a solid 8/10. very few glitches i found and tons of replayability. for those casual gamers out there, this is the way to go. building your empire or knocking others down, this is the best empire building game out there. solo rating: 4/10 multiplayer rating: 8/10",1
"great for a quick game if youve got 5 minutes to spare and dont mind winding up cancelling the rest of your afternoon.",1
"game is really great, i would like a couple more ways to win... maybe currency related but other than that it is a fantastic game.",1
"i have spent the most hours on this game. a game that i  for. it is so lovely when you nuke the enemys capital, and when you go on super easy so you just dominate just for the hell of it. if you dont like this game, you havent played it or given it a real try.",3
"a very fun game! reccommended for people with patience and is willing to wait a few minutes to get started. multiplayer is fun because you are up against real people! enjoyable for the whole family! going up agaist friends is fun and i reccommend it to everyone! ---what happened to me-------- i was a small civilization and then a war started and i claimed around the enemy and they fired a nuke at one of my cities! so i fired 3 nukes at each of their citys and invaded!",1
"honestly, buy the complete edition, it saves you money, and whatever you do dont buy the standard at all if you only want to play classic.",1
"this is a great turn-based strategy game that i would highly recommend.",1
"civ v is one of those games that you want to play a little bit after dinner and then you realize its almost breakfast. with all the expansions, this game is so vast, so varied and with so much written into it you wouldnt even scratch the surface 100 hours of gameplay later. i highly recommend it for people that arent strategy fans too  playing in an lower difficulty still gives you an enjoyable experience from end to end.",1
"i had recently bought this game beacause it was popular so i wanted to try it out. i had classes the next day so i thought id play for 10 minutes or so ( i started at 8ish pm )the next moment i looked at my watch it was 2 am; damn this game is addicting. you can choose fast paced but i didnt. no worries my classes started later than usual at 10am so i had time to sleep but damn this game makes you lose track of time. good luck. keep your watches close and your heart closer to the game.",1
"many new optiuons and different game play from the other civs. in some way it tends to be civ lite, but once you get all the options in play it has its own depth and plays much faster than the earlier games. the mega death stacks of unit are gone. taking cities over without warfare are few and far between. a nice fun addictive game.",4
"love this game, i deffintly recomend buying the complete pack, it is stupid to just buy civilization v with no dlc.",4
"either die as a legend, or live long enough to see mongolia betray you.",1
"wery good game but europe universal is much bether",1
"i recommend this because im pra1m. the god of games has spoken, this game is the polla.",1
"i have nowhere near as much play time as some of the other people here, but this is a fun game. camels were continuously coming into my city from rome and i had no idea why. i was just about to wage war on ceaser when i found out that it was just a trade route that he set up to the roman embassy that was in my city. 10/10 would get pissed off at camels again",1
"civ 5. where can i start? civ 5 is one of those games with everything. amazing graphics, in depth gameplay, astounding soundtrack, and a variety of different characters with personalities of their own. i would reccomend this to a friend, definitley. it is definitley worth the money. can not stop playing. literally. it is becoming a problem..",4
"can lose yourself in gameplay for hours with many interesting scenarios to play out or create for yourself. very nice graphics and soundtrack. go for it.",1
"the gold standard when it comes to turn based strategy. this series has time and time again proven to be endlessly entertaining offering a great deal of complexity and depth. i would reccomend this to anyone who enjoys a game like risk.",2
"great turn based strategy game. its relatively user driven, in that you can make one game last for 10 hours or 100 hours, whatever your preference. you can fly through the game using auto productions and other ease features, but there are great opportunites for micromanaging galore if that is your suit. loads of dlc make the game a lot more fun, especially the addition of religion, as well as the reworked global political system, cultural victory, and diplomatic victory, as seen in the brave new world expansion. i would suggest playing on prince difficulty or above however. aside from learning the game, anything lower then that is rather broken in terms of ease of victory. watch out for ghangis khan.",1
"10/10 this game is so cool. i would get it if it was on sale or not it is so good",1
"great britain wouldnt open their borders for me. i declared war and lost. 10/10",1
"they should just cut the pretense and call it crack.",1
"the ultimate 4x game. its the most polished 4x game around, anyone who is interested in the genre should get it. it might not end up being your favourite, but you will get a lot of joy from this wonderful game regardless. just make sure to get the dlc.",1
"civ 5 is very addictive since brave new world came out. the ai can be buggy and the game can have some balacing issues, but its not enough to distract from how much i love this game.",5
"very good game! enjoyed every moment! only thing that bummed me out was that gold edition doesnt include brave new world dlc. even though brave new world came out after i should still get it. other than that,great game play, good historical background , a good combat system considering its turn based. keep it up fireaxis and sid meiers!",4
"just all around fun game to play when you are in the mood to be nuked by ghandi 10/10",1
"probably my second favorite game on the pc. makes you feel important.",2
"great game, recommend it because its free. main issue is how slowly you earn certs to get better equipment to get more certs.",1
"buggy, buggy, buggy now with gods & kings, last 3 times i played multiplayer its desynced where one player has advanced a turn (they see turn 16 for example when i see turn 15) and the game just remains frozen. why cant a simple turn based game be more stable? surely a simple board-game clone would be at least stable by its 5th incarnation!? i like the game concept, but so sick of its little issues and bugs.",1
"this game will take hold of your soul and force you to play it for hours.",1
"game in singleplayer is great... if not awesome (excluding stupid ai). multiplay on the other hand is total garbage... while using simultaneous turns with units movement and attacking animations turned on game f... up the word simultaneous as camera runs to show you the movement of you allied friend. when those animations are turned off (totally kills the atmosphere of game) the game plays similiar to board game, which you could do yourself if you get a pen, scissors and some paper... theres also no animations for faction leaders in diplomacy window... x_x also annoying stuff... but most crappy multiplay option is auto-peace. if you almost destroy enemy units after a hard fight... nope ai says peace and runs away... if you want to enjoy it, then this game is only for single play really. if you want multiplay then go invite few friends over and play monopoly.",1
"legend a complete legend! everybody should play this game, one of my favorites:d",1
"been playing this since civ i and this reiteration is just as fun as the first time i stayed up for two days straight playing i. great game for hardcore gamers and noobs alike. great gf/wifey game too!",2
"probably the only game ill ever play for over 100 hours ten ata ten",1
"pants down, best turn based strategy game ever. there isnt much more satifying then being the mayans and nuking the incas. makes no historical sense. but hey who cares, its fun.",1
"this is a absoloutsly fantastic strategy game, the best of its kind. extremely, highly reccomended.",1
"very addictive and a different game everytime you restart.",1
"it is a great statergy game, i would recommed to anyone who like to just sit down and play a game as i have played for 6 hours in a row before, in his also good on multiplayer as you can compete with your friends to win the title of great startergy master and overall ruler, i really enjoyed and i hope anyone else who get it does enjoy it to.",1
"youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you, but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter. 20/10",1
"press button make city, make buildings, create units, attack city, destroy city, capture city. repeat and win.",1
"civilization v is a very complex but easy to follow game with many different ways to play it you can invite some friends or people you dont know to have a massive battle for victory with the unique methods of winning: culture, domination, time and science. you can load up some scenarios to play without having to start from scratch. or maybe the single player mode catches your eye by setting up your game just how you like it. never have i seen a game so fun and player friendly in a very long time. once you start playing, you cannot stop! if you enjoy a fantastic balance between strategy and action buy this game right now. id give it a 9.5/10",1
"one of the best strategy games ive ever played. just start and you never stop playing.",1
"best turn based strategy ever play as any civ old or new",4
"a great strategy game, and if you play smart, you can conquer the other people easy. take the city states and build your cities there, then wipe out nations one at a time",1
"this game is great for when you just want to take it slow. trade, conquer, or just be completely peaceful, this is one of my favorites!",1
"i fully endose this product and/or service of which i have no affiliation with",1
"very fun game, but i feel that it is a lot better with some of the dlc",1
"great strategy game that gets you to deeply appreciate the long history of civilizations around the world, master the diplomacy among the nations, and above all, train your leadership capabilities in surviving the competition of great nations. with the exception of lengthy macro-management of resources and upgrades, the game itself is more than just a pc game, but a living encyclopedia for people to learn history and interntional politics.",1
"ter r lats of octagones nd  but ovral its a pretii gud game",1
"absolutely stunning game, battle with historys greatest leaders !!!",1
"if i had to choose between this, or satisfying my heroin addiction, i would choose this.",3
"while i was disapointed at first with this game and its lack of historically plausible scenarios like with total war i still found myself enjoying it immensely. even if ghandi will attack sweden without provocation.",2
"now, this game is amazing...of course youre gonna need the dlc brave new world to get the full experiance that you should have, which the gold edition does include for cheaper. i bought the gold edition whenever it was out for sale that had took off a lot of the price. personally, i would wait for it to go on another sale to get it because it is a pretty high price without the sale. so, overall i would say it would get a 4/5 star rating with brave new world, base game on only 2.5/5. it just doesnt have a good enough amount of game with it. so, yes i would definitley reccomend this game to anyone looking for an amazing 4x game they can play with friends or solo.",1
"sid meiers is one of the best games in my steam liarary to date and ive had stream a long time, play as countrys and proceed through the ages, advance your country, become allies with others or engage battles that need thinking to be able to win, your advisors are a good addition to the game making it easy for new commers to play and understand what to do. many maps mods and expansion packs to choose from. one of the best strategy games i have ever played, if not one of the best games ive ever played. 9/10",1
"oh hai!!!! i love this game. probably one of the best games ive played. theres a few things from civ 4 that i would put back in... and the expansion is fantastic as well. pick this up if you enjoy strategy, but keep in mind that 1 game can last up to 8 hours if you survive the early to mid game :) i give it 4.5 meows out of 5. wtf does that mean? who knows.....",2
"you can kill gandhi 11/10 kony kush game of the year",1
"this game is for those who like staretegy games but want to have some more time to think what to do.",1
"by far the best of the civ games so far in my opinion, and the first one ive really liked since civ ii (not that i disliked civ iv, just...not this much). the ai is better, the resources are much better-implemented than ever before, as is the map generator, and the overall gameplay experience is smoother and better. gods and kings and brave new world substantially improve the gameplay, and are also worth picking up.",5
"great leave me alone im in my own world for 5 hours type game... once you hit next turn you dont realize youve been playing for the next 100 turns lol... only gripe is if you play a huge map the game will begin to freeze once you approach the modern era & thats when all the real fun starts. still.. 5 stars from the strategy lover",5
"i love this game have tons of hours on it and it is endless fun great game to play with friends on.",1
"one more turn then its bed time i swear this time.",2
"this game is awesome!!! not as awesome as civilization 2 but still , will beat any tbs game any time of the day.",1
"superbly handled turn based game that spans throughout the ages. perfectly balanced and requires someone actually thinking about the game to succeed. easy to understand, but hard to master. its great seeing how far your civ can come, starting from the very beginning with just farms, to the end with spaceships, giant death robots and nukes. this is how a game of the world should be presented.",1
"a brilliant strategy game. it and its dlc makes you feel like you are controlling an empire from its birth until its victory of the world or untimely demise. its realistic in the aspects of trade routes and the ability to backstab other players and break promises (remember hitler and czechoslovakia) i personally loved pretending to be weak and then anally annihilating anyone who tried to invade. it was a beautiful feeling.",1
"the best civ ever. amazing game fully worthy of my time and money.",1

"fantastic game, spend hours on it without even knowing",1
"awesome game. visually beautiful, strategically deep, historically informative, and leads to great stories. the day i bought this, i sat down to learn how to play it after hearing for years how great the civilization series is. when i saved and exited, steam informed me i had 12 hours logged. i paid full price of $30 (1/21/14) and its worth it so far and i suspect will continue to be.",1
"masterfully crafted. turn-based strategy dont get any better than this. its much less complex compared to its predecessor civilization iv, hence much more accessible to most of us. endless replayability with its awesome choice of leaders and campaign options. and theres that just... one... more... turn! dammit!",1
"one of the handful of games that simply doesnt get old for me. uniquely engaging and expertly designed, civilization has been killing it since the beginning.",2
"totally worth my life to play this game! you would not regret selling your soul to satan to play this!",1
"a definite game to buy for those that like both easy and hard strategy games, the mods make the game even more fun than it already is. although the multiplayer could be implemented btter, everything else is great and i do recommend this game.",2
"ive been a fan of this table game from the original release in 1991 through the upadtes and even alpha centauri. i must admit that v is my fav version so far. for strategy players its beautiful graphics are skin phenomenon (although welcome), but what i really like is the gameplay balance. many things are more straight-to-the-point compared to the pervious releases, without losing depth. civ v is addictive, immense fun and a great time burner. i can only recommend as well as packing cold food for one week with ya if you are fan of the turn-based strategies and new to this one.",2

"awesome game! this is the first one ive played out of the series, love the idea of passing through time as you play. every combat unit can pretty much be upgraded so keep them alive, youll have upgraded units with their promotions.",2
"civ 5, like the whole series, is the biggest timesink ever. you can keep a single game going all day and into the next day. if you like strategy, you really cant do better than civ. if you dont know if you like stategy, you really cant do better than civ. there are ways to customize this game so that its suitable for complete beginners and for serious experts.",1

"dont like strategy games, love this one. great game, even for newbies in the strategy genre. really good fun with friends, shame the loading screens take a little while, but it is all worth it to play a relaxing game of civ with mates.",1
"i love this game, it can be really fun to play with friends when youre winning and fun when youre not :3. this game is really cool because you can do so much, and it is also a game that requires you to think, use skill and strategy rather than simply pointing and shooting, and it has so many details and interesting game mechanics while not being overly-complicated.",1
"this game is great, but it can get addicting, so beware. the vannila game is good but not as good as the dlc game, its worth giving the dlc a try. one bad thing is with the vanilla game it lacks a lot of things i was used to in civ four, like stacking units, but this isnt really a huge problem, its adds to the game in a way. the replayabilty is huge, kinda like spore, and it is increased with the dlc. please get this game, it is epic! build an emipire to stand the test of time!",1
"if you buy it, get at least one of the expansion packs. vinalla game is kinda meh.",2
"amazing strategy game! so fun to play, endless amounts of fun. it doesnt need a good computer to play on, nor is it too hard to understand when you first get into it! i recommend everyone that is getting into pc or strategy games to play this game first, youll learn so much and develop your skills so much!",1
"one more turn i swear...this time its tru-wait  ghandi has a  load of tanks at my capitals border.",3
"a zulu tribe beat me in the space race 11/10 would play again",1
"i love anything civ, but after 3-5 here, they are going to have to come up with some new stuff to keep this series going, they are just messing with ai, ui, leaders at this point and some skill tree stuff. not sure if i will bother with a civ6 unless i see some innovation otherwise im just buying the same product over and over again.",2
"what the hell are you doing!? stop reading my review and go get nuked by ghandi!!!",1
"addicting!!! watch the clock when you are playing this game because time will get away very easy! the games very good though there are some little things like getting a boat traped when another player buys slots around it and if you move it war breaks out.....but other than that its a very good game if you like board games like settlers of katan this is the game for you! (dont know if katan is the name but it sounds right)",1
"i have no regrets buying this game and every single dlc. worth my time and every singe dollar. although it could use some bug fixes, a ranking system and more realism no doubt one of the best games ive ever played.",3
"great immersive gameplay, played 20 hours in the first 2 weeks.",1
"this game is amzing and i think you guys will like it to not saying that you will like it just i think you will like it",1
"prepare to lose hundreds of hours of your life playing this game.",1
"so many varied ways to play. accurate to historical content. is a lot of fun to play with friends online with only a little occasional lag. 550 played hours and still not bored with the game. great strategy based game. dont buy if you like games that dont involve lucky chance.",3
"how do you describe sid meiers civilization v? long story short, you cant. one of if not the best game i currently , and probably will ever, own in my steam account.",2
"it may take a long time to play, but its one of the most satisfying things in gaming to conquer the world force.",1
"built a massive technologically advanced army, and did nothing with it all game, later i watched ghandi nuke russia into submission 11/10 would watch gandhi destroy the world again.",1
"a cursor would greatly improve game play (and keep me from being a curser) i had no idea where the mouse was which made clicking on buttons for game play near impossible. other than that graphics are good and game play is much like prior civ games.",1
"addicting, and a hell alot of fun! alot of ways to win, and the multiplayer is super fun!",1
"the epitome of turn based strategy games. endlessly replayable, complex yet easy to approach, and some of the most reliably fun gameplay you will experience on the pc. a must buy for any strategy fan.",1
"this game wont let you sleep. it keeps you awake all night like a cursed monolith. the song of the universe plays in your ears as you occupy yourself with the trivial natures of this planet alone.",1
"the game is easy to learn, and once you learn it you cant stop, there is so much variety with each game that you have, each one lasting about 6 hours, you can never stop playing! you have been warned, i also reccomend getting the expansions, they make it much more intresting with more stuff to do and balanced.",1
"dont get me wrong it is a great game. addictive, easy to play other than the intoduction critical thinking in this one. each soldier, achier, ect. can only take up one spot, so it can be tricky to take some citys. i personally play civ. iv most of the time, it is an all around better game.",1
"so many hours of my life have been stolen by this game series. damn gandhi with all his nukes... risk+chess+stratego+computer=this game",1
"amazing game!!! got it during a sale for around $12 and can honestly say i would have paid the full $60! this is the first civilazation game ive played but really got me intrested in the series and i cant wait to see where it goes. reccomend for anyone who wants to feel like their creating history!",1
"extremely fun to patient and strategic players. constantly finding myself talking to the other cpus.",1
"this game is a lot of fun, even if you just play it by yourself. the ai can be a bit derpy, but i think that can be overlooked. there are just so many different things to do in civ, especially with the scenarios and all the different types of civilizations. randomized maps and the ability to exploit the environment and strategies with technology (say, rushing education for science) make each playthrough unique.",1
"great game. all a civ game should be. great graphics, lots of civilizations to play, lots of different paths to go. if something could be better, it would be the ai and the difficult level. the ai of the normal dificult level isnt very smart, and in the next level it is too strong, not because it became smarter, but because the game gives it too much advantage. all in all, it is a great game, a should play one.",1
"my all-time favorite franchise. i never get bored with this game. this is my fall back game with i dont feel like playing anything else. this is a must have game for any serious gamer.",3
"civ 5 was the main reason i dropped $900 on a hardcore gaming computer so yeah its got my recommendation",1
"excellent game for anyone who enjoys complex startegy games. the learning curve is pretty steep but the game itself is incredibly fun to learn and play. a critique i would make of the game however is its balancing in terms of the civilosations that can be played, but this is pretty minor. overall a fun game.",1
"best part of this game? ghandis lust for nuclear war is endless.",1
"this game is a looooooooooooooooooooot of fun. defs recommend.",1
"this game is the perfect time waster. youll find your self saying just one more turn until you either lose or win. very thorough and there is a reason for everything included. keep an eye out for this game whenever their is a sale. im going to go play some more.",1
"good game if you want to waste many hours on one game",1
"vanilla is adequate. gods & kings is useless (included in bnw). brave new world is great. the mods, however, define the reason why i love this game. pro - purchase it and see how quickly 5:30pm turns into 4:45am. con - purchase it and see how quickly 5:30pm turns into 4:45am. con - mods disable achievements (understandable).",3
"amazing strategy game with hours of fun to be had, either playing solo or with friends. for the full experaince i highly recommend getting the dlc for this game as it truly makes all the game mechanics complete, but the core version is still fun nonetheless. if you like strategy games that drain your time, this is a must have game.",3
"i have enjoyed playing civilization. if you get this game multiplayer is a lot better than singleplayer. it is a must get game",1
"impossible to play just one more turn - amazing game.",1
"epic battles, good laugh when you start nuking things. looking forward to playing this on steam box.",1
"the game franchise speaks for itself. so, there is not much to add. for me, the best thing in civ is that i am never tired of it. i mean. sometimes i want to play something else, but after a few days or weeks i can play it again, as it was yesterday that i bought it. it fun for a long long time and so, buying it was well spent money.",2
"it is a great game that has a great ambiance and a lot to learn despite it being simplified for newer people to civ. however, it will waste your life when you realize that youve been spending 5 hours straight on one game.",1
"became a dictator. arm nuclear missles at all other countries and city-states. got elected as world leader through united nations. win.",1
"with all the available mods, its a never ending game.",1
"do not buy this game unless you want to get an addiction!",1
"love the game but i have the complete edititon and didnt the brave new world",1
"this game is the pinnacle of strategy, just the feel alone of controlling an entire empire rises above all else. i must say some areas of the game could be improved like the ai but if you get bored of many subjects in the game there is always mods to think about. dlc is also something to think about, even though its the price of the game i feel that it adds many more hours to the game and is worth the money. ive been playing this since it came out and im still enjoying it, with many civilisations and playstyles to choose from sid meiers civilisation 5 is the complete turn based strategy game. 9/10",2
"totally awesome game. great waste of time if you have it",1
"got elected the leader of the free world, then next turn nuked ever major city on earth. 10/10",1
"gotta go to work... meh, one more turn cant be that bad. hmm... well, okay, 2. ... okay, its been 10 turns. one last! ... ... hey boss? i cant come in today. got a sickness called onemoreturn-itis.",1
"on sale, get it now! great turn-based stategy game. starts off slow, but as the game progresses it really makes your heart beat and your palms sweat. the multiplayer is surprisingly balanced and a great time with friends. a must buy.",2
"very entertaining game with a very complex , yet easy to understand, system.",1
"if you want to start a life, dont buy this game. this game sucked all the life out of me and constructed a barrier between me and life itself. suprisingly, it was worth it fyi: i permanently glued myself to a chair",1
"15 minutes in and i know i am going to love this game. just what i needed to get my strategy/war fix.",1
"oh god this game is so good it will ruin your life ive spent a whole night trying to finish one round",1
"this game is really fun and you can spend hours playing a single round. i reccoment getting all the dlcs when their on sale, the dlcs are really good and add alot of content. the only thing i dont like is that the ai isnt very agressive.",1
"fantastic game! quit diferent compared to the other civiziltions! hope to god civ vi comes out",1
"this is a great game, nuff said. there are hours of fun awaiting you if you pick this up. not for the faint of heart.",5
"sid meiers civilization v is the best one yet. with many strategic victories, tons of civilizations to choose fun, and a lot of fun to play with friends, i would reccomend this game to anyone that likes a turn-based strategy game.",1
"wow this game is truly astounding! as a gamer i like variety of games but, i have never been a true fan of turn-based strategy games. i decided to give it a try and now this is all i have played for the past 2 weeks. this game challenges your mind, you can research technology from increasing your military power, scientific knowledge, economics and more. it leaves you wondering should i focus on military incase of attack or focus on economics to expand my empire? it really can kick your  should you choose wrong. overal i give it a 10/10. get it",1
"turn based excellence. best with mods, now in the steam workshop!",1
"game for all occasions! but, be prepared to put some serious hours every time you play. with the addition of brave new world, the already great game became greater.",1
"great fun game which runs smoothly and doesnt crash",1
"one of the best games i have ever played if you like long-term strategy games.",2
"awesome game. beware though this game will suck away your life...",1
"for a buggy mess of a game, it is one hell of a fun ride",1
"awesome i love the series and this is an excellent addition a must buy",2
"i have played all of sid meier`s civilization and civ 5 is an improvement like the rest of the previous iterations. here are the keynote features in my opinion. pros ------ better ui good tutorials customizable tooltips for different levels of civ experience damage tables on difficulties are more balanced useful spawn tendencies for nations new faith attributes and useful religion customizable religion aspect cons ------ often unpredictable ai basic spawn rate for uranium is quite low faith can only be spent on pre-industrial units ******************************************************************************** i have very little to say about the game except for it`s a great game to play with friends. the online servers are great and makes it easy to play a game with strangers. im a long time player of civilization and i`m glad to see the series is still growing strong. 9.2/10",1
"played 180+ hours, didnt realise mods disabled achivements. 10/10",1
"great game for anyone with enough time to sit and play for 4-5 hours straight",1
"pretty fun. definately one of the best strategy games out there.",1
"i love this game!!! although as it goes onto the loading screen it crashes... it didnt do this before but it may be because i have windows 8 but i hope the creators can fix this...",1
"friendships have been broken over this game however we still play it together. they are now my worst enemies. ten outta ten.",1
"this is coming from a person who does not like turn based games. i bought the super package and enjoy the game. i played this game vanilla, and did not enjoy this game. if you play this with turns i highly recommend a 3 minute timer. some people lose track of time and become rude by making people wait. that said this can be a very fun game. do not look for action, but a quiet evening with this game. try and have a book handy, or the tv on a show thats pretty good. end verdict this is great clean fun. 8.5/10",1
"fun game. i usually play under a different account so not all my hours are logged here. lots of replay value -- games always feel different and theres no one way to win.",1
"i suck so bad. seems like it has solid design though. if you like strategy games this is one to think about.",1
"vanilla civ was a good game, but each additional layer has made meaningful improvements and added delightful depth leading to a full version that is a great game.",4
"vast possibilies. feeling in control. a sense of accomplishment as your ciilization expands, conquers and profits. having started in civ iv and just now picking this game up, i am no veteran but still an experienced player and i can say that this game is more than i could really have expected it to be. the game looks great, controls well and battles have been much improved from the past. my only problem with the game is that having played civ iv as mentioned earlier, it was difficult to get used to the new ui. not to worry though as the game will walk you through what everything does. in total i would have to gave civ v a hearty 8.5/10!",1
"do you want to conquer the world? do you want to destroy america with india? want see gandhis angry side? well.... now is your change! buy civilization v and make your dream of world domonation true! now also with good mods, because who doesnt want fighting bears on their side.",1
"ive always wanted to fight gandhi with nukes, and so has he. this game was made for the two of us.",1
"this will eat your life. but in a fun way. just one more turn!",1
"a game for people like me, who have a craps load of time to create a civilization. anyway, its a lot of fun. try it out!",1
"great strategy game. control your country to achieve victory by any means necessary. war, science, diplomacy, etc. you decide!",3
"civilization v is the best game i have played in a long time. it has great graphics and it is fun to attack people.",1
"the brave new world expansion basically saved this game. it fixed all the issues i had with the base game. both diplomacy and the latter half of the game has been given a tremendous face lift. civ v is now on par with, if not more fun than, civ iv.",1
"play this game cause its awesome to take people over and make them suck your",1
"get friends to play this with. skype with each other. try to cooperate or murder each other, and watch the hillarity that ensures.",1
"its a realy fun turnbased strategy game, realy fun to play with 1-3 friends",1
"get friends to play this with. skype with each other. try to cooperate or murder each other, and watch the hillarity that ensures.",1
"civilization v is a very complex but easy to follow game with many different ways to play it you can invite some friends or people you dont know to have a massive battle for victory with the unique methods of winning: culture, domination, time and science. you can load up some scenarios to play without having to start from scratch. or maybe the single player mode catches your eye by setting up your game just how you like it. never have i seen a game so fun and player friendly in a very long time. once you start playing, you cannot stop! if you enjoy a fantastic balance between strategy and action buy this game right now. id give it a 9.5/10",1
"if you like board games or stradegy games this is 4 u!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",1
"civilization is fun even for someone that might not want to dive into the numerous strategic approaches and play an easier more relaxed game. but after a while once youve gotten the hang of the game all you want to to is play for hours on end. its addicting, unique, and has lead the way for many other games (but none surpass civilizations epic game experience). i would recommend this game to everybody no matter what age or interest.",1
"i just finished my first game after playing another turn. great game!",2
"very fun and exciting strategic game i think ill never stop playing",1
"this is a good game if youve ever wondered what its like to be a president that really does not want to be the president.",1
"civ v is one of those games that you cant really say no to. as a turn based strategy made by the famous sid meier, this game lives up to the name of civilization. although ive encountered a few, but rare bugs in the game (such as a ship magically jumping into a lake from the sea) this game is a game you cant put down, you spend hours on it because you want to see what happens in just one more turn, what you can accomplish. 5/5 id say for this game. i recommend it to anyone from every part of the gaming spectrum",1
"great game.. very addicting ill quit after the next turn 50 turns later",1
"if you like being america and conquering everyone and everything like i do, then this is the game for you!",1
"civilization games keep getting better and better! civilization v is the latest, and arguably the greatest in the series. lots of leaders to pick from, and every expansion has added a lot of depth to the game. with several victory conditions and different civilizations with their own strengths and weaknesses to choose from, replayability is endless. playing with friends in a ffa against ais civs for hours at a time is also fun. highly recommended if youre a turn-based strategy fan.",2
"sure, it could have used some work, and maybe the ai is still finnicky and some gameplay mechanics could be improved. this is however, no detraction from the legacy of civ iv and other civilization games past. this game still continues to improve the legacy of the genre defining series that is civilization. go buy the game and all of its expansion packs. seriously, go buy it all.",1
"this game is so good i had no time for a job and there so i quit my job. i soon ran out of money so i had to sell my house to aford the wi-fi. little did i know you have to have a house for wifi so i bought a car and parked outside of mcdonalds for their wifi until they kicked me out of the lot and i moved to a diffrent mcdonalds everytime until i had to sell my car for gas money. little did i know you have to have a car to get gas. so here i was with my laptop and a couple of moneys so i started walking to starbucks and playing there. soon i got hungry and had to use my gas money to buy food i soon ran out of money so i started to sell my belongings and eventraly selling all of my clothes. little did i know you need clothes to be in starbucks. i was kicked out. now here i am behind starbucks hiding in the dumpster writing this review. please buy this game!!!",1
"u don actlcy liek dsih its but whenas thoutbnd dunt",1
"america too stupid? think you can do it better? do it now with any civilization and use their special traits to rule the world, either in science, culture or just by diplomacy. its a really good strategy game. you can also choose the lame way and just kill the opposition with your mighty army.",2
"civilization series is very addictive. i played this game for 5 hours straight last saturday i believe. it is a turn based strategy, but you really dont feel like that. the line between turn based strategy and real time strategy is hard to tell the difference these days. i recommend this game if it on sale. you wont have huge options available as far as what youll do, but if you are looking for a simple way to replay the same thing over and over agin and totally dominate the world, then i recommend this title. you will be building lots of roads and making huge cities waiting to offend foreign leaders who get in your busniness for no reason.",1
"ive played the other civs and this one is a big improvement. if you liked the other civs or just strategy games in general you will like this.",1
"civ 5 is arguably one of the best turn-based strategy games to date.",1
"an awesome and smart game!!! best strategy game ever!",1
"love this game, very addictive. i play it for hours on end",4
"slow pace civilization builder for those who like long games. loved previous civ games and still love this one.",4
"civilization v should be any and everyones turn-based strategy dream game. its been sharpened to the fine edges of perfection, you find yourself repeatedly saying... just... one.. more... turn! a good investment of your money.",1
"it is a great turn-based strategy game. it is very challenging and rewarding when you win a game.",1
"great game epic single player and great multiplayer suitible for all ages but may only be fun for 8+ you can play it over and over again and never get bored",1
"im lost for words at this point......this game is just........one of the best every second of it is just awsome. i dont just recommend this i feel terrible for those who dont play this.",1
"an utter piece of  unless you have every piece of dlc, especially gods and kings as well as brave new world. with these dlc, the game goes from being an abomination to an actually fun sequel to the brilliant civ iv. it has its issues even with all the dlc and patches, but there is definitely still a lot of fun and enjoyment to be had with it.",2
"i like to play this game. it makes me happy. if you want to be happy, i recommend you play it too.",1
"weve got better things to do you . p.s :p::a::y::thed::a::y: is better",1
"this game, although much simpler from previous titles, is a very good addition to the civilisation series. a far more complex religion system, a more appealing ui and better ai were welcome improvements however i have found that without brave new world however this game does lack some much needed depth",1
"i would highly recommend this game, its very addictive and with all the dlcs the game is just perfect, and the multiplayer is very fun but watch out for the trade bug!",2
"this game is pretty awesome. i would describe it as age of empires if it were a board game. i enjoy the addition of the religion element in the gods and kings edition. ive only played to the end once so i dont really know how you win.",1
"this is a fantastic game that moves at the pace you want it to go at. you can shorten games or make them longer (i perfer the longer games) and you choose what happens to the people in your civilization.",1
"woahhhhh wtf you can play as a leader in history that is the coolest thing ever seriously like woawawhwahahawhahwahw be george the realest washington or cheif shoeshine, leader of the panini tribe and",1
"friend texts you to go to a movie, you reply ok just let me do one more turn on my game the next text you get from him is wtf where were you? you missed the entire movie 11/10 would miss 3 hour movie for 1 more turn again",1
"great game. this is a game that i will keep playing for years.",1
"do have friends? then the best use for them would be to play this game with them. the graphics are amazing, the gameplay is engrossing, and the concept holds it own. you really should pick it up and become a master of civilization!",2
"awesome tbs game. great addition to sid meiers civ series.",4
"get this game! its my first steam game and i love it! theres no two tries that are the same and many ways to win!",4
"really great turn based strategy, the best one from whole civ series, and is still developed. hundreds hours of fun and glorious moments as an emperior! :)",2
"if you need something to play and not a lot of time, this game is perfect for you!",2
"great! i dont think ill ever know everything there is to know about this game! i highly recommed it!",1
"great game! everything is so balanced and stratigical. it also is great fun with friends to see who would win a war. ;) i really like the technoligy in this one. the best out of all of them in my opinion. i notice some ui bugs every now and then though. rating: 9",1
"love this game! not really used to playing these types of games. however im really into this! the best thing about it is the amount of people you get in a game (wheher its ai or online players). its just means there is always something to do, be aware of and work towards. some games, you have to wait a many turns to accomplish something. in civ 5 it seems like you are constantly working towards a goal.",1
"if you enjoy fast paced, quick action, this game isnt for you, but if you enjoy really having to think about your actions and extremely in depth gameplay, youll love civ 5.",2
"this game is awesome. for me it defines what turn based stragedy games are. just make sure you have adequate time on your hands... a single game takes a long time to finish. but its definitely worth it!",1
"sid meiers civilization v is a strategy game, if you like games like age of empires and command and conquer this is definately the game for you, it requires thinking and time. its a very good game, i have playyed it for 4 hours straight with friends who wanted me to get this game, hope by this review you will get it too! i rate it a 8/10 because the graphics could have been a little better. but the gameplay is just fantastic!",1
"oh god, where does the time go? do i like this game? sure should i have ever bought this time machine in disquse of a game? no crap, i sat down for a few quick turns at 7pm and finaly looked up at 3am. oh boy, i have to be at work by 8am.. hmm, that might be enough time for a few more turns...",1
"although i havent gone through the game fully, it already is great. those who enjoy running civilization and strategy this game is for you. not as nice to total war, the civilization series has many great games including this one. ive played civilization revolution for my ps3 and felt confined, i forgot i bought this game, so i saw it and started it up, already feeling the same i gave it a few minutes, which became hours and it became addicting, but fun :d. the create game setup is a bit elaborate but navigable. play as many leaders from around the world from washington to napoleon, beijing to moscow, your choices will have a lasting impact and you must find a way to victory, as there are multiple ways. see you on the virtual globe!",1
"after an unplanned first play in a 8 hours, dabu begins to realise that his journey to find true game may be coming to an end. this game fueled him with all things he looking from ideals, moral principles, religions (dabuism is the best religion though), and political views, he soon discover a great deal about his feeling about this, and he know you should buy it. twice!!",1
"very in depth, although there are some massivly overpowered civs like russia. just as warning, ghandi is not your friend past the atomic era",3
"started to play thinking, well i got them all pretty much in that humble bundle, might as well try it a bit, ive heard some good things about it. 7 hours later it crashes and i look at how long i played and after 7 hours of utter immersion and amazing fun. defenitely one of the best games ive played thats been developed within the last year or so.",1
"21 hours in 4 days! i think im addicted. this game is incredible, a must play!",1
". / a must play for the fans of turn based strategy games.",1
"great game! just runs my gpu crazy at times so i always have to monitor it",1
"civilization gets mainstreamed! less demanding in the micromanagement department but most of the changes make for more interesting gameplay. culture and religion are now currencies you can expend -- the former to unlock civic trees and the latter to buy improvements. both are essentially proxies for mini-perks that boost various resources. espionage is now menu based and more efficient. city-states add a new dynamic to diplomacy and warfare. one unit per hex eliminates stacking and speeds up combat time. overall: different, less tedious, but not necessarily worse. only truly egregious thing was the shameless milking of dlc.",1
"this game is countless hours of fun. if you are looking for a great game to buy with your friends, this is a great one.",1
"if you havent played civilization in the past or any other turn based strategy games this is a good one to start with. the graphics are decent and there is plenty of content to keep you buys for hours. these types of game are pretty slow by design so anyone looking for some action should keep looking. if you want something you can load up and take your time with then this is a perfect choice!",1
"great strategic game. strongly advise trying the demo.",2
"civilization v is awesome, and with the brave new world dlc it becomes epic <3",1
"where would someone even start? its the newest civilization game to date and it is incredible. with the expansions this is one of the best turn-based stategy games ever. it also has great mod support for single player which adds tons of new civs to play as past the already impressive list of playable civilizations. more than worth its price. plus it almost always goes on sale during major steam sales. great game but it eats your time like nothing, not that youll mind while your playing.",2
"if youre looking for a strategy game thats not very deep or intensive, but still fun and addictive civ 5 is what you want. the game isnt as intense as some of its predecessors, but has grown into a fantastic game over the years and is definitely worth playing. i would also reccommend you get the brave new world dlc, as it adds a lot more interesting mechanics to the game that make it even more addicting.",3
"theres a learning curve but plenty of guides available; turn-based games arent for everyone, but this one is pretty interesting.",3
"amazing strategy game and even better for people who like to play with turns",2
"must say this game is good better but not like aoe but still rather than comparing it you shud play it well mp is low i mean less srvsr idk 48k ppl play still i think they like playing with their frnds only lol and yea buy it im w8ting fr u ;d",1

"steam workshop makes it a whole new gae, i recommend getting the complete edition and downloading some mods, r.e.d is a good one.",2
"i have found this game very enjoyable and just as good as previous civilization versions",2
"great game a lot of fun to play! very detailed graphics smooth game play. just good all around game.",4
"playing civ 5 has given me so much confidence, for example i went to the store the other day and people were bowing as i passed by... my status as god-king must surely have had something to do with it. to test this theory i demanded tribute from the cashier telling him if he did not my army would surely lay waste to this market. to my shock and awe... he did not. seriously though, picked this up on sale for $12.50 (plus all dlc) and it was deffinately worth it. very engrossing game. graphics are great. highly recommended. now im off to lay waste to more pixels!",1
"this game is easily one of the most imersive games i have ever played, it balances quite well, and it has tons of replayability. i multiplayer needs improvement, but other than that, it is a nice, solid game.",1

"judging by how many hours ive played, you know the awnser...",2
"best game ever. be america and nuke the world, because if its worth doing, its worth overdoing!",2
"one of the most fantastic games ive ever played. if you like strategy games and have a lot of patience i highly recommend.",1
"an unrelenting addiction. if you have important deadlines approaching then for the love of goodness dont start playing this game. however, if you have a few weeks worth of hours to spare, you will soon learn the joys of conquering the world as a vengeful gandhi.",1
"fun. takes a while though. you need a lot of patience to play this game, and dont expect to finish a match in one sitting.",1
"i have been a civ fanatic since the dawn of civilization (pun intended). i held off on getting civ v due to all the negative reviews and comments about it. im really sorry that i did. civ v has to be the greatest of all civ games to date! games go much faster than in previous versions, are more challenging, and present so many more variables to allow for greater replay value. if you havent gotten civ v yet do yourself a favor and do so (goty is the best bang for your buck!)...and be sure to pick up the newest expansion too!",1
"finally one of the greatest games titles on linux and steamos! many thanks. want to know what it is about civ? try it and youll see.",1

"fantastic playthrough and very involved multiplayer. have spent too much of my life on this ^.^",1
"much better than most hexagonal turn-based strategy games. 5/5 would hit.",1
"ive really enjoyed playing civ v so far. as far as im concerned, its like a much fancier version of the old risk board game we all used to play. if you dont like rtss, id still recommend you give this one a shot. i thought i wouldnt like it, but after i gave it a shot it was really fun.",1
"the only game where invading a virtual version of mecca would get malaysian religious officials panties in a bunch. 5/5 stars from me. play it my friends and people who read this.",1
"this is a fun game that makes you wish you were a banana-republic dictator. you too can create a world where the mayans rule the world with blood sacrifices!",1
"few strategy games can mach this empire builder in large army tactics. domatation isnt the only way to win, even if it is the easyest. allthow you cant get the full experiance without dlcs there are many ways to play this game.",1

"-best 2 week vacation ive ever taken -helped me pass math history final -only reason im still in college *hits next turn* 9.7/10",3
"very fun, and time consuming game, easy for new civilization players. the only downside is once you start to know your way around the game you see how simple the ai is.",1
"it would probably take less time to build an actual civilization than finish one game here.",1
"an excelent turn based strategy game however the multiplayer can be quite buggy at times. the dlcs are a good idea expecially brave new world which adds just as much as the base game.",1
"this game is really amazing if you play it with friends or add a few mods",2
"many sleepless nights lost while sitting at my computer saying just one more turn. it is never just one more turn!",1
"fantastic game, loads of fun but even better with a couple of friends and all the dlcs.",1
"old, new doesnt matter, so many countries, more you understand this game more fun you will have",1
"its great for experimenting with civs by your self, but even better when you go up against friends.",1
"ive sunk over a 100 hours into this game. it is incredible. with the dlc added introducing religion and a world politics system that actually impacts decisions. i have a reason to spend another 100 hours playing this game. ive slowly been playing as different leaders and have found the french to be the strongest. building chateaus generating gold and culture really gave me an edge. in a game that can last days and results in 24 hours of gameplay to finish a game, those edges and differences make this game stand out. ill still be playing when beyond earth comes out, mainly because of how long these matches take. :)",1
"compared to other civ titles #5 leaves you wanting, that maps never set up like you tell them to (eg. earth, terra) and the flow is sluggish..... 1/5 stars 1-gfx no playability - repetative no story..... controles are not user friendly, and the help tips dont provide much info ai cheats, still cant beat me, but it cheats, sure they can propse unbalanced deals and expect me to take them but then when i make the same offer they always refuse sayng its not a fair deal and thats garbage if i clearly overpower them they should be fear me and take anydeal that downst involed me killing them.........",1
"civilization v trade, settling, exploring, religion, war, economics, happyness, manufactoring, building, spying, great persons, wonders, history, expansion, culture, customizing, countless mods. get it, play it, love it!",2

"i think i permanently damaged my right arm by playing this game.",1
"this was the first civ ive ever play. it is a lot better than i thought it would be. i give it my stamp of approval.",1
"ever wanted to change the corse of history? nows your chance!",2
"relatively simple gameplay, yet surprisingly addictive (hence my 385 hours of gametime logged playing it). although a good game at launch, the two expansion packs released since do add a lot of depth to the gameplay and i would recommend purchasing the expansion packs if possible.",3
"i have one word to say about this game amazing this game is so addctive and make u keep playing hes hard sometimed but still not unbreakable this game have tons of situations to give u great gameplay that is easy good graphic and ton of replay vaulve 910",1

"brilliant game!!! but be carefull you pay attention to your time played!",1
"**** this game. **** its bull**** options that are bull**** and do bull**** things. you want to play with a friend? you want to start in the same general area as your friend? while on a team? against all the other ai? hahahahahaha nope! our options here at civ 5 are bull**** lying trash and we **** in your faces. enjoy never being able to have the game you want, thanks for the money. 138 hours of reloading the game to try and get a spawn with a friend anywhere close while the option start together is selected vs emporer bots. nope! because here at 2k sports its in the game! as long as it isnt an actual options menu that matters!!! eat butt.",2
"my favorite game around the globe. pourly optamised but a lot off fun when you are playing against friend or foe. a game realy focussed on the multiplayer, good graphigs and most importantly fun to play. what else do you want! but only if you buy the whole game currently 20 euros, i wouldnt recommend buying it without all the dlcs also still a lot better then beyond earth.",2
"very fun game. you can get caught up in it very easily. better with friends",1
"amazing game, the expansions make it entirely different however ;).",2
"do i look like a professional reviewer to you. 8/8",1
"id easily say, that over the years, the civilization series has never failed to please, with various dlc packs guaranteed with each iteration, the game constantly stays fresh, and challenging, slight downfall however, is the grind that some players may face while playing this game, some lose interest, some do not, but if you strongly enjoy real time strategy games, and want a change, civilization is a perfect turn based strategy to play. 8/10, i play this game frequently.",1
"well, so like, sorta, but like, no. yea feel? its kinda like, sure, you know? but also like no, you know? all in all, its prob like a 8.69/10 if i were to rate it. so yea. #sweg#no filter#too kool.",1
"fix the multiplayer. it reconnects like every 5 turns and its not our internet. fix this and ill recommend.",2
"for kicking back and playing strategy world domination, this game rocks. nothing comes close to choosing your best leader based on how you like to play, then smoothly take the entire world like candy from a baby. this game rocks. eates up some cpus in the longer games, but it just cant be beat.",5
"i got into a war with ghandi over uranium or spies or something. i dropped a nuke on him. he thought he was winning and demanded horses and pearls for a peace treaty. i dropped another nuke on him and demanded 2000 gold for a peace treaty. he refused and i had another nuke. 10/10",1
"i nuked a city-state and then payed them. now were the best of friends. 10 nukes out of 10.",1
"this game is really great. i was new to the civ series, but its easy to pick up and get into. everything is straightforward, but still challenging enough that you have to plan and strategize. even just against npcs its fun. in the brief time i played with a friend, we had a good bit of fun despite their poor connection.",1
"possibly the best turn based strategy game ever released",2
"i think this game has infinite replay value. there are so many days where i have just played atarting in the morning and i check the clock and it is dark out. it sucks you in, its challenging, and it is lots of fun!",1
"shaka zulu is sooper irrational, stay away from that man! also, mlg gamer pros always get the time victory, des the baes win!",1

"you freedom beef you ugly  muffin you never ing play this  game with me. i will ing end you you   monger.",1
"a great game that combines strategy, warmongering and building! the ai needs a huge improvement though... i got washington down to his last city and he demanded that i give him all my money and luxury resources for peace!?",1
"really enjoyable game, extremely easy to sink hours and hours into it thanks to its good replay value.",2
"best game ever , i usually hate strategys of any kind but this series sucks you in and doesnt let you go . some games could be 15 hours and some could be an hour but no matter what youll restart agin and keep going to you win . -luke 10/10",1
"any strategy game fan will find more than enough enjoyment in civilization 5. be sure to prepare yourself for sitting in front of your pc for hours on end.",1
"this is one of my favorite games of all time and i reccomend it top everyone who is even slightly intrested in strategy games",2
"this is a great game. if you want to test your ability to strategize against a smart and aggressive a.i, this game is for you.",3
"0/10 nuked ghandis the world wasnt very brave nor new not impressed i demanded a neck beard.",1
"great game! needs some work with online play, but other then that pretty good. best strategy game out there",2
"the greatest game, the best game. 10/10 would play again for 350 hours",3
"extrememely fun and time-consuming strategy game. prepare a few hours for one session of this game!",1
"civilization v is probably one of the best turn based strategy games out there. singleplayer works great, but the multiplayer is quite buggy sometimes. it still might be worth the purchase for you if you enjoy building your civilization.",1
"good game, steep learning curve but addictive when you get into it",1
"wow, i didnt think id like this so much, im glad i bought it. 10/10",1
"a great way to spend a lot of time on a strategy game. first time playing a civ game and it was very easy for me to get into and understand after a few playthroughs. the achievements for this game definitely give me something to play for, as well. highly recommend!",1
"the king of round-based strategy games suited for beginners and experts this game offers hundreds of hours of empire-building, diplomacy and war. brave new world is strongly recommended, as it adds a lot of fun features. civ5 also supports mods, but only in singleplayer. 9/10",2
"10/10 would play a another turn! seriously though, its an above averge game without the dlcs, but with them... its a totally different game, its just insane! yuffo, out.",1
"civ 5 is to date the pinacle of hex based turn strategy. if it not in your wish or games list yet get it. 9.5/10 echo)))",1
"one of the best games i have ever played, litterally hundreds of hours spent playing this. so much strategy and such a great community and workshop mods, sooooo good!",1
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",2
"ghandi keeps attacking genghis khan, while genghis khan keeps begging for peace 11/10 for realism",1
"amazing game, continuously play it for hours once you get into the game, recommended!",1
"i was not expecting to really like this game when i first got it, but i ended up loving it! the turn flow has just enough hand holding to make it simple on casual players, but it appears as though there is also a lot of depth for more hardcore players.",2
"without any of the addon packages, civ v is still a decent game, but somewhat of a sidegrade from civ iv. add gods and kings and brave new world, however, and you have yourself a heck of a game thats very rich in content, very deep in gameplay, and very, very addictive. my complaints are few: namely, i wish the barbarian levels were adjustable (theyll wreck your civ in multiplayer) and i wish multiplayer were a bit less buggy. however, these are minor compared to all the amazing gameplay.",5
"fantastic game you could play hours on end without getting bored",1
"got to be one of the best games out there. you think you have the game in the bag and bang, someone else beats you to it. brilliant gameplay",3
"ive been a civ fan since the very first by sid meier. i remember impressing adults that in 4th grade, i knew a lot for my age about geography (capitols and major cities), as well as major political figures. i like civ v, but wish some things like the city view from the day, or building a palace would come back. i also used to plan out my cities with the whole 3x3 thing, but with civ v the geography rules are way different. i also, in all honesty, dont really like the city state thing... i almost always cut the number of city states in half when i play (usually like having larger civs). overall solid statigic game and will play it for hours still, but some features i wish theyd bring back and some shouldnt have been introduced.",1
"ive only played one game and it was ok, ill probably start another one next year",3
"got this game when it was 75% off for like 12.74$ and it was totally worth it. spent the last 2 days on 1 game. def worth a lot of replay value with all the dlc that was included.",1
"+ghandis elephants +ghandis elephants +ghandis elephants +ghandis elephants +ghandis elephants +ghandis elephants!!!! +ghandis elephants!!!! +ghandis elephants!!!! -ing nothing",1
"i would highly recommend that everyone play this game! great strategy game that has fantastic replayability.",2
"worth the hype. this is my first civ game, so keep that in mind (although i have sid meiers alpha centauri). easy to get into, and incredibly addictive",1
"endless hours of fun; each game feels different from the last. new honeycomb system means no more noobs using stack of death... good stuff, and a solid 5/5",4
"sid meiers civilization v is an excellent strategy game where each player makes there own empire and tries to win the game! its excellent on your own or with friends! 10/10 brandon times.",2
"runs horrid on a sony vaio flip. it is so bad with understanding screen orientation or resolution you can not do anything beyond watch the game intro. glad it was a free download and not something i paid for.",1
"although the game is long-winded and takes a while to play, civ v is a very fun game for multiplayer and a good time spender when your bored as s**t! nuke them all - nuff said 9/10",1
"please buy the complete edition of this game. the dlcs are what makes this game so addicting and fun",1
"this is the most addictive game ever! watch out before you buy! theres almost endless gameplay method for you to try out. you will be looking forward to play as many other civilizatio or rushing to build the wonder against your friggin friends.. remember, never trust anyone!",1
"say youll play it for an hour 8 hours later well, i think thats enough for one night 10/10",1
"every new game is a whole new story. new strategies are needed for each new game and the game always has you planning out your next moves in advance. you can spend endless hours without knowing it and without getting bored.",2
"one of the best games on the market at the moment. can run on low end machines and looks fantastic on high end ones. if you dont have it, i suggest you pick up the gold edition to add to your collection.",1
"ever since i bought this game, i have played it every single day i could. it is so much more fun playing with people you know, but even by yourself its such a great game!",1
"bloody fantastic game! id reccomend it to people when ive stopped playing it.",1
"best entry in the series, which is saying a lot, because civ 2-4 were all also some of the best games ever. since the bnw and gnk expansions, the game has such incredible depth. you can play for 300+ hours and still get thrilled by beating the pants off the ai. you still look at your clock every half hour and keep extending your play deadline just a few turns longer, until its like 3am and you have to work in a few hours. oh and if you somehow get bored with the dozens of civs, scenarios, map and victory types, etc, you can go and mod the  out of it. 10/10",2
"probably one of my favorite games. makes me feel . in a good way.",2
"this game destroyed many friendships of mine .... but exploding nukes are so pretty *_*",1
"civ just keeps on getting better. another great game from sid meiers.",2
"it is fun to build a civilisation from the ground up even with out the dlc 10/10",1
"extremely fun game. with the the complete edition going for 25 dollars its an absolute steal of a deal. you wont regret puchasing this game.",1
"probably one of the best strategy games ive ever played. really fun to play on teams with your friends. very time consuming but so strategical. put many hours into this game and had some amazing and hilarious outcomes. would definetely recommend picking this game up.",1
"this game is amazing ill be in a game look up realise that i have been play for 6 hours have lost any real friends, have been disowened by my parents and dumped by my imaginary girlfriend still worth it",1
"this is a game i always find myself constantly coming back to. if you do not have this game, i highly recommend this game for all types of gamers.",1
"pretty good game once you add in all the dlc. it is lacking without the dlc though.",1
"this game is amazing, got it for my birthday. awesome features in perspective to civ 4",1
"an awesome strategic game with an endless number of things to do on it. yes, i said endless. it has nearly 300 achievements.",1

"i have 47 hours in this game and i still dont know how it works. but i just... cant... stop.",1
"the ultimate time suck. caution! may result in death due to self-neglect. at this point, get the complete version for the best deal on expansions.",1
"a simple learning curve allows series newbies to be able to pick up the game and enjoy it, while a host of new features will keep civ veterans engrossed for hours. also, the dlcs are something to pick up, they introduce game transforming elements that make it feel like this is civ 6.",3
"jeeze, dont even get me started on this game. just play it... oh wait, you probably already are.",2
"a 10000% historically correct game with realistic ai, particuarly impressed by the danes being complete .",2
"hexagons and cultural victories. really, if youre considering buying this game, then you have no reason to turn it down. i just wanted to put two random reasons...",2
"this game would be much better had i bought the expansions. the lack of city state involvment and the no religion facter in to make it a tiresome experiance after a nice 3 hour+ game. although a masterpiece in the turn based strategy genre, civ5 can become an assortment of tedious commands that dont quite live up to what your want out of them. i love playing shorter games and its worth the 7.50. would never ever buy it for 30. but civ fans most certainly should.",1
"the only place where you can be poland and be more advanced than anyone else.",1
"i havent been nuked by ghandi yet but its still a good game.",1
"extremely addictive! with the massive number of acheivements to unlock and the enjoyment level of the game, it is hard to stay away for too long.",1
"this is one of best turn based strategy games out there right now. i strongly recommend this game if you have a attitude for critical thinking games, along with a liking to playing a large array of renowned historical leaders. buy it and give it a try!",1
"seriously addictive, youll play for 1/2 an hour and end up stopping 3 hours later.",1
"i picked up this game 3 days ago, and have played 8 hours a day. the game starts off as a simple land grab and unit builder, but ends with 30-40 unit managment and high level diplomacy. plenty of customization features for the kind of match you want to play. there were a few graphical glitches at the start, but generally it was fine. 10/10 ghandi kicked my .",1
"ill finish this review after ive had... one... last... turn...",1
"at this point, if you havent heard of this game, please quit steam. this game is amazing in everyway, and the variability between games ensures that it never gets old. there are enough features to keep players busy, even when they are not in the middle of a war. just buy it, and all the dlc, it is worth it no matter what you think of strategy games.",3
"holy  this game is addictive. being persia and nuking berlin and wiping out entire civilizations. i couldnt get into it at first, but  me i cant stop.",1
"very good rts but the matches could take a day no lie.",1
"great game, best strategy game on pc. you can play as many great empires and civilizations of the world, from the mighty romans to the us of a. youll lose hours of your life going throught hundreds and hundreds of turns building your military, making a unique culture, making new strides in scientific discovery and worshipping the gods of, well, whatever. its your game. buy this name now.",2
"so. addicting. raising a nation and choosing how you will take over the world is such a detailed process that you can take hundreds of different routes to achieve it in this game. the amount of choices and control you have over every aspect of the game is incredible. would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys turn-based strategy. 8.5/10",1
"hands down the best strategy game you will play. given the complexity of the game, the learning curve is steep, but not that steep. ive invested 200+ hours into the game and am still learning new things. many improves in v make this game not only more approachable, but tactically different than its predecessors. various victory conditions and civilizations to play make this game such an amazing feat by firaxis games. a must buy!",2
"with the brave new world expansion this game is a turn based strategy dream. ive been playing civ games from the mid 90s, starting with civilization 2. i love the many paths to victory in this game. you can crush enemies with military force. invest heavily in science to be the first to reach an alien world. you can win a cultural victory by just being a really awesome country, or with diplomacy by making enough friends.",1
"its civ... what more can be said. by far the best of the series. have enjoyed many an hour playing it and without any bug, crashes, or other anomolies that would detract from enjoyment. i look forward to civilization vi when ever that gets developed and released. highly recommend.",4
"do you want to rewrite history? nows your chance. 100/100",1
"fun game, strategic, more strategy than the plot from the illuminati for 9/11",1
"i started this map, right, and it was me (as mongolia), and siam, and japan. japan declared war on me in... oh, must have been 1000 bc, or thereabouts (unprovoked, by the way). siam joined forced with them, and they started to bully me. i pushed them back, and fought with siam, which was nearest, for around 2000 years before i finally conquered them. japan was still at war with me that whole time, too, although their attacks were infrequent and kind of pathetic. but when i took siam down, oh no, they werent gonna give in. 1000 years of bloodshed later i discovered nukes and wiped them off the face of the earth. which in hindsight might be considered insensitive, but, hey, they started it. and so ended the three thousand year war. 10/10 would take over the world again seriously though, what the hell was with that?",1
"this game is fantastic...there is so much depth and content.",2
"civilization v is one of the best games ive ever played. as a lover of strategy, i would recommend this to anybody that enjoy thinking long hours. if you love to build empires, fight wars, and conquer and rule empires, then this is a game for you!",1
"insanely strategic and so many ways to win, especially with the dlcs",1
"multiplayer does not working- im using a mac and mutiplayer is always disabled/crashes",1
"do you have lots of friends that love eachother! well this game is perfect for you! it has a few side effects though... 1. watch your friendships crumble to pieces in a matter of minutes! 2.discover that paranoid side of you that you never thought you had. 3. greed (that is all) so enjoy hating your friends! if you dont have friends well...try single player and get nuked by ghandi! have fun!",1
"really awesome game. you might even learn some things from it.",1
"absolutely everything you want it to be. the biggest change from previous civ games is to the actual placement of troops on the field -- units can no longer stack. the non-stacking may sound like a nerf, but it adds a new level of strategy to the game where you could previously just throw a huge stack of units at the enemy. the math-hammer is gone, and the game now plays more like chess. its a very simple improvement, but it really makes the game.",2
"normally id start this review off by saying something like if youre into strategy games this is a must buy! but ironically i, myself, am not a big fan of strategy games, so i think it speaks volumes to the entertainment value of this game when i have logged over 600 hours into civ v yet dont identify myself as a lover of the turn based strategy genre. if you can grab this for a good price, its absolutely a must buy!",3
"this game is an excelent strategy game and is very enjoyable, be prepared to not do anyting that day though because the average match lasts about 7 hours.",1
"the game is rigged so hiawatha always wins. sid meier must have white guilt.",2
"gahndi nuked me then i suprised him with x-coms and death robots 10/10 would future america again",1
"this map script uses various manipulations of perlin noise to create landforms, and generates climate based on a simplified model of geostrophic and monsoon wind patterns. rivers are generated along accurate drainage paths governed by the elevation map used to create the landforms.",2
"still hooked on this new version of civ v. multiplayer has kept our group busy.",3
"just like all sid meiers games you lose track of time with the concentration you put in to it haha",1
"this is one of the best games ever! i just hope the next one will be this good!",1
"this game will bring you hours of fun with your friends.",1
"best strategy turn based game till this point of 2014.",1
"i like the smell of an enemy empire in ruins at 4 am.",1
"a bit slow, but fun and rewarding when you get something accomplished or look back at all the progress youve made. but i speak as someone with no multiplayer experience in this game. so... yeah.",1
"a lot of civ iv vets hated on this game when it first came out and i was reluctant to get it because of that. however, with the improvements and dlc additions, civ v has all the best parts of iv with some welcome additions.",1
"i love this game my only problem is i cant use the mods on my mac. i wish that they would create a way to offically install it so we could use it but other than that, i love this game. 9/10",1
"this game will leave you geeked out for dayssss. overall fun as hell!!!",2
"a great turn based strategy game that is only worth playing with the major expansions installed. once you have those it becomes an engrossing experience that will have you uttering the timeless one more turn...",1
"easily one of the best games you can get on pc. im usually a much bigger fan of rts, but this turn-based strategy game is truly wonderful and ive logged something like 300 hours playing it already.",2
"i really like the game, but i couldnt find the stupid cake.",1
"want to rewrite history? and nuke everyone? then this is for you.",3
"this a great game to play with your friends. its a vary compitive game and makes you think about hard problems. this is single player or mutiplayer",1
"fun and addictive. if you start a game, be sure to bring plenty of snacks and water because youll be here a while. i always end up warmongering for one reason or another.",1
"been playing the civilization series since the third installment. i was worried at first when reading articles about the game long before it released - concerned that this might ruin the franchise. when i picked up this most recent installment i was glad to see i was wrong. the changes made to the series in this game are welcome in my opinion. recently, the gods & kings expansion came out that has rekindled my passion for this series. i expect great things to come out of future expansions and the newly integrated steam workshop.",2
"i usually despise stratergy games but this one is a different story. one of the best games i have played in a long time, you lose countless hours which feel like minutes of your life. a truely awesome game.",1
"you can play this game for 12 hours and still not finish",1
"fun game, strategic, more strategy than the plot from the illuminati for 9/11",1

"of the 44.3 hours that ive played this game in the last two weeks, 44.3 of them were over the course of the past two days. i think that says something about the quality of this game. or just my mental condition. whatever, you should get it. trust me on this.",1
"something about watching ghandi drop nukes on the aztec empire is just really, really appealing.",2
"id like to start by giving you a warning: you will get addicted to this game. this game pretty much has an endless amount of outcomes when dealing with other civilizations & you will not be disappointed with this game. i highly recommended this game & i also recommend getting the dlcs for this game. but, a fair warning, (again): with the dlc brave new world, it is a bit tricky to understand at the beginning. it does big a bit of a new diplomatic system to the game, but it is a great improvement over the old one, (which is still a good one too).",2
"as fun and addicted a civ game as ever. interface is very clean and streamlined. proudly continues the legacy of the series and will leave you awake in the wee hours of the morning muttering one more turn... to yourself. great game.",1
"it is a good game. until it crashes!! this is inevitable. you literally cannot finish the game. do not waste a penny on this.",1
"great game, just finished a three hour match where i found myself as president ghandi of india, i started world wars one, two and even three, then nuked everyone... dont  with ghandi! 10/10",1
"this game is amazing. i have not slept days and ghandi is always spying on you so go to war on him asap. plus the mods are great.",1
"i have close to 300 hours on this game and it is still amazing with the dlc that has came out over the years it has progressed to become better and better. this was also the first game that i bought that required steam so this was my first steam game and it was a great choice.",2
"i love this game! wish i had the expansions though, cause i heard it really adds to the game! if you start playing it, prepare to surrender your life.",1
"just one more turn. do not play this game during workdays lest you become sleep deprived. :d",2
"sid meiers team create the best civilisation to date. we all remember the thrill of civilisation 1, where you would stack militia after militia into your cities to create a unbeatable force.... well now civ is more complex and creative with its strategies, trades and politics. hours have been well spent dominating the world with science, culture, and where neccesary a little tough love.",1
"a little slower than i was expecting, but the interactions are great and there are a lot of new features.",1
"literally the best strategy game ive ever played the best.",2
"civilization 5 is probably one of the best strategy games i have played in a long time, i really enjoy the series even civilization revolution for the xbox 360. but overall i recommend this game to all 10.5/10",1

"better than civ 4 so far. no more unit stacking makes military victories easier. culture rush is nerfed. even cities without any units can bombard barbarians. no more transports needed to travel overseas is very nice. no more religions. the social policies are simpler too. a-",1
"bought this for 7,49 from summer sale 2014. for that price the games has definitely paid off its value, its entertaining, hard, and it takes some time to learn. id say theres definitely more replay value in this game than in most of the total war series games for example. ( go from ancient era to future when total war games usually focus on 1 period of time ) great game with or without friends, but id say you get the most out of it with friends. for me this is the best strategy game ive ever played.",1
"lots of replay value. online play is fantastic. music is awesome.",1
"this is probably a good game. ill know for sure after a few months, after which i will hopefully have finished my first game",1
"best game to get if you wanna play against mates in a long battle. loads of diferent ways to win and all, you dont have to be agressive. you can do waht you want with your country and i love it!",1
"great game to suck some time overall. there are some bugs it seems as you build your empire, the larger it gets the more often there are lag issues in processing turns.",2
"1 word can describe this game, amazing, but that makes for a sucky review. this game is all about building a civilization, and trying to develop it to be better that the others in the game. you develop new technologies, fight wars among the other civs and city states, conquer land and found cities, spread religion (dlc required), and nukes. :uranium: there are some amazing mods out there for this game, just an amazing game overall,",2
"best loose track of time simulator out there. 10/10",1

"ive never played a civilization game before this one, but i was already aquianted with the greatness of sid meiers pirates! so, when i saw this, i decided to go ahead and give it a try. im not big on strategy games, being a bit slow on the take myself, but i have to say that since i got this game just a few short days ago, ive spent a good 35 hours watching my civilization swell across continents. its extremely addictive, and i can honestly say you lose track of time playing this game. its very helpful to new players, and it didnt take me long to pick it up. i certainly reccommend this title to everyone.",1
"such a great game! make sure you have a very powerful processor, or turn-times near the end of the game can take a very long time. really though, if youre into strategy games, this is the best one out.",5
"when you spend 5.5 hours playing in one sitting and still fell compelled to come back, its a good sign that you might like the game. a game that allows you to be a  to the ai as you create and destory empires is a game that i would recommend.",1

"this game showed me my passive aggressive need to rule and conquer the world. ign - 10/10",1
"amazingly addictive game, with endless replay value. only problem is that some countries can be rather predictable, gandhi will always nuke you, and china will always betray you if your friends then when you knock em back theyre like oh no were friends, couple turns later they betray you again.",2
"best strategy game out there. (only posting this review for xp, sorry).",2
"wow, this game is sooooooo addicting! play it, play it now! (i sold my car to buy the game and expansion packs)",1
"the more you play this game the better gets. you cant just sit down and play this for a few minutes you needs hours and hours to even make dent in the amoutn of gameplay needed to really get things going. all in all 10/10 strategy game, would play again...and again...and again....",1

"imho, nowhere near as good as civ 4 and the 2 expansions are highly recommended. much easier than every other edition in the civ series. theyve done a decent job patching out issues created by the changes. infinite city sprawl seems to be a bit less effective than it was at release.",1
"great game! plenty of variety, replay value, victory conditions etc...",4
"it is fun but there are huge let downs, the connections, the dlcs, the extras. for once, a game i loved, has become a dlc sucking one, i was so blind to wanting to buy this game , but it isnt worth it. if you plan to buy all dlc, then its worth your time. if not, dont buy it, the multiplayer feature makes u have all dlc or youll play alone. you wont find much people playing now, it breaks sometimes. it is such a let down, i give this game a 5/10",1
"if youre that guy that cant excercise good judgement and self-control when it comes to getting off the pc and going to bed so you can be a successful, pleasant and useful human being the next day, then just dont purchase this game. youll say, one more turn or something like that every five minutes, itll be 6am and you have to be at work at 8. youll do this until you either get fired for being unproductive, sleepy, or missing work, or youll die from some energy drink heart explosion or in a car accident from falling asleep behind the wheel. yea, this game is great. i need more red bull.",1
"one of the best turn-based strategy game...one more turn",1

"this is a very good strategy game, but they need to put down the turns of the npcs!!",1
"warning!!!: this game is really addictive, you think you can handle one more turn but after 12 hours you realize it wasn`t one turn. i am person who really like strategic games and civilization v is the best strategic game so... best game ever made. 11/10",1
"this is a game you can get lost in. there is always just one more turn and its so hard to resist the temptation to keep on going. its fun, stragetic and most of all very user friendly. its easy to get into if youve never played a turn based game. the tutorial is incredibly helpful and really goes through the fine lines of explaining everything properly.",1
"an awesome strategy game. it is turn based but the good thing is that everyone takes their turns simultaneously so it doesnt take additional time. the game can still take awhile but i love how the put economy into the game so it isnt just about building a big army but can also be about building wonders, building cities, and a variety of other ways to get the most points and ultimately win the game!",1
"amazing strategy game. like the civ series is known for the different victories combined with different civilizations make it interesting to play again and again. the combat system is really well balanced and built. i recomment this game if you are a patient gamer. for those that are used to fast paced rts games like warcraft, starcraft, age of empires, command and conquer etc. you will get frustrated with the pace, even on quick games it takes quite some time if you play with more than 4 civilizations. tl;dr: amazing game, it will suck you into hundreds of hours of greatness.",3
"civ v is a great turn based strategy game which lets you take history and make it submit to you as the master of all history and other boshtets. in all seriousness, the best part is being able to bomb poor s who still use crossbows and swords and crap. id reccomend this game to turn based strategy fans and people who really like seeing rome become a world power and stuff.",1
"best game i have played in a long time but say good bye to your life",1
"being able to eradicate the world of communism, spread the good word of lord gaben, and promoting democracy to the people around the world. what more could you want? 1337/69 would play again.",1

"in my opinion, civ v with the latest dlcs is the best civ to date. exceptional re-playability, trophies, entertainment and balance. of course it has been around long enough to hone itself to near perfection. easily recommended for any 4x gamer who somehow has never heard of civ or sid meier.",3
"one of the best game i goten off steam so far. totaly worth it",1
"one of the best games i have ever gotten my hands on. ive never played a civilization game or any game of the game type and ended up on a 22 hour spree of oh my god i cant stop, this is amazing. worth every penny.",1

"i love this game. but even better with dlc if it would ever go on sale **cough cough**",1
"this game is a life-stealing time-sink. i come back to this game again and again. it is very satisfying to win.",1

"ive only played for a few hours. its pretty meh. probably wont replay too often.",1
"i had never experienced being awake through the night until 5am. until i got civilization v. and despite my sore eyes the next day, no regrets.",1
"great game, i have played over 110 hours and it never gets old!",1
"civ v is on of those games that you have heard great things about, but arent sure if youll like it. you buy it when its on sale and then immediatley lose your entire day playing it, strategizing on when you should declare war or who should be your ally. it does have some minor flaws but the fun you have both by yourself or with friends outsizes the few flaws i found.",2
"bought 7 nukes thatll teach them japs 10/10 hope you dont need to work",1

"its a great strategy game where you can play as historical leaders and destroy countries that in history messed with your country.(also you can take the role of some of the worst political leaders)",1
"this game is sooo adictive. you just want to play until the end of the world. it has so many unique mods that go with it hand in hand.",1
"civilization v has given me a new hope for strategy games. as a person who has had little experience with previous civ games, i can say that it was still easy to pick up and roll with. all-in-all, the game isnt complex, but has many complexities working within it. from happiness of your citizens, to the amount of gold your making, everything you do is an important decision. i liked the idea of spying on other civs while protecting yourself from other civs spies. this game will give you a new patience for movement and decision making when trying to make your civilization dominant.",1
">dont know jack about civ >buy steam sale >play 3 multiplayer games >mfw 14 hours >11/10 would buy again",1
"an great turned based strategy game, with many new things to the series, but still not everything that th eprevious games had. just make sure you keep track of time as you play one more turn for hours.",2
"civilization v is great for those who are not great at strategy games, particularly ones focusing on military might. i have never been very good at keeping an organized military force, whether it be in the turn based or real time genres, but this game does a great job of giving you alternate paths to victory. though i am aware previous iterations of civ have always had multiple paths to victory, this version has made achieving those victories viable.",1
"an amazing game, i reccomend it to players that like a challenging game. even though it might take a while to get into and the games may be long, still a fun strategy game to play.",4
"this game is great if you have 25 hours free a day",2
"one of the best strategi (turn based) game ever, and in civilization v, you can do a lot more then previous games, not only more civilizations, units, buildings, wonders but aswell new cultural victory, international trade routes, world congress, policies, ideologies, religion, diplomacy, espionage, naval combat, city states, and a lot more, what are you waiting for ? world domination by your hand is waiting... (psst, at least try the demo !) official site :",1
"honestly, the best way to make history into a action-packed awesome- game!",2
"my friend always builds the great library before me. but sometimes i build it first and he asks for a restart. everytime he gets it i just try to kill him. i team up with the other friend that plays to kill him. we fail. our empires get nuked. we rage quit. he always wins and keeps playing by himself just to try to capture all our empires. 200 hours go by. 10/10 would try to build the great library again.",2
"this may be the single greatest game ever, from its awesomeness, to its epicness, it makes you suck a  and like it.",1
"kill. ghandi. before. he. can. build. nukes. and thats all you need to know!",1
"be george washington, kill ghandi. seriously what else is there that you need to know?",1
"boring as hell, every game goes the exact same and the computer just steamrolls over you.",1
"great game. just make sure you get the expansions.",2
"if you even somewhat like strategy, then you will most deffinitally love this one. there is always something different everytime you play you will never have two games alike. making this game very easy to play again and again.",2

"good old civ with a few new twists. im especially happy about the army stacking going away.",2
"great strategic game. some wierd bugs, but i guess my biggest complaint would be how mch the expansions cost...",1
"i like it, but put steam workshop for this on mac.",3
"civ v games take a long time and are very addicting but challenge your strategic ability and put you in the throne of a nation. highly recommended.",1
"10 out of the last 48 hours went into this game. bye life",1
"the best way to whittle away hours of your life, and learn a few things along the way.",1
"its one of the only games that i can keep coming back to and enjoy.",2
"civ v before the expansions was good. civ v after the expansions is fantastic. not to mention the scenarios you can build with the mods through the workshop.",1
"simple enough to get into easily, but with enough gameplay mechanics to take months to really master.",1
"had a violent war that killed millions with a tyrannical ghandi. 13/10 would recomend for americans.",1
"awesome strategy game. even if you are not a big fan of strategy games (like me :p) you will like this game. really adictive, you can play for hours without even noticing. recommended!",1
"meh, it lacks the depth i like but is fun for a sitting or two.",1
"yes... please buy this game... conquer the world!!! it seriously is a ton of fun to paly if you enjoy strategizing and planning out your attack. and also being able to see your army grow and crush everything.",1
"i made a civilization in this game. a civilization of fun!!! (not the band)",1
"this game sucks you in. try for yourself, its worth it.",3
"the only game you can play for hours and make 0 progress.",2
"they declared war on me because i tresspassed their borders once some millenias ago. good times. surely recommend. 10/10 would play again.",1
"if you are thinking of getting a strategy game for this sale, go with this. i would also recommend buying the standerd version then bnw cause bnw includes g and k and adds more too, so its just more bang for your buck. if u do get it msg me so we can play!",2
"this awesome game is extremely addictive and one of the most complex strategy games i have ever played. it has taken me over 60 hours of gameplay to fully grasp even the vanilla version of the game and a further 40 hours to even become good at it, lol. the dlcs added heaps of content, refining the whole game into something even more better and worth way more than 6 keys in total for g&k and bnw. played 120 hours and counting; maybe a further 100 hours will satisfy me of this game :l. most immersive ruler scenes and the fact the sejong-korea and also ethiopia is in the game truly amazes me about the range of diversity in the game. 10/10",2
"it really doesnt get any better or more polished than civ5 11/10",3
"great game. if you are willing to sit there for hours and controll the direction a civilization evolves over the eons this is for you. if you want a fast game loook else where",1
"fun game as well very long gameplay only one thing its more fun to play with friends.",1
"fun-to-play tbs, easy to learn, hard to master, and very addictive. you should play it. just for another turn.",1
"dont you just love it when you spend 2 hours on a game then it crashes for an unkown reason if so this is the game for you.",1
"cant stress out how complex and fun this game is. the latest dlc, brave new world is a must have when you buy the game. the game is so complete and allows you all kidns of winning conditions. if you want to be peacefull, you can do it. if you want to conquest everything, you can do it. different speed settings allow you to pace the game as you wish, from a quick 4hr game to a game that can take a few days to complete. user created add-ons bring even more content to the game, making this a game that will provide many hours of fun, and will take a whole lot of time to master and conquest. if you like turn based strategy games, this is definitely a game you must have",2
"great game. played it for hours, the expansions also add some really interesting new mechanics to the game.",1
"this game is awesome, and on sale for the next couple days, its definitely worth your money.",2
"i love this game. the only drawback is that when i start playing, i lose twelve hours of my day without even realizing it.",1
"this game crashes constantly. i am a huge fan of sid meier and the civilization franchise but i cannot even finish a match because the game crashes halfway through",1
"as a long time civ player i really was looking forward to this game - but in my opinion it is a huge disappointment. they took something great and managed to dumb it down and make a game with no lasting value.",1
"ridiculously addictive game. sunk many an hour into civ 4 and this is just as good if not better.",1
"great game. absolutely worth the money and gameplay time.",1
"an excellent update to the classic series. the gameplay is streamlined but not simplified, and the hex-based map makes exploration easier and less time-consuming. the ai is a bit lacking, but civ has always worked best in multiplayer. it also feels like this game lacks some of the character that civ iv had. the soundtrack isnt as good and its missing those classic leonard nimoy tech intros. all in all, a great game, but id stick to iv for single player.",1
"if you want a game to waste your time in get this game.",4
"die hard civilization fan here so the only thing i can complain about is the inflated price of the dlc packs, i really want the new brave new world dlc but 30 bucks for 1 dlc is kinda ridiculous especially with civ6 scheduled to be released next year. i already bought the game and all dlc available seperately, so i have already spent more on this game than the price of the combo. on top of that i didnt get some scenario games with some of the earlier dlc and a few of the civs, i tried steam and civ support and they each blamed the other and ended up giving up after fruitless hours of customer service. awesome game but the support sucks from steam.",3
"ever feel the need to re-arrange everything that happened ever? this is a good way to spend 30 hours doing it in one sitting, only to be crushed by ghandi.",1
"gandhi wants to kill me and genghis khan wants to be friends 1010",1
"awesome game, takes some time but well built strategy game.",1
"kind of boring and tedious, the leaders stay alive for 1000 years its like rise of nations but much slower paced",1
"yes of couse i recomend this game its amazingly addictive",1
"right, so first of all if you dont like history, bloody battles, advances in technology, ancient civilizations or just cool stuff. this game isnt for you. civilization v is a history gurus dream come true, well into a game atleast. as soon as you dive into civilization v, you might not come out of your room for a few weeks, also if youre a student in school expect to see your history grade rise...",2
"bitterly disappointing. nearly everything that made civ4 a great game has been pared back, and what remains is a shallow and meaningless turn based strategy game where everyone seems at perpetual war with everyone else. corporations, espionage and religion are the main things that i really miss, but also the way that the civ4 leaders all had a personality. now its just like a 10 player (or whatever) skirmish mode with leaders you couldnt care less about and faceless city states that act as nothing but speedbumps on the road to domination. lame, really lame. graphics are sweet, hexes (instead of squares) are good, one unit per hex combat is different (not bad per se), the rest is dumbed down rubbish. its like civ for console kiddies. 4/10.",1
"if you love risk you will love this! games lasts for hours and hours and there is never a shortage on what to do :d a+++++++",1
"damn addictive, reccomend the latest expansion brave new world, makes the game look more alive",1
"good game as it stands but the dlc makes it a much much better game",1
"civ v is a piece of art. i love this game and every aspect of it. i love the feeling you get when you capture a city or even an empire. keep it up civ. i hope there will be a civ vi.",1
"this game is a must have. its awesome, and hard. i have played for 30 hours, and are still a noob.",1
"fun game, even better at 75% off, not worth the full price though, good as it is. but then again, no game is worth more than 10, if you pay more than that youre a mug, id say.",1
"great stragey game much better than any other stradegy game i have played.",1
"for strategy nerds, history nerds and anyone who wishes to see wild inaccuracies in history just for teh lulz (the aztecs conquering the french? who knew?) its a great timesink for anyone craving strategy. its good for newbies and experts alike, ranging between i can do this to the ai is straight up cheating a personal favorite thing about this game is that it plays in turns (so you can watch some tv or whatever and wont lose because you got distracted) and that it doesnt require precise controls, making it perfect for playing in a laptop without external mice or keyboards",1
"this game made me giggle my , if you catch my drift.",3
"an absolutely amazing game to play, and its great to just get lost in for hours at a time.",3
"this game can drag you out for hours and make you say hey, just one more turn then ill get off. but nope, that nation just provoked you and now youre going to kick their . this game is a classic and is truly fun. dont underestimate it.",1
"phenomenal game. have over 100 hours and it still gets better everytime i play.",3
"if youve got the expansions, and you want to play with someone, hit me up! unless we dont talk much, then just stay away loser. jk, i would play this game with homeless kittens if i had to, and that would be really cute to do.",2
"its ing civ, what else is there to say? my only advice is to buy the dlcs as the base game is sort of empty... and broken. but other than that its a great game, especially with friends!",1
"never trust that indian  ghandi. he will  your  open so hard and take all of your lavender.",1
"have you ever sat down and thought how cool it would be to run an empire? well in this game you can!",5
"base game is great alone, gods and kings and brave new world really improve on it. barbarians are always a problem. great game",2
"if you are very complex then this game is for you!! its very fu**ing good!!!!!!",2
"yes yes yessssss! there is nothing like the satisfaction of dropping your first nuke in this game!",1
"civilization v is one of the best turn-based strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing. whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer, or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player, this is one game that any strategy enthusiast, or, hell anyone strat-curious should check out. sure, i miss some of the deeper inter-civilization relations that the more defined religion and government setup brought in civilization iv, but thats nothing anyone new to the series will even think twice about. with all the tips, advisers and tools in place, this is the first civilization for pc that i feel is worth just about every persons time. go forth and create, subdue, and exploit. do as firaxis has done, and bring civilization to the masses.",1
"the game is very fun and can keep you busy. it is laid out very well and generaly a fantastic game",2
"one more turn... one more turn... one more turn... just. one. more.",1
"fantastic game, highly recommended to any fans of turn based strategy.",3
"do eet! seriously civ is super fun if you like strategy games. tons of fun!",4
"if you dont already have this game, you belong in a metal institute",1
"reviews are unecessary. just buy it, youll like it, whether if you like it or not.",2

"most awesome strategy game ive ever played! worth a buy =d",1
"i love all the civilization games. i just....i dont get why turns have to take forever the later into the game you go. whyyyyy",1
"fun to play by yourself or with friends, one of my favorite strategy games",1
"twice... twice i thought id start a game then end in a couple hours to come back to the game at a later time. boy was i wrong. this game sucks you in, with so many options in how you build up your civilization.",1
"damn good game very well done for multiplayer fun, though it does take a darn long time. worth a buy for sure.",2
"love the game, but really dissapointed with the price of the dlcs.",1
"this is just one of the most awesome games, cant wait to the next one",1
"this game is so addicting and fun. i recomend also getting the brave new world dlc to make it even more fun. 10/10.",1
"a welcome addition to the civ family. has some definite imporvements from four, including a new hex grid system. downgrades include the loss of troop stacking.",1
"gamer is so good it makes you punch your own face.",1
"a lot of fun to play. warning though time will fly while playing this game",1
"overall, civilization v is an amazingly addictive strategy game. i was skeptical at first, but upon purchasing, i couldnt stop playing it.",1
"one of the best single players games out there. once you get some friends to play with you it is 10 times better, but its still amazing either way.",2
"i have killed the aztecs so many times, im practically spanish. 5 star time suck (woohoo!)",5
"the late-game portion of civilization games has always been a weak point in the series. often, during the middle ages, it becomes obvious which player will win the game. as well, managing a large empire with many cities can become overwhelming. luckily they addressed this problem in civilzation 5 by making the late-game run so slowly, its essentially unplayable!",2
"great game, manages to balance calming gameplay as you dominate everyone on the table, but on the other hand ramps the competetive pressure when playing with freinds. great multiplayer experience.",1
"keep your citizens happy or they will rebel, burn your friends fields, and then he wont play with you anymore because you think that deutschland muss vor allem glcklich, wenn wir mrz dem tank in die herzen unserer feinde und kmpfen, bis zum letzten mann steht das blut blut fr gott!",1
"a deep, wonderfully complex (but not everly so) tbs. many different ways to play, many variations of civs. the dlcs add so much more to the game play, they are well worth it to get. if you have the time to get into this, i would recommend it.",1
"when i login to play anything, this is usually what i want to play. there is something so satisfying about playing civ v. every game you play will be different so the replay value is off the charts. fantastic game all around.",2
"i dont know if its my computer or the game,but its not letting me play.",1
"if deep, complex, but rewarding and intricate strategy games are your jam, this game is a must have. if you dont like strategy or slow games, this is not the game for you! this is meant for you folks who dont like time limits and just shooting at whatever is in front of you. this is for those of you who will take the very long time necessary to learn to play a game llike this.",1
"the best historical turn-based stategy series period. one of the major reasons i built a gaming pc",2
"do you like civilizations?! do you like warfare?! do you like firing nukes without repercussions?! if you answered yes to any of the above, read on. if not... read on anyway. i might be able to persuade you. civilization v is nothing like the previous incarnations of the series. except for the overall gameplay, most of the features have changed. leaders have been done away with, and all nations have only one leader. religion has been greatly expanded upon with the gods & kings expansion, and theres a new world congress feature to replace the un in brave new world. that being said, while this is a great game by itself, the unpatched version without the dlc and expansionpacks is inferior to civilization iv in terms of content. if youre planning to pick this up, get it with the dlc or at the very least the expansions. it should give you, at the veyr least, a few hours of amusement.",1
"one of the most addicting games i have ever played. so deep, but easy to start. may take a lifetime to finish all the achievements.",1
"sid meiers civilization v please let me sleep! this game is fantastic, i cant stop playing from late evening till 6 am. the game pulls you into a timeless zone, where 8 hours feels like 2. great replay-ability, super fun game, cant stop playing it. say goodbye too your social life! 10/10 would play till early morning again.",1
"an awesome turned based strategy game starring some of the world historys great and late leaders*. fight foreign nations for control of resources and lead your nation to victory via military, cultural, scientific or diplomatic dominance. *leaders may not be portrayed with any historical accuracy.",3
"i really dont know what to say.. i just love this game so much!",1
"an absolute must for strategy nuts, highly realistic with the technology tree, barbarians can be quite annoying but then again so can most things in many games, i highly recommend this game to new comers in the civ franchise and the veterans who are yet to play this.",1
"this game wil suck you in and never let you leave.",1
"great fun game to play with mates or solo. hours and hours of fun.",1
"i just wish beyond earth was as good as civ v! great game.",1
"this game is awesome. i admit i have a little obsession with this one. its one of them games where you loose half the day before realize you havent eaten or even gone to the bathroom. its turn based strategy at its best. and who doesnt like to conquer the world?",3
"better than beyond earth.and i recommend::::::buy dlcs",3
"this game is what every city-building games wishes to be. also, the graphics are beautiful and there is a combat system that doesnt suck in a city-building/strategy game.",1
"very great rts play. great to play online. a lot better than age of empires and i grew up on that.",1
"this game has been an awesome purchase. i have been playing it non stop since i bought it.",1
"sooooo many hours poured into this game, ive forgotten what the sun looks like",3
"brilliant turn-based strategy game for anyone that enjoys the genre. great to play with a bunch of friends.",2
"can not get game to run even though it says that i am playing.",1
"if ive wasted 400 hours of my life on this game, you know its good.",2
"this game tears family and friend apart. i started a game with my friends and by the end everyone had betrayed each other, bonds broken, friendships destroyed. 10/10",1
"i bought this game just because i liked the thought of politically molesting my friends who were playing it online at the time. i have now logged coming up to 600 hours in game. the variety of tactics using different civilizations in their most effective ways is a surefire way to keep the game fresh, especially when installing the mods from the workshop. whether its a complete reskin or a civ that holds meaning to you you always find time just leaves.",3
"i love sid meiers civilization v. im a longtime civization and sims nut, so im biased but really. its so worth it and better with friends than an ai! the multiplayer is really well structured and works out really well for an overall fun test of strategic might! x3",1
"one of the best civ games out there so pumped they mave beyond earth",1
"very addictive! but this game is made for who like strategic games. one of the best games on my steams library.",1
"its historic and a very good game you learn a lot while playing it and the strategy in this game is like non other its amazing i love it thx for a great game",1
"great turn-based strategy game. highly recommended. very easy to sink many hours into.",1
"one does not simply dislike this game. addicting, massive replayability, especially with dlcs like gods and kings and brave new world, and amazing gameplay providing hours of fun no matter of age, 6 or 45...",1
"civ 5 is a radical change from the previous civs in many ways, but is equally radically a step up in terms of gameplay. the switch from squares to hexes might seem small, but it makes a huge difference on how easy it is to gather resources and move around the map. the introduction of full screen shots where civ leaders move, gesture, react, and talk in their appropriately native language gives an amazing sense of connection with the past. it is, hands down, my favorite civ yet.",1
"your people get extremely pissed if you build 2 cities, otherwise great game",1
"tried making friends with elizabeth... didnt work, decided to take over her empire... 10/10",1
"good game for every conspirator, war driven fanatic, or diplomatic peacekeeper. recommend to play with friends",1
"highly addictive - the bnw and g&k expansions make the complete a worthwhile purchase after the original. only complaint is mac users are prevented from every earning the download a mod achievement.",3
"-first leader i meet: alexander the great -best buddies, trading and stuff -meet china -befriend china -alexander wants to kill china and asks me, i decline -2 turns later china denounce me, say ive got pitiful army and hates me -alexander, asks me for 3000 gold, i accept -2 turns later, alexander and china declare war on me -i die...",2
"just one more turn. that is what is going to happen if you play this - actually, no, dont even try it. this game is great, everytime there are sales i feel temptated to go around giving it to people and watching them get sucked into being addicted to it. game had its downsides when it was vanilla, but hole cow batman, its great now - if you have free time and think what a log knows is worth to heed, youll play the hell out of this!",2
"the single player is weak, with less expansion and over all intelligence then previous civ titles. but the multiplayer is reasonably well put together. the game could handle some optimizing to run smoother, but overall its a fun title that adds a lot of new features to the series. get the full pack on a sale if you plan to buy it, its not worth the price of buying all the dlc seperately.",2
"i dont even need security clearances to fire a nuke. 420/10",2
"a fanstastic game, youll spend hours playing this.",1
"rome wasnt build in a day... it needed just one more turn",1
"historical fiction: yes famous world leaders: yes interdependant trade: yes as many bugs as skyrim: no",1
"i love this game! i might be playing it, see its late, say eh, just a little longer aaaand its morning...",1
"this game is quite addictive, youll play for quite a while.",1
"i recommend you to stay away from this addictive game. want to be a time traveler? try this game, and skip your boring life forever! this is a must own game. dont ever try this game, if you still love your time and life. score : 9/10",1
"i have loved and played civ for many years now. this one, they changed it so much!!! its difficult to get into it at first, particularly when used to the other game play. still an amazing game though!",1
"this game is fun, and the modding community is awesome, but only if you have brave new world and gods and kings, if not, then you are not going to mod anytime soon.",1
"one of the best tbs games, but for the series fans it still needs quite a lot tuning. i am really happy that the series is going in the right direction with the new content.",2
"became a great entry with the gods and kings expansion. not worth it without it. if youre not interested in spending that much money, pick up iv gold.",1
"you dont think youll play for very long when you start, but then youve got six cities and the ottoman empire is threatening your allies and trying to get on your good side, and you stop playing civ and actually become a world leader with a cry of  what the hell am i gonna do?! as you hover over the declare war button. also its now 4am and you cant remember the last time you ate.",1
"great game. highly addictive so be prepared to spend quite a bit of time on it.",1
"a soon as you start and get to know the game you just cant stop!! you always want more!  thats why we dont have peace in the world! this game show incredibly well why!",1
"possibly one of the greatest strategy simulation games. less complex than civilization 4 but doesnt take anything away from it. game is a great time sink and enjoyable on many levels.",2
"good for hours of fun with yourself or friends dawg",1
"it doesnt get any better then this turn based strategy game. details are incredible. cant stop playing",1
"youre damn right i recommend this game. it may seem silly with some of its cartoonish interactivity, but, once you get past that, it is one of the most addictive simplistic games ive ever enjoyed within the strategy genre. i play it for hours without even noticing such time has gone by, yet i dont feel my time wasted. i enjoy this game and i believe you will to.",1
"the game is amazing if u like this kind of games ,try the tuttorial if is your first time playing this game. but dont forget to stop when u learn the basic.(i spend 6 hours on tutorial :( )",1
"a brilliant turn-based strategy game with many different ways to play.",1
"great game, recommend getting all dlcs as that makes the game so much better",1
"my first game on steam. its the start of my addiction, i h ave since then moved on. however this game still remains one of my favourites because i played it the most and its what got me into the pc gaming community, it was awesome!",1
"civilization takes quite a departure in its fifth installment from its usual design. luckily this works out for the better. the improvements to ui and strategic depth have made civ v the best civ yet. no more stacks of doom and pretty much everything else has been streamlined while retatining the originals strategic depth. i mean, duh come on, its a civilization game. you know you want it.",1
"ive played too much of this. if you have a decade to kill, go for it. world domination.",1
"one of the best strategy games ive played. you gotta love turn base games though.get the expansions too, they add so much good stuff to play with. oh, i almost forgot... bring some munchies and something to drink cause youre about to experience never ending games even on solo mode.",1
"this game expands and expands to no end. its very time consuming, but much like a good chess game, its a lot of fun. you have to give it a try! try getting it on sales, as it goes down to about $7.50 for the whole game with expansion packs.",3
"sid meiers civilization v is one of the best games i have ever played. whether you win by diplomacy, domination, science, etc, you always feel that sense of accomplishment inside. gods and kings adds a number of great civilizations to play as and meet, along with the addition of espionage and religion. the elements added to the original game are useful and fun to use. brave new world adds a very interesting element to the game, completely changing the diplomatic victory. a very fun expansion, and well worth the price. sid meiers civilization v and its expansions are all worth the price they are listed. i would recommend buying the gold edition for the game, or buying the gold edition upgrade, as they are the same price.",1
"i have not played very much of the game so far but as first impressions go i dont think it could have done a better job. it seems like a very well thought out game and well worth buying.",1
"i played civ v for 4+ years before i got the expansion packs. i love the game as a whole, but unfortunately the expansion packs have taken away a lot of the fun that i had while playing civ v. there is quite a lot more going on than there was in the original game, so much so that the it is almost too much to handle. im sure ill get used to it in time, but, as of now, i would recommend either only buying the game and not the packs, or buy it all, but play without the packs until you get the hang of the game.",2
"if you want a time machine; this game is perfect. you can launch the game at the start of the day and being called for dinner not long after.",1
"you cant get a much better deal than with civ v. the gameplay is flawless and still highly addictive even though i have played for a year.",2
"very fun game. many great features in the expansion pack, so make sure you get the whole thing if you are thinking of buying this game. the situations are fun, and multiplaayer works great. citizen managment can be confusing, and hard to master the best combination for specific situations and times, so dont mess with that unless you know what you are doing. every thing else is great and easy to learn. all the leaders are great and fun to play as and against. great game, and worth every penny.",1
"i cant explain it. you open the game...and then you look at the clock and youve somehow lost track of the last 6 hours. any game that can engross you that much is a definite recommendation! a definite must-have for any 4x strategy game fan!!",1
"well, who wouldnt wanna play this game? a great strategy game that you must have in your collection. in case you plan on playing civilization on older laptop. go for the civilization 3 version, as this one tends to bog down old laptops.",1
"civ 5 is one of those games that is so difficult to understand, so you spend hours and hours playing and learning the game, never able to fully perfect it. it is an amazing game to pick up and play, expecially on sale.",1
"i spent 4 hours on this game in a single match. it was worth it.",1
"very fun good graphics you can play with many freinds at once buy it!",1
"this  ing sucks but you should play it anyways for the lulz",1
"civilization v.... sitting on the pinnacle of steam top purchases basking in the adoration of strategy players and your here with a blank look on your face wondering what it is. well take a couple of minutes of your god forsaken miserable life to lift your eyes of your daily degenerate lifestyle to comprehend the apex of gaming. civilization 5 is a strategy based game that revovles around turn based decisions and adaption to environtment and resources around you to achieve various types of victories. if you have patience and are a veteren rts/strategy player you would enjoy this.... well i did anyway.",5
"now that the expansions are out it is as good as civ4!",2
"if you like turn-based strategy thats eay to pick up and play, then pick up and play this.",2
"the best game ever created, hundreds of hours i will spend here with joy!",1
"nuclear missiles giant death robots homicidal gandhi 10/10",1
"i would greatly recomend this game for anyone who enjoys turn based strategy games. youll find yourself addicted to it in a matter of minutes, trying to become the worlds most cultural and military dominate empire. if you are not a patient person however you probably will not enjoy this game, because it takes alot of waiting and planning before you make your next move.",1
"civilization v is the fifth installment in arguably the best stratgy series ever. though people argue that its prdecessor, civ 4, was much better. but is it really. so in civ 5 you essentially pick an emeror ie; napolean and build a civilization. people say that civ 4 was better, because there were much more elements. yes, in civ 5 they did take a lot of eleents that civ 4 had, but if you are willing to get the dlc brave new world, you may get that civ experience that you were wanting all along with better graphics. you should definnitely pick this game up if you havent, you can get it really cheap of amazon or in the steam sales, in my opinion this is one of the best strategies out there today.",1
"strategy at its finest. be the culture that inspires the world, the warmonger that crushes anyone underfoot, be a diplomat and prove that pen is indeed mightier than the sword, be scientific and nuke the world leaving nothing but soot. many ways to win and so many different civilizations and leaders that history fans will grin and swoon for their favorites, and for the rest of us, theres building the pyramids in japan as the mayans while you make war with egypt. yeah, history is great.",1
"a modern masterpiece, with the replay value of a hot blonde.",3
"once you add on the gods & kinds and brave new world expansions, the game comes into its own as the definitive civilization. ive played hours and hours over the years since its been released, and the depth really comes out in the more difficult settings. by far the most-played game in my library, and unlikely be eclipsed by anything else in the foreseeable future.",2
"sid meiers civilization v is a great strategy game that new and old players of the civilization franchise will love. it combines great ai with complex strategy mechanics to immerse the player into his own empire made from a vareity of cities and military might that the civilization franchise specializes in. however, the only downside to this game is the lack of interesting scenarios that only pricey dlc can supply. but despite the scenario problem, civilization v is a fun and exciting game to play with friends or by yourself against the difficult ais. i recommend this game.",1
"such a great time waster, i can get sucked in for hours without even realizing it.",1
"a great game - expecially with brave new world. just watch out for gandhi - dont let the sandals fool ya!",1
"such an awesome game! i never really liked strategies such as warcraft 3 or red alert, but this just opened my eyes...it is so massive and there is so much to do. unlimited replayability (or at least there about) and it is tons of fun.",1
"a worthy succesor in the franchise and true to its just one more turn reputation, civ 5 is a must have for everyone who likes tbs. the abundant achievements are bound to keep you busy even if you played every faction and every difficulty level in the game, and if youre bored with the vanilla version, the 2 large dlc- packs add a new level of depth to your 12-hour game sessions. and even after youve done all that, there are still a truckload of mods in the steam workshop. buy it, and buy it now.",1
"far too often has been the cause of 6am bedtimes. fantastic",1
"dont get this game. hours, literal hours will fly by before youve noticed. i dont even know if this game is fun - all i know is that half of my day dissapeared and i wasnt aware of time passing. there is something sinister about this game..",1
"dispite the fact of war being a little to server punishement (i dont mind my people mad just i am disappointed that if you go to war every one but you allies and friends will want you 6 feet under) this is a intensly fun game and it is much more intese with mods because, you dont have a clue what to expect. if you want most of the workshop addons though you need g&k and brave new world dlcs but you will still have fun vinilla style.",1
"sid meiers time stealer v awesome for wasting an entire day on one game. 4/5 would recommend.",1
"hours of play time, high replay ability, wont get bored of it very fast, overall great game and the expansion makes it even better. highly recommend buying",5
"no words can explain how great this game is! 11/10 :d",1
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played in my life. i put more than 150 hours into this game and the only other game i put more than one hundred hours into is skyrim, and thats sayig something about this game. this game is easily around a 9/10 or 8/10 you will be so addicted",2
"the only downside to this game is that u will lose your life to its awesomeness !!!",1
"the game is fun u can play with ur friends and conquer the world",1
"great game to play with friends. whats better than taking over the world? taking over the world with some friends!!!",1
"a sign of a good game is that you loose track of time while playing it and with civilization v it has happend multiple times were i think i have only been playing for around 45min but i have actually been plaing for 3 hours",1
"back in 1991, a little game called civilization was released. it was a pretty awesome game, everything was perfect. except for gandhi. gandhi was given the lowest possible rating for aggression, he wouldnt hurt a fly. however, when a civilization adopted democracy, it would set back all other civs aggression levels by 2. this meant gandhi was set to -1, which flung him all the way back to the highest rating - 255. its been a running joke ever since. since then gandhi has conquered many civs taken over many planets and made many nukes. #neverforget.",1
"the game is great but steam will not open after a year, be careful. it requires an internet connection to keep verification, but steam does not have a phone number for service. when you ask it a question it gives you only a faq response. not helpful.",2
"well it sucks without the two expansions. but with the two new expansions its one of the best games ever!",2
"each game takes hours to master. especially if you set for large scale maps (i favor earth personally) and slow times with many players and city-states. i seem to have a problem completely taking over enemy capitals in war. ill deplete the entire health but it wont give me an option to make it into a puppet or anything. be prepared to spend days combating other players missionaries (man i hate islam..) and never trust gandhi. great music, good voiceovers. its a thinking-mans game and i give it a badass stamp of approval!",1
"do not buy this game. if you do... there is no going back. just one turn and your life is gone. you keep thinking to yourself: just... one... more... turn...... but it is no use. you cant stop. you have been addicted. 1000/10 best and most addictive game in the history of man.",2
"its a great strategy game where you start off as a civilization of your choice and you battle for victory against many other civilizations. the game has different modes and scenarios so no match is the exact same.",1
"this is a fantastic turn-based strategy game that will chew through your time like godzilla through tokyo. the screenshots may look like its a complex game, but its actually a very simple game with a lot of depth. the interface has been polished to such a degree that it keeps pulling you in. anyone willing to give this game 10 minutes of their time will find themselves looking at the clock at 4 am, blinking in disbelief and wondering where the time went (just... one... more... turn!) and the random world generator means that no two games will ever be alike. im not exaggerating when i say that this is one of the greatest games of all time.",3
"strategy games are sometimes hit and miss with me, but i thoroughly enjoyed this game, and even got my sister in on it! multiplayer is a must, and with there being a modding community, the games life is expanded further. also, hexes! i love hexes.",1
"so you thought monopoly was the ultimate destroyer of friendships, you have never been more wrong. i can promise you from the bottom of my heart that once someone rushes you with swarms of warriors or destroys you in any fashion during a game of civ 5, you will never be able to look at them the same way again. 10/10 would rush wonders to  everyone off again.",1
"essential strategy game. gods and kings add-on highly recommended.",2
"this is one of my favorite games. caution: extremly addicting.",3
"i bought this game a few weeks ago and it just keep freezing in the middle of the game. it is quite annoying. i have a toshiba satellite laptop 4 gs and windows 7.",1
"while many say its much simpler than civ 4, that doesnt stop it being an absolutley amazing game.",1
"i have a very soft spot for the civilization series. civilization iii, is, to my memory, the first game i ever played. i have since played 2, the snes version of the original, and this. like the rest of the series, its decently polished, easy to learn, has a lot of depth, and is periliously addictive. i didnt get into it as much as i did iii, but thats probably just nostalgic bias. if i had to complain, i would say that the diploacy is rather limited, and not being able to trade communications blows. thankfully, the rest of the game does it. also, i nuked beijing eleven times in a row, and it still stood, with two citzens who refused to die, district 13 style. 11/10.",1
"a great tactical game if youre looking for something different from the ususal fast paced action of other games on the market",1
"pretty good game. love the customizations and mutliple ways of winning.",1
"when i play i cant stop. it has ruined my life. my wife has left me and i cant see my children anymore. i havent been outside in 2 weeks. 4/5",1
"a turn-based strategy game that focuses on all of the aspects of building and maintaining an empire.",1
"this is one of the most addicting and enjoyable games ive ever played. very excited for beyond earth to be released later this year.",2
"expansion packs are mandatory, but when you get them this is a great and totally addictive game. definitely a must have for any pc gamer.",2
"this game is awesome. although the game may seem complicated the game really helps you throughout the game with hints and recommendations, and it helps that the menu is easy to understand. the characters in the game are well done but are lacking dialouge. the graphics, surprisingly, are a very strong part of the game. the lasting appeal is endless as their is so many scenarios to play as, especially is you obtain the dlcs for the game. the ganplay is great and fun, and the ai is good and keeps the game interesting. building your own civilization from scratch and conquering the world is awesome 8.5/10- addictive and awesome",1
"you start at the dawn of your civilization with a small city and build up over thousands of years to forge an empire spanning across sea and land. wage wars or play it safe and let others do your fighting for you via diplomacy. the gameplay is rich and deep with many different civs and units and a long tech tree to research new technology. each game is different and provides unlimited replayability. the game becomes much more and generally a better experience with the added expansions, and i wouldnt recommend playing it without them but, the whole set can come at a price. overall i highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone should have it in there game library.",2
"very addictive if you like long sessions of gaming, then this is the game for you.",2
"great game. bugs need a bit of a sorting out and sometimes make the game not as fun but all together a fantastic experience. i would suggest civ 5 for all micro-management strategy fans out there.",1
"dis game is good, very much fun and it is like the best boardgame ever x10000, civ 4 fans will pretend theyre smart and say its not very complex but its still quite a tactical game and is fun in both single player and multiplayer. certain someone in my friends list, if youre reading this, just buy it already.",3
"id tell you everything, but first let me have just one more turn...",1
"i absolutely love this game, its a massive time-sink, but very much worth it. being mainly a singleplayer game, you can easily pause for days and then return to the game, a feature i quite enjoy myself.",1
"really fun and addicting game, games take a little long though.",1
"this game is fun and even more fun when you play it with friends and i really recomment it to people that like 4x games",2
"i cant stand this game. i have no idea how to play it. it is hard. do not recommend because it confuses me alot.",1
"this game has ruined me, much like i ruined earth. 22hrs for one game and they can only get longer, gg life goml scrub.",1
"the best of the civ series... and with each new expansion it gets better and better! 10/10!",2
"a great way to kick back, relax, and have lots of random discussions with your friends.",1
"definitely recommend, especially if you play it with mods. making history has never been more fun!",4
"great game worth the money, but you might want to wait for a sale like i did 10/10",1
"civ is an odd game. to someone with no knowledge of ancient civilizations, its mystifying, having dozens set out before you. but its great. and dont think, because its a bit confusing, youre getting flung in at the deep end. there are highly intuitive controls, and great tutorials (totally optional). i seriously recommend this game, and hope that you get it at some point.",1
"this game has got to be one of the best turn based strategy games in the entire pc gaming universe. i recommend anyone to play this if they have time on their hands and like to have more strategy in gaming.",1
"excellent but very addicting game turning minutes into hours of competitive strategies of awesomeness!",1
"just one more turn 20/10 would lose all aspects of life again.",1
"i nuked gandhi. killed millons of people. wiped out entire civilizations. mowe(e)d down armies with superior technology. did`nt feel bad about it. then i got back to real life. ate something. walked in the nature. accidentaly broke a little stick on the ground. thats something i feel bad about.",2
"what can i say about this game that hasnt already been said? nothing. if you have played any of the past civilization games and enjoyed them, get this. i havent played since civ 2, but this did not disappoint. +depth +replayability (infinitely so) -poor ai relys on built in advantages to be competative. -ai doesnt handle water maps very well.",2
"i love this game. the gameplay is easy enough to pick up on yet not overly simple. the soundtrack is also beautiful and soothing to the ears. i cant really say much other than its quite awesome.",1
"warning: do not purchase if you have anything that needs to be accomplished in the next 6 months.",1
"just a couple more turns then ill stud- napoleon has declared war on your empire oh, that er.",1
"cant get enougth of this game after my first 300 hours ofgameplay i still found new ways of having fun in it,good and huge amounts of content and very easy to learn but hard to win sometimes. the ai is not that bad as in tradicional strategy games and it actual makes the experience better when u have 5 civs going for a win all in diferents ways i love this game to much can get enought of it and i recomendet to everyone newcomer to the franchise or hardcore gamer srry for any english related error",5
"this game is by far one of the most addictive games ive played recently. ive literally spent nights playing on a large world map with my buddies. sat down one friday night and started to play this, i looked up thinking i should sleep soon and realized the sun was rising ! excellent game, great dlcs, just make sure to not trust gandhi. hes supposed to be peace loving but hes got a reputation at starting nuclear wars and spying on your cities.",1
"this game is fantastic! the original creator, sid meier, was a computer science-history double major in college (at umich). his love of historical peoples, leaders, and nations makes this game ideal and arousing to the inner history-nut in us all. also, in terms of gameplay, this games turn-based system makes the game more casual -- allowing players to fully appreciate the historically inclusive design of the game.",1
"quickly build your empire up, make allies, declear war, reign supreme!",1
"ever wanted to waste a week of your life without knowing that you did? here is your answer.",1
"this is the most addictive game know to humanity and i cant stop playing. its like turn based grand strategy for dummies. its really easy to learn, theres an infinite amount of replayability, it has brilliant multiplayer so as this game is easy to learn and the interface makes the gameplay and management fast you can just tell any one of your friends to buy this game and play it with you. id also like to point out that as i said this is turn based but theres a magnificent option which allows you to have hybrid turns which means that you play your turns simultaineously unless youre at war with an another player, in that case the other players still take turns at the same time. 10/10 buy immediately.",1
"civ 5 is truely a great game. with the way you must think of where to place cities and what to build as well as making sure other civs are not mad. must pick up and try!",1
"definatly an upgrade for the series, having seen the issues that civ 4 had with balancing. this game really updates the classic franchise with detailed visuals, a clean art style and much smoother animations during the combat. speaking of which the combat has also been improved with no more stacking units on tiles (meaning that you dont end up having an entire army crammed into a single segment) making placement of your units much more important. i havent really found anything to complain about its a good solid addition to the series. would reccomend, especially with freinds.",1
"this game is horrable and has caused aton of crapy lag for my comr and also the ftustration of my friends my windows 8.1 couldent take",1
"this game will keep you up to all hours of the morning becuase of just one more turn",1
"wow, this game is sooooooo addicting! play it, play it now! (i sold my car to buy the game and expansion packs)",1
"is a good game, get the dlc though. and dont play from 8 pm to 5 am. ps",2
"so far, for me, civ v is the most complex strategy game ive ever played.",2
"not only one of the best 4x or strategy games ive played, but it tops the charts as one of the most enjoyable times ive had playing a video game. the multiplayer can get a little glitchy sometimes, but is worth it nonetheless. ive gotten in some heated political arguments with my friends while immersed in civ 5, which were some of the most unique experiences ive had on a pc game. the single player ai is also very unique, as each country has their own personalities. all around a great game.",1
"one of the few games in my life to actually get me addicted, in a good way. so engaging, you wont even notice the hours fly by!",1
"i never expected to be drawn to a civ game. they never really appealed to me before. however, this game remains my most played on steam and i constantly keep telling myself just one more turn! i recommend this to everyone!",1
"who are you and why havent you bought this game!?",2
"must play ...... seriously????, help me am addicted :( :).",1
"great turn-based strategy game.everything is well made i like the mulitplayer that you can save the proggres that you have acomplished with the players that you are playing with.everything is well polished.",1
"this game captures the tediousness of politics and the thrill and pressure of war. i would reccomend this game to anyone clever and tactful enough to succeed in it.",1
"a very civil game great for family friend grandparent",1
"beats the h*ll out of all those {*}ville games on facebook. play a real game for a change.",1
"wow. ive played this for, like, 50 hours, but only actually opened the game 7 times. wow.",1
"do not buy... unless you want to waste 300+ hours of your life playing an amazing game!",3
"just one more turn next thing you know youre wifes left you for another man, youre sniffing ketamine off your desk, and your kids never want to see you again. still worth it 10/10",1
"my favourite game of all time 10 of 10 in everything.",1
"largest tiome sync in the world and i mean that in the best possible way!",1
"very good game!!! get a bunch of friends that all have mics and split up into teams!",1
"civ 5 is very much differnt then the other civs in many smalls ways which makes it a big way. i personally love this game, its hard to seige a castle, but its not impossible, and can even be easy if you know how to do it. it can be as easy or as complicated as you want. as easy because it can all be done automatic and all you need to do is watch, to as complicated because you can micro manage everything, including where your citizens work. civ 5 has a play style for everyone who likes turn based simulations. from dominating everyone, to being the best in a curtain amount of time, to being great friends with everyone. i strongly recommend this game, and as a hint to winning. pick a way of winning and stick to it. there are many ways to win, and if you stick with one, you will win.",2
"game is a lot better now bugs are sorted and dlc released",1
"has to be the best civ game of ll time, well done sid",1
"according to sid meier, 5 minutes is about 10 days.",1
"- an unbelievably addictive game. - good graphics and gameplay. - can be exceedingly tough at higher difficulty levels.",1
"this game lets you nuke everyone 10/10 very realistic",2
"one of the best games ever created! hours of fun, infinite replay value, and even more fun with friends! not only does this game provide hours of fun, but it can also provide a challenge to even the most advanced gamer. my advice to anyone who doesnt have this game, buy it!",2
"despite its faults (yes it has them) its a great game. one unit per tile gets rid of the death-stacks of older civ games, but makes it very annoying to move large quantities of units over large distances, especially since the pathing is poorly done. the introduction of airlifting in bnw is nice, but requires an airport in both cities. otherwise, the game is fun and there are plenty of mods to fool around with.",2
"its the best strategy game on pc! after the first game you will not to be able to live with out it!!!",2
"a truly awesome and addictive game. once you pick it up, you cannot put it down and you cannot stop thinking about it when you take a little break from it. one sunday morning i decided to play it. once i finished up, i realised my day was gone. the game is somewhat slow, but i hear its dlc brave new world speeds it up a bit. i find no cons in this game. 10/10",2
"very fun game, but crashes every couple of hours. kind of good because the crashes let me do things like eat and sleep while the game loads up again",1
"very, very fun game. now, if you dont like aoe and risk type games, you wont like this, if you do, you will love this. you just have to remember, its like risk, with turns. thats about all. its like aoe because you have to get resources, ect,ect,ect. its not like either of those in the ways of creating a city, attacking, trading and research. well, its kinda, a tiny tiny bit, like aoe with the research. its like aoe with the cant see anything to start with...or at least, tell you get a satalite :) then its like you typed marco polo its like risk cuase you it takes turn, kinda like drafting, but not, its like aoe cuase you see your troops, but you have sections you can move, a amount you can move, and other things. all in all, i loved the game, would buy it again if that meant playing it and winning...again :) thanks!",1
"civilization v is a fantastic example of a turn-based strategy game, in this game you get to play as one of a large selection of civilizations and take them to greatness or death, they are in your command. this game has streamlined ui, great ai and amazing replayability. if you like turn-based strategy games or games that you run countries then buy this game!",1
"it is very fun but there needs to be more balance within the races. for instance venice needs some hard nerfs whilist civs like sweeden need to be greatly increased. it is fun because the bots are super easy to beat even on deity because of have finished it on deity. there is nothing else wrong but please venice needs to be fixed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2
"i love it! its a very neat  empire building  game, with so much to do. some features of the game are unrealistic, but theres usually a mod to fix that, and theres lots of other mods too! 9/10",1
"great game cant fault it apart from a few bugs fun to play for long periods and to just chill on an easy going strategy game",1
"its good if you enjoy turn based games. at first i didnt care for it, after a second try i enjoyed myself immensely.",1
"there is nothing to say, well.....i gaurantee (sorry for my spelling) that you will love this game if you buy it. ;)",1
"an awesome game, have wasted days waging war with my friends. brave new world only makes it better, definitely recommend,",3
"this game is great. the expansions even better. best in the series by far. i could play 400 turns and still not be bored at all!",2
"really loved this game. the expansions gave it a more deep sense on how the world works. got into mastering the game in my little spare time i got and enjoying the close failures vs. the ai.",2
"for the first game you will hate it but after u play civ u cant stop",1
"the best strategy game i have played in my life. it puts its predecesor games to shame as well as making the game as close to reality as possible. adding many exciting aspects that i am sure all respectable gamers can enjoy.",2
"this is one of the most addicting games you can find. fo-shizzle",1
"originally a bit disappointed. new update seems to improve quite a bit of content. stripped back and easily accessible. i miss religion - but definite improvements with new non-stacking hex tiles, minor civilizations (city states) and also great people, cultural expansion and other features tweak better than previous civilizations.",2
"an exellent game, one of the best that i have ever played. now stop reading this and buy it!!!",1
"be all the leaders! make all the wonders!! win all the games!!! have all the fun, all the time, forever!!!!!!!!!!!",5
"an absolute must have if you enjoy strategy games.",1
"brilliant! this game is one of the best games i have ever played, and certainly the best strategy game! if you can, i reccomend getting the brave new world dlc, as it helps create the true spirit of civ, and should not be ignored!",1
"build your empire. then unbuild other peoples empire with guns.",1
"just... one... more... turn. im with the civ franchiese since civ i back in the 90. this is simply the most beautiful and easy game of the series. its like never-ending fun, with so many different strategies and possibilities, you can be sure you wont play the same way twice. also, many mods. cool mods. lots of cool mods like new civs or policies or maps or like everything. and lots of achievements. also, poland can into space!",2
"still th reference in turn-based strategy games, and as addictive as ever!",2
"good turn based addiction 1 turn to 200 in a blink of an eye. cant stop yet ....and suddenly your whole day is gone.",1
"excellent game with an incredible modding community, engrossing, engaging and most of all loads of fun. definitely for anyone who enjoys turn based and strategy. for players of all types, domination, science, culture, religion, something for everyone.",2
"0/10 you cant quik scope and my aim bot didnt work",4
"if you are a fan of civilization-type games, you will not be dissapointed. it is strangely addictive! the only downside would be re-playability. although there are countless configurations for the game setup, and mods available, the general build-order doesnt change much. you get to realize what things work and what doesnt work, and you just stick with it. would be nice if more mods addressed this issue, but still, a game i keep going back to!",1
"pretty good game, and the dlcs are a must in my opinion. it got a little boring, but i kept getting back into it, lots of things to do, and different ways to play. especially fun with friends!",2
"civ v is the latest edition in the classic family of civ games. this one is a fair bit different than civ iv in several areas. a good game just by itself.",5
"me like yes good 4 stars out of 2 thumbs thanks obama",1
"best civilization yet! combines old civilization with civ revolution to make the best of both worlds. highly recommend!",1
"amazing game with tons and tons of fresh and entertaining content. though the game is heavly, heavly improved by dlc. if your low on many brave new world is the for your interest. with an active modding community and so much content for such a small price during steam sales, its a great experience! vanilla civ 5: 7 out of 10 civ 5 with dlc: 9.5 out of 10 :{a must have for stradegy game fans}:",2
"this is one of those games where you start it up, and then its 6 a.m.",1
"amazing game almost no critique except the fact that it is quite boring to play alone, make sure to have some friends to play with. runs smoothly on my ok laptop.",1
"me and ghandi curb stomped atillia the hun. 10/10 would play again.",1
"this game is really good. it puts you in place of a ruler and lets you build a civilisation from scratch. its a great experiece and can even be educational. 9/10 ps very addictive approach with caution",1
"if you want to play a game just add me and i make one with no dlc to you knew steam users. the game is really fun and helps you get the idea of making a civilization!",5
"very entertaining. just as enjoyable as civ iii. really eats away at the time though ;)",1
"this game never ends and is very addicting first game set it to random lasted 15hrs totaly worth the buy but id say till it goes on sale so you can buy all the dlc and the game cheaply",1
"for the strategist player out there, civilization v is a brilliant game, with many customisables and random worlds through each playthrough, with 4 main victory types, made even better with the dlc packs, adding religious, further diplomatic and reconnaisance aspects. overall, if you are an action gamer, look elsewhere. for the strategy players, get this. and you can always drop a nuke on someone you really dont like *cough* *poland* *cough*",1
"this game is amazing and very intricate. its is a startegy game that isnt mostly focused on military exports, yet the military aspect of the game cannot be ignored. the game has brilliant ai which is the most refreshing thing about this game, and even playing single player feels like you are actually playing against real life people. the only suggestions for improvement i have are to improve certain civilizations overall ability. rome for example is always strong and a major faction from start of the game to the end. but civilizations like brazil or the maya always seem to be killed off in every game no matter who the are next to. other than that i give this game a resounding thumbs up.",1
"the only time ghandi will ever nuke you! 10/10 can recommend!",1
"this game made me believe in magic again. this game made my  grow three sizes in just three weeks! this game brought my granddad back to life. he played and had heart attack at the sheer thrill that he could manage citizens in the city. hes dead now, burried with a redeemable code to civ 5 in his grave. dem trade routes... dose quotes... dat alternate history? 10/10 would . and the mods! the mods actually make the game fundamentaly better. they are not just window dressing. they are a thing of beauty and the people who make them should be given the medal of honor. ive wasted so much time on this game that i could have been wasting on other things and i suggest you do the same.",2
"one of my all time favourite games to play on steam",2
"this game is truely, the king of just one more turn. great game and amazing new options with the expansions.",2
"i forgot to make my army, how embarrasing. 10/10 best game n/a -mlg gamer 2069",1
"... masterpiece! just give me one more turn and ill finish this review...",1
"spend hours massing armies of tanks before the ai is out of the stone age.",1
"very good, but does tend to slow down on huge maps.",4
"a game that makes time flow by as if it were water. amazing game, it definately makes you think with every game different from the last.",1
"the intro animation was breathtakingly beautiful. so much so, that i still let it run completely before i start to play the video game itself. not just the animation, but the music and voices! astounding! okay, now about the game. i love it!!!!! needless to say, ive spent hours playing it. i havent done this in ages. its just...mesmerizing, gripping and just plain fun! this isnt the first sid meier game ive played. the first one was for the atari st platform, way back in the late 80s, a wwii submarine sim. i highly recommend this game. i hope there is a part vi.",2
"one of, if not the, best civ games to come out. the updated combat system make the game more interesting. also the dlc is well worth it. just make sure you dont have anything that needs to be done in the near future once you make the plunge! ...one more turn...",1
"i like to play this game every once in a while and is great for stategy gamers who will play for a long time since civ 5 is not a fast paced game so on a scale to 0-10 i would give it a 8/10",1
"great strategy game, looking forward to the next one in the series.",1
"have poured so many hours of my life into this game, definatley reccomend getting this game",3
"easily the best strategy game ive ever played, especially after the gods and kings expansion! start at the beginning of civilization with one small city, expand your borders, build great wodners, build an empire, improve technlogies, engage in diplomacy, conquer the world!",3
"you get to be ghandi with the great wall of china and angkor wat with enough troops to invade/ take over the world. realism at its finest 11/10",1
"i will say this once, get this game, realy fun with or without friends, great strategy game. all around 9/10 stars. has some multiplayer bugs with the more people/bots in the game.",2
"only time you will ever say yes. i finally killed gandhi!",1
"get it. play it. beat it. beat me if your can. >:)",1
"a wonderful game since the first release. civ 4 was great. civ 5 is great too but it comes with better graphic and the hex grid with a different combat system. i really enjoy this kind of game ... lets do another turn ... oh another turn ... wait one more turn. to me its a real keeper once started u cant stop lol. it offers so many depth in politics, economy, trading, research etc. which is welcome by old players but it might be hard for new comers.",1
"super!! really nice and smooth gameplay. one of the best civilization games atm, its not too difficult and the mods are pretty awesome. i play it nowadays with several mods and having a lot fun playing it when i do. so yes i would recommend this game to the gamers that are interested in it.",1
"the best overlooking, creation, strategy game ive ever played. a timeless masterpiece of perfection.",1
"i waited years to get this game because i didnt like the idea of a hex based combat system. that was a mistake; despite being tactically useful youll quickly forget the shapes are even there. dont make the same mistake as me, buy this great game. if its on sale, even better.",1
"great game, its something you can play over and over.",1
"this game is amazing, and even better with the dlcs. i noticed a lot of people saying this game requires a powerful computar to play. my computar is 2 years old and is extremely terrible at running even the most basic games. so you could imagine my amazement at how it could run it pretty well at near minimum settings (not game still looks great in these settings, never put fog of war on minimum though, it is awful). so if you have a bad computar, download the demo and give it a shot and see if it runs, because it might.",2
"extremely addictive and time consuming game, you can play for hours and not realise because youre having that much fun!",1
"really awesome and solid game. if you love strategy, get this game.",2
"civilization v (complete) is easily one of the best tbs 4x games ever made.",2
"one of the best strategy games. so much stuff to do, to think about. this game look like anno or the settlers with turn base system. :)",1
"i like this game alot. i really feel in control of my civilization as i play. i can craft my people into anything. i feel like i make alot of ememies as i play with my friends.",1
"dangerously addictive game. this game makes you sit for hours and forget time. all hours that fly away with sitting on this game is 1337% wurf. could not wish for better strategy game. 133769% must play for people with a brain.",1
"amazing game! first civ game ive played, and i think its incredible. well balanced, higher difficulties are actually challenging, definitely the kidn fo thing i can sink 200+ hours into and still going.",2
"originally i was very sceptical - for me version v had come way too fast after civ iv which i liked very. i changed my mind with the gods & kings expansion and now it is by far the most played game in my list. the gameplay is superb and i very much enjoy the co-op mode. there is no excuse not to own and play this game, as it is eternally replayable.",2
"really? youre wasting you time reading user reviews when you could be playing civ v right now? seriously, buy it.",1
"ok so now i have played for 609 hours since the game has come out, and now they are coming out with a new expansion,brave new world that is going to change up the cultureal victory and make diplomacy more important, and will introduce, trade routes, turism, and a revamped civics tree that will make you choose between 3 ways of building your empire in the late game, and artifacts to put into your museums, as well as 9 new civs to play, and i will most likely play another 200 hrs before getting tired of this game... the shosone, portugal, and assyria, and venetians seem too be the most intersting to play out the 9 new civs, and shaka is back...hide your women and children....lol",5
"greece, they randomly produce a persian army in two damn seconds, then they surround the hell out of you by building cities all around you. then, to make it worse, they spam warriors from the ancient era to piss you off.  this game.",1
"today i come with you to tell you about the very dangrous very evil ghandi. ghandi is a evil mastermind with a very aggressave nature. he will minipulate races to war he will nuke the world and not care if he dies in the prosess because he just wants you to die. if you see one of these nasty animal im sorry but you are to far gone. do not try and make peace with this thing right when you think your safe he will do everything in his power to kill you and he will. good luck with your citys young children and remember stay clear from ghandi and do not interact with it or face the power of his mightyness. 11/10 would nuke again. goodbye,with much love to you and your people wildcat.",1
"i think we can all agree that civ will always stand amongst (or even at) the top of the grand strategy genre. also... the dutch are overpowered... freaking polders...",2
"my favorite game around the globe. pourly optamised but a lot off fun when you are playing against friend or foe. a game realy focussed on the multiplayer, good graphigs and most importantly fun to play. what else do you want! but only if you buy the whole game currently 20 euros, i wouldnt recommend buying it without all the dlcs also still a lot better then beyond earth.",2
"greetings and blessing be upon you. will you build a kingdom that stands the test of time?",2
"this is one of those games that makes you just play the original again. it was really fun on my first play-through, but by my third i realized that aside from aribitrary choices the games were the same, and looked the same even on different planet types with different civs. as far as i can tell there is no replay value. where civ v has had me playing at least once a month since i got it, im typing this review because it seems more fun than loading up beyond earth right now. there are no science/cultural/domination/diplomatic victories. winning is tied to quests and building certain buildings youve researched. i thing 2/3rds of the replay value of civ v was trying different types of victories and different civs. this has none of that. its nostalic, pretty at first glance, but its a ization of civ v, worth only one play through. its very expensive dlc at best. solid c grade product.",4
"not theres not enough people who have reviewed this game at this point but ill give it a shot. i think the first thing that needs to be known about this game is that it will take up a lot of your time, i mean a lot. dont start this game if you have anything else you want to get done in the next several hours. that out of the way, this is one of the best turn based strategy game franchises out there and this game only serves to improve the franchise and the genera! the introduction of hexagonal tiles allows for more interesting movements and strategy. over all if you are at all considering this game, just pull the trigger, buy it, and watch your life outside it disappear.",1
"some day i may stop obsessively playing this...but i dont want that day to come.",4
"like strategy? like challenge? then you will like civ v. in short it is an improved version of the previous games but with some added content which is also a blast. although i have been playing with gods and kings dlc added on so it may be slightly different with the standard version. also having online is a lot of fun especially with friends as you can have a lot of people playing at one time. its also nice to backstab a friend once or twice for not giving you that bit of oil...but thats just my story. also with a large and active workshop community new mods are fun to use as it only expands more on what civ v offers. although if you are not interested in long game times then you might want to avoid this one for now or get it in a steam sale as games can take hours and even days. although there is saving so you can take a rest but dont think you can rush victory in twenty minutes.",1
"great game would strongly recomend to anyone who enjoys strategy games. good game to play with friends.",2
"picked this up during the holiday sales because ive never played a civ game. im really glad i did. its deep, well made, and highly addicting. the game modes are different enough to keep me very busy for a long time. my only complaint is the price of the expansions. i got civ 5 for 9.99 and it comes with a single scenario (rise of the mongols) - for other expansion packs id have to pay 29.99 (brave new world, gods + kings) each. i cant justify paying 3x for the expansions, which is too bad, since id really like to explore additional scenarios and especially the religion mechanic. that aside, i dont need the expansions, and civ 5 was a truly great find for me. absolutely recommend the game and hope that the expansions or gold version come down in price before too long.",1
"great game, if you have well over 100 hours to spare.",2
"great strategy game. in fact the best stragety game i have ever played, which says a lot. its not just strategy, either. its also fun to play online with your friends. but i suggest that you might want to learn the ropes before you face a deity-level cpu :) (btw, this is my second favorite video game of all time)",3
"best empire strategy gmae i have ever played. good with computers, and better with people.",1
"my god, this game is exetremely addicting and takes such a long time. but, it is such a amazing game that you dont care how much time it takes.",1
"built taj mahal , pyramids of giza , eiffel tower in new york . (10/10)",1
"this game is like having the most amazing  of your life and then the mailman comes right in the middle and you have to stop half-way through and rush hurriedly to the door. my point is, games take so god damn long that unless you have the next 6 hours spare, dont start a game.. because something will always come up, and online games cant be paused, mom! 3/5 overall though, i like the game, but finding the time to play it is a right ball-ache.",1
"this game is one for the books, it combines strategy ang roleplay. a must play for any gamer",1
"good game, get ready for pressing the turn over button at then press it again and suddenly you realize its been 4-6 hours since you first pressed for your turn to be over. i like the music and the narrator in iv better but the hex rule is better.",1
"for a game that i would think was going to be sorta boring i was wrong. this game provides the fun that i enjoy greatly. i will also add when you start playing this game, youll lose track of time for real. although the game mechanics could get better because the same thing happens everytime where you research a thing and then build this and that but its enjoyable. for this game a 8 out of 10 is deserved. guess ill start rating games now that ive said that.",1
"a great game with an awesome modding commmunity, i have wasted many hours playing it.",5
"very fun game, but i feel that it is a lot better with some of the dlc",1
"calling this game good would be a bit of a stretch. it has some nice new inovations likw the hex tiles........oh thats it. i personaly feel this game is in every single way inferior to civ 4 and the way that the modding has been almost imposible is shocking. the mod comunity for every previous version of the game added to the flavour. sid seems to have decided that they should be  blocked like they did with xcom which was another shocker.",1
"amazing game filled with strategy, its basicly sim city, but more genral and you get to go to take over the world as ing japan, now aint that some alternate history",1
"with all the hours i have invested into this game, its needless to say that i enjoy this game thouroughly(or have been afk for a long time). this is the game that got me out of fpss and rpgs, and into the, honestly more strategic, point and click genre. the majority of the gameplay ive experienced is without the dlc packs, and i loved this game still. only recently did i pick up these dlc packs, but even before they were purchased, anytime i would have time, id pick up my laptop and play the crap out of this game until my laptop crashed from overheating. 9/10(anyway you look at it) - a definent buy.",3
"this game has been immeasurably improved by its expansions and is absolutely worth getting",1
"lets be honest. who doesnt like destroying other countries and taking over the world? huh?",1
"for beginners, it is so complicated. many buildings, civilizations, leaders, units, policies and production to learn.",1
"i have decided to write this review, because i myself wasnt sure about buying, but reading reviews changed my mind. all i have to say that i was doubtful at first, but you learn this game pretty fast, but you master it pretty slowly. just one more turn.... and it is 2 am and i have to get up at 7 am, god... i hate and love this game at the same time. 10/10 would not sleep again.",2
"beware playing with war mongers fun multiplayer singleplayer boringish 7.9/10 (tip for pros only : rush nuke tech for e z win)",1
"good rts game, try it for yourself for your opinions.",1
"want gandi to invade your country? then this is the game for you!",1
"immersive does not begin to describe this strategy game. its easily one of the most addicting games out on the market, thanks to its decpetively quick turn-based gameplay. each turn is quick on their own, which sets up the just one more turn mentality. which is why any gameplay session - lasting from either five minutes to five hours - will feel like it has gone by quickly. if you want to have your sense of time distorted while roleplaying as an emporer, then this game is meant for you.",2
"the only game where invading a virtual version of mecca would get malaysian religious officials panties in a bunch. 5/5 stars from me. play it my friends and people who read this.",1
"this is an awesome game...and i dont do strategy! i must have put in over 20 hours so far, and im only just scratching the surface. ill report back when i know what the heck im doing, but so far love it.",1
"one of the best if not the best in the civ line up of games. a great game to jump into for new civ players and a must buy for all civ fans.",1
"over 125 hours of fun! a good replayable stragey game if you even remotely like the 4x startgey genre or turn based :)",1
"probably one of my favorite games, tied with diablo 3, minecraft, the halo games, :d",1
"11/0 would buy again. after saying that i truly enjoy this game its absolutly addicting, and even better with mods and friends. never trust ghandi",1
"positives: diplomacy is very strong, combat is fluid, very balanced among ai and players, large variety of nations, use of steam workshop, can set up games to your liking and use of historical figures negatives: branching paths of upgrades could have been upgraded a bit more(too small), city-states have very little usefulness aside from getting a new unit every once in a while, and even though certain leaders have a specialized unit, they are actually the same as a normal one. verdict: 8.75/10 recommendation: to those with too much time on their hands. get it. now.",1
"of the strategy games that i have played, it is amazing. it has an amazing mix of war and military, economy, science, culture, and religion (with g&k worth the money, buy the expansions if on sale.",1
"finally, something to fill in for my lack of a linux compatible city simulator game. its not quite the same thing, but the ability to play with friends makes it fun in other ways. i hear the controls are just as non-intuitive under windows.",1
"great game, great stategery, great explosions, great doges.",4
"i cant even describe how amazing this game is!!! if you like history, alt. history or just having power, this is the game for you!",4
"immersive, detailed. endlessly replayable, especially with the latest dlc, which made the ai much less aggressive. cant recommend civilization v enough.",1
"this game is fantastic. if you dont know how to play it can be a bit overwhelming but once you learn time will fly...like for reals. youll tell yourself youll go to bed after just one more turn....and then all of a sudden the sun will be up and you wonder what happened to the night time. it is utter crack, i cannot reccomend it enough.",1
"this game feels less like a grand strategy or even a turn based strategy game and is more like a complicated version of settlers of catan. the hex shape is an interesting take on the original squares but at the same time its restricting with the one unit per hex limitation. it lacks a lot of features its predecessors had, while also adding some new ones. as of gods and kings its gotten a bit better but still feels lacking. its a fun experience with friends and the civilizations all are somewhat distinct. overall i think i could easily give this game a 7/10. its still leagues worse than alpha centauri but its alright on its own. if you can get the game with all dlc for under 15 usd, id say go for it.",1
"this is an amazing turn base strategy game that keeps you craving for more. ive always loved this game. i would recomend this game and its worth every penny.",1
"im a big fan of this style of game and civ v is no exception. jumped on this when it came out for linux. runs perfectly on my setup.",1
"adictive game. if you like games like: command & conquer you proberbly like this one to if not better. i reccomand to get at least 1 of the dlc like: (gods & kings :))",1
"if montezumas in one of your games, you better bloody prepare for war, cause its coming about one turn after he meets you.",2
"any essence of a life i had this game has taken,,,",1
"highly recommended. it will take over your life, eventually youll escape, then a year later itll take over your life again.",2
"what an awesome game! a great game even for those new to civilazation with a great tutorial and helpful hints that you can set to walk you through the game in the beginning or that you can completely silence once you become a world ruler! the gods and kings expansion is well worth buying! it adds so much to the game, new civs, buildings, and ways to play the game. i dont see myself getting tired of this game anytime soon with so many options, new civilizations to play as, many difficulties to master and so much world domination to be had! if you dont like this game... well you must be crazy!",1
"ever played any of the old civ games? if you did and you liked them, get this one! its the best one ive played since the classic civ ii. by far one of my most worthwhile purchases.",1
"finally ive finished my first game of this. i dont know why but i had never finished a full game before. i loved it. i won through points.",1
"the pinacle of strategy games: civilization 5. a must buy.",1
"starting with several ways to play the game there are over a hundred different paths to go from the selection of your races president. its just a really good game in my opinion, a bajillion hours of entertainment can be gained from this almost never getting truly old. just one of those games worth its price.",1
"kind of slow to get into but once you start a game with a few friends, its very hard to get out of xd i highly recommend this game!",1
"very addictive, reminds of old school fun that age of empires brought me as a kid. if it was possible to play through an entire session with an army of friends it could possibly be the best game ever made. even the shortest play through will take you probably 5-15 hours.",1
"i could speak volumes about how much ive enjoyed this game, however, ill try to keep it short. 1) this game is the standard by which all 4x games are currently measured 2) this game and skyrim are the highest quality games ive played in my lifetime in terms of pretty much every metric there is. i will give this one the edge on balance over skyrim though. (yes i realize they are 2 separate genres) even if youre not sure how you feel about strategy games i would suggest this one as a great starting point so that at least the frustrations of poor design dont mar your initial experience and you can truly decide for yourself based on the gameplay whether or not you are a strategy fan. i wish more game developers could uphold the standard of quality that civ 5 exhibits.",3
"great frekin game. a nice blend of cultures and is really fun to play with friends.",1
"a very nice tbs game, with great graphics and addicting gameplay. altough it misses some strong points from civ iv, you really need to buy it if you like civ. with upcoming dlc, updates and mods, youll never get bored!",2
"good strategy game with large improvments in game mechanics over civ 4",2
"love the entire series, have been a fanatic of civ since the begining. civ 5 is fantastic, fun to play alone and also with friends. highly recommended!",3
"ghandi did nothing wrong. the nuclear devastation of my last civ game didnt happen.",2
"i love this game so much, it has a steep laerning curve, but once past it is is amazing. there are so many routes to take to win, and how to get there! i just simply love it!",1
"this game is great for people of all ages i highly recormend it and all the expansions",2
"excellent turn-based strategy game. i got into this from as a long time player of the total war series",1
"the game itself is great, but its a big longer pasted than other strat games ive played. and you run through things very quickly without the dlc. if you pick it up. do yourself a favor and pick up the gold version.",1
"this game is great to play with friends and is very addictive.",1
"addictive and well made. cant wait for the next civ",1
"by far one of the best strategy games i have ever played. so far i have managed to log almost 200 hours into this game without even trying to. extremely addictive and with the randomization of the maps and ai, along with hundreds of other features, every game is literally a whole new world and experience.",3
"make an empire and take over the world! *evil diabolical laughter* also, make nukes, giant robots and go to space i mean whats not to like?",1
"i tried freeciv when i started using linux years ago and it mad me hate turn based strategy games but this game is just epic. and it also works fine in wine",1
"love this game, very addictive. i play it for hours on end",4
"i am not sure, but you can get 2 copies of the game, and for some reason you can gift that to your friend. is there a way to gift that copy of civ to a friend?",1
"the mac version does not include the workshop, which vastly lowers the replayability of the game",2
"much inculding within the game i still play it today.",1
"great game! if you havent gotten to this one and enjoy the style of game or havent played one like it, give it a go! its really fun!",1
"frustrating and exhilirating. it is, for better or worse, the epitome of just one more click.",3
"this game is amazing and fun. i have and will continue to recommend this game to my friends for years to come. this is a timeless classic which anyone will find a way to love. 5 stars",1
"fun game, spent many hours playing. however be warned, i found i had the most fun near the beggining of the game exploring the area and meeting other people, but near the middle to end half it feels extreamly repedative as you are stuck in an endless routine of upgrading buildings but hardly doing anything ells, and when you do have the forces to bulldoze everyone your forced to take what feels like years to get your troups from one end of the map to the other (oh the feels if you need to call upon reinforcements). thus having a large army is a huge burden as you have to micromanage everything. love the game though as i rage against gahndis lack of morality, but i feel taken advantaged of do to there being so many dlcs that it feels like the basic game is only half finished. ill give it a 7/10 but if there werent so many dlcs id give it a 8.5/10",1
"the is a great game, well worht the money even with the dlc, its the kind of game where you can just keep playing and vever get bored!",1
"this is plain awsome, build empires, conquer, creat worlds. you can play as all the greatest leaders starting from the dawn of time. washington, alexander the great, or even julius ceasarus,",1
"soul-suckingly awesomeeee definitely gonna spend more hours on this - endless replayability",1
"an excellent strategy and conquest game, completely worth the 20$.",1
"get the game if youre patient. also, taking over cities is the best part >:)",1
"if you are looking for a fun, creative, and awsome game, you have found it! this game is well worth the money. i recomend it. 5/5 stars!",1
"one of the best games that will consume hours and make you hate your best friends!",1
"i think my game is broken i never was attack by ghandi",1
"put your hand on your heart and say youve never physically or mentally said to yourself: one more turn..... 11/10",1
"franchise never lets me down, one of my favorite turn-based strategies.",1
"civilzation v is one of the most addicting and brilliant masterpiece that perfected sid meiers strategic game where you help a country build its way through war against other countries and upgrade your land and cities with new sciences, ways of thinking and architecture. its one of the best strategy games ive come to experience and continue to play for 100s of hours. 10/10",1
"finallz after the brave new world expansion civ v really shines, i was initiallz disappointed when civ v first came out as it lacked many features that were present in civ iv with its expansions. with gods & kings and brawe new world the game is at last what is should have been then. a rethought and upgraded civ iv with some new features not present in the previous installement. a great game, too bad we needed to wait 3 years for it to be upgraded to be just that.",4
"once you start playing this game you cant put it down. very addicting. cool stradegy and fun multiplayer!",1
"good game for lots of people to play while drunk...",1
"george washington built new jersy on top of my busiest road",1
"this is by far one of the best games ive ever played. i used to have no life, but the... i found civ 5. once i found out that i could crushed my enemies with a single press of a button and rule the entire world, i knew it was going to be worth every penny of the 49.99 dollars i spent. ive put in about 75 hours of the game, and ive just barely started 9.5/10",2
"this is an awesome game for hours and hours of fun gameplay.",1
"one of my most played games. bought it during the winter sale and cant seem to stop playing it",1
"such tactics, many war, very diplomacy, much religion, wow",2
"this has been one of my favorite games ive played and has been incredibly addiciting. the amount of detail and work that went into this game is extraordinary. while i did play civilization iv before, this game seemed entirely new and revamped. it is somewhat dificult to learn because of its complexity but once learned is a very entrenching and enjoyable game. my one complaint would be some issues with the ai in that there are many times in which units forget what they were automated to do. very fun game, nontheless.",1
"its streamlined but that doesnt mean its bad. troop management on the field is more important now with the stacking roops being gone and cities being able to defend themselves.",1
"great turn-based strategy game.everything is well made i like the mulitplayer that you can save the proggres that you have acomplished with the players that you are playing with.everything is well polished.",1
"hours and hours of screaming at the netherlands for dancing around your borders with their units or at babylon for the never-ending wave of denounciations and war declaration. desperate research to stay on top and brown-nosing to appease the city-states. frustration. blood, sweat and tears. worth it?",1
"oone of the greatest strategies of all time. must have for anyone who likes strategies! *dont buy with out expansions*",1
"a good game with some good ideas. however the ai is still severely lacking (especially after playing betterai with civilization 4). the new happiness system is still really hard to use. the ai receives bonuses in this regard (and with most other things too)",1
"this is the perfect strategy game ever created...yet. civ v can be incredibly relaxing as you take a huge  time planning and thinking about each turn. or it can be as mindblowingly intense as you watch your own hand crafted civilization fall to the hands of your long time friends (both ai or irl).",1
"just . . . one . . . more . . . turn! an excellent and fun grand strategy game",1
"if you like turn-based strategy games, this is what you should play! buy it play it!",1
"i have over 1000 hours playing this game. fully 50% of that is probably in the please wait between turns, waiting for the computer ais to act. the game isnt the best of its kind (thats sid meiers alpha centauri) but its a great game to relax with. what i often do is take my turn, and then, while the game is processing all the ai players and im waiting for my next turn, i do something productive. ive gotten a lot of work done while playing this game.",5
"i love playing this game. ive played this game so much (different accout because no family sharing thing), almost 300 hours, and im still not bored. the expansions make it even better, and its incredibly fun to play with different leaders and trying out different strategies. definitely recommended!",1
"best tbt strategey game out there, very difficult and also easy to get into. lots of fun!",1
"this is a great game . it has a bit of a learning curve but once you get the hang of it its realy fun and adictive. this game has tons of replayability and multyplayer is awsome .... alho it does have some things that can be frustrating at times its still a fantastic game and will keep you playing and coming back for more.",1
"you will lose countless hours in taking another turn.",5
"this is the best slow paced strategy game i have ever played.",1
"a truly amazing turn-based strategy that will have you gritting your teeth all the way through, i would 100% recommend it to anyone who is even slightly interested in the stategy genre. now if you excuse me i have to go and kill babylon this game keeps pulling me back for more!",1
"barbarians took my settler. 10/10 would lose again.",1
"i love everything about this game except how to long it takes to get achievements.",2
"well it sucks without the two expansions. but with the two new expansions its one of the best games ever!",2
"woke up at 8am, booted up civ5 and before i knew it, it was 3am! 10/10, would reccomend for added time machine capabilities.",1
"i have been playing the civilization series of games since the third installment, and it feels like each iteration gets better and better. new/altered victory conditions and the inclusion of city-states as minor civilizations make for interesting changes from civ iv, as do the changes to unit behaviour and the use of a hex grid map. the removal of unit stacks makes it feel like builidng up a significant army can be done without costing a lot of time in infrastructure development, something that always bothered me in previous games, though the associated pathing issues can sometimes be annoying if youre not careful. overall i feel that civilization v is a step in the right direction moving on from civilization iv, and i recommend it for both casual and serious play.",1
"great game, its worth your monies if your willing to sell your soul to the game for about 30+ hours strait for an amazing time :d",1
"when i first started playing civilization v, i thought it would be boring. but now, i forget to sleep while playing this unique game. prepare to stay up all night upgrading your civilization and attacking other leaders. say good bye to sleep. 11/10",1
"this is a solid upgrade over earlier versions of civilization ive played. the cultural victory seems to be the easiest for most leaders to achieve. the game definitely makes you be active though. there is always one or two key resources that are in short supply around the world that you have to go out and find. some leaders play very different - kamehamaha for example who can embark on oceans right away. others, like ramses maybe not so much. there is more difference in how they act during the game than how they work when you play them, i think. but the differing skill levels and boards can keep changing the game dynamics - as can luck of the draw. there always seems to be some very crowded areas which force people to go to war and then one or two civilizations who are off sort of on their own with lots of room to grow. definitely worth playing around with and trying out different approaches.",2
"i just realized i have about a months worth of play time invested in this game.",3
"theres no such thing as a quick game in civilization v. and the thought of just one more turn, then ill... will creep up and gobble up your time. its immersive, looks good and theres so many options that youll be a bit overwhelmed if youve never played a civ before. playing the board game isnt a really good reference, i might add. luckily, i had help with learning the game and once you have, its just great fun. keep a clock nearby, though. it wont be long before you think its just past 11 and it really is 2 am.",1
"this game has all that you could want without feeling pretencious. get it.",1
"any fan of civilization will love this game, beware: just one more turn can quickly turn into just 400 more turns, dont make any plans.",3
"lost my job lost my girlfriend my mom kicked me out but thats all okay because i returned the japanese empire to its former glory 69/10 destroyed my life",2
"beware of gandhi he has nukes. requires expansions for the best experience",1
"one more turn.... just one more... better than sex on drugs.",2
"good game, worth it. stays true to the civ legacy while also innovating itself! enjoying it a lot!",1
"good game, but seems a little lacking in the replayability.",1
"best game ever so much fun played it for more the 100 i suggest this to all strategy loving people",2
"this is an amazing game with some good graphics for sure i really like the way you have to think about where you are going to place your new city because if you place it where there isnt food it is going to starve but if you place it near multiple resources than you are in good luck. when you want to have a good time and you have nothing else to do, then play civ 5 this makes my top 10 great games list the only thing the game doesnt do very good is that it seems you cant ever get the ai to make a declaration of friendship you just have to wait for them to ask you. anyways amazing, amazing game definitely recommended",1
"awesome game spent many hrs destroying civilizations and completing the space race...",1
"ive been playing this game since the first version came out long ago. im still just as addicted to it.",3
"this is one of the best and addictive games ive played. it keeps me occupied for hours and i never get bored of it because each time u play its a totally different experience",3
"a welcome addition to the civ family. has some definite imporvements from four, including a new hex grid system. downgrades include the loss of troop stacking.",1
"great game, fun and challenging. can be time consuming and it takes a lot of power to make the game run smoothly when the graphics are turned all the way up. either way its a great game for anyone who likes stragedy games.",3
"dont play with danny unless youre willing to go nuclear.",1
"on a scale of 1 to 10 on the nuke-happy scale, gandhi is literally a 12, literally",1
"i dont normally write recommendations but for the sake of the steam promotion, heres one! hard to go wrong recommending any game in the civilization series, this game being the latest. it doesnt improve upon (or replace) civilization iv in every way, but it is prettier than civ iv, and introduces some interesting new mechanics. i dont play it frequently, and thats because a single game of civ can take tens of hours, and is consistently difficult to tear yourself away from once begun. if you look at civ screenshots or gameplay videos and you think, that doesnt look fun or that looks too hard - youre wrong on both counts. you need to play it to understand why its so compelling, and its not as difficult as it looks. if youve never played civ, id highly recommend it, and this isnt a bad place to start.",1
"after doing a few sex favors for a horny gamer girl that ive known since the vietnam war, i finally traded naked pics with an australian mafia to smuggle videogames and one of them was civ which stands for cant into vidya, if only starcraft 2: heart of the quickscope were on steam id be reccomending that instead but civ was made by people who clearly failed middle school world geography because i started as mayans and found the city of venice a few miles or tiles away and those crazy italians tried to culturally enrich my  but i called the powers of montezuma and la muerte peluda to overthrow their , but that wasnt the end because later came the dunegook empire trying to take over my new land and i had to 1v1 quickscope with the arab nerdlord and put them to shame because im american and i still remember the alamo",1
"want to start a game at 7am, look at your clock and think about maybe going to bed at 3am, realizing you just fastforwared through time? buy it. buy it for a friend. travel through time together.",1
"i cant seem to quit this game..... one more turn.....",1
"great game. so mush strategy involved. get it a ton of fun",1
"buy this game if you have nothing to live for and you want to ruin your life",1
"great game, keeps you busy for hours and you forget all about your worries. 16 hours in to a game i started friday morning, it is now 1:06am saturday... okay its getting late, just one more tu....oh crap, forgot to pick the kids up from school!",1
"the endless possibilities, scenarios, and beautifal gameplay make civ 5 an easy game to lose hundreds of hours in. smart and stylish civ 5 will can make burning the midnight oil easy. it really does embody all the greatest things about the franchise and the expansion packs fill in all the wholes left in the original game. highly recommend this title.",2
"with almost 300 hours logged and gifting copies to most of my friends, i can justly say my opion is very high of this game. its beyond addictive and so entertaining. you truly get lost in this game and the hours seem to disapear. so beware.",3
"with all the dlc, this is quite an appealing package with a lot of working mechanics and tons of playability. among the likeable things is the variety of music.",1
"this game is great for people that likes stratregic games",1
"really liked the game, however it is worth taking not that the recommended settings arent always the best ones. i chose recommended and i got through to the renaissance era and it crashed when i recieved the spy and i lost my progress. i found a way to fix it by selecting another graphics option but it was a bit too late and it ruined the fun. since then however, ive been having a lot of fun on there.",1
"a massive time killer, well worth every hour given over. civ 5 is a solid advancement to the series. the expansions are fantastic, though it can take awhile to adjust to new features. overall a solid investment.",2
"most addictive game ever... i have 160 hours on it and there is always something new",1
"-played as japan in earth map -spawned in china -so close",1
"great turn-based strategy game. highly recommended.",1
"all in all it was a fantastic game, i loved every minute.",1
"slow pace civilization builder for those who like long games. loved previous civ games and still love this one.",4
"played 3 mostly, 4 some and ive been playing 5 for a few weeks. vanilla is really fun, challenging too. cant wait to get gk and bnw!",1
"civ v... its hard to say it keeps up the standard. it looks better, feels like it makes more sense.. but in general it also feels very lacklustre. it doesnt help that the dlc is infecting what was a wonderful franchise, so i am glad sid meier has managed to reclaim control over the ip. funfact: all of civ vs dlc to date was already included in civiv or became included in much more substantial expansions. now they cost 3-4 each and total 31... id say youd be better off getting civ iv, or civ ii. civ v is good, but its future isnt glowing as bright as it used to.",1
"dont trust that friend of yours? this game will prove to you that you were not only right to distrust him in the first place, but that he is a hell of a better strategist then you. hours and hours wasted to prove something that takes starcraft 2 lesser than 15 minutes to deliver. but hell, when you roll up with your nukes and giant killing robots... its ing worth three weeks, 30 kg and your parents respect. also, gandhiiiii!!!!!",1
"10/10 with the dlc, 7/10 without the dlc this game is one of the best games i have ever played. must buy! but buy the dlc it makes the game way better.",2
"easily one of my favorite games, with m ore game time than what steam says. great game, and a ton of fun,",1
"play it all the time, great game for people looking for a strategy turn based game. i strongly recommend it to people looking for a game that you can just start and play over a few days. great re-play value and overall, i feel it was a great purchase.",2
"awesome game that is extremely accessible to newer players. really reccomend this game as it is a great buy. furthermore, the game is much better with dlc, however the vanilla game is pretty good too. finally, this game has mod compatability which is awesome.",1
"civ 5 is a brilliant game full of strategy and managment. 10/10",1
"great game endless hours of challenging game play.",5
"i played civ 2 as a kid going into this but obviously its been a while. i hate the learning curve on these games since its only really any fun when you have a decent understanding of how it all works. luckily the in game tutorials that pop up when things happen are really good and give enough info to get by at first. the tooltips when you hover over almost anything gives more detailed info that deepens understanding once you get the basics worked out. the deeper you go into the depth of the game, the more enjoyable it becomes. sorta like virtual drugs i guess cept you only gotta pay $30 for this and it wont get you locked up in jail. good purchase imo",1
"having had no experience of the previous civ games, i really enjoyed this game and would definitely recommend it despite the talk of this being a dissappointment to more experienced civ players",4
"dont worry, our units are merely passing through..",2
"hm. if steam had a star rating system, i would give it 3. the gameplay is great for a strategy game, brilliant in fact, but unless you shell out the sixty-some dollars for all the dlc, it just isnt worth much. i got it from the nice fellows at humble hundle, so i got off easy. but poor you, waiting for a 60% sale. and if you want to connect with your friends, be prepared for a ton of space usage (that said, i dont have the best internet provider, per se). of course, with said dlc, its great. immersive, tons of strategy, and will keep you entertained for until you need to keep yourself sustained. truly fun. worth keeping on your wishlist for sure, but unless you and your friends have the dlc, be prepared for a semi-fun six-hour marathon of civ that leaves you awkwardly unsatisfied until you come back.",1
"im not big on strategy games, but this one is really good. everything was done right.",1
"plenty of hours killed playing this game, worth the money with or without the sale",2
"while the earlier civs probably sucked more of my time, this one is the best - especially the combat makes a lot more sense, and hexagonal movement is a welcome addition.",1
"according to sid meier, 5 minutes is about 10 days.",1
"this game is one of those gems you can go back to after years of not playing and ask yourself...why did i ever stop?? must buy.",1
"over the course of the last week i managed to play for one day. the rest of the time the game refused to start. i tried everything from driver updates to windows updates, from restarting steam to rebooting the whole machine... but no, the game doesnt work correctly anymore. there also seems to be alot of people who also have that problem, while others dont. i dunno why that is so and i dont care. if its an error with the program itself, they have to fix it. if its an issue with steam, they have to work wit valve to fix it. since its pretty much gambling wether you can start the game or not, if you dont have the game yet, i would say save your money. also the last civ ill buy for the next years, since i dont trust them to do better with the next one.",2
"game is not for the impatient. if you like statergy it is the game for you.",1
"a terrific game. thousands of strategies are available ranging from all-out war to peacefully expanding your culture across the planet. each time i play, i know i can count on a totally new experience. with many different civilizations and strategies, maps and game play options, and finally (and arguably the most enjoyable feature) an easy to use multiplayer, this is truly a complete game. i would recommend this game to everyone who has even the slightest interest in strategy games.",1
"i swear to the gods; get this game and you will fail all of your college classes. so oviously you should get it",3
"i love the game it is sooooo adictive, my only complaint is how long it takes, but i can live with that. i just really enjoy the game.",1
"i have followed the civilization games with fervor. when i originally bought this, i was floored. with the expansions, i had to change my entire style of play. i wont lie that upset me at first, but i have grown to enjoy the added challenge. inability to unit stack may seem like a pain, but it creates the need to strategize instead of just overpower.",3
"took 10 mins to find out how to go to the next turn 11/10 would next turn again",1
"hated it long time ago and thought iv was better, man was i wrong, this game is just amazing when you play it and it makes you think on where to move and such, plus the graphics are sweet!",1
"my friend gifted me this game and now its telling me to purchase it ?! help",1
"this is a brilliant game if you are a fan of strategy, history and being the leader of a civilization.",4
"this game is fun. slightly addicting. sometimes frustrating. but still, i like it!",1
"sid meiers civilization v is a great game if you want to build and make you own kingdom and make wonders fight others and research many thing and try to win the game.you can play multiplayer play with friends. im not sayinf buy it but im just saying thats its a great game",1
"best strategy game, easy to play, difficult to master.. i only wish, that ai is more predictible. it feels too much random, actions are without consequences..",2
"proposal to congress to repeal the embargo against the ottoman empire. request from the ottoman empire for silver in exchage for 4 votes for the proposal at the congress.",1
"easily my favorite game. i do play consol games as well, but civ keeps me coming back to the computer. all the time that i played games like age of empires 2, sim city and starcraft, this is what i was longing for. this game has everything i love, world building, empire management, military strategy, diplomacy, and much more. ive spent hours in my little microcosms building empires to stand the test of time and i plan on continuing to play it until i can play civ 6.",3
"the commericals were not kidding, this game is addicting!!! you buy now yes!? you buy now yes!?",1
"i quite enjoy this game. i love how there are no boundries what so ever. i also love the dlcs and mods you can get for thins game. if you like stratagy/rpg, you will love this game",2
"had sooo much fun playing this game. definately worth a shot for anyone whos never tried it",1
"outstanding. wish the deplomacy was as good as older versions. ; )",3
"easy to grasp yet complex game. fraxis games keeps showing us that they are the very best developers of turn-based strategy games. last expansion (brave new world) gave the game kick in needed. this game will surely be one of the best or even the best strategy game of this decade. and that place would be well earned.",1
"if you like making cities sending in troops or religion well this game does that if you play spore or any other civilization game this is a must!",1
"this is a great game, its really fun playing through the single player and it has a large variety of different maps to play on. the multiplayer is also really fun when playing with friends. solid 8 to a light 9, would reccomend.",1
"full of everything to keep you busy for hours that you should be spending on something else.",1
"200+ hours of playtime cant be wrong. and there are so many ways to play this game.",2
"this is a great game for strategy lovers, and is even better when played multiplayer.",1
"your civilization can only last for so long, but barbarians are forever.",2
"extremely addictive and engaging. and if you think youve done it all in the vanilla game, add ons like brave new world changes the gameplay and victory conditions dramatically. by the very virtue that ive clocked in 260 hrs on the game says a lot doesnt it. but dont just take my word for it. give it a try. youll definitely have no regrets. :)",2
"an excellent strategy game, but be aware that the hours fly playing it.",1
"one of the best rts games i ever played. at first i was like meh , nothing special and started to play. after palying for a while i looked at my watch. 2 hours passed. so yep , really addicting. but always remeber one thing : never  up with gandhi. never. final mark : 9 / 10 - fun and addicting.",1
"sid meiers civilization v is beautifully designed. ive only played civ iii before this installment, so i have little to compare it to, but civ v feels much more real than civ iii, and compared to civ iii, it is much easier to get to grips with. one of my favourite features is the ability to construct various wonders, and trying to be the civilisation with the most wonders. gods and kings is a fairly good expansion, but adds very few readily seen features. brave new world functions well as making the late game far more interesting, introducing a far more complex diplomacy system, as well as the overhauled culture system (now with added tourism).",2
"right now, i would say that the game runs (with all the dlcs and expansions) like it should be in beta. the gameplay itself is fun and enjoyable, but they havent bothered to fix the stability of multiplayer, or allowing multiplayer games with mods on. these are relatively simple problems that a team of programmers should be able to fix relatively quickly, because of these issues and the lack of solutions i would rate this as sub-par when compared to other games both in the same series and the same turn based style of gameplay.",2
"just 1 more turn is what you will say after every turn of any game of civ v. this game is very fun for you turn based strategy fans.",2
"a great game many hours of pleasure, well worth it.",1
"i dont even own it but steam is letting me review it. my friend chef plays it. it looks good. i think its got hitler in it. i find the story interesting. it probably wont run on my machine. it has great fps multiplayer action. i own it now. you can make tulips and cheese in the african desert and get ebola! you can name your city. city of windmills, . i wanna play it.",1
"very fun game, the vanilla game is good by itself, but the bnw and g&k expansions make it beastly. better than any similar game of this decade",1
"i love this game so much that i want to have sex with it!!!",1
"you know that feeling when you get home in the late afternoon, start working on something then realize that you should be waking up in two hours? thats the entirety of this game.",3
"very fun game. youll find yourself playing for long periods at a time for what will seem like 30 minutes for you. you will get addicted to it and want to finish the game before you do anything else. even when you finish your first match you might want to play again. theres no problem with that either as there different ai difficulties , randomly genrated maps and varing civs with there own special perks.once youve mastered all of that you can try to mod the game , this game has many creative and smart players that made there own custom maps , civs or scenarios. if you have a friend thats plays the game you could play with them. if you are a stratagy game fan or just like the feeling of creating your own empire and nation then this is a can not miss.",2
"300+ hours on record. ive been sober for a while now, but this game will devour your weekend and spit you out on monday morning.",2
"really good game, a lot of fun to play with friends, a challenge if you play it on your own.",1
"i really wouldnt suggest buying any of these games, theres no real room for dipolomacy or anything and the ai will freak out at the slightest hint of something they dont like. although the brave new world expansion fixes a  ton of the issues. so, yeah....kinda worth it now.",2
"i no longer have life all that is left is civilazation",1
"this game is one of the most fun games i have ever played in my entire life and its even more fun with friends. i absolutly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a fun game. also it gets even better when you get the dlc.",1
"just spent a goof 4 hours playing this, and considering the normal length of time id play a strategy game for is about 10 minutes thats a good sign!",1
"got rekt by siam and pc overheated cuz am an  i r8 8/8 m8",1
"after buying this game, im finally happy. you want happiness? buy this game. dont look at the price, dont look at other reviews, dont look at anything...just buy it.",1
"the commericals were not kidding, this game is addicting!!! you buy now yes!? you buy now yes!?",1
"this game is very addictive and very fun. grab it when it goes on sale and say goodbye to your free time :d",1
"great game that you can play multiple times and each time is different.",3
"i dont think it is my kind of game. 10/10 would purchase a game more than 30$ to strike earthquakes at continents.",1
"just another turn, and ill stop playing your mind will repeat it untill you notice you havent eat for a whole day.",1
"its so much better now than it was at launch. great game to just drop some time into.",2
"ten out of ten. having tons of fun with my group on this one!",1
"best time sink ever ! no rly, just one more turn. prices of single addons and dlcs can simply be considered as greedy",1
"the newest iteration of one of the greatest series in gaming. 250+ hours on my steam version, which is one of three versions that ive sunk a lot of time into.",2
"civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have played in a long time. i played civilization revolution on the xbox-360, so when i bought this game, i was not expecting what i recieved. i love the gameplay. the civilizations are well balanced, because one you learn how to manipulate a certain civilization, you can dominate any civilization after. all the dlcs are worth paying for. they add more funcions that caused the gameplay to change drasticaly. brave new world added trade routes and that alone can change the outcome of the game. you can have a city in the middle of the desert, but have all your other cities sending it food and production, making this city able to grow and eventually be stable on its own. love the game and if anyone wants to play with me, add me! if you have any questions about the game, ask away. 10/10 in all aspects",2
"this game is one of the best time-wasters out in the market! the fact that you can also mod the game is amazing! its a must get game!!!",4
"dont be like me and buy it for $49.99... a week later it went on sale for $12.49.... </3 11/10 7spookie6seven",1
"got this game for 7.50 on a steam sale, and still not worth the 7.50",1
"the original civ and civ ii were some of the of the most fun games i played as a kid. i coudnt be happier with this latest addition to the francise! (also it no longer takes 12 hard discs 8 hours to instal!).",1
"game sucks.. if you come even close to being a viable civilization, the game will give you  maps and no resources.. typical sid meyers game. i played 2 and loved it, played 3 and burned it in fireplace. skipped 4 and should have skipped 5. oh, i should add i have played games since my first one, the bards tale on my old ibm with no ram, only 2 7 flopies. lot of games have gone by the board since then and i played a lot of hours on useless ones and fun ones. other than master of orion 2 and civ 2, the sid meyer games have been by far the worst games i have ever played.",2
"this game is probably one of the best games ive ever played! it is probably one of the best strategy ever made that is why it gets a 10/10 from me! :d",1
"good game but some major differences from the previous civ games. troop placement being one of them. has a few flaws in gameplay but overall worth the money if you like 4x games.",2
"i dont know why i like this game. i shouldnt like this game. it seems like it is just so boring. but before i know it, its three in the morning and i am suppose to be up for work at five.",1
"amazing game, really keeps you on the hook. just. one. more. turn.",1
"a classic game of time vampirism. highly recomended.",1
"when i purchased sid meiers civilization v i had no idea what i was getting into. **note** people have said you need the complete edition (dlcs and such) to make the game better, and theyre soooo right. being someone who has played with and without the dlcs i strongly reccomend buying the complete edtion over the standard edition. i played 7 hours in my first real sitting of civ v, and started out as playing alexander, ruler of greece, which was fun and all, but i didnt really enjoy playng as him. after that i convinced some friends of mine to get the game (since it was on sale) and now ill mostly play multiplayer with my friends. they all now love civilization v also and they always thank me for having them buy it. graphics - 8.5/10 gameplay - 9/10 replayability- 9/10 personal rating - 10/10 game! ps never trust ghandi",1
"great game with many strategy elements. its a ton of fun, and totally worth the price.",2
"this game. i spent 5 hours doing  with china, game was nice, ing crashed. didnt save and it doesnt ing autosave, what kind of a  game doesnt autosave you cunting civilization . game is good but im ing cunted off so much that i want to ing end it all.  civ,  my ,  china, ing . good game, would recommend apart from that i will never play it again. cunnnnnnnnnnnnnnnttttttttttt",1
"turned based strategy is fun when you dont have a lot of time to play in one sitting",1
"the cheapest way to quickly travel forward in time.",2
"this is madne... no, its epically awesome. everybody loves raining nuclear weapons on their enemies cities and obliterating them out of existence, right? right?",4
"easy to pick up and play. strategy is fun and intuitive and the persona of the characters bring the game a lot of depth. easily a game you can sink 100+ hours into without even trying.",2
"this is the best turn-based stratagy i have played in a long time. the depth of the diplomacy systems is incredible and makes it feel far more realistic than any other game in its category. the variant victory types allows a large range of freedom in what you can focus your empire on. the tech system is amazing and makes sense, the culture system is undescribably better than anything like it, and the advisors give usful, if reppetitive, advice. can you build you empire to dominate the world?",1
"fight as much as you like, losers. im going to mars.",1
"hated by everyone, yet culture is so influential that you win anyway 10/10 would culture again",1
"singleplayer is really fun and so is the multiplayer when you can get it to actually work.",1
"this game is the best i have played in a long time.",2
"if you dont like going outside, you dislike having friends, and want to either be nuked by ghandi and his legion of death robots or conquer the world as ghandi, this is the game for you. if you want to rewrite history and lead atilla and his huns to religious dominance by founding christianity as a peace-loving people, this is the game for you. if you want to find out what itd be like if a civilization had discovered how to make rifles and tanks while everyone else on the planet is still waving pointy metal sticks at each other, this is the game for you. if none of these things apply to you, youre probably dead inside. and even then, this is still the game for you.",1
"more fun than real life; i lost my loved ones by playing this game too much. but its worth it, i built a space ship",2
"i had forgotten how addictive this game was, but now with expansions, it will swallow your life.",2
"the best series of all time as always in good shape. its my favorite and the worst game ever... why ? because iv lost so much time playing this game ^_^",1
"it is good, but on mac it really needs mod support. aspyer, please put your act together, otherwise it is a great game",1
"after 2 expansions, and almost 100 hours of playtime, i can recommend civ v, but i also warn against it. not since the original civilization has a strategy game consumed me such as this. i fear later this year when beyond earth releases.",1
"this game is addicting. i love the strategy and the challenge of it.",1
"i recommend this game. 8.5/10. this is my own opinion but im sure you will like the game too. based on only serval hours of gameplay. pros: -good a.i -realistic gameplay, [not the graphics but the demand for resources, combat, engine etc.] -fun overall for people who like strategy games. -fun to witness your very own emipre grow to be a great civaiition. -great game to pass the time. -im an honest guy, so im telling the truth when i say this game is good. cons: multiplayer-multiplayer crashes often and players immediately gets kicked. -almost everybody uses dlc. -sometimes takes a while to process turns so you need to be patient. -a little shocking to see all your work be demolished by a huge war. [wars dont happen often but can still be fatal.] -a little hard to master but practice maskes perfect.",1
"thought i was friends with bismarck, turned out he lied 10/10 best deceipt na",1
"a lovely game about growing your own civilisation then reking everything in site",1
"one of the most addicting games ive ver played! note to self: dont ever trust ghandi! 10/10",1
"ive lost hours of my life to this game. thanks sid!",3
"this is a great game that i would recommend to evryone and anyone who likes anything to do with strategy, war and utter domination. i guess thats most people. well done firaxis, this game truly deserves all of the recognition it has received. it is an absolute masterpiece if you dont mind losing a bit of historical accuracy and is great for casual and hardcore gamers that dont mind sitting at their pc for 10 hours straight. hats off to firaxis once again.",1
"great immersive gameplay, played 20 hours in the first 2 weeks.",1
"play this game if you want to make atilla the hun your b*tch!",1
"a great game in almost all possible ways, a must have!",1
"by far one of the best strategy games ive ever played. if you like to macro manage on a national scale and build up an empire to crush your enemies this is your game. although, if you are not normally interested in strategy based games this is not the game for you. the gameplay is turn-based but the pace of the game hides this fact, this is a good thing. many people ive talked to share the same experience, you decide you want to play a quick game one night for just an hour or so and you end up looking at the clock and it is 2 a.m. some people dont think this is true, but it is. this game will chomp up your time for a couple of days after purchase. but maaaaaaaan will you enjoy it. if you decide to buy this awesome game have fun.",2
"best game ever..................if youve got all day with nothing to do... :p",3
"this game is awesome, but you absolutly need the brave new world dlc.",1
"get this game if you plan on also getting the gods & kings expansion to go along with it. the revamped combat and naval warfare systems, along with the introduction of religion, really round out the base game.",3
"this game is not the most enjoyable to play on your own, as the computer can quickly turn on you and end a game you have been playing for hours just to be a up hill struggle and not to enjoyable at all. with friends though this game is a giggle as you have a human reacting against you. i would recomend it though if you find it in a sale.",1
"i really enjoy this game, it is a worthy addition to the civilization series",1
"more addictive then any class a drug 10/10 would lose my life to this game again",4
"to be honest i dont think ive ever been more absorbed by a game in my entire life. dont think that you need to be amazing at strat games to enjoy this one, this is my first civ game and the games tutorial system is extremely helpful without being annoying. it does a wonderful job of bringing you along in a way that just keeps you coming back for more. i advise setting some kind of alarm when you play this one though, this game is the closest the human race has come to building a time machine. buy this game, stop reading reviews and buy it.",1
"great game! worth every penny. i wont deny it can lag sometimes but overall performance is great and fun.",1
"the best strategy game ive ever played, and probably makes my top five list.",2
"very addictive, easy to jump into, great replay value. needs the expansions for the best gameplay.",1
"one of the best things about civ5 is its replayability. advanced setup, randomly generated maps, and dozens of civs that all act uniquely, this game never gets old. even in the middle of a game, theres always the next thing to do, whether its to reseach a new technology, make your cities happy, or nuke your opponents into a firey oblivion. ive spent entire days playing this game. i regret nothing.",1
"an amazing game so amazing i bought it a 2nd time with all the dlc for my new account. 10/10.",1
"one of the last, yet still great of a dying genre the rts. if you can afford it definitely pick this up, and dont forget to check out the expansions, which may not seem all that important until youve tried playing without them. they work as though they were always in the game and only further immerse your experience.",2
"i havent been into civilization since civ 2, and i must say this one was much better than the last few. the diplomacy tends to work, and combat has been balanced out a bit (no stacking). although, whenever i put the difficult up to prince it seems like the competition has some serious advantages. i managed one prince level playthrough without getting my  handed to me (thanks siam). then again, i suck at civilization. i have never been good at the series, but i do enjoy it when i want a simple strategy game. love those giant death robots.",1
"its a turn-based 4x game! what?! i though all 4x games were time-based, like age of empires... this changes everything for me!",1
"ill just play for an hour... look at the clock twelve hours have passed youve missed work and for the last thirty turns youve been telling yourself one more turn and then ill go to the bathroom.",1
"if you are a fan of strategy games (games like chess, risk and other games of such) this is one youre gonna want to get. the dlc makes this game infinitely better, however, the vanilla is still good. if you are new to the series, there is a harsh learning curve, but once you get past this. you learn how fun a game like this can be.",1
"amazing game, really pulls you in once you get the basics. a lot of variation and endless fun with your friends. definitely a must have.",1
"this is one of my all time favorite games. it will keep you up til early next morning...",1
"just bought gold edition upgrade, and no, 2.5 was not hard, and now i got all the good stuff 8)",3
"play as a variety of civilisations in a fight to survive. will you be a warmonging country, going for fast expansion and a conquest of the world? will you be diplomatic, aiming to trade and ally? will you be sneaky, pretending to ally with a country and then wipe them off the face of the earth? there are so many options, and each country has a relevant perk. very much true to history... which you can rewrite! did japan take over korea? did spain destroy everyone and control the map? or did germany choose to be a friendly, negotiating country? its up to you in a world of endless possibilities. another must have. my game library wouldnt be complete without it. and neither is yours.",1
"420/10 made me not get a gf, stay home all summer, and take over japan all in the same month thanks sid meier, for a game that made me eat more hot pockets in a hour than a child in africa did in his entire life",1
"good classic game, but there are too many bugs in multiplayer.",2
"gandhi whooped me so hard that i wish i had died to barbarians back in ancient. 11/10 for realism.",1
"definately buy the complete edition though, its only a few dollars more and many times better than the vanilla version alone.",1
"this game is great, unless you are playing with someone who is unable to take less than 4 hours on each turn.",1
"sid meiers civilization v is one of the best games i have ever played.",2
"my civ was full of illiterate  so i left them for dead to go live the pirate life on the sea. 10/10 would let egypt starve to death again",1
"probably one of the most addictive nation-managing strategy games i have ever played. would definately recommand to people who enjoy building empires with vast varieties.",2
"i am totally addicted to this game. three hours flew by as things started to get heated.",1
"ths game is so gey i cant even belive it why isnt brock obama in this game he is best americian president gandee is a fukin",1
"if you have any interest in strategy games, you probably already have it and a couple of its predecessors. otherwise, buy it and your only regret will be that the wife left you, got the house and the kids. but hey, chances are you wont notice anyway.",5
"epic, best ever civilization game, after time optimized and really great to play. it gave me more fun than the best previous-civ - civilization ii, really this game has so much options, so many different scenarios, you can play mostly every scenario, style, build great empires on huge terrain or rush for victory in a short game. with the new expansions and dlcs, steam workshop... warning! this game neutralizes time - 1, 5, 10 hours - it passes so fast with this game! ultra playable",2
"great game if you have the time and money to offer it. lots of knowledge!",2
"if you fancy a good cry, this is the game for you. 10/10 will cry again",1
"whenever i start playing it, i cant stop. happend to me many times that i started in 4pm and ended in 10pm. then i get 6 nukes, and i can bomb all my enemies and allies. this game is awesome.",1
"gandhi threatend to nuke me if i didnt recommend this game",2
"best online strategy game. i love how you can set up an empire, and go from there, anything can happen. it only becomes more challenging as you advanced through out the various dificulties. you could win or lose in a heart beat. alot harder than the originals.",1
"the best civilization ive ever played there are a lot of dlcs availeble, which in my eyes feesl a bit like farming, i got myself a few but there are not much improving the game - but see for yourself. the game itself is super, you nice graphics, the soundeffects are a little bit annoying when you play it a long time, and if you start it is hard to stop, its quite addictive. so all in all it is worth bying",2
"i played this game for 30ish hours in the past two weeks. that definately says something. single player was a ton of fun, but add in a few friends with the ai and it makes it 10x better. 10/10.",1
"i believe this game is great, but many would disagree... its the marmite of gaming... up there with the well known monopoly board game. its massively time consuming, your friends will get angry if you keep asking them to play and you have to be a die-hard fan of this form of game to bear with its tedious time consuming yet magnicificant piece of gaming masterpieces. but, it proves to me and many others as a shining beacon, of which pulls you away from the painful, dull and necessary work of life and into the gaping greatly lit tunnel of procrastination and determination. to those ready to civ... i salute you.",5
"a great game, moves at a good pace, a million ways to play. itll pull you in for hours, and youll enjoy every second of it.",1
"the vanilla civ v is definitely still a great game, but really only shines with the big dlc (bnw and g&k). the dlcs give civ v the replay-ability you look for in a civ game. so, if you can snag the whole bundle in a steam sale theres probably one of the best purchaes on steam you could make.",3
"there are few games that make you feel as in control or powerful as civilization 5 does. it certainly does a fantastic job at what its meant to do and i would recommend this game to you if youre into strategy games and using your wits to best your opposition.",2
"tried so many times to enjoy this game, couldnt. back to playing civ iv",2
"yesh awesome game :d if youre into games like spore at the civilization stage buy this now",1
"awesome game with the dlc but the standard version is missing a lot of stuff from older civs. buy in bundle if price is reduced, but not only main game.",1
"i love the civ games and have been playing them since civ 2. the only thing i think the games have lost is the espionage element. i miss having my spies in civ 2 that i could move about the board and create strife in neighboring cities then take them over. i know a lot of people disliked that about the spies and i have found that most people either love or hated the spies no in between. either way this is still a good addition to the civ world. looking forward to the next installment. oh... and bring back spy units!",1
"this game is worth every penny i have spent on it. would definitely recommend to players who likes to play rts games!",2
"fun game, nice to kill time or just play with friends! lots of replayability as well.",1
"nice strategy game, really lets you decide whats best for you empire.",1
"its civ 5. you already know its awesome if youre even considering buying it.",1
"i love this game! i grew up playing age of empires and age of mythology, so this was great to find.",1
"its a really fun game that stimulates the strategy part of the mind and teaches you a bit of history at the same time =d",1
"civilization v is great, and with the two dlc and with the tonnes of content on the workshop, there is enough content to keep the game entertaining for years to come.",1
"fun offline game with unlimited gameplay oppurtunities.",1
"so guys, this game is not just a standard strategy games, this game not like a game where you just need to expand your army and territory, this game is realy realy realistic if you want a empire builder simulator, not just army, you need to consider your people, dont let them starving, your diplomacy, city states, and the other..... if you are try play this game seriously, i think you need more than 15 hours to complete only 1 skirmish in realistic time (marathon in smc v). this game is very very addictive, trust me.",1
"fun game, very addicting, very strategic, a great experience for any player.",1
"this game is fun when playing against humans. its terrible playing against ai. the npcs are way too predictable and non-threatening. if you build up your military quickly, you can overrun them every time. graphics are better than previous civs, but still just ok. ui and tutorials are good.",1
"great turn-based game, spent way too kuch time playing this! good for quick games or long marathons! :d",1
"extremely good game, i love the warfare and combat, giant death robot #yolo",1
"the only game i can nuke germany from a japanese sub and send robots to take over the world",1
"this is the best strategy game that i have played on pc. it is fun to play against a.i. or with friends. you will have to expect some games to last up to 10 to 15 hours although you can adjust things to make the games shorter. 8.5/10",1
"it took me 30 hours just to finish one game. but i dont regret it, its very funny and very immersive.",1
"this game is absolutely amazing. iv sunk hundreds of hours into this game. absolutely massive replay value. something new each time!",2
"amazing game, hard to play with a lot of friends, but still a ton of fun and addicting! 10/10",1
"i started with civilization and have played every iteration. this is easily my favorite. the unit system eliminates the stack of death balance issue. i would recommend starting with both expansions as they add a great deal of content.",2
"this game is a classic. utterly addicting. if you start, you will end up playing for 12 hours or more and forget about the rest of your life.",1
"i learned more history in this game than in history class,",1
"i found this game to be super fun and rewarding. i cant wait to try out the multi-player. my only complaint with the game is with them using bismark instead of hitler, who is a lot more well known, and lets face it, was a more successful leader.",1
"good game. ive obviously spent a lot of time playing so a positive review shouldnt be surprising. an excellent addition to a classic 4x game. i would recommend getting the expansions, as they add a lot of depth to the game. lots of replayability, especially if you mess around with various map features.",3
"sid meiers civilization v is a very fun game for people who are interested in strategy games, but you probably already heard it before if you are in to these kinds of games. i dont play strategy a lot, and each game requires a lot of time commitment, which i dont have.",1
"fantastic game. be prepared to spend many many hours on a single round.",1
"this is one of the best games for those rts fans and just for the heck of blowing the crap out of your friends cilivization with nukes... and it just keeps getting better and better",1
"one of the best stategy games ive played some things could be better for exaple the soundtrack or diplomatcy but all in all good game",2
"this game is absolutely stunning. beautiful graphics combined with amazing core gameplay and sheer strategy just blows me away. the fundamentals take a steep curve in your learning capabilities but once you get the hang of it, it becomes a beautifully solid game. absolutely great strategy game with awesome capabilities. 20/10 would bang twice",1
"if you like wasting hours of your life, and enjoying every moment of it.... buy this game. very fun long time startegy game.",3
"civilization 5 is one of those amazing games that makes you stay up till 6 in the morning, downing red bull, screaming when you finally eliminate that  who took your tiny town over 200 turns ago, however you just tok his capital. the game runs smoothly on basically any machine, and mines a brick. if it doesnt run smoothly in normal mode, theres a tactical mode that basically can run on a toaster. that is, if that toaster has directx 9. you will play hundreds on hundreds of turns. you will stay up till the break of dawn. and you will love every second of it. 11/10 would buy again",1
"so much fun! such long games ... cant.stop.playing",1
"the best of its title. 10/10 if you are into turn-based strategy, this is the game for you. the best turn-based strategy. build your empire. win through culture, science, diplomacy, or rule everyone dominion. the only things i dont like is that you must continue to improve your technology to the max or you wont be able to compete with other nations. i wish theres a way to max the era to medieval era for example so that you can roll with samurais or knights :)) even then, its still 10/10.",1
"the game is simple to pick for new players. on the easiest mode, you cant lose so its nice to just try things and learn by doing -- no thick manual to read. graphics are quite good. great place to see if you like turn-based strategy games (much less stressful than real-time strategy). played almost 200 hours and the replay value is still high. no two games are alike. ive been playing off and on since 2010 and its always fun when i come back to it. even now, i often get sucked into one more turn and stay up later than i planned. if you find yourself winning a lot, changing the difficulty level will change things for you. the game rewards more passive play which i prefer and there are several ways to win (cultural victories are now viable at higher levels). definitely would recommend this game.",1
"very cool game, ive played about 10 hours worth and still have no clue what im doing, looking forward to seeing what i can do though :d",1

"its great game. i played all the versions since back in college on a 286 with floppy disks. you want to lose famly and friends play this game for a few hours. games never end on the nex turn until its midnight. lol",2
"great fun by yourself or with friends! if you enjoy managing infrasture and war at the same time, then this is most likely a game for you",2
"a very fun game. i was a newcomer to turn-based strategy games before this. ive been thoroughly enjoying it so far, and i highly recommend getting it if you even remotely enjoy strategy titles. everything is well executed, and seamless. on another note, it is amusing playing as the roman empire and having nuclear technology. beware, this game will eat up hours upon hours. but youll enjoy every minute of this game.",1
"gandhi wants to bathe in my blood because i exist. 10 outta 10",2
"a very fun, replayable game. i think that it is a good game to play when you have a significant amount of time to waste. i will say however, that i find it hard to play if it the sole thing i am doing as it can be very monotonous clicking the next turn button constantly, especially if you are playing single player. the multiplayer does make this game as great as it is though. playing with 2/3 friends is quite the experience when you have to work together to defeat a common enemy when ultimately you will have to go your own course in your pursuit of victory. a much recommended game, in my honest opinion and well worth the money.",2
"if you like strategy games at all, then you will love civ v.",1
"great game for turn based strategy (tbs) fans. some of the modifications made the game concepts change from previous version, but the changes were for the better.",4

"steam has a error scince it says i need to repurchase it even though ive played 40 hours. what do i do?",1
"a great turn based strategy game, tons of different civlilizations to play. good depth and replaybility. can customize to have games long or short with different maps. supports multiplayer with frriends but i would recommend getting the brave new world expansion pack, adds trade routes, religion and much more. overall my favorite strategy game out of all the ones i played. get it!",2
"an easy game thats easy to sink your teeth into not a game for casual gammers.",2
"so, so fun! great single player game. if you love stratergy, and you love games with a layed back casual, fun play stile. you will love it. i mainly play online games, but this swayed me away from online gaming for a long time! must buy... awsome.",1
"best game of the series yet! make sure to get the main expansions, makes it a lot better",1
"this is a game for people with big  7 inch plus only",1
"very fun game lots of replay ability i have over 331 hours game time yes it is that good no two matches are a like",2
"if you want to start a meaningful marathon game, avoid the ancient era when setting up the game. your gameplay will be a lot more eventful.",1
"turn based rts with real historic nations/leaders (note controversial chatacters like hitlers germany isnt present) great game requires patience never trust gandhi",1
"great mechanics with lots of replay value. any strategy fan will enjoy what civ v has to offer. the expansions also add lots of content.",1
"ill keep this short and sweet. i never played civ games for more than a few tries here and there over the years. i never played the original one mind you, but i played 2-4. i appreciate the genre, i grew up on board games like risk so this is nothing new to me. all that being said, i now love civ. it may have taken 5 games to get there, but i am hooked. i have spent many hours dominating the world, i will spend many more again. buy this, you wont regret it.",4
"i think this game is amazing it is one of thoses very few games that you can play at any time of the day so i give it 10/10 from a very happyfellow p.s i think peole in this day and age sould stop illgaly downloading games and surport the devlopers infact im going to name one of these people sjbarker",1
"great game! graphics are like crysis 1-2, but it gets the job done. and the gameplay is amazing, unique parkour combat with cool upgrades and weapons. best of all, it doesnt force you to buy stuff with real world money, so you can enjoy it for free.",1
"when you go to play this game you will think you will only play it for awhile. you say, oh only an hour or two and then im going to bed. im not saying that you will be up half the night playing this game, im just saying it should be bundled with a coffee maker.",1
"i love this game, it can be really fun to play with friends when youre winning and fun when youre not :3. this game is really cool because you can do so much, and it is also a game that requires you to think, use skill and strategy rather than simply pointing and shooting, and it has so many details and interesting game mechanics while not being overly-complicated.",1
"love this game though the multiplayer can be a lil buggy at times",2
"for people who like the feel of strategy board games, and the technological advancments of computer games, this is the game for you! sid meiers civilization v, along with its dlcs, runs and feels like a game like risk, making it very easy to follow and understand. i would highly recommend this game to anyone whos a fan of strategy games.",4

"just an advise to you my friends: attack gandhi and siam when they are weak. those ing backstabbers",1
"pros: endless replayability so many countries you can play as amazing visuals workshop content cons: slow (not a bad thing for some people) starting the game takes so long ghandi.... ai constantly backstab you to the point where alliances are usually not worth it overall this is a great game, and i highly recommend this game to any turn based strategy lovers.",1

"this game is amazing! you may have seen sid meiers civization beyond earth. i still recommend this game rather than that because there as been more work on it than the new one. if you buy this game you will want to buy all of the exspansions for it. the exspansions exspand the game so much, the base game is not near as fun as all of the exspansions combined. i really would reccomend this game. i play with my uncle all of the time and we kill each otheror work together, and not even talking about all of the fun of smack talk! this game is amazing to play and even better playing with freinds and family. if you buy this game make sure to get someone you know to play with you. also make sure to practice so much that you crush whoever you play with in an istant, this game lets you achive complete and utter power. buy this game.",3
"a wonderful turn-based strategy game. fun to play with your friends especially. i recommend that everyone give this a try, and those who do like it should purchase the complete edition. 10/10",1
"its a really good game. i enjoyed the 2 days of this game, now im attracted to it like tobacco.",1
"this is brilliant, to begin with, i was pretty unsure how the turn base would work, being a rts player for a long time. but, i have to say, the turn base is very smooth and quick when playing against ai or humans. this game has so much depth, it has civilizations and tech i had never heard of before and it has amazing replayability. i have only put in 42hrs so far, so playing online can be a bit intimidating, but the experience is amazing, the feeling you get when you discover gunpower and then an enemy rocks up to your city with tanks and nukes is amazing and makes you want to become a better player. 10/10 would recommend.",1
"this is the game that help my sleepless problem. whenever i play this game i will so sleepy in 1 hrs.",1
"this game is totally worth buying, if your in to stragety and building empires. envolving lots of diplomancy and war to work your civ to be the best. like building bulding and empire and stragety games? then this is what you want",1
"warning: this game will make time disappear. seriously how long can just one more turn take?",1
"you will not eat or sleep properly after you install this. just saying... 10/10 for you, 1/10 for your health, job, and significant other.",1
"how do i describe civilization 5? the short answer is that you cant. this is for one reason only. if i were to put this gaming expierence into words, it would ruin the game for many. this game has that x-factor that i look for in most games. where you can sit down, play and tell yourself oh look, its only 10pm. one more turn wont hurt. and before you know it, it is the dawn of a brand new day, and all you care is that next turn. this game never gets old because each game is entirely different, and i think that with all these things, 2k has put together a winner in civilization 5.",1
"very good game! great graphics with directx 11 and the gameplay is addicting.",2
"hours upon hours of playing. 10/10. would play again.",1
"reviews are unecessary. just buy it, youll like it, whether if you like it or not.",2
"i get to take over the world as gahndi what more could you ask for?",3
"the best waste of time ever devised 10/10. probably one of the few must have games on steam it runs on practicaly any machine and has some of the most addictive stratagy that never gets old. even if you are not usualy a stratagy fan this game is for everyone becuase of its simple nature and easy to get to grips with systems. this game is best enjoyed with a low paced netflix series for maximum enjoyment and time wasting.",2
"game is awesome, well thoughtout, and plays so nicely. hats off to sid meiers.",3
"this game is good to play with friends and be horrible to them at the same time",1
"you wont realize it at first, but youll be spending hours without realizing it. this game gives you a variety of ways to play it, not just the the opposition must be crushed! sort of way. good graphics, good gameplay, easy to play - good game overall :d",1
"ive really enjoyed playing civ, as always. i think it still could have been much better. id recommend purchasing the game when its on offer! ive played a lot of it and after a few very long games now, ive began to become bored of it. but its still recommended, especially if you have friends to play with!",1
"highly addictive game with lots of strategic possibilties. scenarios are fun, but so is developing a unique civilization as you progress through history, particularly when competing with friends.",1
"civ 5s logic. what?!?! you rejected my friends friend request for a trade agreement that was completely not in your favor?!?! how dare you! you dugust me you foul warmonger! prepare for war!!! uhhhh, why did you just claim a tile thats 20 tiles away from my civilization??? are you trying to acttack me?!?! warmonger! how dare you kill one of mongolias units after they nuked you! we happen to be friends you know!!!! how dare you vote against my proposal to embargo you! denoucement!!! 10/10",3
"incredible game turn based strategy at its finest still, the vanilla has some annoying items that only the dlcs fix such as terrible ai that will only trade with you if you hand over your entire empire ai that likes to declare war on you suddenly, with no warning, and all at once the dlcs seem to fix this i think the faith system adds a lot of variety still crying that they got rid of autocracy social branch :( the game will have you up for hours playing multiplayer can be a let down if you play with strangers because they like to leave immediately i only recommend playing with friends online probably the best turn based strategy atm",1
"be peaceful with everyone for over 3000 years, declares war once and gets marked as a warmongering menace of the world and gets nuked by gandhi. 10/10",3
"new expansion pack adds many new elements to the game keeping it fresh. love this game, highly recommend!",2
"awesome,awesome,awesome!!!! do i need to say anything else?",3
"where to start with this master piece. honestly one of the best games ive ever played, up there with the greats. its got a great concept behind it and to be honest works brilliantly. definetly a must buy",1
"this game should be rated 18+, it is way too addictive. 10/10",1
"love it, mainly for the strategy because strategy games are my favorite games",2
"a game that fails to justify its very existence through sheer lack of innovation; and that doesnt say when that started. one of the most overrated games of the past several years.",1
"is an awesome game! when you start it, its hard to stop!",1
"addictive game: who doesnt want to go from farm to giant death robot? :d",1
"this is great game that will suck you in and make you spend hours at a time. brave new world heavily recommend for full experience.",2
"who knew being a warmongering world superpower could be so fun?",3
"very fun game, either on your own or with friends!",1
"ahhh, good old civ v. if you have time to spare, get this brilliant masterpiece! cunning diplomacy and evil strategies are at your fingertips. conquer the world? or be the cultural genius? its up to you!",1
"never, have i ever, not even once... had a session of this game that was not a complete blast. what cant be said about civ v. its the peak of gridded strategy games, not only will you have to plan out what direction you want your civilization to go in terms of how cultured, scientific, wealthy, and happiness, youll also have to keep track of the plots and connections of various city-states and of course, other civilizations. you can play a plethora of leaders to be the ruler of your civ, each leader is unique and different to play; however, they are all fun to play, theres no real bad or op leader. the real fun of civ v is the mulitplayer, whether you hop on a public server or have a match with your friends, civilization will have you laughing, sweating, cheering, crying, and swearing. ~from a player with 60+ hours, and no completed games. i <3 this game.",1
"awsome game it becomes even better after getting all the add-ons!!!!",1
"this games level of detail is so deep, adele is rolling in it",1
"a fabulous game that simulates perfectly how awful ghandhi is",1
"i suck so bad. seems like it has solid design though. if you like strategy games this is one to think about.",1
"where you blow everyone up with nuclear bombs 11/10",1
"the best turn based strategy game ever made... highly recommended",1
"i am not usally interested in games like this but, this game is an acception. anyone can play and its is easy to learn. one of my favorite games of all time. 9.5/10",1
"must buy game, so many options, so in-depth strategy, great graphics, addictive gameplay...what more do you need!",1
"before i started playing, i pictured this game as being kinda like rts games ive played like age of empires. this is more turn-based and strategic than other games, with an emphasis towards building up over a long period of time. and yeah, i mean looooong. games can get fairly lengthy, though its pretty easy to put them on pause, even in multiplayer. theres definitely a learning curve, and while the tutorials are adequate for the basics, theres a lot of nitty gritty stuff that trips you up the first few games. overall, this is a great game for turn-based strategy, with lots of replayability, especially if you can get a couple of friends to join you for a long evening session.",1
"i have never invested so much of myself into a game before, literal days off of my lifespan playing civilization v. time that i cannot and would not want to get back.",1
"get this game now! you will play it for hours. just trust me.",1
"an amazing game, people who want a challenge have to buy this.",2
"you cant get a much better deal than with civ v. the gameplay is flawless and still highly addictive even though i have played for a year.",2
"this is a great game and if you do not own it yet you should heavily consider picking civ 5 up. strongly recommmeded for edless hour and replayability. what are you waiting for?",1
"trully an astonishing work of art. great graphics and the gameplay is just spectalur! america approves this game for children under the age of 3 :)",1
"this game is addictive. it uses the same tried and true formula of the other games and will keep you glued to the screen for hours as you just need one more turn... the game is more balanced than ever if you get the 2 additional dlcs. the first makes religion worthwhile and the 2nd adds more lategame options and a revamp of the cultural victory conditions.",1
"one of my all time favorite games! truly amazing! a must play for all people who love strategy games. -potato_ninja and a fat penguin",2
"very fun, but not sure about the mechanics, and games take a very long time; which i guess is good :)",1
"this game gives you so many options to do and so many challenges. you can build your empire and shape history",3
"civ has got to be one of the best strategy games ive ever tried. turn-based and played on a hexagonal field, a bit like a board game, but the special rules in civ make you think twice before doing anything. one part of the game that i love is how you get to control every little aspect of your civ; from research and military, to social policies (communism!) and construction. another great thing is that there is a big selection of different civs, each with their own unique units and/or buildings and traits, from across time to choose from; such as 18th century america, 1st century rome, 9th century denmark, and many more, with another chunk being added with the gods and kings expac, such as 17th century sweden. also has a f*cking great soundtrack. my conclusion: if you are into other turn-based strategy games, such as total war, but want en exciting twist, try civilization 5.",1
"its a great time killer and is even better to play with friends. i recommend checking out the workshop for mods with this game as they can add countries or leaders that arent recognized in the game or in the dlcs.",1
"i love that i pay for a game then the stream servers are too busy to let me play it... always. ive been a civilization player since the beginning but now i hate it. i hate stream. i just want to play my game that i paid my money for. again, i really hate your company. go f*** yourselves. thanks",2
"great game if your into strategy not as great as civ 4 but still great game",3
"this game is something special, you control civilizations and make choices for their paths and strategies to fight and destory other civilizations. would advise anyone who loves to make their descisions, strategies and ways of playing a game to buy this right now.",1
"a great turn base game with many different civilizations to choose from. you will spend hours and hours on just one game. its endless fun that will never end. make sure to have a good strategy though.",1
"this game is fun. i like to build a gret nation to take over the world. i build mummies and zombies and no one can touch. i would recommend this game to child or adults. all races and black people.",1
"great game, hours of fun to be had. hours of tactical and banterous fun to be had!",1
"i cant describe my feeling for this game. it is a game you can put hours into a not even realize it.",1
"awesome game, wasted 140 hours of my life fighting montezuma!",1
"i dont have enough hours i this game. its amazingly talented, unlike my skills in it",1
"being new to the civ franchise i did not know what to expect with civ v however i was plesantly surprised. the game is easy to pick up with many helpful hints and notifications so you dont miss anything - its quite clear what is going on at all times even during my first play through and its very replayable. it is true that some angles of play are easier than others (such as going for military victories) however i personally found this very entertaining trying to get social and science victories as a challenge. i highly recommend this game, but heed this warning - you will lose many hours clicking the next turn button. realising youre a number of hours late for bed will be something you get used to playing this game.",1
"a very good game to spend time, along with friends or with mods will accompany you through many hours and longer. personally recommend everyone to try it~~",1
"warning: this game has a tendency to try and consume your life. i must say i try to only play this game occasionally, reason being it sucks you in and doesnt let go, i have passed the 390 hour mark and still find myself saying just one more turn. if you like this type of strategy game you will not be disappointed and will gain a massive time sink in your life, p.s, dont trust ghandi!",3
"its civilization, what more do you really have to say? in any event, this is the most polished and entertaining game in the seires. the fact that its cross platform and runs like a dream with an intel hd 4600 gpu on linux helps a lot too. i cant recommend this game enough. hell if you get around to actually playing it, not only will you have fun, you might actually learn something!",1
"this game is like that moment when youre geting a bj and about to finish and she just lets you go all over her face and chest. and i mean everywhere. but overall, worth my dollar.",1
"bid farewell to the soon to become obselete phrase: im bored.",2
"very fun game where you can command one of many civilizations from around time. go to war with montezuma as george washington with genghis khan at your side, or generate tourism for your civ. fly into space, or be elected world leader. infinite replay value. the expansion packs and civilization dlcs (korea, polynesia, babylon, denmark) add a lot to the game, and made my playthroughs a lot more fun. brave new world, the second expansion, really fleshed out cultural victories. mods add a lot of content to the game, including maps, civilizations, and scenarios. anyways, this is a great game, and i personally cannot wait for civilization: beyond earth next fall. 9.5/10",1
"this game is like meth, you play it once and you think your awesome, in the end your teeth are rotten and you have no friends 10/10",2
"what cant i recommend? this game will eat up your hours, turning day to night. its indepth game play and full on strategy can take you away leaving you wide eyed thinking what the hell happened to you life. note: i am only mentioning this if you really are into strategy and mostly games similar to civ v. the addition of ranged bombardment i think is awesome, it just allows players to fire weapons from behind the front lines, you also have fully animated leaders interacting with players from a screen-filling diplomatic scene which i guess is not too bad, kinda just adds a bit of spice to it. if you have friends, group or a party to play with then this is definitely a bonus.",1
"ill just play for half an hour. 10 hours later... just one more turn.",1
"this game will end your life. get it at your own risk.",1
"best game ever! (except for civ iv, iii, ii or the original civ.) ive lost days and days and days to this game series. more addictive than peanut butter covered crack cocaine. oh go on then... one more turn...",1
"absolutely awesome game! but dont get it on steam. after civ: beyond earth came out, civ v started crashing when setting up a new game. i couldnt find a way to stop steam from updating to the buggy new version, so getting it on dvd is probably the best way to get a working version of this game, i downloaded an old version and its working perfectly (as long as steam is turned off)",5
"anyone into stratagy games should really check this one out. a++",2
"i havent played the game as much some other people that have played this game. but i have to say, this game is a game with a lot of depth and attention to detail. i havent played a game that kept me up as late as it has before. if you like sleeping at night, you might want to reconsider buying this game. however, if you want a solid turn based, diplomacy strategy game, i would definitely give this game a whirl.",1
"filled to the brim with strategy, this game is a must have. i highly recommend the brave new world expansion; i found it far more entertaining than the vanilla game.",1
"you can upset a nation by simply trading your diplomatic bannans to the wrong nation 10/10",1
"this game is highly addictive and will claim hours of your free time. the mods that are created for this game are also well worth the time to try out.",1
"amazing game, extremely customizable, simple to complex, one of the best turn based strategy games ever made.",1
"great game! love it! if you buy this, do one thing before you play a match... pray oh god dont let gandhi nuke me!",2
"spooky game where everyone hates you. its like real life",1
"a really pleasing and exciting strategy game that i highly reccommend. 9/10",2
"solid strategy game. just as good single-player as it is multi-player.",1
"the best civ game i have ever played is really good... a little to many achivements but awesome anyway.",2
"great game. this is a game that i will keep playing for years.",1
"one of the most engaging turn-based strategy games on pc.",1
"this game is one of the best turnbased strategy games i have played to date. i was a little aprehensive about the new tile system and no unit stacking that was in civ iv, but it works out brilliantly in the end. was a little dissapointed that they did not include a few key features that ended up as expansions like espionage, but overall i thoroughly enjoy this game. if in doubt, i would certainly reccomend picking up at least gods and kings with this to better the overall experience.",1
"great game! incredible depth, but very, very,very time consuming. at time of writing i have 44 hours on record and i have finished about two games.",1
"an improvement over previous civ games, and twice as addictive",1
"this is one of the best games i have ever played. if you like strategy then you should definately buy this game.",1
"in my professional life, i am a political scientist who studies political violence and international relations. i have spent many hours in this game for both fun and creativity. i love seeing how gamers choose to engage in a variety of foreign policy decisions in multiplayer games. civ 5 can teach us quite a lot about the average world leader, and it can be damn fun at the same time.",2
"if you are the person who love to : 1. building your own dynasty/country 2. taking up your time thinking about the next move to make 3. have a creative imagination 4. have lotsa time to spend of course then i recommend u to play this game. although it really took a lot of time to learn and more time consuming to play, you have been warned !!",1
"best strategy game ever. dont underestimate it - its amazing.",1
"did you hear about that one guy who spent 10 years playing civilization? yeah, that basically sums up this game.",1
"alsome game to play loved every second of the game",1
"get it now, unless you like hitler (this may give you evil ideas to take over the world)",1
"this game is addicting, for the reasons that it pleases many audiences of even the most die-hard fps fans.",2
"youll make the choice to play for a single hour, then before you know it five days had past and your girlfriend left you, but youre on the brink of killing ghandi is doesnt even matter.",1
"the pinnacle of the civilization series. in my opinion, one of the best games of all time. (i have many more hours offline)",1
"i really like the naval units, but i feel like its such a chore to circumnavigate, even when playing on worldtypes. tl;dr, 5.8/10, too much water.",1
"dear god..ruined my life..i forgot my friends names, that i had a dog, hell i wasnt even sure i was alive..this is what happens when you play..for five hours..ive played for 239..i have no more life to worry about. because civ is my life, my love, my reason, my only sun in the sky..oh yeah and you should convert to the religon of civ ruined of my life. 9001/10 oh and dont in listen to that fat  ghandi..he nuked me..four times..",2
"still one of the top turn based strategy games of all time. every revision has its own merits; and though some woudl argue as to whether they have improved with each iteration, i certainly tink they have. it still has the same adicting one more turn aspect of all civilization games. you will spend hours and hours playing a single game.",1
"incredibly addictive. very fun even without dlc or mods. multiple ways to complete the game. you can destroy your enemys with an iron fist or win with poltical or scientific power. each playthrough is different due to maps many different characters with different abilitys which can by very useful to some people or none at all to others it just depends on what your style is. only a few complaints but they are quit small and not worth mentioning. dont buy this game if you dont have alot of spare time! if you do you that you should of been doing something useful once you have completed the game and trust me games last a long time. i recommend it to all ages. five stars",1
"this is one of my favorite games of all time, if your looking for a game with great gameplay, awsome multiplayer, and hours upon hours of fun... buy this game!",1
"i sincerely suck at this game, but its still fun.",4
"when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold, dyes, and ivory, take my advice. ready all your tanks and nukes, arm them, and shoot them like your life depends on it. they are evil, traitorous demons. never trust them. however, genghis khan is my best friend. he came up to me and was all like, de full do bu la chi mendo. and i said, okay! lets be friends! i can never understand that guy, but something about our relationship just works. ghandi hating simulator 2014 11/10",1
"oh my snick-snack patty-whack give this game a bone! this is one of the greatest turn-based strategy games out there, please give this game a chance because it it absolutely astonishing!",2
"if you are a fan of empire builders, or have been addicted to civ in the past - this is a fine rendition of the series. just keep in mind, they are looking to change a bit from previous games, and there are some shockers - like the removal of stacking units - that can be a blow to peoples strategy. still a well done game that even plays good on the mac - just update to snow leopard first (or it wont run).",1
"so much fun and can easily waste the whole day on this game. easy for anyone to pick up since the game does a good job of explaining things to you with the advisors and civilopedia. i didnt play the vanilla version but i heard gk & bnw helped make the game a lot better.",1
"ive really enjoyed playing civ, as always. i think it still could have been much better. id recommend purchasing the game when its on offer! ive played a lot of it and after a few very long games now, ive began to become bored of it. but its still recommended, especially if you have friends to play with!",1
"i really wanted to like this game but in the end i couldnt get into it. the movement tile system is extremely limiting, and to simply move your army a short distance takes quite a while. also the cities are really screwy - you cant build large cities or your citizens will get angry, so you end up having to build numerous small ones. its just way too limiting for me, but who knows, maybe youll like it.",1
"from civ- games series this is the best one in the league!",2
"totally sucks , hate it so much , takes 8h to finish a game i can finish 3 skyrim quests instead",1
"will give positive review when i can buy complete edition without repaying for original game.",1
"very fun to play, endless replayability, amazing dlc, decent multiplayer, and it usually never gets boring",1
"took me awhile to get out of my hilly base. it was looking pretty bleak getting across that valley, but we got it done somehow. but then ggd out before we could break out our ak-47s to pull out the w. never even found out who my enemy was. eventually i renamed my towns name to tyrezeshiddick cuz it was getting preeeetty boring unreality tazzzyloosepoundite. i give this game a solid 6/10. its hard to get a good review out of me. the only games that i have given above a 7/10 are arma, day-zed, terraria, zombies: survival stories, ufc: fight round 26 and sid meiers 2. so survive our night guys.",1
"the hex grid combat made combat more dynamic but the overall ga,e dept suffered before any expansions. after brave new world and gods and kings wererelease the game became a complete experice. many of the smal;l dlc felt like nickle and dimeing the gamer. they should have been added to the base game. but the game is stupid addictive and deep. so i give it a remomendation.",2
"although this is a great game, and thats from a person like me who doesnt really dig strat games, it is just so poorly done for multiplayer we constantly have to restart it.",1
"gods & kings creates and interesting wrinkle. and brave new worlds... bravo... so glad to see caravans back. they are a real boon to getting new cities up and running, especially when either food or production is some what limited. caravan in hammers to help small cities produce wonders that create bonus culture for city border growth.",3
"great game if you love strategy games. the dlcs are great too.",1
"i think i permanently damaged my right arm by playing this game.",1
"a very good civilization game and is better than beyond earth. play this if you love risk. 9/10",1
"very fun game but i would buy the bundle with all the dlcs because its the best deal and you may not be able to play with everybody.",1
"ive played 400+ hours of this game and its still exciting. the design is amazing, the interface is fun, war is alright, the tech tree is amazing and starting a game on this will get you hooked for ages. i recommend it for any strategy gamers.",3
"honestly there is not much more to be said about the great game that is civ v. like the games that came before it this is nother great addition to the 4x genre.",1
"if you see ghandi, no matter how early in game destroy him at that moment if you dont he will nuke your  into oblivion 5 times over.",1
"civilization v is among the top of my list of favorite games. its strategy demonstrated through gathering resources and expanding your empire reminds me a lot of the board game settlers of catan. the primary concepts focused on are very in-depth, and it takes a great amount of skill to learn the premise of the game in its entirety,",1
"the game is good, achievements are somewhat satisfying. the game is decent. overall.... quite repetitive. it is fun for the first 4-6 months, after that... look for another game.",2
"...wait what its tuesday ive been plaing for six days what the hell happend",1
"a little slower than i was expecting, but the interactions are great and there are a lot of new features.",1
"the next iteration of the classic strategy game scores big again. :)",2
"nothing quite like using gandi to take over the world really!",1
"great game! had it for a very long time now but only just went back on it and it shows how much ive been missing out! it is highly addictive and extremely hard to turn off so i would definatley reccomend it especialy if your like me and love stratergy games",1
"its a fun game with friends, and theres always something to do. but its also boring and the same thing over and over. cities are too op. i think the game is good, not worth the price",1
"even after 850+ hours i still love this game! if i want a simple time sink or a super stressful tactical slug fest i can find it here. i would suggest this for all ages by the way.",5
"i just cant get enough of this game. over the course of the game, you will find yourself expanding, plotting, warring, spying, reasearching, and backstabbing your nation to glory. civilization v is extremely addicting and it will leave you staring at your screen for hours while you try to convince yourself that youll only play for one more turn. seriously, get this game. p.s gandhi is warmongering, nuke-crazy, homicidal maniac. watch your back.",1
"one...more...turn. get the complete edition, most bing for your buck.",1
"one of the best turn-based strategy games ever, basically unlimited replayibility, especially with every games length and production trees...",1
"what was already good just got better! highly recommended!",1
"man i love this game this game ruin my life damn thank you man",2
"this game is fantastic! ive played civilization revolution on 360 and this is 10 times better than that! well worth the price!",1
"made canada in custom civilization creator, destroyed usa. 11/10 would force washington into surrender.",1
"so many hours put on this game, its fairly adictive and entretaining. just remember.. dont trust napoleon ;)",1
"this game will leave you geeked out for dayssss. overall fun as hell!!!",2
"this is possibly the best strategy game ive ever played i recommend this game to any and all!",2
"despite being a little crashy, this game is the best civ ive played. as george washington, i kicked genghis khans  with sun tzu leading my tanks. which gave me enough time to complete my cultural victory. :)",2
"because of this game, my family abondoned me, i got fired, my friends hate me, i lost my house, and i forgot my name. but i just researched atomic theroy so thats nice",1
"great game! has to be one of my favourite games of all time but i suppose thats obvious from the ridiculous play time. the two most recent dlcs; gods & kings and brave new world are a must have, the extra gameplay they implement is incredible.",3
"are you prepared to use ghandi as your instrument of war against the genghis khan and his ally, george washington, in a race for nuclear weapons? this is a game you play if you have a full month to kill. its a game where you start at 7pm and then stop playing at 8am because you have to go to work. this is the definition of video game crack.",1
"ridiculously fun, loads of add-on content, insane replayability, theres just so much i love about this game",1
"i would recommend this game because of its immersion and alteration of history, it is worth the money.",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. unlimited hours of gameplay.",1
"civilization: the only place where gandhi goes to violent war against others. *clap*",1
"one more turn and im done for now ..... 6 hours later",1
"this game is probably the best i have played. i strongly recommend getting the dlcs for this since it adds so much more depth.",4
"words cannot describe how much fun can be had in just one game. you can co-op, compete, or fly solo. and lets not forget the mods you can find on workshop! i personally love sitting here leading my armies to either forcefully or peacefully take over the world! oh gosh and lets not forget the dlc that adds religious boundaries and world meetings. its just a really great game, even though the only comparison i personally have is civ rev on xbox 360, i enjoy it thoroughly.",1
"this is a great game, and a great addition to the civilization saga. i have spent many days playing solo and with my friends, and will spend many more in the future. if you are a fan of stratagy games/ rule the world games then civilization v is for you. with many different ways that you can win this game has something for everyone. you can win a scientific/space race victory, a diplomatic victory through votes in the un, cultural victories, and of course you can just pound your enemies into the ground under the boots of your soldiers. the unique units/buildings as well as the special perks that each nation recieves makes this game interesting no matter who you play as. all in all i would give this a two thumbs up rating and now i think i might start playing myself.",2
"this is game is amazing! i started playing at 10 am and then it was 3 am. :p... this game with the dlc: brave new world. the game gets better than ever. the dlc is a whole new game within another gane!!! buy this game right away or as soon you can. games like this are art and can never be dismissed by gamers! almost ever gamer has or every civilization out there!",1
"sweet baby jesus do i love this game. if you into sinkin a couple of hours into plotting the downfall of other countries, this is the game for you!",4
"i reccomend playing this before bed and studying, it helps you concentrate.",1
"love it. on thing though, if ghandi invents nuclear elephants runnn",1
"i have only played civ v for about 2 hours now, having never played a single game of sid meiers, let alone really and turned based strat games in general. so far i can tell and understand why the hype for this game is so big. yes at first it seems like it has a decently big learning curve, i was kind of overwhelmed at first with what i was supposed to be doing etc. but the nice thing about it is that instead of having to go through a huge tutorial for an explanation, it tells you what you should be doing while you are starting off your country. i like it a lot!",1
"a very good game, can be your first strategy game or just another addition to your long list. along with dlcs it makes the best strategy games ive ever played.",2
"i got this game as a gift originally and i love it. but there is something bad i have to say. you will lose track of time.",2
"this game is a masterpiece. i feel like napoleon (which you can be) commanding his armies (which you can do) to attack enemy nations (which is a thing) and make them part of glorious france (which i think is possible?)!",1
"before this game, i had always dreamed of a strategy game that wasnt all about war. in this, you can have cold wars that last for centuries, or you can be in a state of total war from the very beginning. there is a great amount of flexibility, replayability, and awesomeness.",2
"1. you meet gandhi as you find uranium shortly after 2. you both become allies after his struggle for food in his civilization 3. gandhi starts to look suspicious after the local uranium is mined 4. your halfway through to building your spaceship 5. gandhi suddenly allies with someone else 6. gandhi betrays you and declares war 7. you create nukes to nuke him but your realise he has already made nukes 8. gandhi nukes your civlization and every other leader 9. you regret meeting gandhi 10. gandhi wins the game by finishing his spaceship and sending it to space 11. you tableflip and throw your pc out the window. 10/10 would get nuked and rage again.",1
"great game buy. i would reccomend buying ultimate edition",2
"this is a very addictive game, there are so many options for the maps and the opponents and everything, there is technology, history, science, culture, strategy, warfare, tactics, and more all combined, i created a game with all 14 civilizations and i have spent 3 days on just that game, and it is still not finished, but i have a glorious empire soon to crush germany, then either the empire down on the bottom right or egypt. my idea is play with large continents, take over one of them completely and then fortify it and do what you wish from there.",1
"it was a interesting and creative game. it had limited resources that made it more of a challenge but gives you a reason to expand to other regions. the idea and story behind the game is truely a recipe for fun and creativity. i have payed these games before on other systems and inever get tired of all the things i can complete and do on civilization.",1
"create, or get destroyed civilization is the most addictive game there is on the steam market today. every time i play time passes by so fast, and it just gets better and better. gameplay might be slow at sometimes, but when you eventually play for several hours it becomes insanely fun! there are endless amounts of what you can do in civilization, even a unit called a giant death robot. i would rate this game 20/5 if i could, never will i get bored of this game! get it now!",1
"greate game! all time spent in this game is time well spent, and its easy to have hours disappear from your day after you start playing.",1
"my first ever strategy game. i can not stop playing it. one of the best games i have ever played.",2
"im probably going to have to uninstall this game. ive never been a strategy game player. but civ 5....i cant get off it. the game is great. with so much to do and so many ways to win, i cant imagine getting bored with this anytime soon.",1
"in the year 1971, boudiccas celtic nation was the last thing standing before napoleon is dream of global domination. within a year, the french nuclear program had been completed, and the celtic nation was carpet bombed from end to end. with every celtic city but the capital utterly annihilated, napoleons infantry stormed into edinbourgh, fulfilling the 4000 year old french dream of conquest. granted, half the world is a nuclear crater, and most likely i have launched the world into an eternal winter, but whatever, there are no more celts. 10/10, would start nuclear winter again.",1
"if youre looking for a more challenging, but slow paced strategy game with a huge amount of content. this is the game for you. probably the most complicated rts game ive ever played, but isnt that what makes it fun? :p you start off from an ancient civilization and move up to each era as you finish researching each breakthrough in our human history. (except for the future era) ;p this turned-based game will have you pressing next turn again and again even after saying okay, next turn im done. good luck and have fun with this game. :d",1
"great game but it will be nice if you get a new leader with units and a bonus everytime your first one reaches its death",2
"looking for a turn-based strategy game that is challenging and fun at the same time? look no further. seriously, by yourself or with friends over a voip server, this games fun. buy it. play it. enjoy it. by yourself or with friends. do it.",1
"too many hours in this game. just one more turn ;)",2
"it is a good game, i would recommend it to ages 10+.",1
"this game is ing addicting... i cant stop playing, fckin get it",1
"still the best long-run turn based strategy game series in existance. this version perfects many of the issues the prior iterations had and adds a ton of new content.",1
"wooow david is bad at this which makes it fun for easy wins? 11/10 its ok",2
"this is my first civ game and let me just say that its made a great impression, me and my friend just havent stoped playing. dominating whole countries and having your whole empire crumble from one mistake. this game is a must have, the multiplayer is also a wonderful and fun time, just make sure you bring friends and a glass of water cause things can get stressful. 10/10",1
"when trade stops mysteriously  everything and build an army",1
"got this game for free, cannot stop playing until it finishes. 10/10.",1
"fantastic game the dlc makes it even better very worthwhile. it requires a lot of thinking especially at higher difficulty. there are some great mods for the game in the steam workshop and it is probably my favourite game of all time. i have put more than 500 hours into the game so far and am still playing.",4
"what are you doing reading these reviews!? buy the game already! its great!1!!1",1
"downloaded a mod, it caused the name of my empire to change depending on policies and religion, formed the islamic state of america, 8/8 would gandhi again",2
"this game is such a great game. in fact, i hate almost every rts and this is the only one i actually like. its not the hardest to know what to do, but also requires skill. especially when playing on the harder difficulties. this game is more of a political game, being that you get to start up you civilization with one city and continue to grow it until its an entire country. most problems with the game are solved within the brave new world expansion. if you enjoy rtss or would like to conquer other countries with giant death robots then this is a game for you.",1
"one of my all time favourite games to play on steam",2
"it was a bit tough to learn all the game mechanics, but once you get the hang of it, its a fun game, especially if you like history.",1
"excellent quality. binds all of the qualities a turn based strategy should have and near perfects them. fun to play, at times a bit slow but enjoyable regardless. riddled with some questionable design choices it is sometimes frustrating to play. all around a truly high quality game. rating: 96%",2
"this game is amazing. i recommend this game to anyone that loves stratedgy and other games in thatg area. note this, those that hate this game will be a dead civilization. it is unpredictable, interesting, and very, very fun. enjoy the game fellow gamers.",1
"amazing game! i have played it many hours on a different account, and finally got it on this one... cant wait to play again!!!!",1
"sid meier has made another masterpiece! this is a great game! say goodbye to productivity if you buy this game!",1
"i made this review to  of my friend, it didnt work, but ill post this anyways. p.s this is nice gaem, please buy love you xoxo",1
"i adore this game! a strategic powerhouse with never-ending possibilities (im serious)! beautiful graphics, well thought out gameplay ... the list goes on and on. 10/10 - a must have.",1
"unless you have to kill 8 hours a day at a job where you sit for a living, dont buy this addicting ing game",1
"an amazing strategy game for newcomers and civ veterans alike! theres so much customization available in this game. if thats not enough for you, theres some great stuff in the workshop that the communitys made. really great, addicting game!",1
"ruined my life, i now think in hexagons and have nightmares of impending attacks by napoleon and hiawatha. im planning on seeing a therapist if the addiction gets any worse, and by the looks of things... it will. help me.",3
"civilization v has evolved into a truly great game.",3
"i really like it! especially the part where i can nuke everyone, and backstab allies ;p",1
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",2
"very well crafted game. amazing fun to play, especialy with friends.",1
">boot up civ 5 at 7pm >multiplayer >host game >invite friends >start game >???? >5am",3
"absoutly an amazing game, really in depth, balanced and a great game to waste away weekends",2
"quite possibly the best strategy (in both rts and tbs) game i have ever played, and ive played a lot of those. this one takes the cake from under the noses of strategy game greats like age of empires, age of mythology, starcraft, the total war series, and of course, the previous games from the civ series. if you buy this game, be sure to get the gold edition for the best experience!",3
"sivhd es best gem i ever play this day. i heff lost of fun and i es still have fun. lost of game and lost of playable time mek for grate cheese sim 2017. if i pick my nose for best gem this year, sivhd definitely es best off all.",1
"best turn-based strategy game ive ever played! and i recommend it.",2
"if you are prone to addictions, do not buy this game. 10/10 would get addicted again.",1
"hell of a game -- one of the only games ive breaches 200 hours with. every new game is an entirely different challenge.",2
"a perfect time waster with a nice presentation. possibly the most welcoming game in the franchise. its recommended that you also get the 2 expansions. beware! its addicting as balls.",1
"when people discuss whether games are art or not, this is the answer.",4
"great game to start into the franchise even if youve never played previous installments. i would also recommend getting the expension as it fixes a lot of minor inconvenience from the main game. pros - interesting unique ability from each civ - smart different type of ai (conqueror passifism etc) - each game is different from the last playthrought - more to come con - once you become too aggressive, there is no redeeming yourself - no defense against certain things (ie : atomic weapon) - ai is smart, but single minded, they should change with time",3
"civilization is one of the best game that i have played and will ever play! it runs nicely on mac 10.7.5 and the game has so much to offer! i greatly recommend it to everyone! still a pity that the leader cutscenes are on minimum settings, which is unable to change on mac. still.. play this game, youll love it!",2
"fun to play by yourself or with friends, one of my favorite strategy games",1
"do like fun? do you hate yourself? you do now. this game is some sort of magical time sink that melts your exsistance away. it will be 3am before you realize how much time you put into it.",1
"great game! it is kind of a slow game for multiplayer but the single player gameplay is great. i would reccomend this to anyone.",2
"already played it 160hours, still playing the game. every game is different.",1
"yaa start way back in time with a settler and a warrior unit. 14 hours later, the sun is up and you are going to be late for work.......again. just....one....more....turn 20/10",4
"+rewarding. +infinite replayability, +best turn based strategy ive ever played. 10/10",1
"remember the good ol days of playing age of empires for hours on end, and still barely scratching the surface? well now imagine that you do the same thing but you havent even seen the surface yet. civ v is one of the best, and in-depth, strategy games ive played. its a classic example of oh ill just play for an hour or so and the next thing you know the sun is rising and youve been up all night declaring war and toppling empires. highly addictive, enormous fun, and multiplayer is brilliant, even locally. this game is worth whatever the price tag says.",1
"i have played this game for so long, but yet it does not get boring. you can keep on starting new games and it will always be different. with so many civilizations to play, it is almost impossible to get sick of this game. i highly recommend it.",2
"ive been playing civilization since the begining and i got to say that 5 is my favorite. it wasnt at first but after the gk & bnw dlc the game has really developed into a unique empire builder. so if you got money to throw down on the original version plus the dlcs get it.",3
"so much fun, multi-player is pretty good and they are releasing extras to make it better.",4
"i like this game. the hexagon map takes getting used to. but you cant set up as huge armies as in the last civ.. it has a way better gameplay",1
"so great. one of those time suck games - youll sit down to play for an hour and look up and the sun has just cleared the horizon!",3
"decided to purchase civ on sale after reading an article that placed it in the top 10 pc games you have to play. if you want a game with complex systems, 0 explaination but strangely addictive, this is the game for you. i find it extremely boring, but just played for 5 hours.",1
"do you like stategy games? do you like board games? well then look no further, friend. welcome home. civilizations 5th iteration is a great entry in this franchise and is addictive as it is fun. prepare to loose many hours. some may tell you this one is a weaker game than 4 or not worth playing without all the dlc. i am not really in that group. i had a lot of fun with the vanilla game. the expansions add depth to mid and late game stages and provide more options for victory, along with new civilizations (each which has its own perks). if you have even a mild itch for strategy games then press buy. also note this game is very moddable - all supported by steam workshop. which couldnt be easier to use.",1
"i love this game. its a game of stadigy where you have to control a city and make it the best you can and beat all the other players on the map before they come for you. allthough the orignal map is quite small, you can just turn the settings to a bigger map! i rate this game a 5/5 allthough it was missing some really good fitures out of civ 4, they made up for it by making it in the dlc. + the dlc is so worth it.",1
"civ 5 is an excellent blend of singleplayer and multiplayer. the singleplayer is fast paced and fun. it can also help you build skill in the game. the multiplayer is a great blend of backstabbing, friendship, and war. it is fun to explore different worlds and bring your civ to greatness and glory. overall, i give this game a 9/10. an excellent game!",1
"very fun and addicting for a while, then you start to realize the limitations of the game like its diplomacy and god awful ai after a few games. worth the money for sure though.",1
"this is a rather enjoyable game in the civilization series. i would like to see some non human empires added to it though (klingons, daileks ect). all in all a well rounded turn based strategy game.",1
"i love strategy games. civilization is the leader of the pack when it comes to turn based strategy games and civ v is a worthy successor to the series. the brave new world dlc is a must-have expansion - it feels like a new game, not just an expansion pack. enjoying the broad options with civilizations and their unique abilities allows for much replay. overall - the best turn based strategy game available.",1
"this game is unique in so many levels. they make all the leaders act the same as if in real life and every difficulty has a diffrent strategy that only trial and error can solve. will you be warlike? or cultural? or even a gleaming beam of hope of technological wonders can your civilization hold as you conquer barbarian nations. can your empire stand the test of time?",2
"this game is the pinnacle of strategy, just the feel alone of controlling an entire empire rises above all else. i must say some areas of the game could be improved like the ai but if you get bored of many subjects in the game there is always mods to think about. dlc is also something to think about, even though its the price of the game i feel that it adds many more hours to the game and is worth the money. ive been playing this since it came out and im still enjoying it, with many civilisations and playstyles to choose from sid meiers civilisation 5 is the complete turn based strategy game. 9/10",2
"wow so good what a strategies so many cities to make, lots kinds of people, simply amaze in what to do in it like vikings. so many ways to win like 5. slow to start but so addict. nice graphic. units cant stack like boxes, no staring contest ever again which are annoying. so much dimploatic relationship. so empire wow.",1
"your average civ game. gandhi has completed the manhattan project! quit game without saving. exit civ 5. exit steam. delete civ 5. delete steam. shut down computer. punch the screen in. break the computer with a hammer. throw the computer out of the window. burn the computer with a flamethrower. dance on the ashes naked. buy a plane ticket to india. go to a missile silo. launch a nuke. leave india. watch and laugh as the rest of the world pulverizes gandhis smug  face with nukes. kill yourself. alexander has won a diplomatic victory! come back to life. kill yourself again.",2
"this game is one of the best i have ever played, i have never been so addicted to this game! the interface is great, and the game includes loads of civs to play as!",1
"became friends with gandhi and didnt get nuked. love it.",1
"great game. fun without dlc, and dlc make it feel like a whole new game, or a whole new world (<----pun).",2
"this game is amazing! it is for sure my favorite strategy game of all time! the options of what you want to do with your empire is unlimited, you can conquer the world with an iron fist or let the arts flourish among your people. some things i would want to change but nothing you cant fix with a mod or two. i would definitely recommend this game.",1
"ive played basically every came in the sid meiers franchise. civ5 is a great installment, i like it better than civ4 especially with the brave new world expansion. i wish firaxis has spent more time on performance of the game engine -- it takes up a ton of system resorces especially in late game scenarios. but over all, really fun and has a good multiplayer experience although there are a few glitches.",1
"build a nice little city. then build another one. then build one to piss off other people. then rule the wrold. then realize that it is now thursday and you have miss 3 days and you still click next turn because you have a problem. yeah its that type of game",2
"fun game, laggy online, terrible ai, gutted a lot of features, needs $60+ of dlc to be playable.",1
"surpassing 250+ hours and counting, civ v is and will continue to be the greatest strategy game of all time. nothing ive ever come across can top the attention to detail, the vast number of playable nations, or the replayability of civilization v and ive played a lot of strategy games. theres a reason this is #1 on my steam list for games played. its outstanding.",2
"its like drugs in game form. superbly easy to get addicted to, insanely hard to quit and uncanningly easy to fall back into if you somehow managed to quit (its like gravity, all it takes is a push). on top of that, its extremely detrimental to your health and social life. 10/10, would give up life again.",2
"10/10 - i have to stay away from the game unless im willing to give up a week marathoning game after game because i cant bring myself to stop. just one more turn... *seven hours later* oh look, sunlight.",1
"fun turn-based strategy game that allows you to make friend or foe with the other leaders that are on the campaign with you. strike a trade, open your borders, or make war and steal their cities. watch out for barbarians.",1
"most addicting game ive ever played! i start a game and 8 hours will go by in what seems like a minute. you can play the game for hundreds of hours and never get sick of it. definitely worth the money!",2
"would love if there was a way to upgrade to gold or complete. i currently own civ v, gods and kings and brave new world. i dont really want to purchase all the dlc or re-buy the entire game.",3
"i absolutely love the civ games and the latest version does not disappoint!",1
"insanely addicting game.. and you can get it and the gods & kings xpac for cheaper via my gamefanshop than you can buy just civ 5 for on steam. the codes you get via my gamefanshop work on steam as well, here is the link:",1
"addictive and well made. cant wait for the next civ",1
"amazing game! very girpping and doesnt get boring at all. if you a are a statergy gamer who loves to play a game a different way each time - civ 5 is for you. civ 5 is very dynamic and no game ever plays the same way which is easily the most thrilling thing. if singleplayer isnt exciting enough for you then mulit-player will blow your mind. anything could happen, your empire could crumble in a few minutes or soar and destroy all other civilisations instead! a must need game for stratergy gamers!",1
"a very good game, but i must warn you. gandhis words are backed with nuclear weapons!",1
"this game is great, its a good way to just relax and watch your civilization progress with each decision you make, i rate this 4/5 for the fact that the game can be a bit slow paced at first, other wise, it is a damn near flawless game",1
"awesome game. first skirmish was 24 hours of playtime, and i enjoyed every minute.",1
"an rts that takes the major civilizations of earths history and puts them in a what if scenario. how would the huns fair if they were peaceful diplomatic people? or if ghandi was a horrible tyrannt? what if venice was in the desert? could they build a civilization to withstand the test of time?",1
"the city of yer boi has been founded. yer boi has grown! yer boi desires gold! yer boi is starving! yer boi has completed great wall of china! yer boi has completed petra! yer boi is ready for a new construction project. yer boi has adopted a religion! the enemy is near yer boi! yer boi can fire upon an enemy! yer boi is under attack! yer boi has been captured! 10/10 would yer boi play again",1
"awesome game! i play it all the time and it is an amazing pass-time for college. i cant afford all of the dlc, but im saving up for it, ive heard that its a complete game changer!",2
"great game, still playing for hours per week. still miss some of the features of civ4, like slave states, etc. could really use some additional diplomatic options (like demanding surrender, slave states). and what i havent encountered yet in this version, in older versions if a huge empire lost its capital, it split up in two adding a new nation to the game. would be nice if that feature was also introduced again, or in case of unhappiness for a long time, certain cities rebel and form their own nation (which is actually how many nations were formed).",2
"this game is ing fabulous. highly recommended. the gods & kings and brave new world expansion packs are a must have.",2
"a great game for stratgey fans, civ 5 on its own is much simpler than civ 4 so fans of the series will not like it however all the issues are addressed in both dlcs and they and a tone of content!!",1
"brilliant game, cant stop playing siince i brought it and just love being able to play it with all my mates :d",1
"if we were snails and not humans this game would be a good pace. alas.",1
"if you dont know or never played civilization yet, i strongly recommend you to stay away from it. it is highly addictive and will lead you to quarell with your family over it because you just spent too much time on playing it.",1
"an amazing game that gets better with each expansion",1
"a lot of thinking and hard descisions. each expansion makes the game harder yet more fun! tons of strategy and allways different playthrough then that last time!",1
"at this time, this game is priced as an aaa game title, when it is more of a deluxe mod of civ 5. it is also in more of a beta state than a finished state, with some glaring and a few shocking features not available. i would highly suggest waiting till several patches, and also several price drops happen before purchasing. after that, it may be worth the purchase and somewhat enjoyable.",3
"yup, lost many hours with this game! will be losing many more, too.",1
"as much replayability as tes skyrim (witout needing any mods) this game is seirously worth the money. the game is fun, and extremely coustimizable. only downside is that the dlc is expensive",1
"i spend more time on this than i do jacking off, and im a single teenage boy. 12.14/10",1
"ive spent a lot of hours on this game, and not one feels wasted. dlcs add lots of cool new features, so get them if you can. 10/10",1
"this game is wonderful if you enjoy strategically taking over the world",1
"not all sid meiers games are awesome, this goes for the civilization series as well. this one is a must-play if you like turn-based strategy games though. it is really interesting and offers a long play-time, almost never gets boring.",1
"fun as any civ game, and graphically beautiful, and as with any civ game, you can walk away without worry of explosions.",1
"i just love this game <3 i played all civilization games and i love all of them 9.5/10 thanks sid for this awesome game",1
"great game as long as you have paitence and dont quit like 20mins into the game. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- gods & kings is a great expansion adding religon, new units, new civs, espionage, new buildings, new tecs. five stars sid meier much better than the clustered insanity of alpha centari.",2
"civ v is by far the best of the civ games i have played. also i highly recommend the brave new world dlc.",2
"i really enjoy the coop of this game. my brother and i play as often as we can.",2
"have poured so many hours of my life into this game, definatley reccomend getting this game",3
"almost back to teh civ2 roots.. pretty dam good game",2
"this game is dangerously addictive. i really dont want to recommend this game but i have had some great moments whilst playing it. the early game is really engrossing. mid game a bit of a muddle late game a bit of a chore. but you will find that you consume yourself and your time learning the mechanics of the game only to discover that you are ultimately micro managing several sets of numbers. (hammers, beakers, etc..) trying to increase them bit by bit. 169.3 hour on civ 5 and that is nothing compared to others. life it too short for a game like this.",1
"played this game till 3am without realising the time. 10/10 will do again.",1
"an awesome game of strategy it can be diffiucult at times but is a fun all the same",1
"just the best game series ever. doesnt compare to civ 2 but heh, that was in the past!",2
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",2
"ya, i wen foll coltore an leik, won the gam as russia blowin up india becaus dey wer 2 meen an setle city neer me",1
"long-running franchise in turn-based awesomeness. do yourself a favor and get lost in this title for days, weeks, months, or like me, years. for some reason i have two accounts, each with a copy of this one.",1
"i will shove my culture so far up your butt that i can launch a spaceship to alpha centauri -realistic gameplay quote 10/10",2
"the only game where i can shoot down jets with arrows and destroy tanks with spears. 10/10",1
"its a fantastic strategy game and i have spent hours on different pcs playing it. highly enjoyable!!!",1
"it is a great statergy game, i would recommed to anyone who like to just sit down and play a game as i have played for 6 hours in a row before, in his also good on multiplayer as you can compete with your friends to win the title of great startergy master and overall ruler, i really enjoyed and i hope anyone else who get it does enjoy it to.",1
"fantastic game! good use of time and money! love it!",1
"when i was young i couldnt really get into turn based strategy because it felt like it took forever to do anything fun. as the civ series has progressed, theyve made it not only easier for newbies to get into, theyve also made the pacing very flexible, allowing you to play at whatever speed you prefer (still turn-based, of course). this game is a brilliant way to spend a few hours/days/weeks. be warned, when you start a game, you will experience the time travel effect!",3
"another great iteration in the civilzation series. plays like a civ game should. the workshop makes modding the game really easy so i can finally get those bridges across coastal hexs!",1
"very fun game, it is very easy to set up a game for multiplayer and singleplayer. i would recomend this for everyone.",2
"this game is literally incredible. get it or you are stupid.",2
"this game is just like the movie lincoln...really boring and goes on for ing ever.",1
"if you like your social life, but you want this game, you have to choose. you arent allowed both.",2
"pretty good but lacks innercity customization i would like",1
"love, love, love!! after you get going you wont stop.... either play on deity and get conquered on exactly 30 seconds or play on settler, and itll last for 4 hours. either way, loads of fun!!",1
"always invites you to play just one more turn.. and another..",1
"this game is amazing. it causes fights and friendships when playing with friends and it can rip friendships apart just by declaring war ahaha. grpahics are great, gameplay is amazing and you get to rule as gandhi, what more could you want?",1
"i tried to be friends with ghandi, but he nuked me, then stormed my capital from all fronts. 10/10 would get gangbanged by indians again.",1
"amazing game , id recommend it to anybody. one of the rts games around. a must buy",1
"i have played almost 180+hrs and would recondmend to almost anyone. if you get it you should pick up the gods and kings expansion (assuming it doesnt come with you verson) it just makes it a better game. i played without g/k once and nearly cried.",2
"built the eiffel tower in sparta, then found oil and the usa declared war on me. only 50% accurate. 5/10",1
"simply amazing. for people new to civilization, this is a very intellectual and complex strategy game that never seems to get old. one playthrough is fairly short but i come back to it about once per month and play another. you can also customize the games so much that every time the game is a little bit different and i would challenge anyone to beat it on its hardest setting. for fans of the civ series, i believe they keep getting better. graphics improvements are great but i like the unit and tech changes, i would highly recommend it. also, the leader screens are a lot more involved and interesting. sadly they removed the city view but have the city change dynamically on the map. they also removed the throne room. not sure how i feel about those but at least they put spying and religion back in, in the expansions. definitely worth the money.",1
"i like this game - i hadnt played any of its predecessors, but mac users should be warned that steam workshop is pc-only, so youll be on your own if you wish to add any player generated content. also, the game is very long and time consuming. a small-world scenario on quick can take 16-20 hours to play if you start in the ancient era. so i recommend it, but non-windows players should be aware that they get less than the windows players, which sucks especially since its not mentioned anywhere on the store page.",1
"simply brilliant! i think its much improved on civ iv, though many seem to disagree with me. improved a lot with the addition of brave new world - gods and kings was less impressive.",3
"sid meiers civilization v is an awesome improvement to the previous versions for long-time fans, but also has opened the door greatly for those that have not had the chance to play this line of games before. this is definitely one to check out!",3
"not my favorite turn-based strategy game, it was worth playing a few times, never really saw what all the hype was all about for this game, commanding forces, building structures, its not my cup of tea...",1
"when using raid foam to kill an ant colony outside of my house... as im spraying i pictured in my mind how the ants would deal with the fog of war and then went to play civ 5.",2
"this game is about as boring as they come. i would give this game away for free. ill toss in garbage/nuff said. {end turn}",1
"it is good, fun, exciting, and competitive, i would recommend anyday.",1
"for more than 20 years, a series of games civilization one of the best turn-based strategy.",1
"amazing strategy game thatll keep you playing for hours! i recommend you get the exansions as well, really add to the game!",1
"rule the world through dipolma.... wait a second. i can build nukes? nukes. and ghandi. and kicking the crap out of people who wont give you wine. 10/10",1
"this game is fun, but complicated to learn. i would recomend this to experienced strategy players who a looking for a nice smooth game. there is a variety of ways to play, and new map sgenerated everytime! it also has a very good multiplayer system, you can play with turns, or even at the same time! hanks for reading this recomendation, i hope you choose to buy this wonderful game.",1
"mother of god, you keep playing the game, sometimes taking morning until night. i lost sleep, i lost social abilities, i lost my health. its the best game ive ever played on a pc. :)",3
"fun on a bun on the run!!!! was attacked by barbarian gunships and died hard :d would play again :d",1
"awesome, and even more awesome way to game with mod enhancements. many ways to alter ur view of play.",4
"one of the best games i have played. it is addictive and will have you playing for hours straight. as someone interested in history civilization v is great.",2
"the best one of the series, best of its genre. and remember if you start playing, there is no return.... also this game made me learn more about history etc. then school did.",3
"well... over 18 hours into the game, and i barely have finished the tutorial and 1 game. need i say more ? alright. apart from its extensive playtime, the gameplay mechanics are excellent, the game is very easily modable (thanks to steam workshop, you can play campains on wwii, lord of the rings, game of thrones and so on), easy to set up as you want, a game can last (from what ive seen) between 10mn and 9+ hours, im sure this is even not a lot compared to what you can do. the mechanics are really easy to learn, but seem to be hard to master. and once you grow tired of being pwned by the computer, you can also get pwned by other players online ! thats wonderful. this game is truly a masterpiece, and should be in every strategy fan library !",1
"i payed $7.50 (steam os sale) and got more enjoyment out that than most $60 games. #praiselordgaben",1
"i downloaded it, a demo i think, then never played it.........went to play it, this pops up. hummm....maybe i missed my demo",1
"this game is ridiculously addicting. would definitely recommend as it is a great strategy game.",1
"over the years (and the expansions/dlcs) this game has become better and better. the one-more-turn-feeling is hard to resist and this game is as deep as it gets. i highly recommend getting the addons, as they really add to the experience. also, civ is often on sale, so that shouldnt be a problem. this game offers hundres of hours of gameplay youll love, if you like turn-based strategy games. by the way, i think that its kind of odd that people who spent more than 500h with civ claim that they cannot recommend this game",2
"very good game, its really worth purchasing (specially into any discount for the complete edition). excellent to play with your friends and amazingly enjoyable while single player.",1
"at first, i wasnt interested at playing a kind of strategic games. but after playing this, my whole opinion turned 180 degrees. civilization v is a great turn-based strategy game. sorry, i mean the best out there. civ v is just like a combination of chess but your opponent is more than one and you may win by diplomatic strategies. it makes your brain works hard to think about strategies for confronting other nations, and this is the only game that makes me insomniac. just...one...more...turn!",1
"thoroughly addicted to this game. the chance at a new, more epic start/finish keeps my friends and i from picking up old save games, but its a joy to play multiplayer and learn/conquer amidst good company... hasnt kept me from logging 500+ hours on single player, with more to come. i wish all the maps were fully customizable, but the community is immense and rife with free, custom content. 9/10: im looking at you, deity starting bonuses.",5
"this game is great if you like being systematically  by montezuma/ghengis khan/atilla the hun/napoleon. id recommend getting civ v and all expansions for the best experience. before all the expansions, it definately feels like an unreleased game.",2
"a great game that can have you engrossed for hours...even days. a bit tricky to pick up but once you have, itll suck you in!",3
"either you die as a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become a villian.",1
"this game can make you forget that free time has other uses. it is an incredibly addictive strategy game that takes away large portions of your life. a single game can take over eight hours to finish (on the standard speed, it can be set to go faster or much slower), so this isnt a game for the impatient. since its turn-based you can also easily do other things while playing, making it good for multi-taskers, though playing so casually will extend the already lengthy game times. i highly recommend both the gods & kings and brave new world expansions, as they both add a variety of new and interesting mechanics to keep each game unique. there are some issues, mostly with the multiplayer; mods are not supported in multiplayer - no matter how little they change the game - and the ai becomes much less interactive and therefore much more boring during multiplayer games.",1
"you can use nuclear weapons on barbarian pikeman units. 11/10 would be nuked by ghandi before i research nukes again.",1
"a real turn-based strategy, balanced your civilation with military, diplomatic, religion, technology and social policy. own the world, win the game.",1
"play as some of the greatest empires the world has ever seen and compete to become the the truely dominant civilization. finally become a ruler of a nation and decide the fate of millions by either causing a nuclear holocaust or by peacefully negotiating with other world leaders. lead armies to victory, or trade until you are rich. the choice is yours. just dont play unless you have an hour to spare.",3
"before getting this game: its really well made and in dept, only problem you might get into, is actually not having time to play it. the time it takesto play a match is like an hour to 8+hours, depending on setup options. pros: easy to get into, hours of play, save option, hours of replayabillity! cons: the amount of hours it takes to complete a game, dlcs are pricy, but worth the experience, from what ive tried. 10/10 game with expansions, state of art gameplay quality.",5
"one of the games i replay more than any ever. it has never been long off my installed list and now i just dont bother uninstalling it. has a few ling annoyances compared to some previous civ games (engine seems pretty messed up sometimes) however, it is more civ,. the formula still works and when you compare this with the disasters which have befallen some other classic series such as m&m heroes or the command and conquer games i am glad that civ at least has remained a consistently high quality experience.",2
"this long standing thinking mans game about building up your very own civilization from the b.c. era to modern times plays like an advance form of risk.",1
"gold edition doesnt include brave new world. very misleading. its a good way of ing me out of a few extra dollars though.",1
"one of my first games here on steam a year or so ago and i cant get enough. whenever im bored i can just start a game and before i know it, 4 hours have gone by. it is really addicting and while i enjoy early game the most (my mac has a hard time handling later game turns) it feels so good to crush all opponents or lead your civ into space.",2
"tl;dr version: civ v on its own: not just no, but hell no. civ v + brave new world: hell yes. this is a review for civ v on its own. no dlc. civ v is easily the worst game in the series. it seems unfinished. buggy. short on content. inordinately dumbed down. insultingly easy. its missing basic core features present in other civ games. ai civs will declare war for no reason. it sucks! but! the brave new world dlc makes it really good. why? it basically adds all the  that should have been present in the game at the very start. bnw also tweaks many of the insultingly crude features that obviously (likely intentionally) werent finalized in the core release.",3
"fantastic fun, you could spend hours playing it. inituive gameplay and tutorials to help you get started. the addition of famouse historical leaders also enhance the fun. at the moment im trying to recreate the great british empire! i highly reccommend !",1
"one of the best games ive every played. highly addictive. must play. if you think you wont like it, youre wrong. so very, very wrong.",1
"at first i was a bit alienated after playing the 4th game for so long, but after a time it grew on me and with the gods and kings expansion it ended up being definitly the best game in the serie so far.",2
"the only thing i would change about this game is the ai. when you set the difficulty higher, your enemies do not become smarter, they just get unfair advantages. if they got smarter when the game got harder, it would be much more interesting.",2
"once again proving that there is no more blood thirsty historical leader than gandhi.",1
"i play this way too much. this is a great followup for the civ franchise. the dlc is worth it at any price, but you still get a great game without the dlc. if you buy this, youll get used to the hours flying by.",1
"this is civ5, a game where you conquer people and nuke stuff. at least according to me. for the uninformed, its a hexagon-grid turn-based strategy with a focus on combat, diplomacy, city management, and hurling nuclear weapons at people. no story here, folks, you make the story yourself. +good visuals. +stupid amount of mods. +map editor and modding tools. +scenarios are pretty cool. -ai is irrational in terms of diplomacy. -multiplayer exists, but its pretty bad. -no story except for what you make.",2
"this is a great game. always enjoyable to play whenever your bored. dlc is great too.",1
"game play is solid, has instructions for noobs, and works great, even on old boxes",1
"got in this love/hate relationship with poland. i planned to spread islam to all four corners of the world, and yet he kept converting my cities. i was about to denounce him, but he kept coming up to me with lucrative offers and helped me fight attila. i wanted to hate attila for taking my goldmine with his great general, but my culture dominated his and i felt that hes like a brother to me. plus his army is huge. i ended up losing because of my indecisiveness. 10/10 would get into an abusive relationship again",1
"i recoment game for guys with addiction to drugs and chemics, these last will be easy song in compare to civ game",1
"really addictive game that will keep you up until the very early hours of the morning. at which point, you will promise yourself that this will be the last turn before bed, but you contiune until the sun pops up from over the horizon and there isnt any point in going to sleep anymore.",3
"great game fun to play, this was my first civ game and i love it! shame the dlcs are so expensive... but i recommend it to anyone who is thinking of getting this game.",1
"simply amazing piece of gaming entertainment. many hours of fun to be had with this one folks. no two games are the same, which is what makes it so good.",1
"i nuked the aztecs as an egyptian warlord. what other game lets you do that?",1
"this game, along with both the expansion packs, is as close to perfect as you can get. nuff said.",2
"after playing civ i, ii, iii and iv + expansions - this is one of the finest! little midgame inbalances though.",3
"its really strange that this game and civ iv are such different titles. the fundamentals are all there, but itll be a bit of a learning process comming to civ v over from civ iv. its still just as addicted as iv, but the aforementioned is something to keep in mind.",1
"i think this game is very good for new civ players",2
"civilization v is an amazing turn based strategy game in which the goal is to rule the world through battle, culture, science, or diplomacy. the new hexagonal grid tiles allow for much more interesting gameplay than the previous games in the series. the game allows the player to choose from a variety real civilizations, each with their own unique perk, unit, and building. while this game features multiplayer capabilities, the games take a very long time to complete, and take more than most people are willing to invest in a single session. if you do have a lot of free time, it can be very satisfying to dominate the world with or against friends. id very highly recommend this game, particularily in conjunction with its downloadable content and expansions.",2
"great game! best money spent on a game so far with this account.",1
"this game is time consuming. never start a game if you have plans in atleast 4 hours! i have no regrets though... my friends? maybe...",1
"at first i didnt tink i would like it.... but damn i can play this for hours",1
"highly recommend this game great to play with friends after getting all the main dlcs as the base game is not so great. however you need lots of free time to complete games.",1
"my favourite in the series and all in all an amazing game",1
"its fun fun fun and more fun. you will play the whole day and you will still want more siv.",1
"make sure you have no plans for a while... especialy plans to sleep; because they will not happen. one. more. turn.",1
"extremely addicting. great game. 11/10 needs more fedoras -ign",1
"it had its flaws when it first came out, mainly that it lacked depth and detail compared to civ iv. but like all civ games, they grow and grow and become more fun as time progresses. i feel at this point (actually since g&k expansion hit) that civ v is beyond any other civ in the past, and it makes it very dificult, if not impossible to play previous titles again.",2
"nuke other great powers as the aztecs and have the same workers for the past 10 thousand years.",1
"you cant play it for an hour, youll need at least 8 hours to complete a game. you can just hop in the game, no need to have played civ4 addicting",4
"while not as good as the civ4 series the most recent patches released are getting it there. the hexagon tiles and one unit per tile seem to provide a better combat experience than that of civ4 but almost ever other victory conditions seems less so. i do recommend it based on its own merits alone. it is a fun game and if you like civ games you will like it civ5. however, if you are looking for another civ4 with better graphics this just isnt it ... yet. =)",4
"this game is a must own for anyone who plays pc gaming.",2
"extremely addicting.if you hate gandhi yet want a fun game then do a custom single player game with no gandhis and med diff. invaded belgrade,nuked venice thrice and adopted fascism. gotc,game of the century.our kids and aliens shall look down upen this game and not shun it because of its greatness",1
"started playing it a week ago. i have a total of 26 hours, and my wife is giving me worried looks, so i have to say that this game is awesome. so many strategies and things you have to take into consideration, that i feel like im only scratching the surface.",1
"just got into the civ series with this game. as a new civ player, the single player content alone was worth buying the game. civ veterans seem to disagree on this based on other reviews i read. i let my brother try it and he got hooked. i woke up to him still playing the next morning, so i got it for him for and unlike others, we havent seen any multiplayer issues, yet (hopefully this continues). i think its important to note that i found this game looking for a new rts and it is filling the role quite nicely even though it is turn based and not filled with the fast paced battles i am used to. if anything, the slower pace and individuality of each unit makes it more fun than your everyday rts.",2
"i am an avid player of strategy games like age of mythology and age of empires, but when i saw this game i thought i wouldnt like it, but i changed my mind quickly after i got it. the gameplay is great, the endless playability is amazing, the online support is fantastic and the fact that you dont have to have a 10 ping internet connection to be able to play well since it is a slow turn based game. the game comes with multiple expansion packs that add countless more hours of playtime to your account and mods are completely optional. i rarely find myself playing with mods due to the endless replayability of the game. 10/10",2
"just one more turn....... if you havent ever played any of the civilization series, then i must recommend you get one of them some time soon. they may seem complicated at first, but with many different ways to win using different strategies, short or long games, different map types, good dlc, many different civs to choose from etc, it is really rewarding in the long run. civilization iv is pretty damn good too. enjoy",3
"shouldnt prompt me every single time for which version of directx i want to run. unskippable videos when the app finally does launch reminding me its 2k games and other junk. mandatory click to continue screen about online ratings is pointless. steamcloud saves do not sync between mac and windows. this is why i bought the game.",1
"savior game. when you get bored play this game. when you get depressed play this game. very good game. caution its addictive :d",1
"im not the best at this game, but its super fun and addictive. youll get sucked into a vortex. stay away.",1
"greatest way to kill time...if you have days to kill that is! its amazing.",1
"if you are a civilizatoin fan this new installment is a must have. great graphics, new units, new civics to use, and much more.",1
"spectacular game, though it does have its fair share of flaws. single-player experience is second to none as far as turn-based strategy gaming is concerned. 4/5",1
"i am writing this becasue i want a badge and feel socailly responsable to get it also i liked te game",1
"koreans arent as advanced as they are every game as they are in real life.",1
"i am not a great lover of turn based games, you heard me not! you have heard brilliant reviews on this game from the turn based veterans of the gaming world. but you sir are not them! you are looking at this game that came out years ago and are wondering maybe i should give it a shot, to see what all the fuss is about. well take my review as this, this game is pure cocaine, it is so addictive it should be labelled as a drug by the fda. like a said before i am not a fan of turn base games, but this game turned me, it is worth the price and i will play for many more hours, and if you get bored 40 hours in. (if thats possible) add a mod or two to change the game up completely. it will never end for me. i have found the game that will more than likely die with. just... one... more... turn...",1
"also known as barbarian simulator 2013 one of the most amazing games ever 9999999999999999999999999/10 would use in everyday life",1
"i thought games like this wouldnt be something for me, but i played two games so far, and even tho i got my  kicked by gandhi, im hooked now.",1
"good gameplay, like this game, i more like age of empires, but this one is good tooooo.......................... 9.5/10 recommended",1
"this game is a great statergy game. it is hard to pick up, it will take practice but once you know how to play youll be able to play. i highly recommend this game",1
"definatly worth it for 8 bucks if you enjoy turn based strategy, or for that matter any of the other 4.",1
"i was a bit skeptical to jump into something thats notably complex. however, the interface, tips and tutorials as you play are great assests and make the transition much easier than expected. im now a huge fan of the game and purchased the expansions days after completing the purchase for the standard version. dont be intimidated. trust me!",1
"a great way to kick back, relax, and have lots of random discussions with your friends.",1
"get the brave new world expantion if you want to play this game. it makes it so much better.",2
"i highly reccomend buying this game because i have only played for a few hours but i am practically addicted to it and im looking forward to buying beyond earth",1
"civilization is a series i have probably put so many mindless hours into, by myself and with friends. the series is legendary and in my eyes the best strategy series in existance. the fifth entry has its ups and downs, but with gods and kings (the first expac) the game begins to match the scale as the third and fourth before it. balance is getting there and the overall changes it makes are superb. i love the hex tiles versus the square tiles of the first, and removing stacks is a very risky but rewarding move. overall it gets a 9.5/10. if you liked any previous civ pick this up but dont forget gods and kings.",2
"this game is perfect for those who love tactical games",1
"this game will have you addicted for hours. soon you will have no life. 10/10 great buy!",1
"its a good game, aka good setup,good gameplay and.....yeah,just play it already will ya",1
"i find this game to be extremely captivating. i cant seem to stop playing it in my free time. it can be as easy or as challenging as you would like it to be. wrap it up with the sdk tool, and you can create a scenario with nearly endless possibilities. its definitely worth the investment.",1
"great game, excellent strategy based game. although what brings it down is its bugs, and that the developers are trying to milk the consumers of their money. seriously... i speak for everyone, just stop...",4
"great great great!!!! unlimited hours of gameplay and fun :)",1
"spent way to much time playing this game, definitly recommend",2
"this game annoy me just gut ask by rome if i could help them kill germans and i say oki but he had to wait 10 rounds so i could be ready they 10 rounds pass and im haf way down to germany and then rome decleare war agianst me insted of germany the computer have no problem whith attacking you from behiend whith out warning then you kick their  and they want peace you refuce and take the capital and some how they make peace whith out you know it and you have to wait and in the mean time the computer talks bad about to the other contry saying you are the bad guy so they also wanna attack you you never know if they are your friend or they wanna attack you dislike",1
"great strategic game. some wierd bugs, but i guess my biggest complaint would be how mch the expansions cost...",1
"this game is amzing!! hands down, it is one of the best strategy games out there!!",2
"the biggest sink time ever...never play this game when you have something else to do. the one more turn comercial is more of a real ad than a joke. this game is too addictive.",1
"i cant even describe how amazing this game is!!! if you like history, alt. history or just having power, this is the game for you!",4
"the game is pretty good and insanely addictive highly recommend if you enjoy a good strategy game 10/10",1
"this one time barbarians took my settler the very first round so i lost instantly........its very fun.",1
"tis a nice casual game most of the time.......until everyone desides to hate you for attacking on city state then its personal",1
"this is a good beer and pretzels, game; but it is not a true civ, imho.",1
"i think its a great strategy game! i played this for hours! i highly recommand buying this if you like strategy!",1
"beware: playing this game may cause you to lose countless hours. brilliant game, hugely addictive and made even better with the expanssions.",2
"all time favorite game, ive palyed for hundreds of hours always on huge and have yet to finish a game, but its about as perfect as a game has ever been to me. if you like strategy with actual diplomacy and trade, this game with all of its expansions accomplishes it.",2
"great game for anybody, definitly worth your money",2

"this game is amazing. its one of those games that never gets old. wacth out though as youll think that 1 hour has gone by, but really have :)",1
"never played any sid meiers civilization before but this one looked fun so bought the complete pack cause saving $99 on it. 4 hours of gameplay yet and still dont have any idea whats going on but i can feel the incredible fun. 11/10.",1
"its a good game overall only problems are that its hard to finish games due to connection issues and the players themselves",3
"buy this game. amazing, and very fun. but you should buy the gold edition upgrade later on after youve bought the game, unless you wanna pay $50 dollars getting it all together.",1
"my all-time favorite franchise. i never get bored with this game. this is my fall back game with i dont feel like playing anything else. this is a must have game for any serious gamer.",3
"amazing game,and the expansions improve it alot to",1
"ghandi shoved an atomic bomb up my butt ghandiwillwreckyou/10",1
"great fun, very addictive, make sure you have plenty of time when playing this game as you will keep telling yourself just one more turn which can go on for hours before you realise. great fun on multiplayer as you attempt to out-do your friends economically or technologically or aid them against their enemies, or, even become their enemies.",1
"this is a fantastic game. i have been playing civ for over a decade...and this is so far my favorite in the series. i have had many late nights. just one more turn....",2
"fantastic game, only gripe with it is the ammount of time you can lose in one setting to it",1
"great game and i love the game when i play with friend like 3v3gandhi style 10/10",1
"this game is a huge time-sink, and for all the right reasons! each game you play, wether multiplayer or against the excellently done a.i will provide hours upon hours of strategic challenges and an excellent system of micromanagement. with the several different victory conditions and tons of different civilizations to play (each with their own unique bonuses, units and buildings) this game caters for every possible strategy. definitely a recommended game - civ 5 is a great play for veterans of the series and for newcomers.",2
"the intro animation was breathtakingly beautiful. so much so, that i still let it run completely before i start to play the video game itself. not just the animation, but the music and voices! astounding! okay, now about the game. i love it!!!!! needless to say, ive spent hours playing it. i havent done this in ages. its just...mesmerizing, gripping and just plain fun! this isnt the first sid meier game ive played. the first one was for the atari st platform, way back in the late 80s, a wwii submarine sim. i highly recommend this game. i hope there is a part vi.",2
"looking to kill some time? how much time you got? wanna be locked in your room, in the dark, blankly staring at a computer screen for literally a week straight?! buy this game! its wonderful, really! five stars.",1

"i freaking love this game. ps russia is the best leader",1
"if youve ever wanted to be a tyrant and steamroll countries for no reason but the fun of it, this is the game for you",1
"used this game to help me study for a history exam. got an f. apparently, the mongolians didnt wipe out the chinese with a nuclear weapon. teacher also says george washington didnt invent and establish judaism as the world religion. 10/10 taught me world history, teachers got their facts worse than wikipedia",1
"addictive tb thats fun and challenging! tons of maps, different cultures and great music! so many great things to try on the workshop as well to keep the game fresh! if you enjoy tb games this one is worth the buy!",2
"great game. very addictive. very huge. very, very fun. too many achievements. must declare more wars.",1
"i learned some great life lessons from this game that i can apply to my own life. 1. dont trust ghandi 2. uranium = thermonuclear war between the aztecs and germany 3. everyone wants your crabs 4. dont be distracted by catherines rack when discussing war reperations 5. stealth bombers = <3",4
"i havent left my house in three days because of this game. 10/11 would strongly recommend",1
"i typically dont like turned based strategies but there is something wrongfully addictive about this game! you will lose your soul!",1
"amazing game; best turn-based strategy game out there. both dlcs are worth it, especially brave new world.",2
"this game has destroyed my social life and caused my friends to alienate me. 10/10",1
"one of the most addictive games ever. beautifuly made with great graphics and superb playability. many different settings available make civ v challenging even after thousands of hours spent in it. just a little slight improvements would make this game perfect. rating: 9.5/10",5
"i made a religion called nazism and then proceeded to spread it to poland i thought it was the reich move.",1
"amazing love it especially with friends such a treat to play",1
"admittedly, it becomes same-y. admittedly, it becomes constrained after some time of your empire growing. and, admittedly, the ai isnt up to scratch. but the strategy that invades your purview on the higher settings sets you up for a realistic battle for conquerance. whether that be via war to win the world, victory in science, victory in diplomacy, victory in culture or standing the test of time, it does to great lengths introduce an abundance of components and options that really lack in some adversary total war titles (i know ill hold preference over this game from now on versus imperial glory: one of the games that got me into the pc platform in the first place). id recommend, especially more so as it grows on you as a pastime or interactive board game of sorts. but perhaps buy it in a steam sale, or whenever its on offer.",1
"love this game...always have always will. not all that hard to pick up and play on low level difficulties but like most games if you go in blind you will probably not get all you want out of this game.",1
"you spend 3 hours doing nothing but clicking next turn with the occasional ordering of a unit. for added fun after 3 hours you get nuked by ghandi. on multiplayer you and all your friends can hit next turn together for 3 hours before getting nuked by ghandi. 10/10",2
"i absolutly (pretty sure im going to spell stuff wrong but whatever) love the gameplay and the history aspect of the game. people who like turn based stratagy games like xcom: enemy unkown would really like this game exept in civ you have more control of everything that is happening unlike xcom. i bet some of you guys watch youtube vids on this and look at it thinking it is a very complex and hard to understand game but it is a lot simpler than it looks. i have over 100 hours on this game and i have even gotten some dlcs. i even got some of my friends to get the game and play with me. in all i find it a really fun game and i give it a 10/10.",2
"nice slg game very deep content , worth to bought it !!",1
"highly addictive. played every civ from 1 up to 5, and this is my favourite. tech tree is familiar if youve played the others but there are new additions, plenty of wonders to build, and the soundtrack is amazing and quite varied. if i had to make one complaint it would be the length of some of the battle animations, if someone attacks your city with several bombers you might as well take 5 and go for a snack, theyll still be circling and diving and bombing by the time you get back.",2
"civilization v is an amazing turn based strategy game in which the goal is to rule the world through battle, culture, science, or diplomacy. the new hexagonal grid tiles allow for much more interesting gameplay than the previous games in the series. the game allows the player to choose from a variety real civilizations, each with their own unique perk, unit, and building. while this game features multiplayer capabilities, the games take a very long time to complete, and take more than most people are willing to invest in a single session. if you do have a lot of free time, it can be very satisfying to dominate the world with or against friends. id very highly recommend this game, particularily in conjunction with its downloadable content and expansions.",2
"been so long since ive actually played these games way back when. but ill never got sick of games like this one, love it.",2
"its alright. it dont help that i forget to do something awhile playing this game start at 11am and finished at 5am 10/10 its worth the money and the time because you will lost time what you are doing i would say get the dlc as will",3
"super addictive game! im glad i finally decided to purchase!",1
"amazing. you will play for hours and not even notice.",1
"a massive time killer, well worth every hour given over. civ 5 is a solid advancement to the series. the expansions are fantastic, though it can take awhile to adjust to new features. overall a solid investment.",2
"im playing this using my laptop with only the intel hd 4000 so i always play with all the animations turned off. in fact, i always play only using the hexagonal grid map yet i still hours and hours and hours of fun. this game is really that good and this comes from a guy who mainly prefers (action-, j- or just normal) rpgs. the last time i played and enjoyed an rts was aoe ii, waaaay back then. if i could only mention one or two things that absorb me in is the background music, especially when were talking about the middle eastern and the east & south-east asian themes. i love em! not only the music though, the tech tree, policy, units, buildings... there are tons of things that you have to decide, more importantly in the first 100/200 turns, and that what makes this games replayability is unmatched. seeing that this is the only game which ive clocked in for 80+ hours, id rate it 10/10",1
"after months of patching away bugs this game has become really good",4
"if you are looking for a good civ game, look no further. i may catch some flak for this but beyond earth really seemed to tank in ratings and reviews are not very positive and rather mixed but leaning towards negative.",1
"civilizaton v is one of the best strategy games i have ever played i played over 300 hours of it and i still have more to learn i highly reccomend playing this game",3
"after 1,000 more hours. let me tell you this, its good game.",5
"the best game for those who want to take over the world. civ 5 is much more tactical and strategic than its predecessors, requiring players to have the mindset of a general rather than a mathemetician. a wide variety of civilizations and cultures to play, with highly customisable, randomly generated maps forces players to adapt strategies. mod support for civ 5 is extensive, with always something new to try. i highly recommend getting all of the expansions, because they add so much more to the game and make it a truly amazing experience.",2
"easily my favorite strategy game. hours upon hours of enjoyment, great dlc, and satisfying victories make this game worth the money.",1
"i am very disappointed with this game. there appears to be some convenient glitch within the software that conspicuously happens when the game is losing terribly. my version of sid meiers civilization v stops working and shuts down almost every other day and sometimes multiple times a day. it happens most often after i have delt a devastating blow in the game that significantly benefits me. i have invested many many hours in this game and if this is the products design then i say this was a bad investment of my money and my time. i would not buy this product again. sincerly, bs",2
"a new clothing for the old fashoned civ. nice gameplay, maybe a little easier respecting to previous chapters; tons of fun with friends in mp; no evident bugs; you must get the version with all dlc, its kinda having a different game. recommended! ps i payed 25 and it definitely worth it!",1
"simply one of the best strategy games of all times! its just too addictive! and to the newcomers, buy it! you wont regret!",1
"loved the game - played them all and this is second only to civ 4",4
"gam is fun, wold reccomind this 2 ppeople out ther. -suggestionz: kim jong-un dlc : adolph hilter dlc if u c dis, show 2 gayben, plis. this gaem is r8 8/8 m8 (i mastrb8)",1
"great game so differnt empires so many differnt so many ways to play your game could turn around with deal that was not thought through",1
"time flies in this game, i need to buy diapers to conquer the world",1
"in combination with gods and kings + brave new world, this is the best civ experience ever!",2
"what are you doing reading this review, you should be buying civilization 5 and all of its game changing expansions! if you dont know what civilization is then you are sad on such a deep level. but, let me show you the light to lead you out of your ignorant ways. this game is the most beautiful piece of strategy than man kind has created so far. you take your group of loyal but hopelessly stupid and simple cavemen throughout the ages and eventually into the future were you drop nuclear warheads, barter for the fate of the world, and host the most splenderous wonders the world has seen in your civilization. see what i did there, i put the name of the game in the description. go ahead, buy it. if you feel that all this seems overly complicated or grandeous, then you are correct and if you turn away from the game because of that, then you are as simple as the cavemen described above.",2
"it is very good after you have been taught how to play it by a friend but not as good as age of empires",1
"i started playing this when i was 19 and didnt leave my computer for anything. ive only just finished my first game and it appears the human race has been whiped from the face of the planet and the seamonkeys now control the planet. great game.",1
"great strategic game. strongly advise trying the demo.",2
"i played for many years the civ 3 , but civ 5 is the best of the series in my opinion!!!",1
"great game if u have enough time takes a while to finish but is so fun and one of my favorites",1
"there are several reasons this is a great game: first of all, it looks nice. but what really makes it great is that its easy to learn and play for a beginner, but an experienced player will still be challenged once he knows the ins and outs of the game. the game is turn based, so you can easily walk away, and yet you still click the next turn button, because it is terribly addictive! it is an absolute pleasure to watch your empire grow from one little village to a large, sprawling empire that dominates the world... or maybe you will choose to focus on just a few cities, and become the cultural centre of the world? and thats the best about the game: you decide everything yourself!",3
"great game. with the expansions there are many different civilizations to play as.",1
"this game is awesome. i played for a year thinking that i had all the expansions until i realized brave new world had come out a year earlier and it had snuck right past me. brave new world makes the game even more awesome. the game is so much fun, my only grip would be that the multiplayer is a bit laggy, and i wish i could own my own dedicated server for the game,",2
"one of the best strategy games i have played in a long time i would get it if you are a big fan of strategy 9/10",1
"i just went outside for the first time in a week after purchasing this game. 10/10",1
"dont start this game. your life will be gone. have buried man years playing various version of civilization over the years.",2
"with gods and king and brave new world this is probably the best turn based strategy games out there. the vanilla version isnt that good but with all the expansions you can get easily a couple of hundred hours worth of fun. with a great multiplayed and a unique and relatively large roster of countrys you will enjoy this. and its not too complex and overwhelming unlike some paradox games",1
"brilliantly fun game, just play it now! ghandi gets nukes!!!!! nukes!!!!!",1
"so deep so amazing. in my first game of brave new world, i guiled my way into the position of head of the world congress, renamed it the unholy satanic confrence of glorious byzantium, forced the world to accept satanism as the official world religion, watched as the various populations of the world adopted my cultures rock music and art against the wishes of their leaders, and eventually was asked by the whole of the earth to step up as leader of world!!! god ing damnit i love civilization v.",4
"would be a great game if it actually worked!!!! constantly crashes on loading screen!!!! dont waste your money",1
"i have been playing civ since the first dos version and i own every iteration of the game since, including now - beyond earth. civ for me is the gamers game - like chess - its open ended, always different, challenging and educational too ! - the interface is stunning. this is the only game that has kept me up all night long to day break - where still i just have to click - one - more - time .......",2
"i absolutly love it!! just such a superb commbination of stratagy, history(sort of) and city domination. in my opinion brave new world has just made civ 5 even better with the addition of great people, better trading, and more civs.",1
"great game! i usually spend 6 hours playing per session. i can never stop playing!",1
"a classic turn based strategy game that tests your wits. from barbarian raids to full scale wars, and from warriors to giant death robots, civilization 5 will test you in every way imaginable. i highly recommend this game.",1
"you know im the type who would never touch a strategy game. this game however changed that completely, and this is honestly the most played game in my library. i definitely recommend this to new people to the genre and pretty much anyone else looking to have fun for countless hours.",1
"civilzation v is one of if not the best turn based stratergies ever. not only does it include difficult choices that have a direct impact on empire but it also opens up a whole new world of imagination where you can create and mould the world as you see fit diplomaitcaly or forcefully. create your own alternate reality today and buy this game. 10/10",2
"i have always been a fan of civilization and this is the best one so far. it sucks they only added religion through dlc but atleast its there. this is definitly a fun strategy game with some serious replay. multiplayer has always been my focus when dealing with civ. the multiplayer is fantastic and i have spent countless hours struggling against my friends and others online. the base game itself was weaker than i wanted it to be but with the addition of the major dlcs such as brave new world there has been much added to the game that makes it feel whole.",1
"i never used to like strategy games all too much, specifically turn based ones. i found them too boring to keep me interested. but i suppose my taste in games has matured a bit since i would have to say this game is pretty good. granted practically any decent game in which you rule an empire gets my approval by default, but this is genuinly a good game. i have no gripes in particular and nothing to point out that i find amazing, its just good. i wouldnt sugest you pay the $60+ for it though, wait for it to be on sale or find some other cheaper way to acquire it.",1
"addictive doesnt begin to cover this game, especially if youre playing with friends. the amount of time youll accidently spend simply by losing track of time is astonishing. worth every hour.",1
"civ 5 is one of those different games, you know your just bored of playing a fps and youre like oh! i feel like i want to play a game that is actually not a fps!, and thats were civ 5 comes in through the door and punches you in the face and is like what the  man, why does no one like me and everyone only plays fps games and im like because no one has no ing clue on what the history was for the japanese. the end",1
"great way to make huge chunks of time disappear. 9/10 - some ai annoyances but other than that this is a great game.",1
"the only game where my internet will support online play, it being fun is just a bonus.",1
"the base game, when first released, was pretty tame compared to the much loved civ 4. gods and kings (gold edition) made this a good purchase, brave new world brings it up to the standard weve come to expect of the series. some pretty big changes in this installment, including hex based maps and the end of the stack of doom, albeit replaced with the blob of doom in some instances.",1
"in a world where gandhi nukes you and atilla the hun sells you crabs, there are no downsides. 10/10",1
"+1 brave new world and gods and kings make the game better.",1
"this game is well made, awesome graphics, decent ai, and so many options for ccustomizing your experience!",2
"one of the best 4x games on the market. with all the expansions it is amazing, without them, its still fun, but you are missing out on a lot of features.",3
"a very nice and enjoyable game. but my favorite best of the series remains civ2.",1
"great rts that has different ways to win. deffinatily would see myself investing many hours into this game.",1
"this is a fun entertaining game bilt for people that love civilization based games.",1
"hours and hours of fun... just make sure you have hours and hours to play it. you can save at any time, but its one of those games youll intend on playing for 30 minutes, and instead staying up for 3 hours with it.",1
"play this far too much! love it, always have. plenty of detail, gameplay. graphics as you would expect. the whole game is nicely polished but what i love the most is the amount of mods and stuff available in the workshop, pretty much change the whole game. 9/10 (looking forward to the next installment)",2
"best multiplayer ever. we do not need stability, only bugs, only hardcore!",1
"what an awesome game! clear 6-8 hours out of your day for a multiplayer game though!",1
"simply an incredibly engrossing game. compared to rival series such as total war, civ 5 is wonderfully accessible; the interface ensures that youll never miss available actions by queueing them, and the at-first complicated map is quickly made understandable thanks to a comprehensive encyclopedia and advisor system. while i cant comment on the accuracy of the language the world leaders speak, they are all visually well represented, having clear, fun animations when you decide to trade with or declare war on them. the soundtrack is suitably evocative of the various world cultures, and a gamut of settings for maps and variables ensures the even if you tire of the unique scenarios or the main game, there is always the option of creating custom matches. strongly recommended for anyone who enjoys historical and/or nation simulation games.",1
"great strategy game if you like turn based games that allows you the choice between different victory types. more fun when played against human players as opposed to the ai in my opinion as the predictability is much lower but there are a large number of options and player mods to help change the game up if it starts to feel a bit stale. a really good pick up if you can catch it in a sale for around 5 - 10.",1
"dont play this game with antis507 he is a crazy paranoid warmonger if you see him in a multiplayer game: run for your life. anyway nice game 9,8/10",2
"one of the greatest games of all time, a true masterpiece. it manages to harness the wonder and awe or human history whilst presenting it in a ridculously fun game. 10/10",4
"for the first time i can relate to why contrys still are mad at eachother after dacades, very good game. both singel and multiplayer. very addictive ones you start its prety possible you will be in for a 8h gaming sesion",1
"a huge fun game, that is one f the smartest toughest things to master. would tots recommened.",1
"this game is amazing. all the civilizations are great and the game provides endless fun because you never really need to stop playing a world.",1
"as a guy who sucks at strategy games, i was surprised to see me wasting 60+ hours (and counting) on this! try it. even if youre not into the strategy category. just... one... more... turn!",1
"if you love strategy games, ths is the game, is fun, worth every dollar. :)",4
"new to the civilization series. played it for 8 hours on the first day.",1
"ive learnt a lot of history playing this. ive also learnt to misspell civilisation.",2
"this game is one of the greatest games you can possible play, you will play it for hours on end and form a civilization based on your own needs and play style. this game will bring out the best of yourself and others, and also the worst. give this game a shot, trust me.",1
"fun edit: was fun multiplayer has been ruined on oct. 27th by devs latest update. the devs didnt even admit to it untill almost a month later, and only deep in a random forum post. possibly the worst dev teams public relations ever. so well over a month later and no fix yet they sell the game in steam store and make no mention of it. **buyers beware!** this is what you will get when you buy this. multiplayer is broken. so for single players its great fun. *****edit #2 : after a month and a half, quietly they let loose a hotfix for the multiplayer problems they created, very poor customer service, great game though.",3
"this game is worth the buy, i have never played such a game like it. it is just amazing",1
"best strategy game. so many options, multiplayer, great graphics, mods etc. expensive dlc though. 9.5/10",1
"im afraid one day ill be drinking out of a water fountain and someone will slam my head down.",1
"one of the most addicting games i have ever played!!! i highly recommend this to anybody to loves strategy games! 9.5/10",2
"holy shucking fit its amazing... dont be a sprogedy crotch waffle and buy it you  :p",1
"far to many hours played on this game - always fun to play though",3
"play dis  ma n1gg4, kick some , launch some nukes, take over some other civilizations, pillage & plunder, or have peaceful relationships with other civs and swipe them in a cultural or science win... 9.8/10 multiplayer can be buggy...",2
"fun game, though there are some features that are just annoying, or seem relatively useless. perhaps just because i dont understand everything about that feature yet.",1
"best in the franchise, best in its genre. civilization v is one of my favourites games ever made. its biggest issue is how addictive it is. but hey, they say that time enjoyed is not time wasted, right? 10/10",2
"a great strategy game. its different enough from age of empires to make it a unique and refreshing take on this style of game. youll wonder where the hours went after playing a session of this. there are multiple ways to win and hundreds of moves to be made. if you fire up a game today, dont expect to get anything else done until tomorrow.",1
"one of the best games out there, in my opinion. i find myself able to play this for hours without getting disinterested.",1
"ever since i got this game, i have almost completly dedicated my life to it. countless hours have been spent building up a civilization, just to have it wiped out, so many games won and lost, civilizations rise and fall. i havent been able to do a single productive thing! this game is too adicting, i havent eaten for days, i cant even remember the last time i slept. i... i cant feel my legs anymore, it has been so long since i have moved. please, someone, anyone, i need help. this game, will be the end of me, tell my family... i lo... 10/10 i highly recommend this game.",1
"easily the most imerssive sim/rts out there. never will you experience on any other game, the unique circumstances with friends that you will run into while playing civ v. just throw your money at the screen already because i cant do this game justice. you just have to play yourself.",1
"this game is awsome i love every aspect of this game i love this game i havent played a turned based game in a while",1
"fantastic game and very addictive howerver, civilization v is too expensive on steam. bring down the price a bit. prices range from just 7.50 up to 15 on various other sites. (jungle).",1
"most complete and compelling game in the series, the add-ons and patches fixed just about anything i had to complian about over the years",1
"10/10/10/10 best tbs game ever. but i only have one problem with this game: ghandi",1
"its a good game overall. interesting and can be fun if you like history or turn-based strategy games. the leaders scene are quite impressive and improve from the previous civilization games. also, with the new dlc, this game sure is going to be a lot more fun! a recommmended game to everyone who likes to learn history, spend their free time or even just for fun. :)",1
"this is a great game and if you do not own it yet you should heavily consider picking civ 5 up. strongly recommmeded for edless hour and replayability. what are you waiting for?",1
"good ol civ. soon it will be cheap to buy, so dont hesitate and give it a try!",1
"we all know that feeling when another civ put a city in your spot and you nuke all the citys in the game 2000 years later",2
"great game with the expansions. very gamey, not simulationist. needs more mods.",2
"i had to stop myself at 19 hours but this game will make you lose sleep if you start playing before you go to sleep.",1
"if you want to kill yourself, this game is perfect for you! if not, i dont know.",1
"i cant stop... this games a tad bit too addicting. you can win with science. yay...",1
"pretty good game, and the dlcs are a must in my opinion. it got a little boring, but i kept getting back into it, lots of things to do, and different ways to play. especially fun with friends!",2
"seems fun, i would definitely like to wish anyone who buys this game this simple phrase. good luck getting away from it.",1
"its an extremely fun and addictive game that gets really into the gameplay as well as the ability to play as one of the great leaders youve heard or read about also makes it one of the top notch games there have been",1
"10/10 spent many hrs taking over the world... its oddly satisfying to wipe out an entire civilization and then move on to the next one!",1
"a 10000% historically correct game with realistic ai, particuarly impressed by the danes being complete .",2
"great game. very addicting. not sure what all the complaining is about, i love the streamlined ui and hex tile system.",1
"lost hours of my life to this game in a matter of 2 weeks.",2
"dropped out of school and started living in my parents basement 10/10",1
"this game can literally turn your 10 minutes, into 2 hours without you knowing it. absolutely recommended, assuming you can repel the just one more turn spell of this game.",1
"very good stratergy game, one of the best ive ever played, lots of variety and content 10/10",1
"civilization is one of the best video game franchises ever, and this is arguably the best version of the game.",1
"what can i really say about this game but... wow. one of my favorites. 119 hours in as of the time of this review",1
"just doing this for the badge. im terrible at this game, but its pretty dope.",1
"i gotta say if youre married this is a really good game to get your spouse into! great for couples!",1
"r8 goot gam. it can be plenty fun, even for people who arent vets of the series (me) and who arent turn based strategy buffs (me). it feeds you gameplay elements and things to think about as you go on, so every new game doesnt bog you down with a million things to manage. the game is visually appealing as well and the soundtrack is often quite nice to listen to i rekomend",1
"resembled the fall of the western roman empire when it came out. the , jon. however later on it became so reverse  it is now amazing due to g&k and bnw. dont buy this without buying the expansions, or else youll be in for a surprise. (not the good kind)",4
"fantastic game you could play hours on end without getting bored",1
"great game, incorporates tremendous depth and diversity, the multiplayer is the best part and as long as you have enough time (10 hrs) youll definetely want to try it out. this is a great immersive game and fans of the previous games or strategy fans in general should definetely check it out.",2
"super addicting. ive never played a game more than this one.",5
"perhaps the most addictive game ive ever played. youll be telling yourself one last turn for about 7 hours. play this game.",1
"how gandhi learned to stop worrying and love the bomb.",1
"great game! get it on humble bundle while you still can.",1
"fantastic game. easy to learn and pick up on. one of the best games on steam.",1
"absolutely the most enjoyable time consuming non console game we have, beware it eats up your life!",5
"two words  buy it! if you love strategy games this is the game for you. never a single dull moment. play how you want, and its brilliant when playing with friends go for it, if you love strategy game",1
"i feel as though now is a good time to write a review of civ v, given the relatively recent release of civ: byond earth. if you are new to the civ franchise buy this game. in comparison to civ: be, this game is so much more polished and generally better (but only with all the dlc. without the dlc, civ be is better). once beyond earth gets its own share of overpriced but high quality dlc, it will become the go-to civ game, but right now civ v is the number one title in the series.",1
"i personally have never seen strategic or click appealing or fun but i can hands down say civ v is addictive, immersive, and an all round amazing game. especially is you have 2 or 3 friends to play it with! 11/10",1
"if you have played civilatation iv dont buy this! it may have better graphics, but this game is just about the same thing as civilatation iv. i suggest going to its page and buying it!",1
"havent played much yet on this account, but i still own every single dlc, including gods and kings and brave new world. the first thing to say about this game is that it is very new user friendly and have real diversity among difficulty levels. so if you havent tested this game and like rts, history, strategy and even turn based games, plus this is an awesome lan-game. if you have played civ iv and v and you had played iv first, you probably liked iv more. but i bet that if you buy gods and kings dlc and maybe bnw, youll start to realize that these two games are good in their own ways and maybe youll start to prefer civ v over iv. this is a game for intelligent, curious, enthuastic people and even for kids to try(kids should probably play on the settler difficulty setting, because theyll get owned by other difficulty levels). plus youll have to be a genius to beat deity difficulty.",1
"classic sid! love the game. my son has played it for years and still talks about his strategy and tactics all the time. will still come back to play this after the new release.",3
"i bought this game then two weeks later its 50% off. =(",1
"absolute classic of a game. i have been playing since civilization since i was a young kid and each instalement has been highly enjoyable. a very in depth strategy game that you will gladly spend many hours playing. there are always a few negatives however, i feel the game can become quite boring half way through once most of the primary resources are taken (unless you are at war).",2
"it is an amazing game that lets you create a civilization and help along as it goest through ancient era to postmodernism. the huge number of civilizations lets every game become unique and the great music lets you be immersed in the civilization that you are carving.",1
"you can spend hours playing this game and never feel time pass. its pretty cool",3
"a fantastic time sink - with the bnw expansion i think it finally can be said that it eclipses iv as the premier in the series. while some may disagree due to the added depth from the earlier edition, i feel as though the much improved combat system pushes v to the top.",1
"any fan of civilization will love this game, beware: just one more turn can quickly turn into just 400 more turns, dont make any plans.",3

"this isnt game dosnt have the highest played hours in my library for nothing... well maybe its that the game takes days and sometimes weeks to complete... but with infinite play through possibilities its a game one could play constantly... :)",3
"one of the best of the civ series so far. the game is beautiful. the gameplay suffers in a few areas but the game is very playable. if you play civ at all this is a must buy as well as the new expansion for it. it adds a lot of new things to make the core game much better.",1
"amazing amount of rich and diverse civilizations to choose from, beautiful animations and scenery, fantastic to play with friends",4
"the latest entry to the best turn-based strategy game series of all time, civilization v delivers the goods and implements new gameplay while still remaining true to the series. great game: 4.5/5",1

"amazing game. i can play for hours and still have fun. looks lovely and has lots of content. 10/10 recommend to everyone!",1
"such an addicting game, always end up with 3+ hour sessions consistently.",1
"an absolutely amazing game. you do kind of need the expansions to make it worthwhile, but with them this game is easily one of the best strategy games out there. thanks to the many different victory conditions, you can seriously play this game for hours and hours and still find a new and interesting way to play.",2
"this game made me 2 feet taller and handsomer. id say buy it.",2

"the greate and best strategy ever! there are a lot of kinds of development of ur state in this game. you can become a rich person and make boom to other countries. on the other hand u can fight for every piece of land and struggle seemingly insignificant from the poor state. so this game is rly enjoyable and diversful!!!!!! 9.5/10",1
"i was always a huge fan of the civ games and when civ5 came out i was all over it, drooling on the counter in my local game stop and almost ran home. any thats where my happiness with civ5 ended because i found i could not save my off-line game. so after some time of hunting the web for a fix and not finding one that would work for me i un-instaled with the intention of waiting for a patch. well after a year i reinstalled and the base game now saved but then i bought the dlc and the issue has returned. what can i say about a game i loved? i can say dont by the dlc and expect it to work maybe some will but not all of it or maybe i just did not find the fix (and i tried all the ones i could find). i recomend the base game alone! but not the dlc bye dlc at your own risk!",1
"amazing game, missed the civ games after years n this shows they are getting better. spend hours playing a single match n will gladly play more",1
"only a person named stevoqueer would enjoy such a game of this magnitude",1
"a must have for every fan of the series. especially with g&k and bnw expansions. shines in multiplayer as well (though its lacks stability a bit and has a few other bugs).",2
"civilization v is a perfect strategy game. if youre new to strategy games you will still love it and it offers you hundreds and hundreds of hours for gameplay. multiplyer is amazing too espically with friends. also try to buy the brave new world expansion pack. that will enhance the game and youll play it even more. even the angry army supports this game. (angry joe).",3
"just bought this game on sale cause i got addicted after playing the demo a few friends warned me about the dangerous path that lies ahead....they warned me about the one they call gandhi the destroyer of worlds, i shrugged it off an started my conquest. i was about 10 turns into my game when the balded headed messiah came to waving a white flag of peace. i stupidly accepted an was soon deceived, because a few turns later he delcared war with me an killed me. turns out that flag was a bunch of lies an deception. 10/10 would be deceived again",1
"this game is bad because it ruined my life. i have over 250 hours put solely into this game. i just beat the highest difficulty a couple days ago, and i dont know what to do anymore. ive been nuked countless times by gandhi, and ive played the day long games that everybody talks about. ive stayed up until 4am on an exam day. i lost that game thanks to  gandhi. i cant take it anymore. multiplayers fun btw",2
"very fun and addicting. lots of fun to control what goes on and murder everyone with nucle... i mean, um, fun. would reccommend to anyone who has a fun time with strategy games :)",1
"this is an absolutely fantastic game. i would reccomend it to anyone who likes an rts or even a city management game. it has elements which make it great for rts players, such as the war mechanics, but also has city building and citizen management. overall a great game. 10/10",1
"spent 37 hours building up my empire just to die by ghandi. 10/10",1

"what year is it!? ive been stuck in civanji for years!",1
"sid meiers civilation v is a very addicting turn-based game. once you start it keeps you busy for the next two hours at least, the multiplayer feature makes you play for hours on end with your friends. what i really like about this game are the plenty amount of characters and countries you can choose from, not only do you get to play as gandhi or queen elizabeth, but everyone has got their own perks so choose wisely. your opponent also has thier own personalities which makes the game more fun to play. also, this game does not only provide fun, but you can learn from it too. its not a simpel game either, it requires tactics and a lot of thought. the visuals are simply amazing.",1
"google earth: but with tech trees is the most laugable excuse for a video game ive ever played. heres pros and cons. pros- map hexagons indians ghandi cons- worst game ive ever played",1
"although i feel that this game has been a bit simplified since civilization iv, it is still a fantastic and addicting experience! at first i was disappointed with what was removed from the vanilla game (such as religion and espionage), but it was remedied with both brave new world and gods and kings. the multitude of civilizations available means that one can never run out of strategies in their quest for their nation to stand the test of time!",2
"pretty good game once you add in all the dlc. it is lacking without the dlc though.",1
"this is a fun game and a great game that ive wasted many hours of my life life on. i definitly reccomend you to be friends with england though cause she whill #### you up if you dont.",1
"-starts off peacefull -tries to befriend china and siam -friendly with both -is nice to china -china becomes  -defends self after unprovoked attack -everyone claims that im  after defending self -everyone angry -obsessed with revenge -take over siam -manhatten project -try to be nice to china -china still  -build nukes -one last act of kindness towards china -china still  -nukes the  out of china -builds fishing boat",1
"this game is one of the best games i have played in a long time.",3
"if your looking for a game that lets you literally rule an entire empire againest other empires through the test of time, then you should give this game a go. its very addictive and will make you keep going turn through turn, only to look at the clock to realise what felt like and hour, turned into seven instead.",1
"awesome game, very addicting. great for sinking lots of hours into. the only problem is the multiplayer, it can be fairly glitchy and frustrating.",2
"one more turn turns into 40 more turns. incredibly addicting",1
"the civilization series is amazing, so many hours well spent dominating the world. would be nice if there was a better online prescence but singleplayer is great. if you love turn based grand strategy this is the game for you!",1
"great game. you should buy it. great multiplayer maches. good to play with friends.",1
"its like age of empires meets risk, its just amazing and i cant stop ing playing it.",1
"conquer the world whatever way you decide. fight off that war mongering neighbour or spread your religion to every corner of the map. you will have fun into the small hours. i find myself losing full days to this epic turn based strategy game. civ 5 is the kind of game that you will want to befriend everyone, but be denounced numerous times, they will murder your people, destroy your armies and pillage your cities. peace can work if you back down at every request and pay the enemy with all your uranium. then gandhi will nuke you anyway! 10/10 would befriend gandhi again!",2
"a great addition to the sid meier legacy. the new one unit per tile system is frequently frustrating, but introduces a new stratey angle to the combat system that makes combat much more engaging",2
"veterans of the civilizations franchise may be immediately put off by the lack of features in this hexagonal iteration, but the expansions (gk+bnw) add a lot of content back and steam frequently has them for sale. to be honest the smaller scale of warfare due to 1-army-per-square and reduced warfare abilities in general as a result put me off at first. however, i really came to appreciate how much more significant country borders became as a result of this, making each expansion risky due to quick flanking maneuvers by the ai. i still think the ai for civ is still too predictable and even when set on random, a bit harsh depending on your difficulty level. still recommend the game for fans and newcomers, you will easily end up spending way more time than you thought carving your perfect civ.",1
"incredibly addicting. i was never really into strategy games, but this one completely changed my mind.",1
"better then ever with the gods and kings expansion.",1
"on a scale of 1 to 10 on the nuke-happy scale, gandhi is literally a 12, literally",1
"thoroughly enjoyable play, nice graphics, however somewhat infuriating. it is very daft to not have an auto-save feature, perhaps save the last ten moves automatically then you could still go back, if necessary, ten moves or back to the full save. this feature would not be so crucial except that the linux version of the game frequently crashes saving no progress; a simple request for an internet account password or even tabbing between applications causes complete meltdown. i would recommend if above issues were rectified.",1
"tons of fun! one of the best strategy games ive ever played!",1
"absolutly amazing game! probably my favourite. put in over 300 hrs and dont plan on stopping anytime soon haha havnt played many other 4x games but this one deffinetly a favourite for anyone who wants to try. highly recommended!! 10/10",2
"hpw do i get the faerun mod for this game onsteam?",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. immersive, intelligent and informative on a historical level. also one of the most life-destroying games ive ever played. at any moment you could find yourself wondering where hours of your life went. a great distraction.",1
"i reccomand this game so much its so good and with the dlcs it is awesomeeeeeee",1
"just an awesome game make sure you have atleast gods and kings.",1
"8/10 a good game. this game is not the best when it comes to civilization. it is harder to mod, and got rid of some factions. now, they did add some (like persia) but those dont make up for it. the goals are the same as every other and not many things have changed. unless if you want the multiplayer with more people do not get this at full price. get it when it is on sale. or, if you have civilazation 4 just stay with that. i like this game, but get it on a sale.",1
"sid meiers civilization v is the fifth installment in the famous series started by sid meier back in 1991. the series has always been received very well throught the years and has now reached its fifth installment which brings alot of changes. the introduction of the 1 unit per tile and the new social system have added some new diversity to the series bringing it to a whole new level of startegy. and with gods and kings it comes the reintroduction of religion a mechanic brought into the series in civilization iv adding even more diversity to the game. brave new world is set to bring also new features. so take advantage of the current summer sales and buy the game especially if you can get the gold edition.",1
"one of the most best games youll ever play with endless gameplay",1
"normally i would hate these kind of games but there is an exeption to civ as it gives you the freedom to create an empire based on your personnal prefferences, for example if you want to be an  then just declare war on everyone and base your gameplay around you military or then you can be peacefull and win with a science victory which basically involves using neuclear stuff to show dominance. the rate at which time goes by while playing civ is quite amazing to as it is impossible to know how long you have been playing as you become so fixed on the game. 10/10",1
"ill tell you what: dont buy it because it is too awesome to spend all your entire life playing it. the new bnw dlc add a lots of good content and made this civ5 not only a military-grind game but a more strategic game. you can play it for fun in the prince difficulty and you can challenge yourself in high level difficulties. and it did made me felt challenging, and i cant memorized how much summer class i absented because of it (hahahahaha in a word, this is a very good game. all you need to care is thinking about how to control yourself to stop playing this damn thing.",2
"turn based strategy and loads of fun :) do not expect to be playing for an hour or two.... this game will eat away days and nights for that matter. it is by far one of the best turn based strategy games out there. so many things to do, so many people to conquer!",2
"quite possibly the best and most complexly amazing game i have played! 250/100!",2
"i love this game. ive stayed up for countless hours just playing away trying to win. its easy to learn but hard to master especially if the game is not set in your favor. i would recomend this to good strategists and people who just like having fun with there own civilization games.",1
"you cant stack armies anymore but new features make this a great game.",1
"best turn-based strategy game. lot of nation and civilization. very well made random map generator for skirmish game mode.",1
"i love this game and i can only recommend it to other people, its a great strategy game with mod support (turn based strategy), it has a few kinks (not really bugs), and it takes some time learning, but its worth it.",1
"this game is one of the most amazing games i have played in my life. i recommend getting the game and at least one of the dlcs because it just makes the game 10 times better, and the more you get, the more fun you have. trust me if sid doesnt make another civ game i will flip out .... i recommend you get this masterpiece.",5
"not as good as civ 4 was, but still great in its own right. if you havent played a civilization game before, try out the demo. if you dont like the demo, get civ 4 instead. if you have played civilization before, well then... its ing civilization! what more do you need to know?",2
"this game is a serious load of fun; however, a single match can take ages. in the words of a good friend of mine, it would probably take less time to build an actual civilization than to finish one game here.",1
"another civilization game and another stroke of genius. this game allowed for a personal approach to civilization development based on my own preference rather than providing a single formula for success. this is a great turn-based game and i strongly reccoment it.",1
"an excellent game that will leave you thoroughly addicted. the amount of times ive said to myself just one more turn is too high to count. if you are a fan of 4x strategy games, civ 5 is a must buy.",3
"just another round before i go to bed, aaand its 4am",2
"this is the greatest turn based strategy franchise of all time. civilization 5 will suck your life away as, let me just do one more thing, becomes a day of gaming. the unit balance of this game is extraordinary, and the random world creation keeps the map/environment fresh and new every game. there is a large number of leaders to pick from each with their own abilities and special units/buildings that can allow for different strategic options even given similar set ups or in game technology/policy under a different leader. raging barbarians ftw!!!",3
"when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold, dyes, and ivory, take my advice. ready all your tanks and nukes, arm them, and shoot them like your life depends on it. they are evil, traitorous demons. never trust them. however, genghis khan is my best friend. he came up to me and was all like, de full do bu la chi mendo. and i said, okay! lets be friends! i can never understand that guy, but something about our relationship just works. ghandi hating simulator 2014 11/10",1
"if you like turn-based strategy, you need this game like you need air. if you arent sure what a turn based strategy game is or if you like one, youll likely still find this game pretty awesome.",2
"amazing game, but be warned... this game is highly addicting",2
"if you have any respect for your free time, do not buy this. it has a small tendency to suck you in (in a good way). you play for hours in what seemed like minutes. also, got denouced for being a warmonger by atilla the hun. 10/10",1
"one of the best turn based strategy games ever on the pc. very addictive",1
"probably in the top 5 game ever made, it is the second game in the civilization universe i have ever played with the first being civilization on the ps3, the amount of detail put into the game is so entirely breathtaking that i could literally play this game for days, in fact ive had it for less than a week and im already closing in on a full day of gameplay... 5 out of 5. cant wait to see where beyond earth takes the franchise but i can pretty much gaurantee i will be there to see!",1
"reallly fun if you like turn based stragedy games this is for you pick it up or get the complete edition comes with both expansions and all dlc",1
"this is the most addictive game i ever played since dota 2!! hell i even quit dota for this! this game is just absolutely fun to play. you can enjoy it on any age. its not that hard to learn how to play since you have advisor to advice you. the mods made the game even more awesome! you should really get this game and the expansion pack brave new world. ill give it a 9/10! go get this game now and the complete edition trust me its worth it!",1
"it is a great turn-based strategy game. it is very challenging and rewarding when you win a game.",1
"dominated gandhi and george washington in the same turn. 11/10.",1
"very good game, great multiplayer, thought it would be boring, boy was i wrong, great change of pace with no hiccups,",1
"great game if your into strategy not as great as civ 4 but still great game",3
"ive been playing for 36 hours straight. i dont remember if ive eaten. may or may not have pooped myself. but im taking that  gandhi down before i get up from this chair again. thats good, right?",2
"great game. hex tile element adds new depth to the usual square grid.though the movement controls are a litte wierd ad the character selection will jerk you all over the map once your empire is massive, it is a great strategy game derserving of a 9/10",1
"amazing game great gameplay and amazing graphics.the ai runs quickly and intelligently.",1
"**** this game. **** its bull**** options that are bull**** and do bull**** things. you want to play with a friend? you want to start in the same general area as your friend? while on a team? against all the other ai? hahahahahaha nope! our options here at civ 5 are bull**** lying trash and we **** in your faces. enjoy never being able to have the game you want, thanks for the money. 138 hours of reloading the game to try and get a spawn with a friend anywhere close while the option start together is selected vs emporer bots. nope! because here at 2k sports its in the game! as long as it isnt an actual options menu that matters!!! eat butt.",2
"what can i say... its civ - of course its good! initially though i did find it a little more frustrating than civ iv in that every single ai opponent wants to go to war with you - even ghandi!, but they can be relatively easily kept at bay on all but the highest difficulty levels if you are leading the tech race and have a full kitty (and if you dont have either of those - youre not doing it right ;p). overall, an interesting and fairly replayable addition to an already great series.",1
"sid meiers civilization v is an excellent game with endless replayability. if you enjoy turn-based strategy games or enjoy the concept of the civilization series, this game is for you.",2
"you can make the little people find bananas and elephants",1
"one of the most addictive games. tough its more than 4 years old, it can still give you a great time!",1
"this game is great if youre in a global domination kind of mood. not as much focus on combat like the total war games, and more focus on science, politics, and producing a successful (duh) civilization. lots of different nations to play as and play against, lots of different map types to play on, and several different ways to win. this makes for fantastic replay value. the only set back i can think of at all is if you only want to buy this for combat, dont get it. the combat in this game is fun but nothing like the total war games. you move your units around on tiles and it is all turn - based. other than that, i highly recommend this game for any global conquest fans out there. a++",1
"great game i enjoy it each time i play, it makes you think",4
"if you are in university and need to write an essay due tomorrow do not launch this game. the whole one more turn is just your brains way of justifying the last 6 hours you spent on this game 10/10 goty",1
"the best game ive had in such a long time, woth the buy!!",1
"this game is honestly the best video game i have ever played, i swear to it.",1
"amazing graphics crushing titles like crisis 3? hell no. complicating, difficult gameplay? generally, also no. however, these things are to be expected in a game like civilization v. what the game doesnt lack is strategic difficulty, diverse scenarios, addicting gameplay, and an adaptable challenge for anyone playing it. an absolute must buy in the genre, due to the replayability, and genuinely enjoyable experience.",1
"good game, sadly the day after i got civ, it went on sale...",1
"the endless possibilities, scenarios, and beautifal gameplay make civ 5 an easy game to lose hundreds of hours in. smart and stylish civ 5 will can make burning the midnight oil easy. it really does embody all the greatest things about the franchise and the expansion packs fill in all the wholes left in the original game. highly recommend this title.",2
"awesome history strategy game. i recommend to buy this game. especially because it has steam workshop.",1
"this is a good game other than the fact that it overcharges for feautres that should have been introduced in the first edition.",1
"this game really drove the sid meier experiance home. sometimes whille playing i really did feel like i was becoming sid meier. its hands down the most realistic simulation game since fez ii so it was basically real life. at some points of game play i literally thought my name was sid meier, so that means the graphics in the game look so real that it makes you feel like youre in real life...for real. thats why i give this game: 8 cans of mountain dew / 3 family sized bags of doritos. graphics:real life gameplay:1 commentary:63 directors cut:9.9999999 story: dank/10 verdict:yea",2
"to try and keep this brief, civilization five in one of the most refined strategy games on the market. the fact that even recently the game is still recieving both offical expansions, and user content should be a testament to that alone. building on the framework of pervious titles, and reworking nearly every aspect into a more streamlined approach might have back fired. yet, it still remains addicting and fun even after the years it has been released.",2
"i definitely recommend this game. it is quite time consuming, but this isnt a problem, because with each turn the game gets more in depth, making the player want to continue playing. plus, who doesnt want to take over the world and become the ultimate world leader. it is even better when you invite your friends to play.",2
"im mainly doing this to earn a ticket in the steam summer sale. however, civ5 is an awesome game if you like turn based strategy games. the multiplayer is a lot more fun than the singleplayer since you end up with an intelligent ally. if anyone picks this up, message me and we can play a few games.",3
"i am really enjoying this game,and after i have spent more than 200 hours,i can say that this game is perfect for someone who likes to play historical/strategy games.scenarios are really great,which lets you start as civilizations on real locations in the world.this game gets 10/10 from me.",2
"wicked game logged nearly 200 hours gameplay and ready for another 200",2
"extremely fun game, i just dont recommend this to someone running apple os. it always freezes completly to the point that i have to do a cold reset. forums online talk about how its not a computer problem because if you run bootcamp with windows and play the exact same game i guess its fine. probablly going to stop playing because its very frustrating to have to keep reseting my computer. oh well...",1
"this game is yet another golden egg given to us by sid meier. his skill at crafting these beautiful games is unmatched. i recomend this game to anyone who loves strategy or any casual gamer.",1
"i can not recommend this, for your life shall slowly fade away 10/10",1
"ive played this game at least 20 times and never finished it. 10/10.",1
"possibly the most addictive thing thats legal to buy. incredible game, just one more turn will become your new motto...",1
"brilliant fun by your own or with a friend but be sure you have freinds to play with for some friendly banter",1
"manages to be be both easy to pick up and incredibly tough to fully master, which is quite an achievement. it walks the newcomer through the basics of the game before leaving them to work out how to improve and build from there.",1
"civilization v is one of the best pc games i can suggest to anyone who asks! its a massive time consumer but its deffinetly worth it! i personly own all the dlcs which t received after purchasing the complete edition, and it just creates a whole new gaming experience! so buy this game,i urge you! you will not regret it! 5*s 10/10",1
"ive played civilization 3 for years, then about a year ago i got more into games and i got steam. a few months later i got this game, i love the community, the dlcs, and i love the game. civilization has been an amazing game series. i cant wait to see more games like this come out. so check this game out and have fun. (10/10)",1
"despite numerous mechanical flaws and inconveniences, there arent many games that can replace civs specific niche multiplayer works well",1
"a cursor would greatly improve game play (and keep me from being a curser) i had no idea where the mouse was which made clicking on buttons for game play near impossible. other than that graphics are good and game play is much like prior civ games.",1
"great game and thank you so much valve for giving us this game on linux. it would be even better if there was a sdk tool for this game on linux.",1
"i loved all the civ games but civ 5 and its expansions have really brought new depth and strategy to the genre. my only complaint is how quickly the ai will turn from friend to foe...but then again maybe thats how real politics work. 10/10",3
"the fifth instalment in sid meiers civilization series brings a new fresh flavour to the game. the overal expirience is a lot smoother and simplified when compared to civ iv. id definitely recommend this game to beginers in strategy games but to seasoned aficianados as well.",1
"sid meiers civilization v is a great game it looks good and its easy to get into. its also a great game if you dont play many strategy games.",1
"i loved civ 4 but the improvements to this one make it even better, i would recommend this to anyone who likes turn based strategy games.",1
"awesome game, definitly worth the price! make sure to grab brave new world dlc to get the most out of the game",3
"civ 5 is the last in the series of the civ 5 games, a turn-based empire building game. a lot of fun as long as you have the patience and get the statisfation of building a nation and dominate the world. >:d",2
"fun fun fun fun. this game is very, very addicting. definitely worth buying! i love it.",1
"pretty good but expensive game though its actually worth it when you buy the game as the game itself is pretty epic with its features though i recommend buying all of its dlcs as they make the game more fun and it will literally take a whole day when starting from the primitive era to the future era. 8.5/10",2
"dont even have the expansion packs and this game is a hell of alot of fun.strategy.i absolutely love that i can build my economy based on what choices i make for my country,i can build my sciences based on my decisions, my culture, the happiness of the nation,the size of my country...you can build a country!!!how you want it to be built too!!!!you can dominate the world!!! 20/10 + 2 virtual cakes thats right!!!cakes!!!not cookies!!!cakes!!! (cause why give cookies when you can give cakes?!)",4
"by far the most detailed game in comparison with other sid meiers civilization games. if you do not mind killing time for 4-5 hours per game then you will love this game. not only does the game introduce new mechanics, but it also allows the players to play a leader throughout time and change the fate of history... forever!",3
"i have played every single civilization since the very first one came out. this is definitely one of my favorites and has its own unique feel to it.",3
"recommend dont critisize until youve played it good overhead strategy game which involves planning and thinking ahead of the game. graphics are fairly good for a game of this genre. there are a few bugs (mainly on multiplayer) none too noticable.. i cant go in full depth personally since i dont have a great amount of hours playing. have fun.",1
"amazing!!!! its the best strategy game i have ever played!",1
"a nice strategy game, easy to get into and a smooth learning curve. next to ck2 and eu4 my personal favourite, it is just a bit too simple for me, bu the dlcs can make up for it. each dlc expands the game more and more, making it a deeper experience by the hour, the two best features for the dlcs were religions and steam workshop compability, the creators had some nice thoughts about things they didnt liked and either just buffed or nerfed things.",2
"conquer the whole world! then erect phallics in all the towns!",1
"great game! love it! a uniuqe expirience that requires stratigic thinking and planing turns wisely. overall, a fun game!",1
"awesome, game with a great mod community. be careful, nine hours might pass before you know when playing this game.",1
"eats my life, but not as much as civ 2 did back in the day :)",1
"5 minutes in: how the **** do i play this game 5 hours in: how the **** do i stop playing this game? 10/10",1
"this game drains my soul and makes my dinner always late t_t",2
"one of the greatest strategy games ever. diffinitely a good choice for hours of endless fun.",2
"love the game a little bit hard to get use to but its bottyful",1
"amazing. too good to explain. fudhkceoidjoefnsizlfksuybfhsfkugadwytfaukywgydjbhsavgdftuwkfdgvasjdwtyfakdgh",1
"this is one of the best games i have played in recent memory. multiplayer is incredible. got nuked by ghandi 10/10",1
"i have had a lot of fun with civ v. there are many roads to victory. you can also make a custom game to limit methods of victory. there is so much that can be customized for each individual game you play. very good replay value.",1
"friggin fantastic gameplay. good game to play if you enjoy patient, long, in depth games. long term strategies are paramount in this, and it also tags quite a nice list of dlc for everyone to add content and alter gameplay just enough to keep your interest. also a necessity to for turn-based strategies!",2
"this game has endless replayability. i cant stop playing it. love the graphics too.",2
"goty!!! this game is amazing! worth the money, improved a lot with the dlcs, this game should be on everyones wishlist! 5/5!",1
"this game is an excellent addition to sid meiers collection of games. the original version is much simplier than the older systems and in a way easier for me to learn since this is my first civ game. however there are much more complicated tasks and different ways to win as the game progresses. the history in this game is quite accurate and interesting for those who love history and random facts. i highly recommend this game if you are a history nut and enjoy strategy games. also check out the expansions as well they add a lot of new features that ultimately change the gameplay and ways to win!",2
"such fun, many friends, very time consume, wow, so worth",1
"at first i thought very little, but with time i came to love it!!",1
"excellent game especially with the gods and kings dlc",2
"never tried offline multiplayer is bugged for alot of people they officially only support 8 players but you can play up to 16 players? start multiplayer +4 players: forget it if you are lucky you can play a game where noone disconnects and you can play it to the end and thats the only time it is fun. if you are like everyone else, someone disconnects or crashes : game is lost, continue with bots but game cant handle someone joining and makes everyone lag/disconnect/rage if you could i would ask my money back but i can only say: dont buy this unfinished game here is my playing experience: 2 finished games, 10 unfinished because of crashes, disconnects, leaves, never tried multiplayer because lan is this bad.",1
"ive been playing civ since microproses first game. boy, since the second one, civ v is the most inovative yet loyal to original game general dinamics. purists will initially dislike the abundance (or mere existence) of city-states, but once you start playing youll see they contribute enormously to the game balance and a more dynamic early game stage. if wou like turn base strategy games, civilization v is mandatory.",1
"i cant spend just an hour playing this - every time i play, its always a large chunk of time, and its always worth it. 10/10.",1
"grate game a side from being a masive time vammpier it you do kind of need brave new world if you wount the full esperance then buy brave new world though all in all a grate game.",1
"hours fly when you play this game,its funn and addictive but only whit the dlcs",2
"an immersive, slow paced, and very strategic turn based game that is as deep as it is challenging. if you consider yourself a smart gamer or love strategic and turn based games, then you are doing yourself a disservice by not buying this game.",1
"a nice stratagie game fore the people who love the genre",3
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",2
"such a fun addicting turn-based strategy game. its very indepth with all the different civilization leaders and their different playstyles.",1
"love this game and its one of the best civ games yet. but it really needs the expansions to give it replayability.",1
"civilization v is a great game, i like just about everything in the game. the only thing i dont like is the price of dlc! for all of the dlc it costs $100+ but if you buy the bundle that indludes the base game and all of the dlc it will cost $50. still kinda high for the dlc. make it cheaper 2k!!!",1
"not quite as addictive as some of the older iterations, but once you find all the workshop addons, you can really tailor the game to your own playstyle.",1
"civ 5 is following the steady lineage of civ games. brave new world + gods&kings packs are quite worth it due to adding a ton of new capabilities. specialy in the brave new world the caravan tradings can make your day.",1
"my number one favourite game of all time on console or pc. fantastic fun to play and i always enjoyed playing different civs in a real world scenario and changing history. the mods for this game are mint too, with a huge range of maps and scenarios created by other players.  ghandi, that prick is not friendly (ai civ communication is the one thing this game really has to improve on and a lot of the time they make ridiculous decisions like declaring war on friends or demanding silly trades)",2
"if you like turn based strategy games, this is it!",1
"mixed feelings: pros: -its civil. it has been simplified on some parts, but is good. -nice graphics. cons: -unbearable wait times. i really mean it. on a huge map, on advanced turns it took about 10 minutes to just load a saved game! and about 5 minutes each turn just waiting the machine thinks. -very bad diplomacy. its almost impossible to get a balanced deal. the computer always want to have a very unbalanced deal. -no spies, no sharing tech between cultures. -spain as a dlc?! come on, they were one of the main cultures on every civil. the wait times killed the whole thing. it cant be possible that it took too long each turn to think.",1
"best turn-based 4x strategy game, even better with g&k and bnw",1
"when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold, dyes, and ivory, take my advice. ready all your tanks and nukes, arm them, and shoot them like your life depends on it. they are evil, traitorous demons. never trust them. however, genghis khan is my best friend. he came up to me and was all like, de full do bu la chi mendo. and i said, okay! lets be friends! i can never understand that guy, but something about our relationship just works. ghandi hating simulator 2014 11/10",1
"countless days spent on this amazing game, one issue...mother  gandhi. he will nuke you. 10/10",3
"this game is absolutly fantastic. you can lose hours just getting halfway through a single game. no matter how you want to play through a game, whether you want to attack other countries, make peace, build sceince (my personal favorite as everything is easier if you have better sceince then other people), build culture, spread a religion, build cities, etc. and all thoose and more are ways you can win a game too! the ai could be a bit better but i hear the brave new world expansion fixes that (i want it sooooooo badly). so to sum all that up: play this game",1
"by far my favorite civ game. this is a great addition to the franchise and i highly reccomend it to any fans of this series or any other strategy type games, turn based or not. best game purchase i have made in the last couple of years.",1
"if you have any experience with civilization games previously, do yourself a favor and buy the complete version of this that includes gods and kings and brave new world. the dlc for this game takes what was otherwise an okay, but kind of pared down and boring version of civ, and turns it into the best civ game since alpha centauri. other things of note if you are an older civ player looking at this game: - units are restricted to (basically) one unit per tile. at first this seems terrible, but in the long run youll wonder why you ever put up with stacks of doom. - instead of squares, you have hexes. this increases the strategic depth of the game a lot. - india will still nuke the hell out of you the first chance they get.",2
"very fun game. highly recommend to anybody interested in strategy games.",1
"im not gonna lie, games like this i dont really enjoy. but this is something else. it can look quite confusing to begin with however from the guidence of a few friends i was running my own empire, founding new cities and creating a religion. under my control japan was ruling the world. and i was loving it to say the least. the multiplayer works slightly differently but with a few friends its still great fun! overall and amazing game. and i cant really complain when i got the full game plus all the dlc for only 8.99!",1
"this game answers the hard questions. how are people created? wheat stocks. how to win and keep friends? bribery. how to create happiness? eat whales.",4
"civ5 is a great time sink, an activity for lazy days.",1
"freaking awesome game, tons of ways to win and many avenues of approaches!",1
"great social strategy game. the engine creates a pretty easy-going sort of playstyle. artwork is decent, and so is variety. the diplomacy in the game does not have much depth to it, and creating a lasting alliance with another faction is a rarity. there is also the problem with turn processing, at later turns (150+), you may aswell tab out of the game, as you might be waiting over 5 minutes for the game to end the turn and start a new one. still very enjoyable, 8/10.",1
"solid game with approachable curve, but needs dlc to achieve same levels of depth as previous games",2
"its a good game, has nice mods to make it over into smac/smax but the $30 dlc isnt easy to swallow considering how half-baked they seem.",4
"be very careful playing this game!!! you make think you know what time it is, time to nuke gandhi, but you realize that 3 days have passed since you have started your game and you havent drank or ate in the last 18 hours. this game keep you saying just one more turn! but dont let it make your decisions for you, like when you should use the bathroom or when you should get another sandwich. if you see this game on sale buy it immediately, oh and brave new world did amazing things for this game, buy it as well.",1
"crazy fun with a few friends, and just generally a great play.",1
"amazingly fun and addictive game, over 200 hours spent on this. never tried a game of this series and was pleasantly surprised. thumbs up.",1
"great game. 10/10 would definately take over the world again.",1
"i heard from other people that this game was a bad game compared to other civ games, and i was hesitant to purchase it, but when i noticed it was on sale for a very low price, i bought to try it out. i now take back anything bad i ever said about this game because playing it is the most fun ive had in a strategy game since civ 4. the military mechanics are now completely different from the previous civ games, with only one unit allowed per tile, which isnt a bad thing, just different. after playing this i find it almost impossible to go back and play civ 4 and 3, its almost as if theyve lost their appeal. either that or this game set the bar too high, and makes civ 4 and 3 seem somewhat subpar.",3
"used up all my sick calls for this game.... one....more...turn....",1
"you will lose hours of your life to civ v, but you will love it.",1
"if beyond earth(there new game if you dont know) is haft as good as this game i will get it",2
"i could write out an intricate review for civ v or the excellent brave new world expansion but im too busy playing civ v.",1
"realy epic tbs game.it lets you redifine history as you know and puts you in the role of histories most important leaders. nearly endless singleplayer replayability with every playthrough beeing different and the multiplayer ,although buggy, is realy awesome. all in all epic game 11/10 its oke skyrim with less rpg and more strategy.",1
"absolutely fantastic, addictive game. it blends the classic likes of sim city with the command & conquer series to deliver an engaging, fun experience that you wont be able to look away from!",2
"great game been playing it here and there just dont have the time. but still play it.",1
"poassibly the most addicting game that exists. easy to learn, difficult to master. this edition of sid meiers franchise is the new standard for turn-based strategy.",2
"legendary. worth every cents, specially since i got it from humble bundle :)",1
"i recomend this game to people who like strategy and dont mind taking a day to complete 1 game my friends who are major fps players didnt like it.",1
"this game is incredible. in my opinion it is quite fun as a stand-alone, but it is much more fun in the complete version. when alone the game flies by however it will become boring after extended periods of time. with your friends this game is even more fun as it allows you to enhance the experience by playing against other gamers of your level.",1
"vanilla - 9/10 with g&k and bnw - 10/10 moddable beyond all reason - 11/10 love the  out of this game, now im gonna go back to playing it.",1
"buy this game and all of the dlc! a ton of fun and totally worth every cent! the more to play this with, the better it gets!",1
"i only have 8 hours, but have over 200 hrs watched on youtube. yes the learning curve is high, but its so addicting.",1
"sid meiers civ v is a must have if you are a fan of turn based strategies. giving you the ability to play as 50+ civilizations from 6000+ years of history it allows you to build them up your way while playing against or with other nations. civ v gives you the ability to create your own social policies, religions, chose the global path as a un leader on a diplomatic battle ground putting sanctions and embargos on countries and city-states in your way. build a masive army to back yourself with, with the assistance of nuclear blastic missles and giant death robots you can watch as the world around you burns! or create the perfect eutopia if your heart so desires. steam work shop with its thousands of choices makes this game worth it even more. 10/10",2
"the vanilla version of this game offers a pretty solid base game, the game settings lets you spice up every new playthrough, which gives a really great replaying value. the ai is hard to please but its nothing that you wont be able to handle on your second playthrough. the expansions themselves enrich the game, offering a lot of diversity on how you want to win, plus, with both expansions you can access a variety of free community content (maps, civs, buffs and nerfs for certain gameplay aspects,etc). if youre looking to kill time this is one of the best games out there to do it.",4
"id inject this game into myself if that was possible",2
"if i had a choice between having sex with a woman or playing civ v, id probably still choose sex with a woman. but afterwards id tell her to get out of my house so i can play civ v. 10/10 would give my crabs to george washington again.",1
"this game is incredible. i would recommend it to any one who is interested in strategy or building a empire.",1
"that awkward moment when you remember you have a pet after a three day binge play. . .",1
"want to build your own country? a empire that can go through the test of time, war and economical issues? then take your settlers and start the journey. you decide how your empire grows, will it make war or diplomatic influence. fight with barbarians and other countries, explore the world, gain resources so your name will be carved in stone for eternity. strategic balance of battles, smart ai, lot of leaders to choose. at the end you want to make jest... one... more... turn...",1
"its amazing. the game gives strong strategic values. it displays ancient quotes for players to ponder upon. and most importantly its extemely addicting because of these few yet strong traits.",1
"not much to say. amazing game and really hard to put down. gets only better when you have lots of friends to play with. is very time consuming and one game can last hours.",2
"by far the best of its genre, addicting as can be.",2
"you conqueor nations, you concqueor your friends nations. you pillage and plunder to your hearts content until you either rule all or get your  handed to you. what could be more fun than that? really? what?",1
"i would not recommend this game once, i was in a loving relationship, but then i started playing this game... now we nuke each other with carriers named love you though...",3
"if you have played and enjoyed age of empires, and empire earth, this is a welcoming face in the genre. unlike the empire games mentioned, its turn based thus giving a game of more stratergy, instead of spamming units.",1
"one of the best turn-based strategy games around sid meierss civilization is still going strong since 1990",1
"hope you have a lot of time spare for this game, can take ages to complete, for some may be too complex, for others not so much, city states though, great fun, and killing filthy barbarians.",1
"my favourite game, pehaps of all time, because it has the perfect balance between a great multiplayer game and enjoyerable single player which many games seem to lack. it has a few bug and querks that will make you cringe but they can be overlooked",1
"i recommend this game alot. if you play it multiplayer it might be a bit laggy, but it still works. its a really good game where you can challenge the ai in a stragetic game with no possible way of nothing how theyll react.",1
"you do a civilization thing. so thats pretty cool.",1
"after playing civilization v :- battlefield 4 - uninstall done battlefeild 3 -uninstall done dota 2 - uninstall done black ops 2 - uninstall done watch doge - uninstall done best game i have ever played in my life !! my rating -> 69/10",1
"as soon as i downloaded this game it turned out my computer couldnt run it. looking back at the reviews i want to tell my computer to clean its **** up and run because ghandi needs a beat down. im pretty sure sid meier knew everyone would trust ghandi so he made him a sadistic nuclear frenzied psycho. i must play this game.",1
"hi all ive just got a new laptop and downloaded civ 5 to it. but its now saying disk error. i brought this game by downloading from steam on my old one. could anyone help me out please jay",1
"this is definately the absolute greatest turn-based strategy game ever. i have been a fan since i first played civ iv and i could not wait for civ v, and i have to say that i was not dissapointed at all. the level of realism in the decision making aspects of the game is incredible and the graphics are phenomenol. if you are a fan of any genre of strategy game, i definately reccomend you getting this.",1
"this game is great! it is very easy to waste away ten hours on accident playing this game, and getting a group of friends and talking on skype while you play makes it even better. highly reccomend.",2
"maybe just one more turn.... mmmm just one more. wait why is it 4 in the morning now.",1
"one of the most best games youll ever play with endless gameplay",1
"this game is a great turn based stratagy game fit for co-op and single player, the down side playing this game will give you so many problems from happyness of your citizens, finding resorces, to barbairan attacks i rate this game 5barbarians attacks out of 10",1
"this game is amazing for people who like strategy games",4
"amazing strategy game spent tons of time playing this game.",1
"amazing game. i nuked korea. they didnt like it very much.",1
"i simply love this game, every game is different and enjoyable, you can customize enough to make it pretty darn challenging or a sandbox laidback session. i def. recommend this. seriously. buy this game. play it.",1
"a must own strategy game for anyone who loves turn-based games. you can play with friends or alone and you kind of get lost into it after a while.",1
"rating: 93/100 awards: bronze game award silver game award gold game award game of the year 2013 & 2014 most played game 2014 comment: extremely fun game - a must-buy! reason: this game is a very good choice for anyone who likes strategy. it is fun to play with friends or just with ai. unfortunately, ai are a bit easy, but for newer players, the ai should prove challenging on the higher levels. i personally find singleplayer a bit boring after playing lots of games, but multiplayer is always very good, especially since you have real competition. i very highly recommend you buy this game, as it is one of the best around.",2
"this is a great turn based strategy game. i would recommend it to anybody who likes this genre. if you are new to the genre, this is a great starting game.",1
"hands down the best strategy game in existence. there is literally nothing wrong with it in any way, shape, or form, and it is superb. id say if you like games like halo wars, the total war series, or any military/war game, then you should get civ 5. and if you do, i strongly reccommend getting the dlc. best purchase ive ever made (just look at how long ive played it)!",1
"be warned: you can start a game and not know what day it is when you finish. overall great game.",2
"+when i cant conquer a city, i can build a city elsewhere and change the name of the city to the name of the city i initially wanted. who needs your stoopid city anyway. -no mods for multiplayer 9/10",1
"one of the best games ever. very complex and elaborated, as civ always was. various settings, random maps, scenarios and expansions round it up to have no game like the other. quite a lot workshop mods and dlcs let you modify even more aspects so it wont get boring. it even teaches you some real history while you write your own. only bad thing is that it needs a lot of time to calculate next round if you have a lot of opponents, depending on your hardware. must-have if you like strategy games.",2
"a fabulous game that simulates perfectly how awful ghandhi is",1
"the most approachable civilization game, but probably not the most balanced or most in-depth or most interesting. it gets a little grindy, with lots of repetetive turns, and lots of boring optimization, that turn it into a sort of zen experience rather than a heavily invested strategy game. lots of dlc and expansions have adjusted things to be way more complex and interesting though, and even if they didnt, the amount of content is staggering. 4/5",1
"with all the dlc, its probably one of the most entertaining games i have played.",2
"in the last couple patches, civ5 has really become a better game. its launch was shaky and unbalanced, but almost all of my initial complaints have been addressed. theres no better time to jump in and go for one...more...turn.",1
"civ...effing civ! its addicting, deep and a great way to spend time when youre looking for some alone gaming time.",1
"great game but mainly only worth it if u buy all the dlc and it was deffinatly worth the $25 usd i paid. it is a great time stealer and keeps you entertained for hours",1
"great game. the game looks great and difficulty can range from easy to ridiculously challenging. games will take hours to complete, but itll fly by.",1

"had i have none how amazing civ 5 is i would have bought it a long time ago. i was lucky enough to catch this game when it was 75% off during a steam sale. this is my #1 game of 2013 (even though it came out in 2010). if you wait for the next sale (or look else where for a sale i.e., greenmangaming), or decide to buy it at full retail price. either way civilization v is worth it at any price. pick this game up!",2
"one of the best rts games ive ever seen and played.",1
"this game literally is probably one of the best games i have ever played single player. it contains hundreds of hours of fun with the ability to play as your favorite historical civilization. i went out and got the 4th civ to try it and couldnt play because of how awesome civ 5 is. one downfall may be that the online doesnt really work too well so playing with friends isnt the best option. but if you look at this from a single player game standpoint it is a gem. i would recommend this to a friend and i give it 10/10 my most played steam game.",1
"the game does have its ups and downs, like how the ai cheats and somehow gets way ahead really early on, but in general the game is a great game.",1
"awesome turn-based strategy game that stays true to its predecessor while still making enough changes to stay fresh. the amount of map, time, and difficulty options amount to many possibilities and challenges.",1

"return to the inventive mind of sid meiers civilization franchise with renewed civilizations. each leader provides, not only unique units and/or structures, but specific civilization-wide powers. from oda nobunagas power to fight to the end at full strength, to ramesses ii and his wonder building bonus. each leader has unique audio when interacting with them, in their peoples language. this holds true if youre speaking to japan, france, egypt, mongolia, and even aztec and iroquois! if you want to imerse yourself in the cultures of the strategy game series that made the perfect turn-based formula, or just want to prove a civs superiority over all the rest, take up your sword and diplomatic skills for the first time in this generation!",2

"this game is simply awesome. the art is good, and while there is no story, you get the feeling that you have the power to write it yourself through the actions you take in civilization. my only qualm is that it can be a little buggy at times, particularly in multiplayer (good god). the gameplay is also very enjoyable and fun.",1
"this is a game in a series that honestly does not need a review, and i personally feel that anything i say cannont do it enough justice. after many many hours put into this game this never seems to get old. the core gameplay is amazing, also that is open to moders is another large boost factor.",1
"i think i have a job to go to... and a dog to feed... but gahndi must be destroyed, and i just cant let that opportunity pass me by. i mean.. me and napoleon have a good thing, id rather not ruin it, and besides, me and life werent really working out anyways. 9.5 / 10 (for those with free time, and nobody to feed)",1
"i have never been more interested in social studies.",1
"ive always loved the civ games and this one is even better.",1
"this is an amazing strategy game that will not only let you compete with the future technologies of today and play against advanced ai players. this game will also let you react with other online players that get you motivated thinking about what could be there next move and what should be your next move. this is also a game with the workshop added so you can play with several mods. it also has a couple of dlcs. here is one that i know of: brave new world. i suggest you buy it and maybe we could try to kill each other! :)",1

"been playing civ for years now... never managed to get tired ! :)",1
"sid meiers civilization 5 is a great game. it is a turn based game. the point of the game is that you are a leader of historical civilizations. you start fresh, strategetically growing. there are a number of victory types in this game. domination, cultural, science, and diplomatic to name them. they give you the option to to choose what victory based on how youre feeling. one of the things i dont like about this game is that, vanilla civilization v is only half the game. the dlcs ( brave new world, gods and kings ) make it what the game is. overall, this game is awesome and i suggest you get it. it is a little pricey, but try to get the complete edition if you possibly could. i give this game an overall rating of 9/10.",1
"this game is probably one of my favorite games of all time. i sit down on a weekend to play for maybe an hour or so. so i start a new game and an hour later a realized that 5 or so hours have passed. so then i tell myself just one more turn and 1 turn later 50 turns have passed! this game is soooo addicting and i recomend purchasing the complete edition if you do get this game.",2
"really fun everytime i play it. mods are great too!",1
"this game is addicting. would be the 4 words that i would say if somebody asked me about this game. civilization v is probably the most fun ive had in a game. every turn, you move your units, manage your cities, interact with other civilizations, not knowing what awaits you next turn. you can become friends with the warmongering genghis khan, or piss off the peace loving gandhi. this game offers a ton of civs to play as, so youll be spending alot of time in it. also, if youre worried about getting demolished, dont worry, civ v offers a really good indepth tutorial made for getting beginners into the game. if you can get a good deal on this game or the ultimate edition, i really would recommend buying it, and prepare for getting your soul sucked in. 9/10.",2
"i have to admit-i was a little offput at first by this game. i was familiar with the concept and a very basic idea of how to play, but some things about the game seemed downright strange the first time i played. the hex tiles, the belligerent ai (yes, you montezuma), all of it kept me somewhat uninterested in this game for a while. but after a while of thinking, i started to understand the game more, and the more i understood it, the more i liked it. it is a complex game, and i certainly dont understand all or even most of it. but nontheless, it is a highly replayable game of great value that i enjoy greatly.",2
"with the addition of the brave new world expansion, this is easily my favourite civilization game. the graphics are beautiful, gameplay deep, and the units and civilizations plentiful. if youre a fan of civ you should get this now!",1
"nice game if they would stop the  dlc system! make it free! only ask some money for big expansions. also make no expansion and expansion compatible in multiplayer!",1
"bought this game about 2 weeks ago, can barely put it down. this game is really fun and has alot of playtime to offer. overall immortal is pretty insane. scouts turn into archers and maria theresa is overpowered. 10/10",1
"ill write a review in a minute, just give me one more turn...",1
"this is a hexagonal, turn based real time strategy game. this game flows, looks beautiful, as was really well designed just, seriously, dont give ghandi the nuke....",1
"i love it, its very good with friends until they backstab you but other then that its a really fun game.",1
"never trust washington, i know hes cute and all but...he is evil himself",1
"definitely recommend this game, me and my friends love it!",1
"love this game. a mix of strategy, politics, bullying and trade. what more could you ask for?",2
"essentially an enhanced board game with more depth than possible in an actual board game. does a great job of portraying events on a large scale in a streamlined manner. slow-paced as a strategy game, but it suits the theme well. style and design shows a lot of attention to historical details. semi-educational if you want it to be and worth putting some thought into. definitely recommended.",1
"fantastic game. been a while since i last played the series, i have fond memories still of colonization. last game now took me 23h to win a domination victory, had a blast along the way. it might be a bit easy though, and the replayability isnt what i thought it would be. there was also a few small things i would like to have had the option to enable and disable in the ui. i would however also liked to have seen more diplomatic and a more exciting research tree. but all in all it was a civ game, though simpler then i would have imagined. well worth playing, even if you have 4x space games and tropico 4 out there to compete.",1
"you play one of the best, most addicting, turn-baed stradagy games to exist for pc, civilization 4. you thoughts such as it doesnt get any better than this. . the 5th installment of this game series absolutly leaves you jaw-droping by proving you wrong!",2
"one of the best strategy games invented i have spent most of my life playing this, and every second has been worth it.",2
"just one more turn will always last another 3 hours. great game.",1
"amazing, if you love strategy games. its fun to play with friends, because singleplayer can get boring after a while.",1
"i heard its an ok game, need to play it a bit to know for sure.",4
"in short amazing game i spent 6 hours playing first civ and im craving more.",1
"it is an extremely addicting great pc strategy game. every time i click next turn i cant quit/put the game down.",3
"positives: - an in depth strategy game. - fun with friends and by fun by yourself vs ai. - easy to learn and hard to master. negatives: - online matches are rarely finished due to the sheer length of a single game. - can become quite repetitive with certain strategies and skill trees being more powerful than others.",1
"had to go to hopsital because my eyes got so dry from a 10 hour game. 10/10.",2
"very fun to play. multiplayer can be a bit annoying due to internet problems.",3
"as a mind games lover i highly reccomend this game even if you one of the people who dont love looking up for many tutorials and guides to play a game. this game briliant once you play it you cant get enought as some one who made more then 10 saves atleast and still every new game is more crazy then the other just the felling from making your first city with one population all the way to a huge empire with an advanced army. i highly reccomend this game to everyone no metter what types of game you love action,adventure or any other type this game is fun for everyone.",2
"one of the better games ive played, great replay ability rate.",1
"fun strategy game that is only really worth it if you have the dlcs.",1
"like excel and powerpoint combined but with better ui - illasera 8.5/10 without dlc/expansions 10/10 with dlc/expansions.",1
"without brave new world this game sucks  i want my madoka back",1
"very fun strategy game that had me hooked for quite awhile. simpler than some in its category, but it is really fun.",2
"this game... omg this game! its the first game ive ever managed to play for 8 hours straight without ever getting bored... that ought to tell you something about it",1
"after a long series of backstabbings, had the pleasure of dancing on gandhis corpse. vishnu/10",1
"this is probably the best strategy game ever. if you like strategy games, you should, no, you must buy this. its fun and very, very addicting.",1
"nice tbs game, good for those that like really long matches.",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. unlimited hours of gameplay.",1
"great 4x timesink. easy to get into with plenty of depth for when you get better. so-so multiplayer, as with all civilization titles. ai can be lacking but its competent on higher difficulties with bonuses. both expansions are totally worth it.",4
"not good game do not buy its nothing like real world cant even play as the obama wtf? if riot made this game u could play as the obama but not this game! i think that civ5 really missed the ball on this one better luck next time in civ 6 gl also dont buy dont forget.",1
"was worried itd be too complex to play, but its magnificently streamlined.. also i can run it on a 2.20ghz 4gb ram intel integrated graphics (4500mhd) laptop smooth enough to actually be enjoyable.. plus any game that allows me to create a religion called bill nyehilism is top notch, no questions asked!",1
"fun but make sure you get at least the brave new world dlc or it wont be as fun. if you can, get the complete edition and dont be dumb like me. the total dlc seperate is over $100 but with the compelete edition its an awesome price of $49.99.",1
"henry ford the great russian engineer appeared in moscow.",1
"an excellent new version of the game. the new rule of only one military unit per tile seems strange at first, but ultimately makes for more strategic gameplay. this is definitely one of those games that will have you thinking ok, only one more turn and then finding yourself still playing hours later. strongly recommend to anyone who enjoys the civilization series or strategy empire games. 9.5/10",1
"if someone asked me what game i would reccomend to introduce them to pc gaming, i would immediatly reccomend this. this has been one of the more involving and rewarding games i have ever played, and would reccomend it to anyone. i will go ahead and say that if you have never played a similar game to this before, there is a pretty steep learning curve that will at first be overwhelming, but power through and you will understand why this game recieves such high praises.",1
"oh  its 2 oclock id better finish up just one more turn oh  its 6 am",1
"10pm: its getting late, i should probably think about logging off 11pm: ill just settle this dispute and then ill get to bed 3am: just...one...more...turn",2
"i tried getting into this game, tried living through and understanding the mass of the text walls but... its boring, thats all i can say.",1
"missing a few good old features from the 4rth, but still a really good game. some new features, like the 1 unit per case and the hexagonal format, are pretty great and change a lot of things when thinking about strategy. for thos who miss the religions, i also recommend the expansion, kings and god.",3
"great game. have been playing civ since the first one and this is certainly the best in the series. highly recommended!!",4
"i love this game. the reason i dont recommend it is youll end up doing nothing all day because of this game. i usually play this on hotseat mode with a friend and one time, i was nearly charged of kidnapping because she stayed in the house for 36 hours.",1
"never trust japan. this game is amazing and i had trouble leaving the computer for so long only because of this game. the expansions completely changes up the game and so when you think youre done, you try g&ks or bnw and instantly the game feels fresh. truly and amazing games that is worth the 1000s of hours youll end up having put itno it.",1
"definitely worth buying! especially during the steam sales! insane amount of replayability! good buy",4
"in my humble opinion civilization has gone worse with each number. if we take a look at the direction, the change is obvious. the game has changed from historical and real to silly and toy/cartoon like. the game has changed from diverse into stupified for those who play console games. lots of options have been taken away on each civ. i want to choose to have 50 aztec civ on super small map if i so like. who are the game makers to say i cant? instead they decide what you want. no thanks.",1
"hands down on of the most effective turn-based games ive played in a long time. only downside is in large player matches...fighting against other people eats up a serious amount of time.",2
"i purchased this game during a summer steam sale with my roommate, and had no idea what to expect. 12 hours later and we were still playing late into the morning, even with work and class just a couple hours away. while it might not have been the smartest decision of our life, this game was worth every penny and every minute of sleep lost; over 600 hours later and i still havent had close to enough. whether youre a newcomer to the series or a civilization veteran, i cant recommend this game anymore highly to anyone who thinks they have the capacity to enjoy a solid rts. the expansions of gods & kinds and especially brave new world add many needed mechanics and empires that turn an incredible game into an amazing masterpiece, great for singleplayer and multiplayer fans alike.",4
"amazing game. tons of fun with friends, or alone. hundreds of hours of gameplay, and many many different ways to play. 9/10",2
"long term playabiliy... i keep coming back to this again and again. destined to be a classic. the dlc is usually well thought out too, but not really necessary to enjoy the game. if you like strategy and war games, this is the king of the pile...",3
"loved playing civilization revolution on the xbox 360 so i decided to get a newer version. visuals are awesome, much more indepth and you compete against more then just 3 rival civs. the leaning curve was tricky to begin with but with all the pop ups (which you can turn off) that give you tips and explain stuff for you really helped. this game is amazing for people that want abit of longevity to their games. maybe wait for a sale. i paid 20 though and i think it was worth it.",1
"recieved a notice that attila the hun had just declared war on mahatma ghandi. chuckled, and kept doing science. four turns later, satellites picked up six icbms arcing across the sky. shortly followed by the entire hunnic empire bursting into radioactive flames. recieved another notice the next turn. attila has surrendered to ghandi. ten out of  ten.",1
"a good game if you get it on sale. civilization 5 introduced many new mechanics that i found very welcome, hex based tiles, one unit per square, but unfortunately took away multiplayer modding. you cannot play mods in multiplayer, i cannot stress this enough. what made civilization iv so great were the mods and this game just does not have them. a very unacceptable oversight. crappy launch but the game holds up ok now. especially with the two expansions. however, even after the expansions civilization 5 continues to have graphic issues with texture popping and still has a poorly optimized engine that will be a burden even on some higher end systems.",2
"this tbs (turn-based strategy) game is probably the latest and greatest of its genre. there is a good reason the civilization game series has had 5 releases, because they are great games which reek of success. it should be noted however that these types of games are not for everyone. this game is most approprate for those who have a real appreciation for strategy and possess a lot of patience.",3
"love this game its where you get to form your own empire and go from the stone age to the space age with so many world leaders and figures like george washington, ghandi, bismarck, and many more. so many different possibilities its just a wonderful game",1
"please buy the complete edition of this game. the dlcs are what makes this game so addicting and fun",1
"its civilization so what really needs to be said about it that hasnt already. really the most important thing to know is this has to be one of the easiest to get into.there is so much stuff that easy to find when you need it but not in your face when you dont. you can far better understand what your units are able to do, and moving them around feels like a really good of chess sort of. plus you have so many ways to win that you almost always get some thing new to play with.",1
"one of the deepest yet most accessible strategy games, civ v is superb - i do recommend you get the gameplay-enhancing expansions to get the true experience, though.",1
"this game is the . it has destroyed me many times but i always come back with proper planning.",4
"if youve ever wanted to rule the world . . . .this game is for you. if youve ever wondered what developing a god complex is like, yeeeup. are you the type of person that would, if handed the reigns of civilization, put its full focus toward the development of fusion powered robots; just to satisfy a grudge from when denmark laid siege to your city and then denounced you in front of that cute celtic warrior gal? if so, i think you know what you must do. kiss your family and friends goodbye, forget about your dreams, plans, and aspirations; and play one more turn.",1
"the first time i tried civ 5, i wasnt much of a fan of the strategy genre of games. that was until i play civ 5. it just simply has profoundly amazing gameplay, stunning graphics, and the replayability is great for trying out different styles of playing the game. it has exceeded my expectations, and i highly reccomend it.",1
"i bought this games code on amazon and it wont even open. so, do i reccommend? no. its a scam and a waste of my money and time.",1
"really fun, and really addicting once you really get into it.",1
"a verry fun game if youre into turn-based strategy games. worth the money! 8/10.",1
"if you get this game, you wont be sing much of your firends or family anymore.... them, you have an empire to rule. 10/10",2
"i think this game is a great stragity game and i love ot",1
"buy this game and it will eat your brains. 0/10 needs shrek civ",1
"beautiful game i normaly dont like this kind of games but civilization realy is a very nice made game which has so many tools to play with. a absolute 9/10 a exelent game",1
"i have played enough to say my opinion. this game is amazing in every single way. from war to science. just amazing :d and to make it even better :d try to challenge yourself. difficulty to the top :d recommended",1
"super duper game, even more so with friends. 5* to sid",1
"once spent 16 hours in one siting, winning, only to be nuked by gandhi and lose. 10/10 would spend another 250 hours playing",2
"buy this game so you can fight the genocidal tyrant mohandas gandhi with your best bros genghis khan, attila the hun, and harald bluetooth of the vikings. also shoshone for life.",2
"this game is beautiful. does it really need another recomendation? im sure youve heard of it or seen gameplay. one of hte absolute best turn-based stratgey game. p.s. if you get the gods and kings expansion, be prepared to look at an ugly pubic haired jesus wanna-be staring off into the sunset wandering where his life went wrong every time you start the game up... freaking hated seeing his face.",1
"just......................one.......................more...................turn.",1
"awsome game, you can just play it for hours and not get bored. some things are a bit to over powerd but you almost have to play this game. edit: the dlc are really worth buying. i bought them on sale so if i was you. i would wait for a good sale or something that could drive the price down.",1
"started playing these when civ iii was given to me as a birthday present. continued playing these and definitely wont stop with this one. yet another great work in the sid meiers series.",1
"this game is a game. someone told me to get this game. it is game.",1
"an extensive and deep strategy game that is easy to learn and consistently fun. a large array of content, enhanced by numerous dlc packs, a blast with friends, singleplayer can drag over time. relaxing in times of peace, and thrilling in war.",1
"never played any of the previous civilization games, but everyone kept telling me to give civilization v a try, so i did. at first i found it kind of confusing. a lot of things to keep an eye on, but after a couple of hours of play id figure it all out and i was hooked! great game! has provided me with many hours of great fun! just one more turn...",1
"this is a spectacular and deep strategy game for those of you with a couple (read: a ton) of hours to spare. its various map generation settings, well-functioning hotseat and online multiplayer modes, plethora of unique and interesting civilzations to play as, and varying routes to victory will keep one entertained for hundreds upon hundreds of turns. one note- the complete edition is a must-buy. gods and kings and brave new world are instrumental to having the best civ experience, as they add awesome features and necessary balance, improving the game greatly.",3
"one of the most wonderful games ive played in ages, while also being humanities first sucsessful attempt at time travel!",2
"best game to play while doing other things. i have enjoyed this game since the first one came out (used floppy discs to install). play this while miniature painting. love turn based games.",1
"so addicting...i cant stop playing....this game cant be healthy for you. so much fun!!!",1
"as the inca, i allied with kamehameha and conquered everyone. sadly, my warmongering spree was ended by gandhis nukes. 999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10 would get nuked again.",2
"the game is a dream, what else to say. it is a pity that in addition to the presence of pain in the  of the enemy, and the fact of robbery hunting traders little useful.  of",1
"brilliant game. civ 5 has a very good single player experience, although is amazing with friends in multiplayer. the only negative i have for this game is that as of yet, there seems to be no way to make the multiplayer ai any more or less difficult. the only way to change the pace would be to put a handicap on yourself. to get the full experience of the game, i suggest getting both of the expansion packs also, as this doubles the games content and replay ability. i highly recommend this game to anyone.",2
"this game is great. only posting this for the awards",1
"lets trust the peaceful ghandi. famous last words. 10/10 words.",1
"just gonna play a quick friday night game aaaaand its monday morning... seriously addictive. crappy ai though.",2
"sick strategy game i reccomend that anyone interested in games such as total war should get it great fun! :d",1
"best strategy game on steam. recommend to everyone who loves a turn based strategy game with tons of content and endless replayability.",3
"very good game, a big improvement over the first game in my opinion.",1
"so gandhi approached me, and i was like, hell yeah, lets be friends with gandhi! he became gandhi the terrible of india. what. the actually. heck. other than that, a really fun strategic game that you probably need a looong time to finish.",1
"this game will have you addicted for hours. soon you will have no life. 10/10 great buy!",1
"one of the best games ever played, is so fun with friends but is also fun on single player. the long hours put into one game makes it very rewarding once the game has finally finished what i love about this game.",1
"epic game. if you like strategy games you must have it,but you have to put up with lots of waiting turns until it gets interesting",1
"a brill strategy game that can lead you away from boredom anytime, anywhere.",1
"i am enjoying this game when playing it with friends, well, for the most of the time. will recommend it if you got people to play with in multiplayer. games can take quite some time though depending on the speed you choose and if you wanna finish it in one sitting then prepare for 20 hours of a day spent...or maybe even more.",1
"this is a rather fun game. soundtrack is very good. sometimes i pause my other music so that i can take in the sights and sounds of the immersive world that is sid meirs civilization(r) v. sometimes the game feels drawn out. 2/3.",1
"ghandi has completed the manhattan project! no no no no",3
"i dig this game, its challenging took me some time to become profficient, not a typical rts",1
"the pyramids were built by the swedish people... in the ocean... historically accurate, fun, and is addictive to play.",1
"this game is one of my favorite strategy game! like c&c!",2
"this is an amazing game, i would recommend buying it. if you do buy it, make sure you have friends to play it with as it is much more fun with friends.",1
"if youre reading this, and have not yet purchased this, go do it now. thank me later.",1
"you can be that chilling dude, or you tear apart everyone. your call.",1
"i like this game i have over 7,567 hours on my potato",1
"ive only played 10 hours and this game is  amazing. careful to not get stuck in the just one more turn loop if youre playing alone... ive legitimately lost sleep because of how kickass this game is. in that 10 hours i still havent finished a normal game. i think im in the medieval era still, so be prepared for some long  games if you set it to normal game length.",1
"this is a pretty good game when you want to retell history so that the aztecs ed over the germans and then the united states joined forces with the russian queen. pretty good, i like hurting history books.",1
"its a good game. unless you have played civ 4 complete... ;-) in solo, it feels furiously easy & basic & limited when compared to civ 4, especially at end game wheres not much to do anymore. there are a good bunch of nice improvements over civ 4 (mainly: better visual, more accessible, more easy to get into), but the core gameplay has been dumbed down. moreover, its slow. it does less than civ4, but waiting ai players between turn is much longer.",1
"this is an amazing strategy game, i recommend it to all critical gamers.",2
"for the power of kamelot i can say that its the best game ever. and if you will buy brave new world, you will get a lot of fun and i think that you should buy this game.",1
"great game, still playing for hours per week. still miss some of the features of civ4, like slave states, etc. could really use some additional diplomatic options (like demanding surrender, slave states). and what i havent encountered yet in this version, in older versions if a huge empire lost its capital, it split up in two adding a new nation to the game. would be nice if that feature was also introduced again, or in case of unhappiness for a long time, certain cities rebel and form their own nation (which is actually how many nations were formed).",2
"i always wonder why i ever played this game. then, i realized that it is played en masse because that is the games nature- to have you waste an entire day trying to better ais in a cpu generated world. is this my reason, i cannot say. but i can say that it is worth a hundred hours of gameplay.",1
"my wife left me, i got fired, my dog hasnt been fed in weeks and all my other bills have gone unpaid for several months. twice i have been questioned by the police after my mother filled in a missing persons report. 10/10 this game is addictive.",1
"this is the best turn-based game that ive played. it has lots of civs with unique bonuses, good ais, multiple different ways to win, and good graphics. overall, its just about as good as it gets.",1
"ive been playing the civs since version iii. though i dont play on-line (just for my own enjoyment) i really like these games. civ v carries on that tradition. at first i didnt care for it compared to civ iv, but after giving it a fair shot, i really like it and highly endorse it for those who enjoy these types of games. ;o)",2
"good game if u like turn based rts games but get all the dlc as the original is balls",1
"this is the best game i have played in the last few years. the expansions make the game even better. it still does have some problems with the ai and combat.",1
"this game is probably the best timesink ive ever encountered. i play it with a friend almost once or twice a week for hours on end, and it really doesnt get boring.",2
"this is the perfect game when you feel like, changing history. me myself, ive been a fan of history since childhood and never once, in my life, that i ever think about changing it. after this game arrived, history turned upside-down and inside-out. japan atom-bombed america, england liberated from indian colonialists, germany won ww1, and russia is in africa. best history-bound, turn-based strategy game ever. 10/10",1
"very hard to understand at first, but then you learn to love it 10/10",1
"this is a game that is easy to come back to on those quiet nights. every play through is different because of all the combinations of ways to win. this is especially fun in multiplayer but turns can start to take a really long time as the game progresses.",1
"ive been a civilization addict since civ3 i think...i hate to guess how many hours of my life have been spent on this game...just one more turn!!!",2
"a turn based strategy game, civilization v continues the classic civilization series.",1
"needless to say, civ v is a quality product - tons of content, hours, and i mean hours of gameplay, all wrapped in beautiful graphics and sound. brilliant.",1
"what you have here is the cleanest, best looking, smoothest playing, most tactically enjoyable version of the deepest and most addictive strategy game of all time. -cvg magazine. +1",1

"great game so good i bought it twice once on xbox and once on pc",1
"civilization v is the fifth game of a successful turn-based strategy series where you choose a civilization to rule the world. you have a lot of ways to achieve victory; from dominating other players to launching a spaceship, among others. the major improvement here is the new hex-based geography that provides a lot of new strategies and makes the game flow beautifully and look better than ever. civ v is the best for newcomers too. ui is very intuitive and the game has a lot of tips to help you in your first steps. also, this game has steam workshop support, which means you can easily download maps, custom civilizations and mods from the community. with the expansions gods and kings and brave new world, civilization v became one of the best in series. i highly recommend civ v, specially if you want to start playing the 4x genre (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate). one more turn!",1
"one of the best games i have played. i highly recommend checking this out, and on sale, woah, youll regret not.",2
"when i first got a pc this was the game i was wanting most. i have spent contless hours offline just trying to do it all. i love the game in ways i can never decribe. if you enjoy any other civ game (even civ revolution) get this game.",1
"one of favorite games, a little crashy at times but still fun!",2
"finallz after the brave new world expansion civ v really shines, i was initiallz disappointed when civ v first came out as it lacked many features that were present in civ iv with its expansions. with gods & kings and brawe new world the game is at last what is should have been then. a rethought and upgraded civ iv with some new features not present in the previous installement. a great game, too bad we needed to wait 3 years for it to be upgraded to be just that.",4
"if this game was a pineapple , it would be a very nice pineapple that strips you to a chair and gives your  a thorn job when you suddenly look up and realised you waisted your life away in hopes to give some retribution to the pakistanian army , however you failed to win and died by barberians who made a peace treaty with ghandii. dont even get me started on the culture you can choose a social polecy on the second round and.....ghandi has nukes gg.",1
"people talk about its chops as a strategy game all the time, but its actually at its best as an unintentional comedy simulator. ghandi the bloodthirsty dictator! stanley kubrick, that great medieval japanese artist! spartacus, the austrian general and inventor of the jeep! okay, but no, its great. buy it, get addicted, hate yourself.",1
"meets ghandi. 20 turns later invades city state. 60 turns later ghandi declares war. 200/20",1
"its like a giant game of super chess where you play as a historical leader. you must trade control social policies and fend off the advances of the evil warmongering nuclear fueled ghandi,the epitome of terror. 10/10",1
"you get to piss your day away, but in a good sense. dont forget to invade all of the city states. 10/10, beware of gandhi.",1
"endless replay potential hence the ~1000 hours logged... :/",5
"the best strategy games/series... one of the best games. will keep you entertained for hundreds of hours. puts the best of military strategy together with things like cultural and technological strategy and adds diplomacy (a little lacking but game play makes up for it) to create one of, if not the, best games i have ever played. the internal improvements, such as wonders and buildings, and choosing how to shape your civilization towards a certain victory condition even adds to the strategy. throw in the goty edition, along with g&k and bnw and you have a highly developed and emerged strategy game that will give you thousands of hours of entertainment. each civilization gives you a completely different experience and there are hundreds upon hundreds of combinations you can try. the dlc may get a little pricey, and the ai has some issues, but it is still, by far, one of my favorite games.",3
"classic empire building game. timeline goes from the stone ages up until you colonize space. ive been playing some version of this game for 25 years (yikes). civ 5 looks good but is resource intense for some older computers. ive wasted a lot of my life playing this game.",2
"i just watched ghandi nuke alexander the great. 20/10 pls buy",1
"so much fun in a single game :-d i love this game !!!",1
"i love this game, it is a great game, but civ 4 was better and more complex, this is easier than civ 4 and the ai does need alot of work considering its backstabing and the ability to not make true longlasting friends with the ai as a ally.",3
"perhaps the best strategy game ive ever played. great game and if you liked the other civ games then you will enjoy this one.",1
"got this about 4 weeks ago. invested heavily in dlc. didnt regret those investments. one thing i would suggest is to buy bnw and g&k when theyre on sale because, you know, they are the same price as the base game. 99/99.9 (that extra .99 i dont like is because of the dlc cost)",1
"i love this game and have dedicated almost 600hrs to it....yeah i know thats kind of sad. the only thing i would have liked to of seen is in civ 4. you started out in the location on an earth map where your civ was historically located. and played through time to see if you could make your civ survive history. thought that would have been nice too",4
"playing as japan and conquering everything. nuked by gandi would play and get nuked again 11/10",1
"the history of the most fun simulation game series of new works. buy it!!",1
"laid back, slow-pased strategy game. its a bit of a combination between the board games: risk, and colonists of catan. for me its the ideal game to pass a weekend where you just dont feel like getting away from your computer. even if its still 30 euros. very much worth it.",1
"a very fun and addicting game, anything can happened and it keeps you from getting bored.",2
"i mean, its civilization. if youve played one before, you know the general gist of things. i will say that i enjoy the move to hextiles over the squares previously seen, and i actually like some of the more controversial changes, such as not being able to stack an infinite number of units into a single tile. since i tend to play more for non-militaristic victories, the changes in civ v have, for the most part, not been things i have issues with. if youre into conquest as your main mode of play, maybe not for you. but if you mostly play a balanced game or go for a non-violent path, then i think youll enjoy the upgrade. make sure you pick it up with the two expansion packs, as it adds an enjoyable depth with trade, religion and culture without adding too much complexity.",1
"if you area fan of any time of stratgey game weather it be real-time or turn by turn, civ 5 and it expansions are a game to certianly pick up. dont fall for the new reskin that they are putting out (beyond earth). civ 5 will be around for a long time",1
"its civ. you just take a couple of . . . its civ. 92%",1
"a great updated version of a classic game. in depth, great graphics, an amazing game.",1
"this game is great with both expansions. i do like it but it does have drwbacks. 1. the ai is still . it doesnt always develope land and seems militarily stupid at times. and 2. the difficulty setting work by making the ai cheat: it adds food gold and culture to every ai city. this means that an ai city can have 13 pop and a huge influence area while surounded by jungle with no improvements on the tiles. i hope civ 6 is very different from this game. i do reccomend this. but the next iteration needs to have a very differnt a.i. and difficulty system.",1
"civilization v continues the new look of civilization series. many upgrades from civ iv include hexagonal grid, cities fighting back, one unit per tile and so forth. the game is positive upgrade from civ iv and along with the new expansions gnk and bnw the game adds much more elements to the gameplay. overall the game is great. one more turn.",3
"this game is one of the best strategy games out there. its from the master of turn based strategy, sid meier. i give it 12 out of 10. a definitive must have!",4
"awesome game, many choices of winning and different leaders to play. can play for hours without stopping",1
"probably my favorite game of all time and has great replayability. i love the strategy involed as well as the different ways you can win the game. i highly recommend.",2
"get the complete edition... its fukken worth it eventho you already has the base game with some dlc...",1
"this game is for anyone who whanted to change history in there owned way",1
"civ v is a very good game to play both solo and multiplayer. just beware that it will make days many hours shorter than 24 hours!!!",5
"sunk nearly 600 hours into this game, still find it deep and rewarding, best current 4x game on the market 10/10, concentrates on civilization building, not just warfare.",3
"a good game with some good ideas. however the ai is still severely lacking (especially after playing betterai with civilization 4). the new happiness system is still really hard to use. the ai receives bonuses in this regard (and with most other things too)",1
"i will write this in a minute  just one more turn  if you know that feeling then this game is definitely for you :d",1
"only good for some hours as a bargain. did not evolve much.",1
"as with the previous civilizations fromm 1 to 4 civ 5 is an extremely addictive game. very good graphs and the amazing thing is how balanced it is compared to civ 4. from the beggining till the end of one of your games you get what i call the one more turn... disease. you need to close your pc and do your work or go to sleep and you say ok 1 more turn and ill close it. 3 hours later you watch the clock and say oh my god!.. ok 1 more turn and ill close it... highly recomended even for children, since its also an educational game, as long as you can control them! :)",1
"played the tutorial for 1 hour 40, realised i couldnt save, had to start over, cba.",1
"taken a lot of pleasure from civilization v and its two expansion. however, i do not recommend the base version without both the gods&kings and brave new worlds expansion packs, they greatly improve balancing and general game play this is a conditional thumbs up",5
"an absolutley awesome game. huge improvements over the civ iv series especially now with the new expansion. i love the new hex tiles and the only one unit per hex rule. it really adds more to the game strategy. i sometimes take a break for a couple of months but then im back to play a few games. i love it because every time i get a new map. every game is unpredicable. every game im trying a different strategy.",1
"civilization ruined my sleep schedule and made me hate gandhi. best personal moment? when every single nation went to war with atilla and i got to sing mulans be a man. ten outta ten",1
"this franchise has long been one of the best in the strategy genre and the fifth installation is nothing less than spectacular. the change to a single unit (of type) per hex changes gameplay significantly. however, i found that once i adapted it enhanced the game greatly.",1
"excellent game.i started playing on civ 2 and have played each one (2,3 &4) to death, i expect that civ 5 will be the same. :)",1
"ive always been a fan of the civilization series and in my mind, this is the best in the series. i think that the new game mechanics are for the best. this is a great game and is extremely addicting. i love this game, and i hope you do too.",1
"since everyone else is placing their reviews, and having around 30-50 hours of gametime, i figured id put my word in and close the time gap. this game is amazing, you will not regret getting it. its not a waste of time, nor is it a waste of money. this game will have you playing it over and over repeatedly. replay value? definately a lot. in fact, if you were to buy this game right now, and youve liked the gameplay videos and screenshots, im positive youd like to play the game for yourself. go ahead and buy it if its your cup of tea! its very fun, and youll enjoy yourself. :)",4
"this has everything you need to conquer all of civilization and just have the best time being stabbed in the back then nuking your once allies. good memories...",3
"it is soooooooooooo awesome!!! no, but seriously, you got to play this. psssst. play it!!!",1
"if rtss arent your thing, this game does the job, no zerg rushing, just ghandi and his mission to destroy your life and civilization. so remember to rip out and eat his heart to gain his courage, his tasty courage....",2
"one more turn addiction, check. lots of nations and emergent storylines, check. send people to thier deaths in the name of religon, just like in real life, check. annoying advisors, check. unlimited replay value, check. should purchase, check.",1
"if you like turn based, emprire building, stratigies games you will love this game!",4
"one more turn then ill go to sleep. 750 hours later....",5
"finished installing at 1am, ended up watching the opening scene. next thing i know its 4 hours later and everyone on the map hates me. 10/10",1
"i must say its a must have! lots of hours in this game and its cool! buy it!",2
"this game is so good its the best tbs ever i have ever played and ive played about 2 so this game is about 12/10",1
"one of the best strategy games i have ever played.",2
"i cant stop playing. send help. also, never trust the ai. ever.",3
"didnt sleep for 72 hours, but denamark is dead now so 10/10.",1
"one of the best strategy games out there. the dlcs are pricey, but 35 for the base game + all dlc is a good deal in my opinion. would definitley recommend this to anyone looking for a fun strategy game! :)",1
"well, its not a bad game at all when it comes to strategy. if you are a person who likes strategy games, this one is for you. however, it does require some patience when it comes to playing on multiplayer, because it is a turn-based game. this is also a really hard game because you need to monitor many things such as the number of citizens you have in a city, or how many turns are left until the next building is completed. actually, its not a bad thing because its a challenge to learn how to multi-task and monitor. in overall, its a challenging game that requires a lot of experience, but you can learn to do things all at once at most strategy games if you master this game.",1
"oh my god i spent 2.49 on this in the summer sale two years ago thinking it would run its course of being fun for a while and then give up on me after a few months yet it didnt, i love this game so much it is soooo addictive!",1
"a lot of good changes in this game. square tiles to hexes, ai seems to be better, one unit per tile, units being a little more valuable, etc. grab it when its on sale, though, much like how you should be getting every other steam game.",1
"this game can suck you in so much, its kinda scary. the game has a few technical problems (wrong textures on certain pieces of the map, the ai takes a while to process turns in larger games) but it is still and excellent game that warrents your attention! it has a great modding community as well, which can help keep the game fresh as you go through it. the massive expansion packs (specifically brave new world, which at the moment this review was made, is the latest major dlc pack) also change the game completely, with bnw making the game as far as i am concerned, better than civ iv, which is pretty hard to do as it was my favourite up to that point. do yourself a favour and buy this game, you will not regret this purchase!",4
"great game, love it. indepth strategy and great turn based playing.",1
"just one more turn.... *72 hours later* 10/10 easily the best turn-based strategy game on steam.",1
"highly reccomended at sale prices for its incredible replayability. 40 hours in and counting!",1
"an excellent game spoiled badley by the fact that it crashes more than a zx80 on a warm day !",2
"awesome game, great polish and presentation, very easy to get started, and can really eat up your time into the wee hours of the night, in a fun way. with the newer patches, the game has become very strong in all modes. playing with friends is a blast. it gets better with time, and the new scenarios help mix up single player and add value to the dlc. all the civ dlc is pretty good, nebuchadnezzar is not quite worth it however. the map packs are a bit weak, as maps are random normally, and you can get map mods for free if you want specific maps. the developers are really showing this game love and support, so give it a chance.",1
"civ v is probably the best looking and most enjoyable game in the civilization series, plus major updates to gameplay every few months. very worth it, buy it!",1
"slow and meticulous but draws you in. fun like risk with friends on a late saturday night.",1
">napoleon declares a public friendship agreement with me >allright.jpg >next turn >napoleon denounces me >napoleon declares war against me >i attack his troops and defeat them >napoleon begs for peace and gives me 500 gold along with 7 gold per turn 10/10 france surrendered",1
"nuking england as gandhi. 10/10 would radiate earth again.",1
"i love this game with everything that can happen in it. there are unlimited possibilities to what your civilization can turn into. as you can see with my hour record that i am an enthusiast of civilization v. tip for people with slow computeres: use a mod called quick turns, it allows you to play in 3d mode rather than strategic game board mode because it speeds up all the processes. and with the hundreds of games ive played with it, i have come across no problems.",4
"fantastic iteration of civ. probably the best one so far, make sure to get both expansion packs as they add a lot of depth and options you dont get with the base game, and these are essential for enjoying it to the fullest extent.",1
"my friend is really annoying and he plays this. 10/10",1
"this game is just like a dose of crystal meth. you take it once and you cant simply stop. your kids start starving, your friends start leaving you, and worst of all is that gandhi hates you!!! i just got the game yesterday and i already have 8 hours played on it. yes, i know im a sad individual. it is really fun and it is an awesome strategy game (especially for 7.5$; thank you gaben).the only downside is that the game freezes 45 minutes in a multiplayer game (hopefully itll be fixed soon). 10/10 would marry. oh yeah, and say bye to your life while youre at it.",1
"this game is awesome!!! fantastic graphics, mechanics games and very complex.civilization have very much leaders are more attractive gameplay.diplomatic and spy is great! and strategic war is very intresting.nothing only playing days and nights :d",1
"just reached 24 hours of gameplay and im still loving this game!",1
"once you get into this game, a whole new world opens up, where you first only saw some numbers, fresh strategies appear. its also relatively easy to learn, so dont be intimidated.",4
"where do i begin? the countless nights ive stayed up playing this game? the fact that im thinking about my current game at work and devising a counter attack? this game is addicting. do not get it if you dont have time to play. as a turn-based strategy game it gives you enough time to think about what the best course to take would be and then act on it. this doesnt mean its slow or boring though. ive sunk a couple hundred hours into it and theres still things im learning about. i highly, highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone (except maybe cod players).",2
"what can i say about civilization v? hmmm... its mother flippin amazing!!! i may have not played that much but you dont need to! you get soo addicted so quick! just buy it already!!! 9/10",1
"civ v is a game that i would recommend for anyone interested in strategy games. the building of your own empire is something i had been looking for in a game for a long time, and the fun only grows if you can convince your friends to play along!",3
"im into to history and war and stuff like dat so this is perfect for me xd !!!!!!!!!!",1
"love the versatility and unique play styles of each leader and love the ability to play with my friends online and the drop in drop out is wonderful",1
"one of my favorite games ever i could play this games for hundreds of hours and never get bored, especially if im playing with a friend. highly reccomend 11/10",1
"i have spent far too much time on this game, simply because i enjoy the style of gameplay. after many times of playing it becomes slightly monotonous, but it is still highly enjoyable thanks to the different environments and opponents. i would still recomend this game, due to the fun i had conquerring other civilizations.",2
"this is by far one of the best turn based games ive played. whether its trying to get more delegates for the next world congress, warding npcs or other players off your borders, or fending off the all-too-many barbarians, theres always something to do, and it gets even better with friends.",1
"as a bad rts player, i recommend civilization as it is turn-based ;). anyway, the nation you guide in the game, organized in cities, has a very deep but easily approachable management system, and advancing through the game is very satisfactory.",1
"when civ 5 came out, i didnt like it at all. i still wouldnt like it, if not for the exceptional expansions that address pretty much every flaw (except the ai, which i still find a bit silly, but i find almost all ai flawed) its friendly and fair to the new civ players, and has enough content to keep the veterans occupied. i especially loved the scenarios.",1
"very awesome game, great graphics. i cant wait to try civ 5 beyond earth :d",1
"when i originally got this game i was turnned off by the turns. as i started playing i was pleasentely supprised at how much fun it turned out to be.",1
"if you like strategy and changing the past, then youll love this game. go for complete package so you dont have to spend 50 more dollars.",1
"one of the most addicting games ive ever played. this game is a must for anyone who loves strategy games. i highly reccomend it.",1
"every time i open this game i lose 8 hours of my life. its kind of fun when youre waiting for the next day for whatever reason, but it has taken a toll on my livelihood. 10/10",1
"i want this game so mush. one of the best games i have ever played but dont have the money for can some one gift it to me :) :(",1
"i wish i could add more npc players to the game without it actually making it harder for me to win. whats the default for a normal-sized map? like, six players? well, on the right difficulty setting, thats a fun challenge; not too easy, and not to frustratingly difficult like it could be if there were more players to complete world wonders before me and things like that. having more civilizations in one game makes it seem deeper and more varied, though! it adds flavor. i wish i could add, like... secondary civilizations, (from the full list, not just city-states, because city-states are boringly two-dimensional), but just have them kind of suck, so that im only playing against like five or so empires that are actually challenging to overcome. is that a strange request?",2
"how to people get bored with this game? i mean, seriously, aztec xcom soldiers, while atomic bombs are launched from montezuma. where in the world can you get that? waiiiiit.... just... one.... more.... turn....",1
"a worthy successor to the grand-daddy of the 4x genre. the brave new world expansion really changes the game, and makes you care about city-state diplomacy in ways you never had to before.",2
"whats there to say? its civ v. rts juggernaut. its a great game, although there are a few flaws. specifically, the ai is weird. it doesnt act like youd expect. theres no way to game them or be strategic about it at all. you just cant piss anyone off, or you are basically on a losing battle to craft alliances. thats why i always go it solo and do my best to outgun/research everyone else. otherwise, i dont know how to win personally, but im not great at rts games anyway. if you do get this (i do recommend it obviously), just keep the above in mind.",1
"you will find yourself saying where did the last 20 hours go as youre sitting around at 1am on a sunday. just saying.",3
"this is civilization at its best. (with all addons) what else can be said? the geographic importance of landscape and non stockable units make this version a lot better than other episode in my opinon.",2
"if you like board games or stradegy games this is 4 u!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",1
"this is the most entertaining strategy game ive ever played. even though im somewhat of a latecomer, its never to late to join the party :3. so much replay value, and the dlcs are definately worth the investment, especially gods & kings expansion. so if your a fan of turned based strategy or even just strategy have a look at this!",1
"dont buy this game, its too addictive. its like trading your soul with the devil, i want my life back.",2
"for those who knows how to think! not best in series but almost incredible with new dlc.",1
"fantastic game. a strong contender for the pen-ultimate strategy. need proof? this game is four years old, with two expansions at two and one year(s) old respectively, and is still on of the most played games on the steam network. between the large amount of dlc and the endless library of mods there is little to be left wanting from this game. in the end, with modern graphics and a more polished ui it is a strong contender, if not a guaranteed, to be the best in the series. it may not be complex as the the first couple of iterations, the more streamlined gameplay leaves for a more widely applicable and fun stlye. if you have any interest in turn based strategy, get this game, ask questions later. give it time, it may take a while to get the hang of it.l",3
"in theory, civilization doesnt appeal to me. but in practice? i have played the game for hours on end, unwilling and unable to stop. it sucks you in and doesnt let you go. i cant comment as to any changes from previous civ games to v and brave new world, as this is my first civ game to play. but i really enjoy the culture based victory. its the ultimate passive-aggressive way to win, imo. i may not have tons of soldiers. but look at my art!",1
"civilization 5 is a game in where you, the player, control an entire nation. what they didnt tell you is that a barbarian can kill a huge god damn tank. 1000000/10",1
"blow up ghandi. rule as washington. do nothing with queen elizabeth. 10/10",1
"best turn-based large scale stratagy game of the current gen. the expansions add a lot and are worth the money (if they go on sale). play on a higher difficulty and challenge yourself. have not tried multiplayer very much, so i cannot comment on it. but as a single player time sink, its perfect.",1
"not a good game if you played previous civs. features were taken out and lazily implemented in expansion pack leading to a very lackluster experience. conquest seems to be the only way to win in this game because ai is . decent for a first timer but civ 4 is better.",1
"one of the best strategic board games out there. the hours will fly by as you play this game. i would recomend buying the game and dlc bundle if its on sale for a good discount. at 75% off, its totally worth buying!",1
"thanks civ v! now ill never have faith in inspirational world leaders like ghandi again 10/10",1
"this game is highly addictive...everything that you were use to in civ 4 was changed, the changes of course were amazing. of course i still suck at the game but hey im learning :p",1
"civ v is a more casual civ compared to the previous games in the series, however, it is still as addictive as ever and youll find yourself wondering where your day went every time you play.",1
"a well balanced and relaxing game. had most fun playing with friends.",1
"one of the most fun games i have played in a long time, but be warned! you will get hooked like an addict on gaming crack, and there are so many mods that enhance the game, even when you feel like youre done with the standard campaign (and thats without even mentioning the awesome multiplayer) :d would definitely recommend! 10/10",2
"very great game to play offline and with freinds, prefect for sitting back and relaxing.",1
"built a nuclear missile in 1870. 11/10 would logic again.",1
"have been playing for years and have never got bored of it, it is a must buy!!",2
"a very good stratigic game. takes lots of brain power to play! multiplayer works like a charm.",1
"gandhi denounced my civilization so i nuked every city in his empire 11/10",1
"great turn based strategy. very addictive with a lot of depth. a lot of replay value.",1
"simply amazing. for people new to civilization, this is a very intellectual and complex strategy game that never seems to get old. one playthrough is fairly short but i come back to it about once per month and play another. you can also customize the games so much that every time the game is a little bit different and i would challenge anyone to beat it on its hardest setting. for fans of the civ series, i believe they keep getting better. graphics improvements are great but i like the unit and tech changes, i would highly recommend it. also, the leader screens are a lot more involved and interesting. sadly they removed the city view but have the city change dynamically on the map. they also removed the throne room. not sure how i feel about those but at least they put spying and religion back in, in the expansions. definitely worth the money.",1
"good game, spent hours playing it to death. no regrets. the ai is somewhat stupid but the difficulty settings make it quite the challenge. lots of replayability and great multiplayer to go along with it.",5
"i not really sure how to play this game but it seems okay. -i like catherine...shes so perty. ..and op. -screw gandhai and the iriqouis -omg science! -china loves me. -greece is an idiot... -i have no idea what im doing. -one more turn. 10/10 would nuke, science, and catherine again.",3
"this is a great game, but it takes a lot of time to complete a game. and playing with friends is sometimes a nightmare because you have to finish the game online or meet each other in real life to finish the game. would rate 8 out of 10.",2
"this is a great turn based strategy game which when played correctly is very addictive and extremely fun. it can sometimes get boring but you can just leave it for a day or two and then get straight back to playing.",1
"ive had it ever since it came out and it is still one of my favorite games of all time. bnw is awesome and g&k is also awesome.",2
"its great if you have a weekend with nothing else to do, doesnt require a lot of concentration so you can put real effort into trolling your opponants :d",2
"this is the best turn-based stratagy i have played in a long time. the depth of the diplomacy systems is incredible and makes it feel far more realistic than any other game in its category. the variant victory types allows a large range of freedom in what you can focus your empire on. the tech system is amazing and makes sense, the culture system is undescribably better than anything like it, and the advisors give usful, if reppetitive, advice. can you build you empire to dominate the world?",1
"fun turn-based strategy. ive found enjoyment through singleplayer and multiplayer. singleplayer is not the average learn as you play campaign. instead, you can chose from a variety of scenarios and make custom games tweaked to your liking. easy to learn and gets you hooked instantly. multiplayer is probably the golden highlight of the game, despite the immersive singleplayer. invite friends and start a unique game of your own. choose from many different options to make your game fun for everyone. in my opinion, this game is only complete with the brave new world expansion pack while others such as gods and kings are nice, too. with over 40+ unique and powerful civilizations, making your own way of play is as easy as ever.",1
"why is the multiplayer so slow thats the only important part wow gj obama",1
"if you havnt played it, you need to. its a great strategy game that takes time that is well worth the investment. to say the least about it, it is one of those games that will make you say at some point, oh, ill only play another hour before going to bed. two days later, just one more hour. 10/10",3
"steam: none of your friends have played this game recently. tell them why they should. me: because its fun!",1
"so i dont have very many hours on this but let me tell you something this game is a game that you buy if you want to do nothing except this in your free time. this game is even better when you have a friend and you can just screw him over for the fun of it. 20/10 would buy again except i have no monies.",1
"if you are going to play this be sure to have alot of hours , yes literally some days it takes forever but when you have world domination nothing beats that felling. myself really enjoys spending countless hours on this game just because you get to conquer all in any way you want.",1
"a very addicting strategy game. very fun in singleplayer as well as multiplayer. definitely a great game for anybody who has a bit of time on their hands. :)",1
"this game is my life. seriously. a game takes a lifetime, and its awesome.",1
"the temptation that is a steam sale is too much for one with a will as weak as mine. at first you remember the strategy games you used to play, cnc, starcraft, lotr b4me. you then run the game to get serenaded by its wonderfully, eloquent intro. you then play the tutorial, as this game is more in depth than justin biebers social life. never did i think this game would suck up so many hours of my time. a tutorial, which took me a good 12 hours as i went and read what things do, and think of what i should do depending on the situation. you will learn to hate barbarians, you will learn to hate them, and then you will destroy them. the satisfaction of getting the barbarians away from your capital, and saving your first workers is just too much. if you play this game you will forget what day of the week it is, and realize that you got fired from your job for playing civ 5 for 3 days.",1
"so addictive (40 hrs in 5 days?!?!?), yet it lets you set your own pace because its turn-based strategy. i prefer this to rts games like aoe 3.",1
"this game is the best! it is one of the best stratigy games of all times. i highly recomed buying it.",1
"its a really cool game if you like strategy games. this is a really fun strategy game, that has action but also takes a ton of thought. one downside is it takes probably 12 hours minimum for each game.",1
"this is the most addicting game i have ever played. get it. get it twice, and give to someone you play games with. you will not be dissapointed, actually you will be negative dissapointed.",2
"endless hours...endless.. do not play on a work night.",1
"good game if you like to just kill time. really entertaining and challenging if you increase the difficulty but otherwise fairly easy.",3
"good game, lots of fun if you play with friends. but be aware this game consumes time like your fridge food. 10/10",1
"after a lot of patch and fixes, this game is finally incredible ! browse the workshop for useful and fun mods (such as doge as a nation) this game is as tasteful as fried potatoes with pop corn and bacon !",2
"this game will make you play for hours and hours and hours its nonstop fun!",1
"being a big fan of civilization, i can proudly say that this may be the best entry in the series. going from sqaures to hexagons adds a new layer of strategy. a great games to challenge friends in. id recommend this to newbies or long time strategy player.",1
"mongols built the great wall before getting overrun by chinese horsemen. irony 10/10.",2
"just give up on trying to go outside because this is the end....",1
"this game encourages you to be a complete psychopath. you will begin to laugh as you drown your enemies in their own blood, blowing up all their cities with nuclear missiles. and all they can do it watch helplessly as you crush the life out of everything they love. endless, boudless joy. every time.",2
"do u reallly have to ask why u should get this game its freaking awesome <3",4
"theres no other game like civilization when it comes to human civilization technological evolution. i have loved this franchise since i was a kid from the first game for pc. thank you for making such well developed strategic game, i spend many hours of enjoyment on it ; )",3
"dont be turned off by the fact that this is a turn based game. that was a mistake i made allot of times but now ill never make that same mistake again. i havent played any of the predecessors so it might or not be the best in the series but as a newcomer to civilization this game blew my mind! most definitely a must have!",1
"still a fantastic time killer. fun overall, but much better playing with/against friends.",1
"fantastic game, gods and kings only adds balance to an already amazing experience. highly recommend getting it if you like to watch something grow from your own works.",3
"a great and addictive game! i bought this for 2 days and now i have 33 hrs played.",1
"10/10 i no longer have friends in the game nor outside of the game.",2
"warning ... when you start ... it becomes so adictive ...",1
"for the truelly fearless and hardcore strategy gamer see how u stand up to a legit turn-based campaign and be proven how much of a  u really are!!!!!",1
"seriously, one of the only games that just keeps getting better.",1
"i set up a game to reinact ww2. it was an 8 player game with the chinese, japanese, germans, russians, polish, americans, british and i played the french. i minded my own business until just before the modern era, the germans unloaded a full scale assault on paris. i wasnt surprised. everything was going according to plan until the americans backstabbed me at orleans. it was completely uncalled for. the historical inaccuracies really bring this game down from a 10/10 to a 5/10. would not recommend ever playing the french. much betrayal, such conspiracy, so war.",1
"damn good, but make sure to get the 2 expansions (god and kings, brave new world) otherwise dont bother.",2
"one of the best, if not the best, strategy games. with g&k and bnw this has reached the current pinnacle of the civilization series. 1 unit per tile system, interesting culture/tourism game, religions, personal ai opponents and policy system with great random maps and game settings gives hundreds if not thousands of hours of replay value.",5
"this is my first steam review for one of three steam games i own. anyway, i like playing the hell out of this game. it works like coffee.",1
"this game is godlike. it is beautiful and wonderful. even the vanilla version makes oyu want to just stay for 12 hours and play. i highly recommending waiting for a sale for the complete version but i still got bnw and it is awesome. love the game and its mods make it more exciting. 5 out of 5. a perfect game.",2
"one of my all time favourite games to play on steam",2
"finally available for linux, and works even better than on windows! :)",1
"the concept of time does not exist when u play this game. 100/10",5
"be very careful playing this game!!! you make think you know what time it is, time to nuke gandhi, but you realize that 3 days have passed since you have started your game and you havent drank or ate in the last 18 hours. this game keep you saying just one more turn! but dont let it make your decisions for you, like when you should use the bathroom or when you should get another sandwich. if you see this game on sale buy it immediately, oh and brave new world did amazing things for this game, buy it as well.",1
"civ v is an insanely great game. wonderful visuals and powerful game mechanics make this game in my top ten games of all time.",1
"a moment comes which comes rarely in history but we step out from the old to the new when an age ends and a soul of a nation long suppressed, finds utterance. build courage when courage sees to fail, gain faith when there seems to be little cost for faith, create hope when hope becomes forlorn and remember....the future belongs to those who believe in their dreams....i have to say, this has been the most fantastic, most amazing game i have ever played. especially when you get the dlcs that can be be bought to go with it. a generally good game with regular civilization 5 but the excitement and intensity of it increases when you get bnw and g&k dlcs. definetly consider getting this game if you havent already and be sure to get the dlcs!!!!!!",2
"-play civ 5 -year 2020 -with friends -my civ unhappy -friends civ very happy -dammit gandhi 11/10 would get rekt by gandhi again",1
"yes it is a very fun game and with the dlcs it makes it even more fun than before",1
"great game, good play and cool incorporated histoy.",1
"i recommend this game for those that like the turn based stratedy types. civ 5 gives you the right ammount of control over your civilisation without information overload. a well contructed game.",2
"this is one of the few games you can take with you on the desert island.",5
"this game is amazing! i recommend it for anyone who enjoys stratedgy games, it is one of the best ever made.",3
"civilization v is a very complex but easy to follow game with many different ways to play it; you can invite some friends or people you dont know to have a massive battle for victory with the unique methods of winning: culture, domination, time and science. you can load up some scenarios to play without having to start from scratch. or maybe the single player mode catches your eye by setting up your game just how you like it. never have i seen a game so fun and player friendly in a very long time. once you start playing, you cannot stop! let alone the easy-to-install 2 dlc packs. for 20 each, so worth every penny. if you enjoy a fantastic balance between strategy and action, buy this game right now. thanks for reading.",1
"one of he greatest games i have played. best simulation/ tbs game i have played",1
"great game takes a good bit of time to complete matches but totaly worth the money.",1
"too bad im not completely fluent in any other languages yet, because english certainly doesnt have the words to describe how epic this game is. im currently playing my bazillionth game, and ive played nearly 750 hours, but every game still feels like a brand new experience. the ui is probably the most user-friendly in any game ever, and the music is just plain awesome, plus every game is randomly generated. theres a demo; download it and youll see what i mean. so when you do get hooked, and you do dish out 80 bucks for the gold edition plus brave new world (as you should!), dont get upset when you start failing your classes or missing work because you played all night and didnt even notice, because trust me, your time is better spent here.",5
"oh ill just finish this turn 5 hours later youre still thinking the same thing.",1
"games can be really long, but you can also save them which is nice. graphics are good, mid/late game you dont really notice the turn based as much unless youre with a slow moving friend. ai seems pretty smart and solid, feels like they can be cocky, submissive, ectect. fun game.",1
"got a gaben mod and exterminatred peasants. 10/10.",1
"fun game to play if youre looking for an extended stay at your computer. better with friends, but okay if you go at it alone.",1
"epic fun, a classic must-have game! very relaxing.",2
"more than 800 hours.....my life guys....no i have shared it with my family. but as someone who has above 800 hours of this game on there account trust me when i say best pc game of the year. simple. cant wait for more.",4
"fantastic game. used to be a bit rubbish, but was massively improved by the expansions they released. now its incredibly engaging throughout the whole timeline of the game, even at the very late game. being in a position of power doesnt make the game any less interesting, because of the numerous victory methods, so the other civs always keep you on your feet.",1
"a great strategy game for all ages. i strongly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys watching something grow over a long period of time. the graphics are good, a.i. is great and the diversity is fantastic. though it takes a lot of patience, it is a great game when you have developed your civilisation. 9.5/10",1
"ive been playing civ since it first came out. this version works well with steam and on the mac. the units and action are enjoyable. lots of content included in the basic version. theres a slew of downloadable content. my only complaint are some interface bits that could be better explained. looking forward to downloading all of the dlcs.",1
"played this game awhile back during its free trial. very fun when you need a couple hours to kill. if i get the extra cash i may think about getting it. still too pricy for me right now though.",2
"amazingly addictive, with all the dlc this game will have you playing non-stop for hours. though it seems complicated at first it gets much easier and better with time. 11/10 would play again.",1
"this game is amazing! it is a very thought inspiring and creative game that realy makes you think how we have com as a species. i also love the historical aspects of it, giving you the opertunity to dive head first into the lives of ancient civilizations. 10 out of 10",3
"never before has gandhis personality been recreated as faithfully as in this game. declare war,  es. stay classy, gandhi!",1
"this is a fun but very basic version of world history it has entertained me for a lot of time though, pick it up. 9.5/10",1
"with both expansions this game rivals all other civilizations. a solid 10/10.",1
"if you like european board games or turn based youll love this great combat cool graphics and awesome researching of technology however pepole declare war on you for no reason even if thier personality is peaceful and your empire is nowhere near them its infuriating and the dimplomacy is pretty bad however if your calm with this stuff youll love it 8/10",1
"at first i was not a fan of civ 5 after coming from civ 4 but getting the gods and kings and brave new world really improved the game for me. i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes turn based strategy games.",3
"takes about 48 hours to understand about an eigth of it, but wow, rewarding as ever. extremely good game.",1
"very nice 4x game. a must own for every strategy fan. 8/10",1
"wake up every morning at 10 oclock at night, half an hour before going to bed drink a cup of sulpheric acid play civ v 29 hours a day *insert city* wants whales *insert leader* denounces me *insert city* wants whales *insert leader* attacks me for no reason *insert city* wants whales gandhi nukes me leave the world on a spaceship/kill everyone/build a perfect society/wait until doomsday repeat 10/10",2
"friend got me this, and got me into this, and i like this! :) this is fun.",1
"i have to say, after starting this game up i did not really understand very much. but anyone who loves strategy games like myself will thoroughly enjoy it. there are multiple ways to win, and a multitude of units to choose from. advance far enough, and you can even build tanks and shoot yourself off into space to win!",1
"very good fun teaches stratagey to adults and kids",1
"so much fun, replayable to the max, #ghandiwar. this has to be my top game ive played in 2015! 10/10/10",1
"my most played game on steam. im playing this til some good beyond earth dlcs get released",1
"seriously,all i got is crash crash crash crash and crash its a good game if it can fix it sorry guys,but im really annoyed,i spent whole day(literally) try to fix the problem but nothing work well whats above was something happened years ago,now i enjoy the game",1
"probably in the top 5 game ever made, it is the second game in the civilization universe i have ever played with the first being civilization on the ps3, the amount of detail put into the game is so entirely breathtaking that i could literally play this game for days, in fact ive had it for less than a week and im already closing in on a full day of gameplay... 5 out of 5. cant wait to see where beyond earth takes the franchise but i can pretty much gaurantee i will be there to see!",1
"great game. as of writing this i have just finished my first game by destroying all enemy ai with nucleal bombs. awesome",1
"just one more turn... one more... *falls asleep at keyboard*",3
"this game has stolen hundreds of hours of my life from me- and i dont regret a single minute. :)",4
"if you are new to civ like i was at first this game can seem a little overwhelming due to the vast amount of content offered. however after a few hours of gameplay you can expect to be navigating the overlays and maps like a pro. this game is non-stop fun and super addictive, i often find myself playing for hours and hours even after i say to myself that im going to play only one more turn and save. highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in turn based strategy games. game also has steam workshop which adds to replay value.",1
"this game is greate, but jimmy kimmel / kman777x / kman777 is not as good as me. and he is a swoooopingggg scrub muffin.",2
"the 4x strategy game against which all others are compared. achievements are buggy, so if you are an achievement hunter, you will be dissappointed. you do not always receive the earned achievements. if you use the mods, you will get no achievements whatsoever.",1
"this is one of my favorite games to play, the realistic physics engine and amusing themes cast this game into one of the most difficult and fun strategy games ive ever played, especially now that they have added monetary constraints, the community development is superb and the game is constantly being updated and patched.",1
"recommended requirements: no children. no wife. no life.",1
"im starting to wonder if crack is less addictive.",2
"this installment keeps you playing turn after turn till midnight. ;) seriously, once i start, i cant stop...its that good.",1
"comes bundled with the smash hit waiting for players 2014",1
"very good game just dont play as enrico dandolo (venice) unless you want a challenge",2
"just an advise to you my friends: attack gandhi and siam when they are weak. those ing backstabbers",1
"i love the civilization series so much. so intoxicatingly addictive that you just cannot stop playing. i would highly recommend the bnw expansion with 5 as it really improves the game.",2
"hmm lets see i can build a huge  empire destroy my friends and nuke the whole world oh and with dlcs i can make a religion called squidward yeah i think you should get this game",2
"highly addictive! amazing mod community if you have the dlc.",1
"fun turn based strategy game. single player is good with quite a few difficulty levels but the multiplayer is poorly optomized so crashes and lags a lot.",2
"there is many things wrong with the world. its your job to fix it. get this game",1
"a joy to play like previous civ incarnations, and kept fresh with new ideas and possible strategies with a change to the unit-stacking rules, this is recommended whether youve played previous civilizations or not. some teething trouble at first that was soon patched enough times, i didnt really get into this version until the patches had come out, but i have to say it was worth the outlay. highly recommended like the previous games of the series if you like turn-based strategy games with more victory conditions than just kill everyone else (although eradicating all other players in the game will win too)",5
"the best game you will ever play, although ruining your life turn by turn, 10/10.",4
"great turn-based strategy game. even more fun with friends on marathon settings.",1
"dont believe the haters; if you like turn based strategy games purchase this immediately; if you have never played turn based strategy games before purchase this immediately as it is an excellent entry-level title with a smooth learning curve.",1
"graphically superior to any other turn based strategy game i know, civ v is my favorite platform for historical inaccuracies. you may not be much for strategy games, but nuking ghandi never gets old. i give it a 7.8/10 but with gods and kings i would give it a 9/10. i might also mention that the max graphics look like an oil painting...",1
"i read reviews about how addictive the game was, and i didnt believe it. i got on the game at 9:00 in the morning, and started expanding my civilization. a few minutes later i look at the clock and it says 11:00. so, maybe i was wrong. maybe this is the most addicting game ever. 1/10 this will keep you busy for a long, long, time, and i recommend this to a anyone who loves strategy games. plus it works on mac, so thats a bonus :d",1
"one of the best civilization games, or for that matter empire building games, to date. be tactical, be religious, be cultural, be scientific... the possibitlys are endless...",1
"a little different to civ iv, but easy to get the hang of. all in all a thoroughly good game. it will nab your free time though, so make sure you keep an eye on your watch! if you enjoyed civ iv, you should enjoy this just as much.",2
"just like all the rest of the civ series this is an amazing and addictive game. new dlcs give you the ability to host a wold council and make global decision. this is probably their best game yet.",1
"besides civ:4 this is the best grand strategy game of all time highly reccomened to any fan of grand strategy, politics or boardgames",1
"very addicting game. especially if you play for one of the harder victories.",1
"if you dont play as america 100% of the time then get out of my face you filthy commie",1
"very cool strategy game. love it and recommend it to all. you will have tons of fun playing",1
"extremely addicting. im not good enough to win on normal difficulty, id rather play on easy and feel like a god as a obliterate all the other civs or build everything beyond every civ. the interactions with the others civs has improved. previous civilzation games made me feel like a twerp to be bullied by every other civilization... either by demanding money and gifts or demanding i go to war with my ally.",1
"hours of endless world domination is always bound to please the conqueror in everyone.",4
"sid meiers civilization v has extrordinary and fun addtions to it. i highly suggest this game to all who love strategy, and challenges. a+++++++",2
"pretty fun, good stratergy and great game when you want to zone out",1
"ive learnt a lot of history playing this. ive also learnt to misspell civilisation.",2
"the joy this game has brought me is pretty much unlimited. i can say my grad work and home projects have been neglected mutliple times because i got knee deep in a new campaign. addicting game with lots of awesome game mechanics. i dont play as much anymore mainly because i dont have the time but whenever i get a spare moment, i hop on to play for as long as i possibly can. love this game!",1
"civilization is one of the best video game franchises ever, and this is arguably the best version of the game.",1
"this is a great addition to the civilization series",1
"now i may not have the most hours on this game, but it is really fun. civ. 5 is one of my favorite games. i cant wait for the new civ. game to come out. i think most people would enjoy this. the singleplayer works fine but the multiplayer can be a little bit laggy at times.",1
"i tried to review this game, but i got distracted for five days playing it instead. seriously, civilization should be considered an addictive substance.",1
"dis game made me feel like i have downs syndrome. too complimacated",1
"exceptionally well designed gameplay, one of the most beautiful soundtracks ever composed and all that multiplayer supported. you like strategic board games and complex econemy systems? then this game is a must buy for you!",1
"it is good. wish there was a faster game time though otherwise with friends it is a long effort.",1
"5 x 5 = 21. 2+1 = 3 half life 3 comfirmed! buy this game.",3
"this is one of the funest games that i have played in 2013 and am exited for the new game that is about to go onto this amazing game series",2
"what the  dude its like crack cocaine you lose your life playing this  if it wasnt clear i love this game",1
"i really recommend this game it is just so good. but make sure you get the dlc it turns it into a whole nother game.. grayson my friend doesnt own it and he wont buy it cause hes a dumbass with aids but its okay he doesnt know what hes missing just make sure you get it!!!!!",1
"a nice game for heavy-weighters and black people!!",1
"this is a great turn based game with potential to be fun online. akthough i havent played online yet, i look forward to it. only for people who are patiant. this is not good for people looking for somthing fast paced",1
"small pox, malaria, aids? all of the many things you will be diagnosed with after playing this slow as ing boring as  game. cool firaxis, i get it, youre ing stupid and want your dumb ipad game to take forever to boot up so that you can take the syringe while i wait and inject your cuntiness intravenously. in this game you control a bunch of sand er/europoor savages while sid meier takes a fat  on your computer monitor. it tastes like wild cherry and wild cherry sucks . 9/10",1
"brilliant the game is so good and i cant see any flaws in it **** 4 stars.",1
"you know what it is. turn-based strategy at its finest. civilization v is the strongest inducer of the one more turn syndrome ive ever encountered. first turn, you settle your first city. hundreds of turns later, youre tired, aching, and hungry while you wage war with persia, japan, and greece. civ v is an excellent game.",2
"great game! involved and has many aspects. you sit down to play for an hour and 2 days later youre still playing! its addicting. only thing that i wish it had is the capability to stack troops on one tile like cililzation iii.",1
"whether youre an old school civ guru or brand new to the series, like myself, civilization 5 delivers engaging gameplay through key choices made during every campaign. tread diplomacy lightly as to not incur the wrath of larger, more powerful civs, or go balls to the wall militarily. i guarantee if you play long enough, youll ache to win as many ways as you can. gods and kings didnt quite fix diplomacy, but the game is directly better because of the dlc.",3
"fantastic game, great amount of strategy, however the ai is ballistic and not very good, capping out in a difficulty at king, and just getting cheap starts at any difficulty higher. with that said, the game is still absolutely fantastic, and you can spend dozens of hours just going through a couple of turns, making decisions, trading, and managing your city to make it as customizable as you want it to be.",1
"id write a review, but, im busy playing civ v. so sorry about that.",1
"great game if you like strategy games. i would definitly recommend it to anyone that likes these kind of games. 10 out of 10!",1
"trust me when i say that this game will make you play until its 2 am, its that fun. if you want to play a turn-based-stratigic game that grows in time when you play it longer, this game is for you! if you want to play as a japanese warlord, this game is for you! if you want to destroy all nations in your way wihtout feeling guilty about it, this game is for you! (also it has giant robots of death. dont belive me? play the game and youll see.)",1
"amazing. a blast with friends. conquering and crusading for your glorious nation and renaming every city something silly is one of the best things to happen to gaming. 10/10 would play again.",1
"i reccomend this game it is amazing cant wait for the new one",2
"i loved playing this game, ive put countless hours into it and still find the fact that i can win in thousands of other ways amazing. anyone even remotely interesting an a strategy game should pick this up.",2
"have a life? tired of it? get this game. no more life. problem solved.",1
"great game i love it!! nice graphics also and i love the gameplay",1
"one of the best games i have ever played if you like long-term strategy games.",2
"very fun game, got it in the sale and then played it for about 11 hours straight.",1
"great game! immersive content, and very fulfilling. games last long sometimes, and are really fun if its a rainy day and you have nothing to do!",1
"totally worth it. when its 6am and youve yet to sleep its because of this game.",1
"its really good. edit: after rolling over too many hours playing this... and i still dont have the latest expansion... its still really good.",3
"a brilliantly addictive strategy game and an excellent introduction to the civilization series! great fun over multiplayer (if you have the bandwidth)!",2
"love the game. im always playing it so much to do, so many ways to win. it is one of them games you cant stop playing. 11/10",1
"great gaming experience, dont play marathon games or you will be up late every other night =)",3
"games like this built my intrest in history and my critical thinking skills.",4
"its a peace of crap... nah just kidding, its a wonderful game thatll make you play for hours>",2
"universities and colleges should offer this game as one of their curriculum to help students develop resource management, economics, strategy & many others traits that can be helpful to the students for their future!",1
"let me put it this way i played for 15 hours straight 10/10",1
"great game, its also a good way to stab ur friends in the back",1
"this game is absolutly amazing! its complex fun and entertaining. if you start playing you wont be able to stop. i give it a 9.99/10 - the silent",1
"really enjoyable but takes hours - days or longer to play would definitely recommend.",1
"takes alot of patients, but a very good game worth playing.",1
"omg they broke my game paid a total of well over 120 euros and now they broke my game !!",5
"very good turn based strategy game! for those who like to take it easy and good diplomats!",1
"i think i liked 4 more but this game does a lot of things differently enough to make it interesting and stand on its own. i can say that its something you could play in parralel with theior previous sequel.",1
"a must have for stratagy gamers. i am a casual pc gamer but a competitvie console gamer and i love this game!",1
"great example of a turn-based strategy game at its finest. easy to begin and learn the basics, but at the same time difficult to master, civ 5 is a great game if you are the type that is interested in leading an empire. i highly recommend it.",2
"the same civ you know and love, but more tactical thanks to the new no stack of doom combat system. make sure to pick up both gods & kings and brave new world for the full experience.",1
"i havent played this game too long, but so far i am addicted. after i have some more experience with this game ill update this review. 11/13 yognaught*",1
"this is one of the best games ive ever played. my friends and i love playing this. i reccomend this game to everyone.",1
"i love this game. a big group of friends getting together and playing a huge game of civ. overall a great game!",1
"i enjoy it a bunch. a single game takes hours to complete, and the suspense of a new world each time you play helps to change up how the game will be played. i recommend it to those who enjoy sitting down to play an intense game for an entire afternoon.",2
"a quick, sleek version of the venerable civ-franschise. took a while to get used to it but now i prefer it.",1
"the only game i play on my pc for over 440 hours!! this game is one of the best in my opinion, to not own it is something of an omen.",3
"i might need to play a game or two, but after 5 minutes of trialing it, im very uninspired. to be fair, i was expecting something else and this was far from it.",1
"very good game, i would recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy genres. the graphics for me are supurb and the little animations when you battle singleplayer! in my first game, my tank anihalated a spearmen and the animation to me very funny. great game!",1
"good game, but many things were either downsized or made worse from civ 4",1
"the most time consuming game you could possibly play",2
"a fun, deep and complex strategy game, civilization v is definately a gem worth picking up.",1
"if you havent had an erection yet, you will know.",1
"while the updates to the hex grid, and one unit per tile might seem game breaking and daunting, it really adds to the fun. you no longer require a rolling stack of death to get anything accomplished. with proper army and terrain management, you can take out their entire army with a few smart choices. what else do you need? its still civ at its core.",1
"one more turn... one more turn... oh, its 4am in the morning already?! oh well, one more turn...",1
"i have to say this is probably the most addicting game i play. youll tell yourself that youre only going to play through one more turn...only one more...okay this is the last one...until finally the sun is coming out and you hate yourself. the only con is that the game really needs the gandk and bnw. it really makes it a complete game.",1
"dang!!! i was about to buy it some weeks ago at the steam retail price ($49.99) when it suddenly went on sale for $24.99... i thought it was a sweet deal and now i find that it is all the way down to $16.49.... i shouldve waited a little longer. it has me hooked up better than civ 4... cant wait fot beyond earth to come out and try it. hope you steam guys can get a grip on a downloadable demo for all us sid meier fans.",1
"tips on how to civ v. 1.) make an alliance with ghandi. 2.) wait until near the end of the game. 3.) ghandi has researched nukes. 4.) ded.",1
"i have become a new world god in this game. every country bows down to me and gives me resources in exchange for their safety. anyone who even steps within range of my cities becomes a blazing inferno within my endless barage of nukes and giant death robots. 20/10 would be biggest dirtbag in history again.",1
"best strategy game ive ever played, one of my favorite games ever. mods, scenarios, and different victory types allow for basically endless gameplay. definitely get it if you havent already. the expansions, gods and kings and brave new world, are worth their asking price and make the game much better.",1
"this is one of the most addicting games ive played to date. the amount of things you can do in the game game plus the vast difference between each new game keeps me pressing next turn hoping to crush those filthy ais",2
"sid meiers civilization v is an amazing game in which you start off by selecting the leader of a country, you will play as that leader, each country has different attributes and units which help them start off the game, after selecting a world to play in you will spawn with a settler and a warrior, (may change depending on leader of choice). the warrior is there to protect your settler which you need to found your first city, a capital city. as you go through the game you find other world leaders, barberians and city-states, you will face war with all of them, diplomacy with two of them and everything inbetween. in the end civ v is one of the most entertaining games i have played in a long while and has massive replay value! 9/10",1
"this game is more addicting then crack. you see korea and youre like well f**k thats my science victory gone or is it? 20 turns later i have 2 catapults 3 spearmen and 3 composite bowmen. surrounds seoul and takes it in 5 turns. korea starts to negotiate peace and gives me busan thats too much win xd 20/10 hoes xd sorry if my language was offensive at some points xd",1
"civ v is a a great game, provided you have the gods and kings, and brave new world expansions. vanilla civ v is clunky and incomplete. but with the addition of the two expansions this game turns from a dud into the best game in the franchise. i highly recommend buying this with the two expansions, if you can afford it.",2
"this is the first civilization game i have played, so it took a solid 45 minutes to learn how to play the game effeciently, but it is worth it because the game is a lot of fun. if you can get past that initial 45 minutes - 1 hour of learning the ins and outs of the game, you will love playing it.",1
"great game! so fun being able to win without firing a single shot but also to have the option to nuke cities if i want :)",1
"one of the most addicting games ive ever played. massive in scale and depth, the game immerses you and makes you want just one more turn every time. turn-based strategy and (optional) very long games prove a challenging and very fun element, if not for everyone, due to its turn-based nature and depth. the ability to save and quit or just walk away and come back to the game at any time is a huge plus for me too.",2
"an awesome strategic game with an endless number of things to do on it. yes, i said endless. it has nearly 300 achievements.",1
"by far one of the best game series ive ever played. theres endless hours of fun in this game. yet some would probably prefer earlier versions of the series. regardless if you manages to get sucked into this franchice, youd have endless hours of fun with it.",1
"its worth playing if you want to make world peace with other superpowers, but if you like world war 2 its worth checking out the red ww2 mod where you can change the history.",1
"spent hours building up greece to become a super power in the modern age only to be backstabbed by gahndi.",1
"an amazing game that may take a lot of time out of your day,but playing with the right friends will make this game the funnest it could be.",1
"it was a great game for the short time i played it. it is much like aoe, but mixed with risk, it is lots of fun. im not so sure its worth $30, but im tempted to get it. im getting the demo immediatly. 5/5",1
"as a new time gamer i really enjoy this game. there is definitely a lot of strategy required in making sure your civilization is victorious. i cant wait to delve deeper into the game and experience more of the strategy.",1
"10/10 why because givin crabs to zulu is just hilarious(he deserverd it...) and then destroyin it all with nukes is just....murica!",1
"inmersive experience. makes hours fly. unleash your inner dictator :d",1
"amazing game ohh mah gurrrd! it takes over 5 hours to finish one game but its amzing.",2
"you might check the time and wonder if the last 12 hours of your life was worth it, it was! civ v is an amazing turn based strategy game that will entertain you for hours. try not to be too competitive when playing with friends though, it can get ugly!",2
"this is madne... no, its epically awesome. everybody loves raining nuclear weapons on their enemies cities and obliterating them out of existence, right? right?",4
"love it but it is a little hard 4 and a 1/2 stars out of 5 tip dont build too much food reources",1

"i love this game. its so much fun even tho games take forever",1
"awsome, but could be improved upon. endless space is better",2
"i would love this game but it i get so far and it shuts down every time.",1
"i bought this game due to gameplay from the yogscast and it was one of the best choices ever this game is so addicting. i have never had more fun in a strategic game definetley a must buy! 20/10",1
"excellent global strategy game. isnt as clumy as civ iv and with the best combat system of all civs.",2
"the highly moddable nature of this game really adds considerably to the life of this game. tools are provided to allow users to do anything from adding new civiliations, to changing the ui, to changing game rules and ai behavior. definitely worth a look for anyone who is a fan of turn-based strategy.",3
"this is a very intesting game to learn more about the worlds history its self and create communitys and trade and even battle! i would totally recomend to buy this awesome game!",1
"oh yeah deffinately the game for u if u wanna play a turn based life consuming game that does not draw you in what so ever =d",1
"this game is possibly the best game ever. it has very deep strategy and the opportunity to play very differently.",3
"great game!! play this game 24/7 and is the most fun ive had in a game, especially on multiplayer!",1
"this game started off great, and with the exapnsions and dlc it has only gotten better. it requires a good chunk of time to get the full experience, so if you plan on doing a playthrough in one sit down, expect o be up until the wee hours of the next morning. this games has taken everything about strategy games, thrown it together, and amplified it. i love the way the game is and i cant wait to see how it grows. if you like strategy or are interested in testing the waters of the stratedy genre, jump right into this game.",1
"good game, lots of replay value, and lots of mods in the workshop.",1
"i remember buying this game at night. by the time i was done checking things out i had spend two days on this game without sleeping. friendly advice to anyone looking to buy civ v; set some alarms so you wont forget to sleep. now if you would excuse me, im going to play for just one more turn...",1
"i have mixed feelings baout his game. i like civ4 better but i like the hexacon map and clouds on civ5. also the multiplayer on civ4 is wayyyy better. if youre new to civ5 and/or want to play send a request.",2
"civilization is by far my most favorite series of games ever made. civ v lives up to a great tradition and more. you will lose yourself in what seems like a simple game on the surface. it can be a complex or a easy as you want to make it. playing twice is never the same.",1
"if you want a game to eat your afternoons away, this is the perfect game for you. no other game has made me play it for 6 hours straight and not checking the time until after im done.",1
"a real challenge for the strategy players among us ;)",1
"wow. what a wonder! so much to say about this game. where do i start. i think firstly the",1
"buy this game and you wont pay for a week of your life! dont let this special offer go away!",1
"as addicting as ever... just one more turn. great game for any strategy fan. and even three years later content is still being added and is an easy pick up during any sale.",2
"good game once you get into it but if you are new to civ i suggest that you play tutorial mode for a bit because unless you know what you are doing the game is quite complicated.",1
"it is fun unless you playing against ing germany. ps dont buy on steam its 50$ less at eb games",1
"i ing love this game ive had it for 2 months, it runs on any computer",1
"it has a lot of replayability and is pretty good mini hitler simulator. seems pretty balanced, all in all. nukes dont feel nearly as devestating as they should be - late game on a warrior run i tend to toss them out like vowels in a sentence and i never feel like as big a monster as i should be. has the steam workshop too so you have even more crap to stuff in when you run out of love for the vanilla stuff. gods and kings is pretty balanced save for the initial pantheon powers (you have a choice between +10% population growth and other stuff like +1 production - so needless to say, there is no reason to take 90% of what is on the list because there are one or two things that offer bonuses that will actually mean anything late game). still, nothing shattering or bad.",2
"i have seen a whole day dissovolve away into nothingness while this game is up. just one more turn... pets need feeding... i need feeding... help me...",4
"definitely the best game in the civilization franchise. and one of the best turn-based games ever. highly recommend, and i cant wait for civilization: beyond earth!",1
"nice game if they would stop the  dlc system! make it free! only ask some money for big expansions. also make no expansion and expansion compatible in multiplayer!",1
"this is what i play when im supposed to be doing homework. it really takes a lot of skill and makes you think so much about every move. multiplayer with friends is the best, especially when you all end up just foofin around making deals of giving one gold for nothing :d and time just flies by and you just cant get tired of it because every round brings so much to do, all the possibilities, man!",2
"its really strange that this game and civ iv are such different titles. the fundamentals are all there, but itll be a bit of a learning process comming to civ v over from civ iv. its still just as addicted as iv, but the aforementioned is something to keep in mind.",1
"if you are a fan of risk or diplomacy or any of that kind of board game you will love civ. even those coming from the realms of aoe and cnc will like the relaxed but more strategic play style of a turn based strat like civ. only downside is its very long games, but if that dosent bother you, i suspect you might have found your new favourite game, if at least for a while.",1
"if your new to civ, 9.5/10, if your not it starts out being 7.5/10 then as you adapt 9.5/10. hard to adapt from civ 3 being the expansion mechanics are very different, but overall very good.",1
"excellent game. the best of the civilization games yet.",1
"i didnt get a chance to play this game a lot. but from what i did play, i really liked it. this game really sucks you in, youll be sitting on your butt for 5 hours trying to win a game that will last days. the weird thing is, while sometimes you will just want the game to end and you will just want to win, other times you will want it to last as long as possible so you can unlock every technology or take over every last tile. its good, and very addicting.",1
"one of my favorite games, i could play it for hours.",2
"warning: more addictive than your favorite designer drug.",1
"became friends with gandhi and didnt get nuked. love it.",1
"i.. just.. keep pouring hours into this game for some reason :d",2

"ghandi the most peaceful leader in the world... right? 10/10",1
"this game... so addicting, you lose track of the time and its only after youve finished the great fun of it that you realise its been 6 hours. definitely recommended.",2
"i love this game it is really fun! it has gotten me to learn alot about woners and civilisations to!",1
"for to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. to subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill. - sun tzu (c. 6th century bce)",1
"better have a lot of time on your hands when playing civ 5",1
"best civilization so far. improves in almost every way.",1
"great game, but even better with the brave new world or gods and kings expansion packs. i highly recommend this for anyone. very easy to learn too, and has mod support!",1
"this is the best strategy game ever. i have to admit......... i cant stop playing it. nothing is more fun than being able to be your favorite civilization, then conquering the world with them. amazing game! buy it!",5
"this game is very fun, but only if you like stratagy games. i would recommned this game to all of friends if they werent all playing it. i sound like a commercial for this game because i am,now give sid meier all your moneies so that he may continue to create masterpieces like this so buy now.",1

"i ran out of money and food until all of my troops disbanded.  me im bad at this game/8",1
"the beating of a million drums the fire of a million guns the mother of a million sons",1
"in combination with gods and kings + brave new world, this is the best civ experience ever!",2
"this game is way too addicting. love it. pretty historically accurate too. right down to rome rolling right over their neighbors the aztecs. its the little details that count. 10/10 would recommend.",1
"my butt plug really enjoys this games, it makes fredrick (the butt plug) really happy.",1
"so many late nights have been spent in this game. civilization v is perfect for newcomers to the civilization franchise. aswell as still having many of the core features that makes long time fans love the games.",2
"i highly recommend this game as a very relaxed strategy game. personally, i dont fare well with strategy games, but with 9 different ai levels, there is something for every type of player.",1
"for those who are deciding whether or not to purchase civ 5, i will compile a small pros and cons list to help you out. pros: - greatest game on planet. cons: - loss of friends - loss of time - loss of job - loss of pet fish (poor fish) - loss of sleep - loss of sex - loss of money for snacks - loss of money for drinks - loss of money for pot - well known gateway drug to crack - ghandi - probably illegal somewhere - have 350 hours on steam - bought the game 3 weeks ago - help me..",3
"good for hours of fun with yourself or friends dawg",1
"this game is one of the best in the civ series. 10 out of 10 and would do buisness again.",1
"i cant do any work anymore because i end up playing this 10/10",3
"the only place where you can be poland and be more advanced than anyone else.",1
"this is an absolute masterpiece when it comes to people who isnt so used to strategy games and people who still are! although i had some problems with the game, didnt know what to produce, etc. after a few hours i found it very enjoyable and fun =) i highly recommend this game to anyone who wants something fresh, some thing new, something thrilling! and who knows, you might learn a little about history and historic persons too.",1
"civilization v by sid meier is one of the top strategy games that i hve played. i must admit i am not really a strategy man; more of a terrorist gunning psychopath. but i deeply and suprising enjoyed civs multi-layered and diverse gameplay and is one of the best purchases i have made since joining the master-race. thank you for enlightening me on a genre of game i am unfamilliar with.",1
"just buy this game you wont regret it at all 10/10 100/100 5/5",1
"great strategy game. only problem is the just one more turn trap. before you know it, it is 3am and you need to get up at 6 for work!",1
"very fun, it is an interesting game. you should get it if you like strategy games. to the average player, it might get a little boring though",1
"this is possibly the most addicitive game i have ever played. 10/10",1
"just look at how many hours ive spend playing it...",3
"so good that you dont mind how long it takes to finish a game.",1
"the next jerk who spreads their religion to my country gets nuked.",1
"if youre a civ fan and enjoy turn-based strategy, it really doesnt get any better than this! all the best parts of civ 1, 2 & 3 without the let downs of civ 4!",1
"great fun if you dont mind the drastic departure from the previous games in this series. ai players can be a bit wonky at times.",1
"amazing game! you can play a quick hour long game, or even have a 10 year long game (reference to the guy wwho has been playing the same game of civ 2 for the past 10 years)",1
"its an amzaing strategy game id give it 10/10 in my book!",1
"always a great game especially when i just get tired of playing fps games and such.",1
"every game is more fun on a console, except for turnbased and rts-games. and king of them all is civilization v! the only game which is mandatory for the pc.",1
"played as germany and made the main religion judasim - 12/2",1
"this game is very good if you dont have a job, you dont have a life, you dont have any responsibilities, you dont particularly enjoy the sun, you can go without eating, sleeping, or using the bathroom for long periods of time, and if you have extra time to waste away trying to nuke the entire world. 10/10 played for 100+ hours and would play for another 100+ hours",1
"if your into strategy games and you havent played civ yet your missing out. it is a fun game to play solo but even funner with friends. i strongly recommend this game and suggest you to get the gold pack so you get most of the dlc.",1
"are you a major nerd for history? turn the tables and brew your own history. as japan, you can own london and berlin. as american, you can be communist. build maccu piccu next to tokyo and dominate with a giant space robot. space is the limit in this world, dive right in.",1
"the game is great, but the problem is me and many other players are facing the same problems. workers stop working and stop building roads, and they dont seem to care much for enemys they just stand there from time to time and stop working. this is making the game very difficult. pls help fix this i really love the game i spent so much time in it. i have send letter for help but got nothing.",1
"its good, but it feels like it lost something compared to the previous civ titles. when it came out, i was crazy-hopeful that it would have the same epic impact that civ iii and iv had, improving on an already stellar setup, and polishing the rough areas. but while the attempt was to mix up the gameplay and see how that would go, it left behind too much of the older titles style, emphasizing interaction over exploration. its good, but ill play civ iv until the new civ comes out.",1
"the best civilization game of all, once it got gods and kings and brave new world. score 95/100. i have played it extensively and will play it again. it is a fabulous and deep game with so many gameplay styles that are viable. i love minor things like no more need transport ships and one unit per tile. the hex tiles are great as well and added a much-needed upgrade in the tactics. one of my 10 favorite game series ever, and the best one of the bunch. i cannot recommend it more.",1
"game is great, new expacs make it great fun and adds alot of civs and its alot of fun playing on immortal and seeing ghandhi come and attack you with half a million nukes xd pros - game contains alot of fun and the modding community is great for keeping up the fun and adding new content cons - seeing missionaries and  inside your borders and not being able to attack them if you aint a  is really annoying. would 10/10 anyday.",2
"a very good game that lives up to its nickname, just on more turn the game. you can realy loose track of time while playing it. and if your the military type like me, then you will realy enjoy the giant death robots. also caesar is a jerk, kill him first.",1
"if you currently have a job then you might want to come down with a flu because sid meiers civilization v is fun, and extreamly addicting. youll spend hours on here without realizing it, and it may even ruin your relationship status for the first couple days. enjoy!",2
"lots of depth to gameplay. it really requires you to think.",1
"one of the better strategy games of this generation. i do find war a little clunky but other than that its an amazing game.",1
"this game is very addictive and is very fun to play. and i higly suggest this game. this game gets even better with the big and small dlcs like brave new world and gods and kings and other dlcs and expansions",1
"a turn based flagship game, countless civilizations to play with and this was the game of the year edition so you get extra packs in it, best of all its under $15 bucks this summer. so there is no reason for you to not get this deal now cuz its the best youll find anywhere. get set and be ready to re write earths history !!",2
"end turn doesnt work, on a turn based game, it makes the game pretty pointless.",1
"this games going to ruin my life. calling it now.",1
"the sweet revenge of nuking everyone who denounced you repeatedly. 10/10",1
"civilizations 5 is an amazing game! i would reccomend this game to everyone, it might be hard to start of with but once you know what your doing you will have a lot of fun. its also got multiplayer so you can play with friends. ive got 67 hours on record of this game and still havent got bored of playing it.",1
"i reccomend this game. like, a lot. its a great improvment from the previous game, and i really enjoy playing it. its just an awesome game. if youve liked this series or any games in the genre, i would recommend getting it. theres so much to do to stand the test of time.",1
"firaxis and 2k are becoming my new favourite game studios, very much thanks to civ v and xcom... this is one of the most complete games ive ever played.",1
"right after i bought this damn game it went back down price son of a gun",1
"great game! highly recommend it. so many aspects to it.",1
"simply put, this is one of the best games ive ever played. even with the vanilla civ v, i spent countless hours playing just one more turn. with gods and kings and the brave new world expansions, the game only got better. i paid full price for almost all the civ v dlcs and expansions, but it was worth it --- and i have more than 600 hours of playing time to prove it. ive had the sun rise on me many, many times, whether playing civ v alone or with friends. the depth and complexity of this game ensures that every playthrough will be different, every decision interesting. and as if the game isnt nearly perfect already, it still gets improvements 4 years after its initial launch! this game is a true classic, a standard by which other games of its kind will always be measured and is a must-have for any strategy game lover.",3
"the continuation of the best strategy game series of all time. the game is well optimized, fairly balanced and beautifully rendered. so, much thought and detail went into this game. this creation is outstanding on all accounts.",1
"good, but it gets a bit boring after the first couple hours. still really fun, good game",5
"civilization yo get the elder scrolls leader mod get the game scrub do it",2
"good ol civ. soon it will be cheap to buy, so dont hesitate and give it a try!",1
"one of the best series of all times. this civilization v is not the best but does not disappoint either.",1
"if you love turn based strategy this is a must own game. the only issue is the game software does not efficiently use the hardware of your system so you need some powerful hardware to play this game on top settings on the largest maps, especially during the late game the lag can become nearly unbearable.",5
"this is an amazing strategy game for both hardcore and not so hardcore players. it can relly take you hours if you are building you dream-emprie so i warn you. for civilization fans=buy for turn-based fans=buy for people thinking about buying=buy for people who can only play 20 min a day=sadly dont buy it can be played in shoter burst but i still prefer playing for atleast the 40-45 min. at a time.",1
"by far, my most played game on steam. i have ruled the world many a time and i shall again many more times thanks to this amazing game.",2
"civ 5 is a smooth, turn-based strategy game about building your empire from the ground up. along the way youll face invading barbarians and other nations, some will help you, some will harm you. i highly reccomend this game, but get all the main dlc, without them the game is pretty trash. 10/10",2
"get used to saying to yourself one more turn then ill go to bed",1
"why are you still readingthis? buy the game already.",1
"great game to play with friends! the expansions add in content that gives the game more ways to win",1
"the best strategy game ever made. if youve never played a civ game this is the one to get, with its greatly streamlined interface and controls, you can easily spend the whole day away with this game.",1
"if you like strategy this game is for you! it is the perfect game if you like forming a civilization and conquering the world in many different ways",1
"its not a paradox game, but its fine for a civ game.",2
"one of my favourite sagas of all the time. too addictive :-)",1
"honestly best 4x game ever i love playing this with my buddies multiplayer 6+ people or just finding out cool ways to use the civs",1
"great game, i reccomend having patience if you are going to buy this game, a beautiful strategy game of what-if. for example, what if the great wall of china was made by america? (the great wall of america) well, thats possible! watch yourself holding history in your hands and bending it to your will! 10/10 great game! :d",2
"wow, what a game. it is so easy to spend hours upon hours into this. im not much of a fighter, so im glad there are ways of winning without firing a single shot, but dominating other players in single player is so much fun.",1
"one of the best games ive ever bought. its the one game i always go back and play.",1
"i once woke up, played this game for the whole day, went to bed, and the game wasnt even three-quarters finished. 10/10.",1
"i play one game for like 5 hours and still cant end it",1
"even with all dlcs, the game still feels simple in comparison to previous version. yet an enjoyable one-more-turn game.",1
"the most important detail is the title screen msuic, civ 4 took the cake by having the best title screen music i have ever heard. buying civ 5 (gods & kings) i was expecting it to have bad music. slowly it became my favorite. good job! besides the title screen music the game improved 110%. every area was improved. 5 stars.",2
"great game, fun and challenging. can be time consuming and it takes a lot of power to make the game run smoothly when the graphics are turned all the way up. either way its a great game for anyone who likes stragedy games.",3
"the best strategy game i have ever played! great graphics, gameplay and dlcs! playable for hours on hours!",1
"i know i dont have that many hrs on record but i love this game its probly one",1
"the best time suck you can buy. many hours have vanished while playing this game.",2
"civilization has ruined, and continues to ruin, my life. would recommend.",5
"if you liked civ4 this has some good changes. there are some things that are broken, like stacking military units but it does not effect game play too bad. i recommend this game if you are looking for a change from civ4.",1
"this game is great if you play with your friends. when you go online people are very cheap and get things rather quickly because they find ways to make one city be a power house and for them to win a game quick. which is why i never recommend on playing online but only online with friends to just have fun.",2
"worth buying as its one of those games of the one more turn genres. play with friends and buy when cheap if possible.",1
"i started playing this game and now i have a beard and smell really bad. the prefect escape from realilty.",1
"sid meiers civilization v is an awesome turn-based strategy game, youll be playing it for hours. highly recommended for those who are struggling to find a game that is very adictive and worth your time (just a heads up when going through the tutorial, you should play up to a time where you think you understand the game enough to create a new world for you can not save your tutorial world). have fun. ;)",1
"one of the best strategy games out there, must buy! rating: 9.2/10",1
"a great game many hours of pleasure, well worth it.",1
"intricate and customizable, the foundation of the game is solid and replayability long. the multiplayer is a touch cumbersome though.",1
"a fun game that you will lose yourself hours if your not paying atttention.",1
"it is really really fun. i got it not really knowing what it truly was. i just wanted to make the 2k sale worth it. but when i started playing, i was immediately entranced. i recomend it to not only fans, but everyone.",1
"slowly giving up my social life for this and i have to say, it is so worth it.",1
"france was winning a war and it surrendered half its resources. 10/10",2
"played for 5 minutes, stopped when i was starving, 12 hours had gone by.",1
"civ 5 is a great game with lots of gameplay in it. you can easily play this game for hours without getting bored, especially with the complete edition which gives you loads of civilizations. the workshop is also a great way to extend your gametime. if you like turn-based tactical games, this will be right in your alley.",1
"sic game blud. terrible to play with friends as it takes forever to finish as people always leave. like joe. yeah thanks a bunch joe.",1
"awesome game ! true to the civilization series. a must buy!",2
"absolutely amazing game. love it. you do need to buy at least gods and kings + brave new world to make the game better than civ iv, and the combat is a bit, well clunky, but aside from that it is one of the best strategy games on pc right now. 10/10.",2
"game is garbage without both expansion packs. absolutely amazing with them. dont bother with the dlc civilizations, youre not missing out and its not worth the money. multiplayer is too buggy to play.",1
"one of the finest, most addictive releases ever. the core game was lacking, but with the expansion packs, it is the best civilzation game released to date.",2
"i pour hours and hours into this game at a time! i get so distracted and sucked into, i have no idea why.",1
"a fun strategy based turn game that not only gives laughes, but also a lot of fun for all experience levels! i love it! but remember, dont trust spain or france!",1
"do i recomend this game, hell yes i do, i masturbate to the picture all the time now. this is way better than subscribing to brazzers!!!",1
"this game is totally worth buying, if your in to stragety and building empires. envolving lots of diplomancy and war to work your civ to be the best. like building bulding and empire and stragety games? then this is what you want",1
"civilization 5 is the primary reason of my having a steam account 10/10",2
"awesome time eating game, fun to play with friends.",2
"very good game very addictive... will finish the review after this turn",1
"great addition to the civilization series, with all the dlc the game evolves and becomes an even more intriguing and challenging experience.",1
"played a game with graphics and map mods, didnt get any cheevos 9.5/10 its alright - ign",1
"singlehandedly the best game that i have ever bought. it is the type of game which you can play in so many different ways whilst continuing to be exciting. if you have the money to buy this game then snatch it up, its worth every penny!",4
"best game to play while doing other things. i have enjoyed this game since the first one came out (used floppy discs to install). play this while miniature painting. love turn based games.",1
"i love civilization 5 its the best game ive ever played!!! ive played this game for 527 hours its so addicting i very deeply recommend this game to every one who likes strategy games",5
"very good strategy game, fun and addicting. you can play as many civilizations and there are lot of dlcs that adds additional maps, scenarios and civilizations.",1
"great game, the map packs are silly but all the other dlc is great.",1
"this game is somewhat enjoyable, but with its frequent crashes (just about every 5 minutes) and multitude of bugs, i would call it a waste of money. also, the steam forum for this game is full of people saying that they are experiencing these crashes. it may have something to do with windows 8.1.",1
"just know that youre going to waste a lot of time on this game... 10/10 would get nuked by ghandi again",1
"if your computer can play it, then why dont you own this?!?",1
"in my opinion, the best game ever. i started meiers civilization with civ rev on xbox 360. this has been a major upgrade and i am looking forward to getting the next game.",1
"would recommend to people who like being randomly attacked by france and montezuma.  those s",1
"play as gandhi, nuke washington back to the stone-age on the penultimate turn. (that smug er.)",2
"awesome game, lots of fun with friends. be prepared to lose all track of time. just one more turn turns into hours...lol",2
"civilization v is the fifth installment in arguably the best stratgy series ever. though people argue that its prdecessor, civ 4, was much better. but is it really. so in civ 5 you essentially pick an emeror ie; napolean and build a civilization. people say that civ 4 was better, because there were much more elements. yes, in civ 5 they did take a lot of eleents that civ 4 had, but if you are willing to get the dlc brave new world, you may get that civ experience that you were wanting all along with better graphics. you should definnitely pick this game up if you havent, you can get it really cheap of amazon or in the steam sales, in my opinion this is one of the best strategies out there today.",1
"this game was amazing until my first encounter with the trade glitch its been in the game for a good year now, so i assume they are not going to fix it. but other then that this game is pretty cool/fun to play with friends. eddit: the glicth has been patched as of the latest update**",1
"great linux port of an already great game. the base game is great, but the brave new world makes it even better. thanks for porting to linux!",1
"its a sid meier game so by saying that, you already know what you are going to get out of it such as hours on hours of gameplay that youll keep going back to year after year.",1
"very good game, you loose track of time when playing.",1
"civilization v is an amazing game that you can play for hours.",2
"blows all other turn-based strategy games out of the water, except of course xcom, which was deveoped by the same people. firaxis seriously knows what they are doing with their strategy games. the only beef i have is that if you want the full experience you have to buy gods & kings and brave new world. they add a lot to the game, and they are worth the money you are paying.",1
"a pretty good strategy game with historically relevant civilations. only really lacking some versatility. 7/10",1
"one of the greats. ive lost days of my life to this game and its a blast with friends. highly recommend all the dlc.",3
"amazing game. i have spent countless hours with and without friends enjoying this game. teaches you to learn strategy and adapt in game.",2
"a fantestic mindstrecthing strategy puzzle game you can play as quite a few civilizations and it can be easy or hard (there are 7 levels of difficulty) it may cost a lot but is absoulutely definitely worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"you really want to play it with all the dlc (with bnw in particular).",4
"biggest time sink ever. 10/10 would waste time again",1
"been playing civ for years now... never managed to get tired ! :)",1
"very good strategy game. due to its versatility there is a very high risk of addiction!",2
"its civilization v. if you love civ games, youll end up loving this one too.",1

"i have spent many an hour glued to my keyboard because of this game. too addictive. it is espesially a danger to those that have things to do.",1
"with the brave new world add on civ5 is highly recommended. depending on the difficulty and other settings you are busy days per session. for me personally a great game. one reason for me to play a game on the pc again. warning! extremely addictive!",1
"great game, and all the improvements id wanted at the start were implemented except micro economy control.",2
"civilization is an amazing game were you can have basic strategies but everything has to be freestyled to go with who you are allied with and who is near you or on the same continent. i love playing this game and have been through four playthroughs all of which were vastly different. in some i mastered technology to win, in others i conquered the world and bent great cities to ruins with nuclear weaponry. or i have founded the un and let the world choose me to lead it. but overall this game is only matched by games that have the same level of strategy but are mmos, but if you are looking for a way to strategize on your own with a great ai that truly does come close to the level of stategy you face while playing an mmo then this is the best game for you.",1
"fun . lots of mods. addicting singleplayer and multiplayer.",1
"an exellent game, one of the best that i have ever played. now stop reading this and buy it!!!",1
"since the latest expansions this has turned into a great game. no longer looking back at the days of civ4.",5
"too much fun, but when i stop playing i realize ive played an 8 hour session",1
"great game. despite issues with the dx11 support and some graphics glitches on dx9 it runs smooth. just about to declare nuclear war on the incas who didnt like me starting a city next to them and keep waving spears at me.",3
"instead of flying over a lake my helicopter turned into a boat",1
"super fun war game. playing with friend is the best way to play this game. but is still reccomendable on single player. build up cities upon cities of foundation on your civilisation and watch is thrive or be destroyed be superior forces. great game. only problem is tabbing out is super laggy and also the steam severs are of poor qualty on this game, would reccomend creating own server. 9/10",1
"it is one of the most addictive, entertaining games i have ever played",1

"wow... this game has infinite possibilities and play time... tons of hours of fun incoming!",1
"awesome. incredibly addictive & taking over my life currently :(",1
"you know its a good game when you keep pressing play game in the store during the trial version but it wont let you play it at all.",1
"i played the other ones, loved them so i got civ 5 and loved it. i would recommed this to anyone",2
"the best and most amazing game that you have ever played in my entire lyfe. buy this game at all costs but try to wait for a sale cause, $30 bucks hell no not saying its not worth it... it is just im a cheap basterd",1

"civ series has kept my closet megalomania content all these years....",2
"about to reach 400 hours in this game. i guess you could say its okay.",3
"a friend had told me about civilization for a while now, and i finally decided to pick it up during the summer sale. glad i did! civ is an awesome game so far and i literally instantly got hooked on it the first time i played. multiplayer is amazing so far even with just playing with one friend. awesome game!",1
"the fifth installment to the series sid meiers pros: you can be different countries you can be merciless or peaceful there is a variety of leaders cons: barbarians are annoying verdict: 8.5/10",1
"turn based strategy game where you gather resources, build, research, and conquer, ive been a fan of the civilization series since civ i. civilization v is fun, playable, and has better graphics than civ iv, howver, i enjoy the actual gameplay of civ iv more. i dont recommend this, or any other turn based game, for playing with other human players as the turn based nature can make it painfully slow.",1
"the only game where i can have big boss wage war against eren jaeger while being denounced by hatsune miku for being uncultured. of course i would recommend this game!",1
"this is probably the most fun and addicting game ive played yet. i would not recommend playing this when you need to do homework/study, or else this happens; -paper due tomorrow, should probably start on it -decide to play civ for a while before starting paper -next thing you know, its 3 in the morning -cry",3
"probobly the best game on steam i love stratagy but this is awsomely good cant wait for beond earth this game is amzing",3
"absolutely love the game. being able to come up with your own strategies and the random spawn locations make each game different and a joy to play! :)",1
"surprisingly fun game, great to play with friends.",1
"turn based time suck that is the de facto standard. this game is highly addictive and impossible to put away.",1
"tons of fun, if you have any thoughts on if you should get it or not, get it. it will engulf those meaningless hours that you used to use for doing productive things. great game all in alll, i would recommend purchasing the gold edition. 9/10",1
"this game takes thought to win if you know what you are doing it can set up your cards and win",1
"if you are a fan of strategy games and/or history get this game! its super fun! its so fun father time is forced to make time go faster just to get you off this game! this game also helps you learn history in best way possible! if that doesnt sound convincing it has a  ton of mod support allowing you to customize the game any way you want! overall this is a awesome game that i can recommend to even new strategists",1
"only had this game for a week and i already have 42 hours on it, my second game was a 18 hours straight game so in other words say goodbye to you social life once you start a game :)",1
"very good game requires some stratigic thinking unlike some other games, has a lot of depth, will even the slightesting causing trouble with another civ, also plenty of different civs with onw strengths and weaknesses",1
"the game is ok without dlcs. but with g&k or bnw the game is extremely good and well done. civ+expansion= very good civ alone= ok.",2
"as a poor guy, i tend to make sure all my purchases are durable. anything i put money into should theoretically last me as long as possible. i bought this game in the summer sale two years ago, and after many hours of playing, i can assure you, civ 5 is a durable game. i love replay value and, in my humble opinion, this game has replay value in spades. i have taken long breaks, but thankfully firaxis has been good about dlc and updates to keep the game fresh and me coming back. i love this game.",2
"sunk nearly 600 hours into this game, still find it deep and rewarding, best current 4x game on the market 10/10, concentrates on civilization building, not just warfare.",3
"strategy then more strategy then more of that and some -raping strategy! oh, and nukes",1
"great classic !!! just can some1 help me to get nuclear weapon in game =) i m more than 900 turn but still dont know how to get nuclear civ5 ://",1
"one of my favorite games of all times, it can be equally realistic and ridiculous and is a definite must buy! i have become a little obsessed with the game and i have hundreds of hours of playtime and have still only scratched the surface of what i can do, and what civs i can play as. you can spend hours developing strategies and plans for the ultimate empire, or just dont give a care and nuke everybody. in my time in civ i have been able to: -take over the world as the might warlord ghandi -get my butt kicked by siam within 20 turns -watch the babylonians burn after they dared to defile me -say that ill only play for 2 more turns and end up playing another 200",4
"a fantastic game. i strongly recommend getting the brave new world dlc which adds a ton to the late game. the multiplayer for the game isnt great and it has its problems, but the single player contains hundreds of hours of fun if you have the time.",1
"fantastic stratagy game. this is the first civ game ive played and it is great!!! its just one of those game which you can keep coming back too.",1
"been playing civilization since the early 90s civ 5 is the best. i have logged close to 700 hrs on civ 5 and im still not bored!",5
"what can i say about sid meiers civilization v? it is seriously one of my favourite games to date. it is an amazing turn-based strategy, that does not feel like either genre! you slowly build up your empire untill your number one, or you get left behind, choose one of the multiple ways to win, whether its world domination or the magnificent space race. i feel like anyone could play this game with or without your friends and still have a great time. wait did i say with your friends? yup it has multiplayer. as you are building your civilization why not invite your buddy? where both of you get to compete with your friends to see who is the better conquerer! i hate turn based games, but this is great game that everyone can enjoy! p.s. and remember, dont trust ghandi :p",1
"i love this strategy you can play countless hours for sure...you can enjoy this game everyday! buy it if you like strategys..! you wont be disappointed..!!! (sorry for the bad english)",1
"this game is fantastic. it has a great gameplay, great visuals, however it is a little bit difficult when you start out. its easy to create games and just play, but requires some amount of thinking, which most games dont require now-a-days. i rate this game 9/10",1
"pure excellence in world domination sims. some things were better in civ iv but overall i prefere this one.",1
"i have lost days and nights playng this game. it is the only game i know of that i can spend hours apon hours at a time with no food or drink. strongly recomend this for anyone, trying to no study for finals, lose some pounds or are suffering from a physo x girlfriend and cant leave the house for a few days",1
"sid meiers civilization v is one of the greatest games i have played. with an almost infinite replayability value, this game can be played over and over again and get a different experience each time. depending on how you set up the game you can play a quick hour or two game or a game that lasts days. if you are looking to sit back, relax and dominate, you can play on an easier setting. if you are looking for a very difficult challenge, you can play on the hardest difficulty mode. and the modding community for this is great and extensive, there are all sorts of cool and entertaining mods. i really enjoyed this game, and its dlcs.",2
"enjoy hours and hours of fun with sid meiers civilization v it is a must play as one of the best strategy simulation games out there! choose who you lead with as you build your empire and lead your civilization to victory!",1
"great system, well organised. more ideal for multiplayer usage, and more fun with closer friends than strangers. make sure you have a lot of time to invest, or you will be taking a lot of breaks and games can go on for weeks, maybe months. highly advise to get the dlcs that improve gaming content, and are extensions, as they tend to include importany and game defining features. 9/10 recommended for those who have friends willing to take the time to play a city building game. (around 4+ is best)",1
"purchased when it came out and its cost me 90 bucks thus far good game not worth paying just to make it playable",3
"if i could only play one and only one game for a year, this would be it. you will lose all your time playing this.",3
"just pure amazing soon a new game of civ called sid meiers civilization: beyond earth i am excited for that so fall of 2014. but the game its just magnificent. i reccomend it with a 10/10.",2
"defiantly buy this, this game is most likely the easiest way to waste time :d",1
"sid meiers civilization v, i really enjoy these games and this one is not an exception. infact i think ill play a game now. :-) 5/5 *****",1
"great single player, the multiplayer is epic. i wish you could form alliances though... 8/10",1
"spent 13 hours playing a game. got atomic death robots. was repeatedly nuked by the peaceful mahatma gandhi, then beaten in the race to alpha centauri by genghis khan. 12/10 for realism+general awesomeness",1
"good fun, though it does make a macbook air try to take off when playing against the ai (fans go nuts to keep the cpu cool). so easy to lose half a day to the game because of the just one more turn nature.",1
"if your a fan of strategy games give this game a spin. civ 5 offers a ton of fun content available to each player with multiple ways to pave the path to victory. the core game itself is a good game. add gods and kings or brave new world and your playtime basically doubles and triples. even with all my hours in civ i still dont tire of playing it. 9/10 would play again.",1
"ghandi is just so kind... just look at him with all his nukes.",4
"this is a great game to play by yourself or with friends. the whole concept of this game is good the gameplay is flawless you can spend countless hours raising an army or trying to get into space either way you will have loads of fun with so many different civs to choose from youll find yourself each time before you start a game taking a while to pick your civ. you can play this game one thousand times and have a different out come each time. the ais are very balanced and you can choose your difficulty to suit your needs. this game being 4 years old is still an amazing game 10/10.",1
"the best civilization ever, also the best strategy game i have ever played. i recommend using both gods and kings and brave new world expansion packs for the full civilization feeling. just one more turn.....",4
"warning! you will be shocked how fast the time goes after purchase. 10/10 i love this game.",1
"a very fun, replayable game. i think that it is a good game to play when you have a significant amount of time to waste. i will say however, that i find it hard to play if it the sole thing i am doing as it can be very monotonous clicking the next turn button constantly, especially if you are playing single player. the multiplayer does make this game as great as it is though. playing with 2/3 friends is quite the experience when you have to work together to defeat a common enemy when ultimately you will have to go your own course in your pursuit of victory. a much recommended game, in my honest opinion and well worth the money.",2
"one of the best strategy games of all time. would recommend to everyone.",2
"barbarians razed my farms and massacred my citizens 10/10",1
"although it certainly has a few redeeming qualities, good graphics, replayability, social interaction, etc. this game really isnt worth it. in my experience the games are far too slow (to the point of falling asleep between turns if you arent careful), and your turns are not as engaging and exciting as they could be. also, this game has very poor optimization for computers running amd hardware. cant speak for intel systems.",1
"best strategy game in years, probably will keep up with beyond earth for a good long while thanks to its immersive gameplay. awesome! xd",1
"ive loved civilization since the day i played the original. civ5 has improved on things quite a bit in both game mechanics and visuals. this is deffiantely a game worth having! and if your already familar with the civ series, be warned... napoleon is still an . >.>",1
"say goodbye to your life. amazing game (both for single anf multi) with only one (very important for me, as mod fan) disadvantage: you cannot use mods (which completely overhaul the game) in multiplayer.",3
"sid meiers civilization v is a god among games. if you dont get it you are mentally .",2
"i have owned civilization 4 and civilization 5 has expanded on every thing i liked about civilization 4. this game was worth every penny i spent on it. i highly recomend this game to everyone.",3
"saying oh ill just play for an hour a great way to lose half a day",1
"this is the latest incarnation of the civilization series. pick your ruler, build your cities, expand your borders and prepare for war. the game can be long and involved (about 30 hours to complete on the largest maps), but provides a lot of variety due to the different leaders available and the many ways one can use to win the game (culture, war, a vote in the un, or via science).",1
"an excellent game on all accounts. if you love strategy, or if you want to remake history, this is the game for you.",2
"civilization v is a wonderful game. it has many improvements over civ iv and was hard to get used to after just playing the later version but once i did the improvements were obvious. i like the additions of the city states and the tutorial is very helpful. i highly recommend this game.",1
"this game is amazing. great strategy and fun gameplay will leave you thinking okay, just one more turn. ...and thats my biggest complaint: if you play this game, you will probably get sucked in and spend hours upon hours playing it. if youre going to buy it, make sure you have the next day or two off work.",1
"its a very good game. time consumer yes. can take a whole weekend on a single game. not the best when playing only against ai opponents, religion is kind a dumb system if compared to civ iv, also why no technology trading? still i recommend this game.",1
"this game is the most fun management game ever. i dont think i could ever insult it 2143621341234123432/10",1
"great and fun game, worth its cost during summer sale!",1
"i saw that the full version of the game was on sale for $12 and i was excited because i havent played it before im only about 6 hours in and i already love this master piece. love the game :) plan to play it alot. 10/10",1
"simply the most replayable game i have ever played. staggeringly good value.",3
"quite honestly, the best civilization of all time. this is truly a masterpiece that just keeps getting better and better with each and every playthrough. i cant highly recommend this enough. the gods & kings expansion pack just makes the game even better.",3
"great game, easy to learn with tons of variations gameplay for incredible replay value.",3
"1.allys with ghandi 2.ghandi makes nukes 3.ghandi says nukes are to be used on russia 4.i feel safe and trust him 5.he nukes all of my citys destroying them 6. gg ghandi 10/10 would play again",1
"one of these magic games where you try to play half of hour but end up playing it whole night.",1
"great for strategist and history-buffs alike. win with war, culture, technology, and stylish creativity.",1
"amazing. thats all i can label it as. nothing is more fun than watching your enemies capital be ingulfed by a mushroom cloud from your nuclear arsenal. with plenty of modding capabilities, the possibilities for this game are endless. this game overs a great variety even without mods too! will you be a kind and benevolent leader, or a merciless tyrant? will you be a religious fanatic, or a rational heretic? will you pull the world into nuclear conflict, or make world peace? will you stomp upon those weaker than you, or will you make allies and fight the neverending war machine? will you build a nation, that will stand the test of time?",1
"this game is truly amazing especially if u get the complete edition. you basically manage an entire country u built up from nothing and makhere are make it a global superpower. there are countless countries to play as as many custom governments u can create (the custom government thing is only in the complete edition and brave new world). you can declare war on countries and maybye take over the world if u want. also this game has a very complex political system that is great for negotiating complex deals. there are 5 ways to win th game whicheach are all funt try out. this game will give you months of entertainment. 10/10 amazing game",1
"i recommend this it is a very fun and exciting strategy game with lots to think about while in-game.",1
"the best turn-based strategy game i played.. they keep updating the game with large dlcs, it costs money but that makes the game durable. you never played a turn-based strategy game before? well civilization 5 is a lot easier to play than the civilizaition games before. just try it, its awesome!",1
"hands down, *the best* real time strategy game ive ever played. engrossing, long-lasting matches, excellent multiplayer, and nearly infinite replay value. civ just cant be beat.",1
"a good, updated version of the classic with some exceptional new features. still a lot of fun in single player, but my friends and i love the multiplayer.",3
"do you believe that your fit to rule the world. well you have to start from the bottom to get to the top! throughout the game i focused on more then world domination, theres an economy you must mantain, people you must feed and armies you must manage. its not as easy as you may come to believe. but when you crush egypt, or ghandi, or whomever else it may be, you walk away satisfied.",2
"i love this game. 1) its good for school 2) its fun 3) it can be used in school -=bad fetures=- lag (depends what option) crasheds (too many crashes!) overheating issue (a lot of overheating problems [depending system])",1
"a classic. complex, but worth learning. one of the best games of all time (if you also have the expansions for it: gods and kings & brave new world, also note that brave new world is the more recent expansion and adds all of the functionality of gods and kings but does not include the civilizations from gods and kings). highly addictive gameplay that will have you staying up too late for just one more turn. with a great range of difficulty levels there is something here for everyone: from the civ rookie all the way up to strategy pros. cant recommend this game enough!",3
"this game will devour your social life with extreme prejudice. dont say i didnt warn you.",2
"awesome game, the amount of time i spent playing is too damn high! haha",1
"10/12 best game. gaben is now a titan, not a god. kappa licked his lips over dis title. serious note here : good for the whole famiry.",1
"awesome game! very addicting! one of my favorite games!",1
"great game! has to be one of my favourite games of all time but i suppose thats obvious from the ridiculous play time. the two most recent dlcs; gods & kings and brave new world are a must have, the extra gameplay they implement is incredible.",3
"i really really really should do my homework. let me just settle this research agreement first. ok i should really finish writing my research paper. i just unlocked flight.. maybe after a few more turns. huh... failed every class but macroeconomics this semester.",1
"built a massive military, simultaneously nuked every other country, and took over the world. 10/10.",1
"ill give you v good reasons not to play this game. i. cant find whales. ii.ghandi is a . iii. my friends are . iv. no character customization. v. roman numerals are an outdated form of numbering things.",1
"awesome game, had it for about a year and i love it! just one problem, for some reason i am unable to create a religion! otherwise this is the best game i have!",1
"its the best. besides the fact that it takes a ing year to beat",1
"make sure you have a clock you can see while playing so you dont accidentally miss out on the rest of your life.",1
"with the gods & kings expansion the game is nicely rounded out and i think a worthy civ title.",1
"stately, plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. a yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him by the mild morning air. he held the bowl aloft and intoned: introibo ad altare dei.",1
"truely excellent, eventually a marvelous sequel after poor attempts of civilization 3 and 4. this has the feel of civilization 2 but with greater depth and more thought put into fighting and cultural strengths and weakness. would buy this game again and wouldnt regret it in a heartbeat!",2
"gamers should marry gamers. and if that happens, playing hot seat civilization v with the wife counts a spending quality time together :)",4
"very easy to get sucked into. i end up playing for hours on end whenever i start this game up, and its well worth thirty dollars.",1
"playing as japan and 3 whales are next to my capital on the first turn. stereotypes/10",2
"although i do not play it as much as i did, i still think that this is one of my favourite games of all time. it is great to play against the a.i. and even better to play people online, (although some people take it a bit too seriously). pros: - easy controls - large variations in civilizations available - simple display (of data and map) - option for normal and strategic display - fair and balanced gameplay - fun to play, even after long games - very customizable options (in-game) - a.i. is balanced: in difficulty and in gameplay cons: - long games can sometimes grow tedious - some civilizations are better at everything than others [this may be unavoidable: to have weak civs and more powerful civs] - occasional texture glitches; but i think thats just me all and all, i think this is a brilliant game, and would most definately recommend it to people who enjoy strategy games.",2
"this game is hours of fun! each expansion pack adds a new demension to the game making it even more fun. this game can make you easily forget that there is a world going on outside your computer room. the game is awesome to play with friends. best installment of the series thus far. endless fun.",2
"yes!!! this game is truly amazing! in true civilization fashion this is one of the best,only if you have the dlc. they basically took what made civ 4 good and took a couple of things out going oh we dont need this lets just take this out. and then when people complained about it and went oh we took that out becasue we didnt think people would want it so if you pass us a couple of bucks you can have that stuff. what im saying is if you are going to buy thid game or any of the civilization games then wait for a complete edition or buy the dlc so the game you play is complete. im not trying to say the game is incomplete im just saying that if you want a full experiance then get the dlc.",1
"sid meiers civilization v is the best strategy game ive played. the new hex grid tile system works extremely well for combat, allowing for a much more strategic, intellectual battle. sadly, the game doesnt fully feel complete without both the gods & kings and brave new world dlc packs. g&ks revamps the technology tree, adds more buildings, units, and civilizations, includes an espionage system, and adds a religion system to the game. bnw adds a new cultural system/victory, new civilizations, ideologies, trade routes, and a world congress. both dlc packs are a must-have for the full, complete experience. be prepared to be a victim of just one more turn.",5
"very good rts. definitely my favorite one to date. would recommend 10/10",2
"i try to be friendly but then i end up conquring the world. 10/10",1
"very fun game which will never get old with all community mods e.g world war ii",1
"i grew up loving real-time strategy games such as age of empires, warcraft, knights & merchants and rise of nations. my first impressions when i tried the turn-based civilization v (when it came out) was extremely negative. i was off by how the level looked like a board game and how everything depended on number of turns, even for soldiers. however, everything changed once i finally understood how to play this game. to begin with, there is a high learning curve to understand how a civ match works. you will have to be patient in the beginning of the game, where you build your civilization. once thats out of the way, the fun starts! the way you do politics, agreements and war is very interesting and it actually simulates a board game. so if you love board games, you gotta buy this one.",1
"civ 5 is an amazing game, once you start a game you will want to finish. i started as britain and over a few thousand years i had managed to be hated by the whole world, this is when i decided to strike. i started with india demolishing there country and army with my huge force of advanced soldiers, war in civ is quite tactical and requires planning; i started by surrounding the border with my army and naval force and then when my army is together i launch the attack and overwhelm the opponents army. i conquer india and proceed onto more countries. i managed to destroy every country in the world except america and ethiopia when i decided i had spent way too long on the game! :d 9.5/10",1
"what you need to know: this is probably one of the best stratagey games created. if you have the 2 expansions then the game is well balanced to appeal to many different types of play. whether you want to stick to your one little city on an island and go for a diplomatic victory, or expand your civilization by the might of your military; then this game will appeal to you. i highly suggest playing with a group of friends or even just 1, multiplayer against other humans or even teaming up against comps is what makes this game great. the only flaw is the amount of money you have to spend getting all the expansions so buy the complete edition when its on sale. other than that i know its worth the value, i have gotten more hours out of this game than any other.",2
"its awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"i am a civ 3 + 4 fan, so i bought this. it was super confusing after 14 hours i still had no idea what was happening and at no point was it fun. save you time for something more worthwhile than this game.",1
"terrible without dlc. good thing im not poor. 10/10",3
"a really simple and easy to pick up strategy game that even people new to strategy games can pick up and enjoy. its a really good game that goes into a high amount of detail on the map and in terms of facial animations of each leader (of which there are lots of). i would really recommend picking up the gods & kings and/or the brave new world dlc as these add new features to the game and fix a lot of bugs. well worth a go if youre even slightly interested in strategy games, it is definitely a good time sink.",1
"strategy games have has a large area in my heart, keeping me locked with them, this is just another good game, by the best strategy maker sid meier! he is a good strategy maker, in my eyes, since i have most of his games, and i still want moar. i recommend this to you, because its a fine game, long game sessions, but its calm, relaxing, and a true time spender.",1
"i sat down and told myself i would play for 1 hour. *12 hours later* yeah! get nuked russia! *falls asleep*",2
"ive spent alot of time in this game and it is fantastic, 5 stars, i only wish you could stack units but i understand why they chenged it i really havent played any of the other ones but this one is great if me and my friends had the time i would bplay more but the singleplayer is still tons of fun. i would recomend this to a friend!",2
"a greatgame that makes real hours seem like minutes",1
"a really awsome game i only with all my friends could play this also!!",1
"time-sink, and boy do you love the hours you put in it.",1
"this game is an awesome strategy game. for those chess players who like to build like in games like minecraft. pros- in depth gameplay. multilple difficulties, various game modes. always expanding and you can always find a mod to build whatever world or civ you want. con- lengthy for anyone who only wants to play for short periods. some civs are imba and others stink.",3
"a great game and easy to get in to. just dont start on deity if you are new to the civ series. 10/10",1
"sid meiers civilization v is not only a great single player strategy game but it is also the best option for the multiplayer game with all the maintained proportions of all the available civs. you simply must have this game if you title your self a strategy geek.",2
"a great game with many elements and suprises, if your a history buff or just enjoy a great turn based strategy this is a great game. 10/10",2
"it is really fun, highly reccomend it, even if you have never played a turn based strategy. it has very helpful tooltips to help you learn the game.",1
"amazing game that forces you to balance between being nice with others and destroying your enemies to expand your empire.",2
"civ 5 is a great game and i definitely had a lot of fun playing it. that said, the game can feel a bit lacking in content sometimes, especially in the endgame. this really hurts the replayability and i would not recommend the game without the brave new world dlc.",2
"it sucks when you pay 25$ for it, and then the next day its 12$.",1
"the ultimate experience in video gaming. this game will make you think, a lot. that may be why you play it. or you are a power-hungry sociopath and you get off on watching people succumb to your will.",2
"if you want something that is useless at teaching you history but is really fun and involves history just that little bit get this game!",1
"a wonderful strategy game. a must recommend for everyone. remember to buy all expansions for best experience!",2
"the type of game that can suck you for hours as soon as you pick it up... 5/5",1
"you get to conquer the world as a mongolian nuff said",1
"this game is great for replayability since every game is different, plus, ghandi nuked me a++",1
"ive played every civ, and all i can say about civ v is that it is absolutely fantastic. 10/10 must buy for anyone who has played any civ title ever. you can lose hours at a time and not even notice until you check the clock. amazing game, and cant wait for the next.",1
"great game, makes hours of playtime seem like minutes. make sure you get the expansions, though.",4
"sometimes i start playing this game and realise im late for class... the next day.",2
"one of the best games in the civ series in my opinion. the game has an excellent combination of strategy, and action (for those who love wars that is.) i would reccomend this game to just about anyone who really wants to play a challenging game, and for those who love strategy, its a must have. with the steam community being extremely active in the work-shop, the game has an abundant amount of mods available to change the gameplay. i give the game a 10/10, and would highly suggest you to buy it, if you dont already own it. itll remain the the game of my choice for years to come.",2
"i have owned this game for about a month, maybe a little more and it is one of my favorites until recently (not saying it isnt good but this is really annoying, still love the game) when whenever i try to load up a save or start a new game, it crashes. besides that annoying aspect, the game is amazing and if you dont own it (one of my friends), buy it.",2
"its kinda like civilization revolutions for xbox 360 and ps3, only much better.",1
"basically this is all i have to say. the game is great,the units are awesome, and the small cutscences when you meet a new civ are amazing. i highly recomand this game to those who are a fan of the civ series and those who are a fan of strategy. so whats my rating for this? 1010 one eyed dragon approved.",1
"i absolutely love this game. the dlcs are great, and there are some terrific mods out there. a lot of fun for a very long time. 10/10. would play again. i just cant even. only odd.",2
"great game (with brave new world) subpar otherwise. very immersive, high replay value. scenario mode is awesome. #gandhi nuke man for president",1
"great game if you are looking for a way to make make a world the way you think it should be run. if this is not enough for you than civ 5 a brave new world will improve the game to make it better than it already is.",2
"seriously do not try to play this game before going to bed, this is not a game to wind down to. 10/10",1
"hours of your life will pass you by...and you wont care.",2
"the classic sonic levels were better than the modern sonic levels",1
"i love this game, and reccomend it to anyone who is a fan of strategy, 9.5/10",1
"this game is for people who seek world domination. this game is for people who are scientific. this game is for people who love culture and stuff. this game is a strategy game. this game, my friends, is for everyone. 101/100",1
"great turn based strategy. beautifully and ergonomically presented and really easy to pick up.",1
"buy. this. game. i have over 400 hours invested into this game and it has not gotten boring yet. make sure you get the downloadable content with it. it makes a huge difference and brings all new and exciting ways to play to the table. you have to be careful when playing this game because you will start playing and bam next thing you know you have been playing for 6 hours straight. one of the best games i have ever bought. there is one con to this game. when playing online make sure you try and play with all human players so there are few or no ais playing with you. this is because for some reason the ais wont declare war on anyone while it is in online mode. they will in single player, just not online. honestly that is the only negative thing i have found about this game. word of advice, the zulus are s and mahatma gandhi is an even bigger . 9.5/10",2
"addiction is an understate as the famous sid said one more turn",2
"a great game for lovers of stratagy, be warned there is no such thing as a quick game so be prepared to invest alot of hours into it. (oh and be careful of ghandi, if he can nuke you by god he will.)",2
"if you like games that keep you up until sunrise, then this is the game for you",2
"i massacred thousends of russians. it was a ripoff of the third mission of cod modwarf2 but i enjoyed it!",1
"one of my favorite games ever i could play this games for hundreds of hours and never get bored, especially if im playing with a friend. highly reccomend 11/10",1
"the turn-based strategy game from where all the other turn-based strategy games got their ideas from. playing civ since version 1 and it keeps getting better and better. recomend it to all strategy fans.",2
"one of the best games ive ever played! great replayability",1
"i hate this game! just one more turn. how am i supposed to get any sleep or much less do anyhing?",2
"such a great game. only getting started in it but i can easily see my self pouring hundreds of hours into it. good choice for people just getting into turn based or age old veterans.",1
"what a great game so far... i havent really played it multi yet, but single, online or off, is fun! i recommend this game to all my friends!",1
"you all need to check out this website to get either civ 5 or mafia 2 for free,",1
"highly addictive! i couldnt put it down for four days in a row.",2
"the best civilization since civ ii. just cannot stop playing the damn thing.",1
"i liked the base game, but i loved the expansions. if you get it, the expansions are a must (dlc is still optional however). one of the richest strategy experiences out there.",1
"oh hell yes! this game will consume your life, but youll love every damn second of it",1
"ive always been a fan since civ 2, though i was too young to really understand what i was doing. probably one of my favourite parts of the game is that you buy a game and an encycliopedia, and the quotes. i love all the amazing quotes in the game.",1
"amazing game. each new version of the game brings more and more stuff.",1
"a simple but very well polished game. infinite scenarios, each unique and enjoyable. highly advised.",2
"its hard not to enjoy the civilization games, and this is so far my favorite. the expansions make it even better.",2
"the dlcs make this game so fun, and the basegame is still good. with friends its even better, and i recommend getting this if you have a couple of friends getting it. 9/10",1
"i have the complete edition which i got on sale, and i really must say: great game. is it a game? is it a simulator? either way the intricacy, the depth, the characters, the realism is/are fantastic. for a number of years i had passed over societal/national simulators because none of them had the detail and intricacy necessary for bringing realism to the social/political interactions between nations. this one does a good job with that, and im impressed. my only caveat is that the ai is sometimes really dumb. otherwise its one of the best games ever made, i think: 9/10.",1
"i come from tons of hours on civilization iii and i was a little sospicious about this one... but i was wrong. this game balanced, tough and have a lot of new cool stuff. worth it.",1
"not the greatest civ game i have played. not being able to stack units and the hexa-tiles sure makes things different from the previous games. you have to love civ to look past the flaws to enjoy all the beauty that is this game.",1
"its a great game, if youre not familiar with the series check out youtube first. its a real time sink.",1
"one of the top games ive ever played. its very nice to just sit and chill with friends playing this game! worth every penny and more! p.s get brave new world it aswell is worth every penny!",1
"ok thought i would finally do this reveiw of civ 5, after much belly acheing on my part and out right refusal to play civ in anyway shape or form i must say that i now have the hang of this game so now i can add that its not that bad to play, graphics are very pleaseing to the eye interfaceing is also easy to get a handle on it. so i give this game a solid 8 out of 10 if you ever get a chance to get it for a decent price go for it.",1
"multi player or single player, absolutely amazing and addicting.",1
"probably one of the best sid meiers games out there at this moment",1
"amazing game but the ai cheats on the higher difficulty ratings. i mean the ai shouldnt cheat it just makes the game feel  when suddenly the ai get 50 units out of nowhere in 2 rounds. but other than that it really is quite a good game 8/10",2
"starting with civilizaton ii i have always enjoyed these games. although i dislike how selling expansion packs is abused by publishers now-a-days, for civ games i will usually fork over my hard earned dough.",2
"super addicting game so glad i got the expansions on sale =d",1
"this game is flipping amazing. nuff said. its awesome, its addicting, the graphics are amazing, ive played it for 39 hours, its really good, awesomest turn-based strategy ive ever played. go buy it now.",1
"one of the handful of games that simply doesnt get old for me. uniquely engaging and expertly designed, civilization has been killing it since the beginning.",2
"slowly giving up my social life for this and i have to say, it is so worth it.",1
"fantastic game. offers hours of game play and makes time fly by.",1
"in the end, i got enough enjoyment out of this game to recommend it, though it still feels off and game-y - it really punishes you for doing things the wrong way, and i never really feel like i can attack anybody until civilizations have guns, when most of the appeal for me is playing as ancient empires like the romans. but anyway, its still worth playing.",1
"best game i have ever played on pc 9/10 if ran on a good pc that can support huge worlds full of ai this game cannot be beaten in the strategy category. hands down the most enjoyable relaxed game. it is also hard to find good online play with strategy games yet, although due to other players some times tedious still adequate and fun to play. easy peeps",3
"so much fun, to play single and multiplayer, and if youre worried about not having enough time for a complete game, you can change the settings to accelerate turns and make you able to do more in them but less turns, it can easily cut game time to a third",1
"three rules to the game... 1. invading people makes everyone hate you and you cant take them all out fast enough 2. trade is king and making friends wins games 3. gandhi will drop the bomb if you let him (dont trust) 10 atom bombs dropping on gandhi out of 10",1
"i love this game! this is one of my favorite games to play, but i dont like how the dlc costs so much",1
"fun strategy game, i would recommend it for anyone who likes tactics or strategy. very confusing to understand at first but you slowly adapt to the game the more you play, maybe reading or getting help about the game would help you. still trying to understand the game more and im so far enjoying the game. and playing together with your friends is probably the most fun part about the game in my opinion. 9/10",1
"if you plan on getting this game, be warned, you will spend hours and hours of your time playing civilization v. it is so addictive, and has huge replayability, with 5 different victory types, and over 20 different civilizations to play as. definatly of my favorite games ever, 11 out of 10.",1
"honestly? ive played civ 5 for hours on end, but i still prefer civ 4. there, i said it. still a good game though!",3
"love this game makes you think more about the whole battle feild other then just one guy. never played this game before and i really am enjoying it.",1
"this game is like squeezing blood from a stone, while talking to the night.",2
"best buy you could make on steam. will give you hours and hours of fun and entertainment.",4
"great game to play with friends. very strategic requires a lot of skill and cunning. quite cheap for what it is worth aswell. great game overall",1
"this has become my favorite steam game since the day i got it. i truly recommend this game, but i do recommend that you buy the dlc for the game. the dlc really improves the game. 9/10",3
"requires a bit more careful planning, thought, diplomacy and time than other games ive played. bit of a time sink, but damn is it satisfying to one-up england with a people they suppressed and screwed around historically.",1
"if your thinking about getting it, get it. i dont even like stratagey games and i love this...",1
"well worth the money, long gameplay and obviously great replayability",1
"very entertaining and lots of food fun with strategy. fun multiplayer",2
"such a great game to play, and be warned, bananas start wars!",1
"good game. there is a lot of dlc that i havent tried out yet. much more fun to play with freinds than randoms or computer ai.",1
"addicting i played 20 hours in one day it felt like 2 hours",1
"good game. but dont plan on finishing the game in one hour or so.",1
"lost many hours of my life to this. pick it up during a sale, its definitely worth paying for.",1
"right now, i have 171 hours spent on this game. doesnt that say it all? its amazing, addictive, but mindless enough you can play it on one monitor whilst watching a movie on the other. i highly recommend the mods. a lot of them build really nicely on the vanilla game, adding a lot more units and styles of play. i almost always play with mods now because the changes are too good to ignore.",1
"i will never get sick of this game. recently featured on npr as a game adults should play.",3
"10/10 for being able to nuke the us as japan, take over the world as germany or for just having a city state called ur a must buy",3
"some major changes, but i like them. way more strategic than just creating an epic stack and steamrolling the map. gods and kings dlc adds religion, and a few other parts of ai have had some updates. my only complaint is how dlc crazy they went this time. i would much rather have 1 or 2 substantial dlcs than 20 little ones, and then another that costs nearly $30 but only includes elements that probably could/should have been in the original release.",1
"this game is amazing. games might take a while to start. i give it a",1
"all around great game good for a wide variety of ages. lots of promising hours of gameplay in this kingdom ruling simulation.",1
"ghandi was being a smartass and then the game froze. i re-loaded it and ghandi was still a smartass.",1
"recently ive tried to play a normal single player game and the game freezes and says that it encoutered an error and needs to be shut down. i retry to play and the problem happens again, usually during diplomatic discussions. i have an awesome computer and have never had this problem before november when i started to play again. i love this game but unfortunately i hate not being able to play. please help me....",3
"youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you, but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter. 20/10",1
"absolutely addictive. easy to pick up and play even if you arent that into strategy games, its probably the best strategy game ive ever played. easily 9/10 for the base game, with the expansions its easily 10/10.",1
"this game is an absolutely blast! requires some patience though because games tend to last a while. luckily, there is a save feature. you could be playing the same game for weeks!",1
"game sucks.. if you come even close to being a viable civilization, the game will give you  maps and no resources.. typical sid meyers game. i played 2 and loved it, played 3 and burned it in fireplace. skipped 4 and should have skipped 5. oh, i should add i have played games since my first one, the bards tale on my old ibm with no ram, only 2 7 flopies. lot of games have gone by the board since then and i played a lot of hours on useless ones and fun ones. other than master of orion 2 and civ 2, the sid meyer games have been by far the worst games i have ever played.",2
"the game is realy cool. its need to have a long time to play but it realy fun for strategy lovers and history lovers. goes well with the bnw expension and the g&k.",2
"an extremely fun game to play even when you only have the base game. but with brave new world and gods and kings makes the experience even more fun. this is definately a game you will come back to again and again.",1
"i havent played civ alot yet, but i enjoyed it so far!",1
"with the bnw expansion the game is now very deep and enjoyable. there are many different and well-balanced paths to victory. as someone who started playing civ 2, it has taken me awhile to adjust to civ 5. they may have the same names but they are fundmentally different games. in one the key to win was near constant expansion and the creation of doom stacks. civ 5 is pleasantly different. pros: culture system is finally come into its own ai is no longer horrible at war all systems well balanced and thoughtful stratagy is rewarded cons: the non-cheating ai (prince) is still not nearly as good at the gam e as any human",1
"i can spend hours on this game, why? well its not just about winning battles to win but also about economics and developing your country with new developments you can do it.",2
"get this when its on sale. but not stand alone 8/10",1
"i reallly enjoy this game because its complicated many ways to win, and you always have fun even when your new so i think you should play it",1
"good game... but today only in sp. multiplayer is kindda uplayable. every 5 turn someone disconnect and yo cant play map bigger than small, because when more than 6 players on the map game dont catching up and every turn = loading. still freezes and dropping connections. ai in multiplayer is totaly dumb and dont even interact with you unless you do. this game would deserve a lot more attension from developers, but they are actually doing new civ which, i hope will not end like this one. still i really recomend this game for its last turn addiction and great replayability. but that multiplayer is a shame. :/",2
"the fluidity and addictive nature of this game really made me feel comfortable as a first time strategy game player. a must buy. unless you value your social life.",1
"my life is ruined by this game. with a free day i end up playing 14 hours or more. its so good that i actually lose sleep over thinking about what im going to do tommorow.",1
"you think youll only play an hour or so but than 11 hours later and at 4am you realized your hooked. 10/10",1
"civilization is one of the few games that is really worth its price. you can keep playing it fo as long as you want and every time it will present you with chalenges and meaninful decisions. not that 8 hours disposable crap you are used to. buy it now.",1
"awesome game. keeps me seated for tens of hours and i havent tried out expansion packs. i definetly recommend this to everyone, who likes to relax, yet focus on strategy. turn based system works really well.",1
"when it comes to losing entire days over a weekend glued to your screen ... civ is at the top of the list... in reality, after years of playing civ through its various generations, civ 5 now sits at the level sofistication that the developers had to leave planet earth to take a step forward... literally.",3
"as a monarch ruling under the divine right of kings, i must infallably declare, regardless of my spelling, that this game is very enjoyable. this is a fantastic game for anyone who is into stratagy games. however, i must say that diplomacy in this game is impossible. dont even try. trust no one. beware ghandi. dont blink. blink and youre dead. dont turn your back, dont look away, and dont blink. good luck.",2
"ever wanted to nuke the  out of korea or conquer the land as the mighty warlord ghandi, perhaps you would like to have peaceful debates as the huns, no? maybe not your game then.",1
"the biggest problem with civ. 5, is that the game is borderline bland and boring without any of the incredible dlc. though with all of those(which if you buy on a steam sale wont be to pricy)put together, you get a beautifully crafted turn-based trategy game that demands hundreds of hours to be put into and always lets the player find something new when they play it. it also very easily teaches the player to play, with difficulty levels going from very beginner to experienced master civilization 5 is a wonder of a game that demands attention.",3
"named my religion the d and everyone wanted it. 10/10",2
"this is one of the most played games in my steam library, i bought the gold edition and fell in love with it, eventually i bought brave new world, and it became an even better game than ever before. if you have never played this game before, take my word for it, buy this game.",2
"i think my game is broken i never was attack by ghandi",1
"if this game was a lady i would be having an affair.",5
"get the expansions. several sales (years) later i finally manage to get civ5 and the expansions for the cost of what would of been the original game and i can now finally start racking up the hours. an awesome game stripped bare on release.",1
"fantastic, strategic gameplay. an immersive learning curve gets you into the game early, and you cant help but play until youre the last nation standing.",3
"i love civ! definitly worth buying however multiplayer games dont get finished often because this game can suck away hours of your life and not everyone in the game wants to spend 8 consecutive hours playing. so if you find yourself with an extra 8hrs of nothing pop a squat :)",2
"totally. amazing. game. i feel like i get sucked in as soon as i start playing with my friends or alone. good graphics, great mods, great updates&expansions! definetly up there in the best startegy games on pc.",3
"a great game that makes me come back for more, ive played over 100hrs and have all the dlcs and it never gets old, lots of fun and great replay value but dont forget steam workshop has many amazing mods too. overall 10/10",1
"i love civ it is such a fun game, and when you play with your friends it only multiplies the experience!",1
"great game if you have many hours to play. everything about it is what you can expect from a sid meier game and more.",1
"sometimes i play this game and my dog starts floating.",1
"ive been playing since civ 1, played and bought civ ii, civ iii, civ iv and now civ v. it is good. but be sure to buy the complete edition. you will sleep less because of it, promise.",1
"you can invade the united states of america as gandhi 10/10 game of the century",3
"if you want something to do with friends this is the game for you",2
"i like to play the ottomans cuz he has a funny hat",4
"i like this game so mutch because it is a strategy game where you go from ancient era to future era. i like that very mutch. there is nothing about the game that i dislikes.",1
"its a very good game for playing singleplayer but it is more fun to play it whit freinds.",1
"i recently purchased civ 5, and later got the gold edition pack and after that i bought gods and kings. civ 5 on its own is a good game, with thegold edition/gods and kings, it is a really good game, with brave new world, it is possibly the best strategy game on pc. its easy toget started but at the same time it is complex and deep. but with the good dlc costing 20/$30 it is difficult to recomend. if the dlc is on offer, get it.",1
"pretty entertaining for a few hours but often gets a bit boring, overall i like owning kingdoms <3",1
"not as good as iv in some ways... better in others. any fan of the series will find things they enjoy about this title",2
"fun little turn based, great for testing your wits, use mods to have added fun, 8/10 in my book.",2
"nuking my best friends when they are 3 ages below me its a feeling like your a god.",1
"it is a very nice game and it is really addicting. i had lots of fun playing this game. i really recomend it.",1
"civilization is one of my favorite gaming series of all time. it contains every element of a turn based stragegy game that i have every wanted. i recommend this game to everyone.",1
"one of the best games i have ever played. the replay value is what makes this game worth while. the game changes through every playthrough because you can make 1000 different decissions between each era leading to different endings. one game being the world leader peacfully desiding to host the world games, the next game you could be a war mongering leader that rules a majority of the world.",5
"the pringles of gaming... dont start playing if you have any plans for the next 10 hours!",2
"i recommend civ 5. yeah, initially i was skeptical. zomg they simplified civ 5 you s! but honestly? a lot of that was simply fat trimmed from a swaggering, bloated cow. the core game has needed a rather serious refactoring, particularly military units which civ 5 addresses. not perfectly, mind you, but i like the direction it is taking. and yes i know its civ v not civ 5, but that just sounds like some kind of disparaging slang. you civvie!",1
"well... at first i was like... eh this is alright. but i just kicked my wife and kids out when they tried to turn my computer off.  this game is so gooooood",1
"experience the great events like: the great wall of mongolia, germany the holy country of judaism, the warmonger ghandi nuking the celts, the great pyramids in the us and of course the great aztecs who found mathematics, philosophy and writing! learn history in no time :d",1
"civilization v is a reboot of the series in some ways. over the years, they kept adding mechanics until the whole thing got kinda bloated. they rebuilt things from the ground up for this one, keeping the core essence of the game intact but streamlining the bloated systems. i love it. i absolutely love it. it took some getting used to, as a fan of the series, but i feel like this game, like the others before it, is yet another improvement on the formula. for people who havent played any civilization games before, this is one of the most famous simulation series of all time for good reason. if you have any interest in the genre, its worth getting.",1
"if youre into strategy games, but dont like all the complicated mechanics and micromanegment, this game is for you. its absolutely fantastic, and the dlc just make it way better. its very accessible to new players making it perfect for people who arent too comfortable with these kind of games but want to try them out.",1
"amazing game! definetly buy if you can, and every dlc they are all awesome. i think that civilization v + dlcs is better then the new civilization: beyond earth, and if the dlcs wont do it, try mods! als epic.",3
"always a good experience and is only made better during multiplayer.",2
"great game, worth every penny ive spent on it. not good if you enjopy having a social life.",2
"this game is amazing. it is a great strategy game and really gets you thinking. it is super addicting and never gets boring and the replayability is 10/10 because there are different scenarios for every move you make and every different character you play with. it is pricy but if you have the money i highly reccommend to anyone to get the game even if you arent into strategy games.",1
"what is there to say about civilization. every game in the series is awesome and this one is just as epic. its so game is so good that it speeds up time. it will soak up your soul but in a good way.",1
"although i largely played real time strategy before i got this as a present, i still greatly enjoyed it. it was made even more enjoyable when i picked up the dlc during a sale. this game is a great game, and it has certainly made me more interested in civ and turn based games in general. it has a nice feel to it, and one day i plan on picking up civ iv and iii just to try them. 8/10 without dlc, 9.6/10 with dlc.",1
"highly addictive, challenging and fun. no more words needed.",1
"great game very easy to sink several hours into it without even realizing it",2
"one of the most addicting and fun games on steam. 11/7 would bang. the vanilla multiplayer has some serious issues doe.",4
"so much fun to play constantly has you thinking of what you should do next. 1 hour quickly turns to 3 or 4 whenever i play this.",1
"much inculding within the game i still play it today.",1
"10/10 the second best substance that makes my night fly by like a blur",2
"fantastic game. expansions add moreplay through possibilities.",2
"if youre going to get this game it would be best to do so with a couple of friends because it has an excellent multiplayer. although you should prepare for some very long gaming sessions! xd",2
"words can hardly describe the wonder of this game. the unique aspect and ties to real world cultures across the ages is just phenomenal. truly a game worth to anyone who likes strategy, real world history and engaging gameplay!",1
"with way more than 200 hours of gameplay (steam is always about 40% of what i actually played), this is my most played game in my library. this is not the greatest game of all time, but it is probably in my top three, with portal 2 as the greatest game of all time. while this game does take long, it is worth it and very consuming! i love this game and i would most definitely recommend it! i love this game!",2
"was fun, turns me and my friends into actual dicktators. turned laughing and having open borders and sharing resources to being spitefull people who will slaughter entire cities for losing one tile 2000 years ago. 10/10",1
"i should go to bed. hang on, one more turn...  its 3am. 10/10 would play again.",2
"this game is ridiculously fun and addictive; say goodbye to your social life once you start a game on marathon mode. also, especially now because of the summer sales, definitely get the complete version with all dlcs and expansion packs; it makes the game go from being great to being incredible.",2
"this game saved my life from having to revise for exams. 10/10",3
"attila tried to conquer my city then proced to slam his face against my wall. did not work so he gave me a city as an apologize. 10/10 would recommend",1
"this is probably the most addictive game i have played in a long time. i love it. this will definitly keep you up at night!",1
"i bought this because the news said it was the most played non-valve game on steam. i can see why. im going to be losing large chunks of time to this game.",1
"a truely addictive game , the game contains so many awesome moments like when you get surround by enemy troops as you fight them to your last unit and you legendery civilzation has been vanquished... or vice versa you take out a powerful might foe and you add his city to yours and then set off for the world... such moments make this game a classic if you dont own this game ... just buy it already!!!!!!",1
"one of my favtore game of all time i love all the dlcs the building up there civ and the feeling of beting the game",3
"your average civ game. gandhi has completed the manhattan project! quit game without saving. exit civ 5. exit steam. delete civ 5. delete steam. shut down computer. punch the screen in. break the computer with a hammer. throw the computer out of the window. burn the computer with a flamethrower. dance on the ashes naked. buy a plane ticket to india. go to a missile silo. launch a nuke. leave india. watch and laugh as the rest of the world pulverizes gandhis smug  face with nukes. kill yourself. alexander has won a diplomatic victory! come back to life. kill yourself again.",2
"i could easily lose my entire life to civ. makes for strange conversations trying to explain to people whats happening, so worth it.",1
"ghandi nuked me 10/10 would be aggresively pacified again",2
"essentially an enhanced board game with more depth than possible in an actual board game. does a great job of portraying events on a large scale in a streamlined manner. slow-paced as a strategy game, but it suits the theme well. style and design shows a lot of attention to historical details. semi-educational if you want it to be and worth putting some thought into. definitely recommended.",1
"garbage. ... and dont believe the hype, brave new world has exactly the same fundamental flaws as the base game.",1
"build a city close to someone else... they get mad. build to many cities... they get mad. put your army to close to someone elses land... they get mad. destroy someone else even if they didnt like them.... they get mad. i love it!",2
"great game to eat potatoes to. but seriously its a great game, the good old civ as we knew it. just as one would expect.",1
"this game is so deep and complex but is made so even beginners can play no problem. 9/10",1
"a hip hop the hippie to the hippie the hip hip a hop and you dont stop, rock it rock it out, baby bubba to the boogie da bang bang the boogie to the boogie, the beat. i said, i cant wait til the end of the week when im rappin to the rhythm of a groovy beat and i attempt to raise your body heat. just blow your mind, so you cant speak and do a thing but a-rock and shuffle your feet and let it change up to a dance called the freak and when you finally do come into your rhythmic beat, reast a little while so you dont get weak. i know a man named hank he has more rhymes than a serious bank so come on hank, sing that song, to the rhythm of the boogie, the bang bang da bong!",1
"a wonderful game that inspires you to create an empire to match your personality, stratagey and aspirations into a nation that will either live a peaceful existence and achive glory through culture, diplomacy or tourism. or you can make the world burn and conquer the millions either way a great way to spend your day. (i prefer the nuclear fire off war). 9/10",3
"this game is very emersive and makes you want to play more and more.",1
"if you do buy this game i only have 1 thing to say never under any conditon im meaan anything (seriously guys) do not let ghandi mass destroyer of worlds take your uranium (seriosuly he will take it build nukes then nuke you with your own uranium i mean common)",1
"the first time i played this game i thought id only play for a few hours to check it out. i started at 8pm. the next time i looked at a clock, i did so because i heard birds chirping and the sun was coming up. this game is a time machine.",2
"very addictive and a different experience every game that you play.",1
"another great game in the civilization series. a few small issues that were fixed with the expansions. worth a try if you are a fan of the series",1
"dont get this game. the reason? just. one. more. turn. nuff said",1
"best strategy game out there. (only posting this review for xp, sorry).",2
"a game where i can finally make china and japan fight. a game where gandhi can drop 10 nukes on america just for the laughs. 10/10",1
"ive been playing this game for a long time and the only thing that bothers me is the diplomacy for the ai. really like it otherwise",2
"played as george washington. built the great wall of china and stongehenge. wouldve built the terracotta army too if ghandi didnt get to it first. 10/10",1
"great game, i spended houres already and ill spend even more playing it!",3
"10/10 if you intend to play single player only. (the dlcs are a must, they add a lot of content) 0/10 for multiplayer, the game is just unplayable, completely broken. we spend more time waiting on people to rejoin, because they are constantly crashing, than actually playing the game. and its not just one game, but every single game. every. single. game. and its virtually everyone that crashes, not just a select few, but every player. so the problem is obviously not individual. if you love multiplayer, dont buy this. it could have been a terrific game but the devs just dont care enough to make it playable. in mp it crashes more than an early access game. if youre into single player its really great, and buy the complete edition with the dlcs because you get a lot more civs and a couple of new systems.",1
"its a really good strategy game, ever since the first one came out, recommended to people who enjoy such genre of games",1
"great game, ive played civilization for a loong time. i remember the first one. but this one really set the bar high for any other turn based strategy games, and the sequels to this. i only have one problem. when i download something other than maps in the community, it doesnt do anything. it says it is in the downloaded folder-whatever but it isnt in the game. im not so great at civ, so it might just be that. but even though im not the best, i would recommend this to anybody. what sucks nowadays is that every cares about their k/d ratio not how they crushed the indian power last night, or converted russia to democracy. this is definitely one of the best games ever made.",1
"unfortunately, not everyone in my country is as committed to non-violence as i am - gandhi",1
"a really freakin funny game! it is really fun to conquer cities, and wreck the enemy! really good mods aswell, for example you can play as the pc god gabe newell, or the imperials from skyrim in tamriel!! it has this only 1 more turn addiction to it, making you sit up all night playing it! you should really buy this if you like stratigy games! i will give it an 10/10 would buy again what are you waiting for? buy it now!",1
"great game, just dont play it if you have something to do in the next 4-8 hours",3
"great game, but has a lot of glitches and problems that need to be fixed. hope they fix them.",1
"its good, but this game will just eat up all of your time.",1
"great game full of fun ways to win also good online with other players 9/10",1
"ill be the thousandth person to say how addictive this game is, but its digital heroin. anyways, its awesome, and well worth the money.",2
"after initially being impatient to play the civilization game series when i played iii for a bit, i regret that decision, because i was too impatient to play what would of been one of my most favourite strategy games. i got this game from the recent humble bundle, and i got to say after playing a good 6 hours on this game, that it is one of my most favourite games to play. there is ghandi who is an , dont trust him, he lies and nukes you in the back when you least expect it. nothing else i should say here other than: 10/10 get it now and ruin your life with this addiction.",1
"the game is very addicting and with the expansion of a brave new world the dimension of influence and economy add a lot to the gameplay, whereas before diplomacy was much harder. especially, considering the erratic ais.",1
"just buy it if you havent, worth the money. get the expansions aswell, theyre amazing. as in the game itself, you spend countless hours with different civilzations that you can play as on different kinds of maps that you choose. theres a lot of types of victory; being science, culture, diplomatic, dominance, etc. theres different eras you progress through and with science you get new buildings, units, etc. i have spent a lot of hours into this game and im still not bored of it.",1
"like heroin. avoid if you have even a slightly addictive personality...",5
"civ is that game you play with friends, play alone, anything at all. its fun, you like it, you buy the dlc. you then find a new civ that you like, great. but then you play a game, theres something special about it and you cant quite tell what is so awesome about it. it consumes you for a few days, ita all you can think about, all you want to do. then you win/lose and you feel as if you lost a part of yourself. because ghandi is a .",3
"i would highley reccommend this game if you are into grand strategy games",1
"you need to have a heavy pair of cujones to handle this game. fortunately for me, the good lord has blessed me with said pair.",2
"do you know that feeling when you lead your civilization and become the greatest in the world? its awesome.",2
"the single best strategy game i have ever played. sessions of this game take a while, but it keeps you enthralled and offers a lot of replay value due to dlc and a huge amount of characters to play. if you have ever enjoyed a strategy game, and have not already played this one, buy this game.",2
"this game never gets old! i can keep telling myself, one more turn... but i actually have to force myself to stop playing it. it hooks you.",1
"nothing like wasting uranium on nukes and repeatedly nuking catherine the greats russian empire just cause you feel like it.",1
"it one of the you dont thing your going to like , you start playing 80 hour+ you cant get off the game . it one game want you start you dont stop .",1
"1 more turn ... ah end of day nevermind just 1 more turn *zombie face*",1
"great game, ive already put a 100+ hours on this game. its replay value is very high after playing one match your interested to see how another civs plays. by that time you want to try a game as every civ in the game! with some of the add-ons like brave new world and gods and kings this game becomes very enjoyable and interesting.",1
"excellent game but only for those that dont mind to wait. the recent expansions build upon the greatness of the game making it even greater!",1
"its like meth, but youll lose more friends by using this.",1
"yes. game addicting and fun. frusterating sometimes but good. i like being washington.",1
"fun & addictive. you will wonder where your day went :p",1
"i though this was the worst strategy game ever... i was wrong! with the brave new world this game is one of the bests. it is hard to learn and boring to wait turns but diplomacy, war, trades, civilization... every single this is great. buy it.. no no wait... buy both civi 5 and the next game: beyond earth...",1
"civ v is a great turn based strategy game which lets you take history and make it submit to you as the master of all history and other boshtets. in all seriousness, the best part is being able to bomb poor s who still use crossbows and swords and crap. id reccomend this game to turn based strategy fans and people who really like seeing rome become a world power and stuff.",1
"one of the most fantastic games ive ever played. if you like strategy games and have a lot of patience i highly recommend.",1
"lots of replay value. worth the money and dlc. watch out for gandhi.",1
"prepare to not leave your computer for weeks at a time. instant classic.",5
"love this game so much. jesus, i could just take my balls and rub them all over this. you ever held napoleon under your thumb? you ever ing kicked germanys ? you ever been friends with the great pharoe of egypt? i cant even ing explain. the portion of my mind that i use when i play this s when i open the game. jesus, you can either wreck  or sit in you corner of the world and prepare a god damn space ship. you cant ing comprehend this. buy the game and rule the world, over and over and over again!",1
"if you enjoy turn based startegy games, this is your game. i bought the complete pack with all the dlc except the new one, for about $13. its worth your money even at full price. just be careful to pay attention to the time unless you want to accidently pull an all nighter on this game. 9/10 - experienced graphics issues later game and when loading up a game, otherwise great.",3
"to anyone who hasnt played the civilization series, i definitely recommend it. building whole civilizations and destroying others, while choosing your path (militaristic, cultural, etc), building wonders, are a few of things that make this game addictive. the mechanic of having fairly short-term goals under a main longer-term goal makes you forget time and this is the game that inspired the termone more turn. :d",1
"this game is a lot of fun. can never end due to so many ways to change things up.",2
"just one more turn.. one more.. one.. and then you lose about 5 days of your life. worth.",1
"this game is addictive. stupidly. many have complained that the game has had too much taken out to appeal to a wider market. ignore them. the changes are for the most part sensible, and improve the flow of the game. the gods & kings expansion tweaks things further and makes the whole package feel more complete. ok, so diplomatic relations still go south once you get to a certain size - and someone is bound to attack you if you dont so maintaining a strong army is essential and can make it harder to seek other victory types but it isnt a game breaker. im having ridiculous fun after 100 hours and ive barely scratched the surface.",1
"definitely a fun game if you like turn-based strategy. if you like any of the total war games this is a pretty fun alternative.",1
"a epic game! the game is hard and takes skill to play. if you lied games like master of orion, this game is like that just a different theme, based on human history, and more in depth. i have played countless hours of this game and do not understand the gripes with this game. civilization was made for gameplay not graphics. about the only gripe i do have is that the game does get kinda laggy as there are a lot of big civilizations, but it is not that big of a deal. this is because it takes longer for the computer to think about what moves to make. be prepared to spend many many hours playing civilization each game takes many hours to finish. but it is fun and addictive. i do not have the brave new world expansion, but those i know who do have it say it is great. i do however have gods and kings",1
"if you like strategy games like xcom. buy it. if you like pew pew games. buy it. if you dont have cash get a friend to gift it to you.",1
"this game is like the bridge for advanced strategy games. it has such a complex, yet easily accomplishable setup. this gives civ 5 an inumerable strength as a game. it provides you with over 30 civilizations to play as(dlc included). each of them with a diverse yet interesting skill to go along with them. you could play as spain with a double bonus to all exotic tiles in the game. or switch to carthage, giving you the ability to cross mountains. both long time strategists and newcomers will love this game. as well as its historical units will excited any history buffs out there. and any game you play in it will always challenge and amuse. if you have not already bought this game, you should right now.",2
"awesome game, very easy to play, i dived into a game and it was fantastic",1
"if you like strategdy games and pissing off your friendes by sending war elephents to kill their slaves, or having ghandi nuke your cities, then i would recomend this game!",1
"with all the dlc, its probably one of the most entertaining games i have played.",2
"simply amazing. being able to beat the game from numerous vantage points along many different civs on countless maps/sizes adds to replayability. love it to death!",2
"never trust that indian  ghandi. he will  your  open so hard and take all of your lavender.",1
"i recommend it but it glitched out after i upgraded to windows 8.1 so i bought the complete edition on disk and it only gave me brave new world.",1
"the infamous mastermind behind the phrase just one more turn 10/10",1
"i consider this game the de-facto empire builder, im sure a lot of people will agree. my only complaint is to really enjoy the game, you should have its two expansions, gods and kings and brave new world. this two expansions add concepts to the game that it was lacking. the base game is still very good in its own right. the other dlc arent really important, they add more civs, map scripts and sceneros. any one who want to get in to strategy games, i can highly suggest this one, and people who play them a lot, i can also suggest it. once you get used to the easy to use ui, its as it sounds, easy to use.",2
"do you like having free time last forever? well welcome to the time eater. oh ill just play for a little bit before work... well i guess im fired. point is, get it. you will not regret the decision.",1
"incredibly more-ish, and definitely worthy of just one more turn tag. word of warning, if theres something you need to do in an hour (or whatever) and your looking for something to waste some time until then, dont play this game, ill guarantee that you will lose track of time. otherwise i would highly recommend it. oh and do the tutorial if your new to this game, or else youll find yourself struggling a bit to figure out all the different mechanics and such.",1
"excellent depth ... plenty of replay value, although i wish there were alternative progressions in the tech tree, rather than its linear nature.",1
"running out of holidays as i have to book days off for one game perfect game for people who are immortal or possess several lifetimes to play 10/10 recommended!",1
"this game is absolutelty fantastic, and has a huge replay value.",3
"the only game where i can shoot down jets with arrows and destroy tanks with spears. 10/10",1
"a really fun strategy game, good for when you have spare time to kill",1
"reminds me of the total war series. but better. without the rts aspect.",2
"a great game! dont listen to anybody else, it is a great game!!!!",2
"i cant start the game... i press play on the steam menu i choose the recommended directx 11 and what happens is a black screen pops up and then closes instantly... when i choose directx 9 the same thing happens, no errors pop up and i belive all my system requirement are met for the game. any help??",1
"one of the best strategy game ever. i highly recomend )",1
"want to finish college and find a job? do not buy this game!",1
"amazing game of creating and maintaining a civilization from prehistoria tomodern times.",1
"this my go-to game when i just want to unwind and have fun. hopefully civilization: beyond earth is just as good as this game is with both g&ks and bnw.",1
"allow me to tell you a story. after approximately 8 victorys achieved by world domination, i decided to be peaceful. through various treaties, gifts, and negotiations i reached the status friends with everybody in the world. this made me happy. i was a respectable man in the world, with a low amount of troops and a high amount of manufactored goods. then greece came along. they, along with 3 allies, stabbed me in the back and send about 20 units of pikemen to take my capital, which they succeded in doing. after this loss, i proceeded to curl up in a ball and cry, vowing to never play again. 10/10 would play again.",1
"do you wish hours moved like seconds? hate your job, but too scared to quit? dont worry- youll be missing time and no-showing at your place of employment with minimal effort, thanks to civilization v.",1
"i played this game so much that it melted my video graphics card...it is that good.",1
"a thinking mans game. plenty of options for winning with different play styles and pregenerated leaders/characters to experiment with, very enjoyably time consuming!",3
"what can possibly said about this game? you wanted to play for an hour or two after work to destress before bed? tough luck, your entire night is gone! i could never play for less than 3 hours at a stretch and it took a lot of self control to exit the game.",1
"if you have the gold edition and brave new world, you have endless possibilities in playing this game.",1
"this game provides literally hundreds of hours (or more) of fun. the randomness of the maps, the large amount of civilizations, the multiple different ways to victory, and the many ways to achieve that makes this game so unique that its impossible for it to feel repetitive. this is well worth the cost and definitely a game to get. now if youll excuse me, i have to get back to playing!",1
"i am more of a multiplayer kinda guy, with that said i fould this game very entertaining and fun with freinds. there are a few bugs with the base game though. such as when you send a trade offer to another human player, they cam modify the trade in their favor.still very fun with trustworthy freinds ; )",1
"easily my most played game. i would highly reccomend it to anyone.",2
"once youve played this version youll be converted to hexagons forever. just a fuller, more varied version in every way.",1
"this game is for anyone who whanted to change history in there owned way",1
"i have not played very much of the game so far but as first impressions go i dont think it could have done a better job. it seems like a very well thought out game and well worth buying.",1
"great game, but if you want to play with your friends it does not work... this game should not have multiplayer as a tag.",1
"not as good as civ iv. better than what most people on the internet say.",1
"just 5 more turns... just a few more turns. just one more turn. alright, ill finish this research then im done for the night. just one more turn. ok, i really should stop... after this turn. ill save and ill close the game - after this turn. its 6am and im still playing, after this turn i should probably go to sleep... ive lost control of my life im ed.",1
"one of my favorite games ever great game would buy it again and would cry if i couldent play it!",2
"fun. havent played a game thats made me so immersed in a while.",1
"first time in the civilization series. theres a huge learning curve, but youll get over it. there are huge maps, and there are small maps. this game is awesome, so just buy it now during a sale before the price gets too high.",1
"really fun game in my opinion its better with brave new world but even the base game but for 30 extra dollars its tottaly worth your money",1
"sid meiers civilization v is amazing. this game lets you create your own story, and you create your own history of your own world. when i play this game im not just watching the screen, but im there in the game itself. civilization has economy, culture, technology, a believable world, and a military that has an advance developed game of chess feel to it. the possibilities are endless, and so is the gameplay. brandon m.",2
"10/10 why because givin crabs to zulu is just hilarious(he deserverd it...) and then destroyin it all with nukes is just....murica!",1
"if you want to destroy your entire social life, get this game.",1
"i still dont like not being able to stack units to make a military or fleet in one square. if a city of 50 milion can exist in one square, why does a unit of swordsmen, pikemen, and bowmen take 3? i also miss being able to take over other cities with culture. but it is probably the best stradegy game still. nothing compares.",2
"every single time when i want to play this game lhasa is near me... 11/10 would play again to war against lhasa",1
"great game for singleplayer and multiplayer with or without friends",1
"just one more turn my . just be sure to grab the expansions, gods and kings at minumum, the mechanics inlcuded push the game from good to great. elsewise, go play civ iv and wait for a sale.",1
"this game is wonderful. the only downside is i lose all track of time",5
"fantastic game which allows for hours of gameplay. definitely improved with brave new world dlc.",1
"possibly one of the most amazing games ever created. hours of endless fun.",1
"keeps crashing and wont even let me start a new game. worst purchase ever.",1
"this is one of those games i always find myself coming back to year after year. who doesnt like to start up a game vs. the cpu or vs. a family member and imagine the world domination machinations of ghandi or george washington. the games can go on for awhile or just a day but it never stops being fun to take over the world whether your favorite victory is military, cultural or through overt capitalism.",1
"just got it from a friend, fun game when you are bored.",1
"it was on sale! i figure ill play it for a few minutes to see why its so popular. -29+ hours played-",1
"this game is the best game ever made! chose what sort of game style you want to have, diplomatic, trade or use brute force, to gain control over the world. this game i came back to many times. it comes many new games, to to try out. but if you buy this game you have a game that you always will come back too. if you are new to this sort of games, just play it on a easy difficulty, and you be just fine. this game gets new dlc all the time, and its community, build new maps, challanges for you to try out. its always something new to come back too. build an army of warriors, or convert the world to youre religion to get the upper hand. its the best game here on steam.",2
"would be nice to have more customization options like in civ4, but the ui and overall display, particularly the icons, are exponentially better and make the game much easier to navigate.",2
"an immense time-sink. the amount of variables in map generation, civilisations and the tech trees means you will never have the same game twice. incredibly fun and great to play with friends making secret alliances and sudden betrayals. thouroughly recommended.",1
"its great if you got nothing to do for the next 9 hours or 3 days",2
"ive never been into rts or anything of the sort, so i figured i wouldnt enjoy civilization or similar games. but i was very very wrong. i highly recommend this game! :d",1
"just...wow. where did this sunday disappear. just tested multiplayer game with few friends. 12 hours felt like 1 hour. awesome game!",1
"this is my first official review on a game so please dont take it too serious. this will be a short review because the game is really good i really enjoyed the game. on my first game i finished in 3 days . the gameplay was interesting but the battles were dissapointing. i thought that the battles were going to be like in rome total war. the graphics are good ( dont care about the graphics at all) the music is really good . enjoyed every minute of each song. the game is well made and loved how every country reacted when you do something. overall its a really good game , its worth every cent .",1
"this game is extremely well built, as are the other civilizations. it is very time consuming and fun if you can be patient. with single player for the lone wolves and multiplayer for those who strive for human interaction. still, this game is, as ive already said, extremely fun.",2
"this is the most addictive games that i ever played i could barely eat and sleep even change the underwear because of this and the achievement is really tremendously huge and very challenged at the moment waiting for brave new world discount :p",1
"/10 very addictiing game p.s. dont trust gandhi. ever.",1
"no turn-base strategy games are better made made than the sid meiers civilization 5. i love that game.",2
"just one...more...turn... one of the best strategy games i have ever played!",1
"deciede to play for 10 mins realise that the 10 years have passed then find out that civilisation viii is already out",1
"civilization v is one of the best games i have played. after your 5th game or so, it does get repetitive. i would suggest to get the dlcs that give you more options to win the game, more cultures to be, and other cool things.",1
"this game is drug... you can play with the history, i mean, where else you could declare war do gandhi....",1
"civ v is by far one of my favorite games and anyone with hours upon hours of free time should pikc it up!",1
"over time it gets easier, but at first its hard. i like to keep it slow and just play a little bit everyday.",1
"most fun ive had getting nuked in a very long time!",2
"i dont know who this sid meiers person is, but he stole my copy of civs v.",1
"best game i have ever played. ( i dont paly to many games. tight on money)",2
"amazing game and it really fun to play for a while",1
"i played this game for a long time before i got the steam version. i got the steam version for all of my friends, but since i have been playing since civ 2, nobody wanted to play after a couple of matches. i great way to say goodby to long stretches of time.",1
"buy at least gods and kings (preferably from gold edition), and you already have amazing time-sinking game. find some buddies for multiplayer => best game for long winter nights.",1
"the vatican demands islam - 10/10 would lol again",1
"the most boring game i have ever played. definetly do not reccomend",1
"by far one of the best installments of the series. i do however miss a few of the political and diplomatic functions that were present in previous version. hopefully they will be added in expansions.",1
"once you learn how to play, addicitve. world domination is fun!",1
"if you like turn based strategy games, then this is an absolute must have game!",1
"i have played civilization since the original version and love it to this day. this version has some drastic changes that are unique in the series but is still very much civilization. highly recommended.",4
"i started my first game in 9:00 pm saturday then realized it was 5:00 am sunday when i destroyed one empire 0.o i think im in love",4
"civ v is a must-have game for any strategy game lover. it has everything they could want in a game. economy, military units, diplomacy, multiple victory conditions, different civilizations, and so on. the only thing lack luster in this game is the diplomacy. civilization games just never have had a stellar diplomacy engine. the a.i. has always been a little derpy but nothing that can be frustraiting. just dont be expecting help from allies, or many allies for that matter.",1
"greatest game in its series, same type of units can not on the same tile, that must use more strategy to win a battle or development. if someone found crash when play on windows 8.1, just choose play with directx 10,11.",2
"built the great pyramids underwater and was then nuked by ghandi",1
"its actually good and i dont even like strategy games.",1
"spawned near 7 cities. at war with all of them. 10/10.",1
"fun to play with friends even if they take an hour on their turns.",1
"never before have i had a game that is equal in fun with its multiplayer as it is in its singleplayer. weither im owning my friends with babylon or crushing ai with germany im always having fun. absolutly worth the price it offers for the game, plus the expansions are worth it and add so much to the game... overall one of my best steam purchases",4
"if youve got 100+ hours to kill this is an awesome game!",1
"this is a really nice 4x style turn based game (although you must be prepared for a long game - multiple hours).",2
"the great lighthouse has been built in a far away land :---ddd ha-ha! nice! what can i say? a clear 10/10!",1
"leonard nimoys voice acting is just the frosting on this awesome timesink cupcake!",1
"building empires and conquering the world has never been so much fun!",1
"a game you can play and literally lose days at a time, then after 20 or so hours of gameplay and lose so its all been for nothing! fantastic game, if i ever get bored or have spare time on my hands, throw it on and watch the day disappear. easy enough to pick up as well, cant wait for next expansion..",1
"best fricken game ever, spending far too much of my days playing this right now, but too caught up in building my civ! ^-^",2
"i hate this game. its too easy to spend hours playing it. my sleep schedule is all ed to hell now. thanks, civ. /s",1
"i have played days of this game offline i highly recommed this game its great for wasting time.",1
"i feel as though the best way to describe this game is risk on steroids",1
"should be called gandhi nuke simulator 2015. 10/10 would be nuked again.",3
"and we stunting like aztec aztec, brazil brazil, london london, china basic scrubs play that  so i dont even bother i put that on my tech, i put that on my army korean empire representer, address me as your majesty yeah you can kiss the ring, but you can never touch the crown i create a million badass turtle ship i aint never coming down  you aint no ghandi i see you tryin science no culture, with no parts hurry up im just flyin",1
"been playing civ since number 2 and it keeps changing everything but the spirit of slow determined conquest. i love it",3
"one of the only games i cant stop playing! addicting and frustrating! one of the most strategic games you will ever play and one you will either feel accomplished or regretful by the end. a great buy 9/10.",2
"russia beat america to space 20/10 would play again.",1
"i dont understand it: people keep remembering the first civilization games and then rate the new civilization highly. but the game has not evolved in any meaningful way since then; its still basically an elaborate board game with very simple mechanics. its also very very long and boring and, honestly, no longer captures the epic feeling of a true civilization. not recommended.",1
"this game wow... just wow. lets get to the point. good stredegie game. good animethins. good grafichs. with a lot of history involved with the leaders and wonders. lost of mods in the comunety workshop like more leaders and maps etc. 1 big note to the peps that what to get this game purgase that full game with all the dlcs. (sid meiers civilization v : complete edition) the 10 more  is really whorf it. i hope this helpt u make a poit on bying the game yes or no (sorry for the englich in am form the netherlands ;) )",1
"classic game, the fifth iteration is by far the best! after a bit shaky 4, the fifth take on the immortal classic by sid meier hits the sweet spot. not only is it gorgeous, smooth, and well-designed graphically, but it offers a great variety of features and complexity which does not feel forced. recommend to play with both addons available to date. gods and kings was not particularly good when it came out, felt a bit early and not ready. the second addon though fixed all of the problems, while expanding those that felt a bit lacking. if you got that turn-based-itch, look no further than this game =)",1

"sid meiers crack v is a much better recipe than crack iv, and crack iii. still something seems missing... oh yeah, it makes you feel at home and comfortable. civ v is addicting.",1
"very fun and tactical, provides hours of entertainment.",1
"with both expansions this game rivals all other civilizations. a solid 10/10.",1
"10/10, would play 100 hours in the first two weeks again",1
"overall: 9/10 civilization v is an amazing game. it builds on its previous titles with improved gameplay, graphics and strategy. it is the kind of game you tell yourself youll only play twenty minutes ff and then go to sleep; when in reality youll stay up all night and call in sick to work. positives: + amazing graphics + exploration is varied and encouraged + interesting cultural bonuses + every game is different + engrossing negatives: - a.i. can be a little stupid at times - you need a heavy duty computer for bigger maps and high graphics - can feel a bit unrealistic at times (the whole world declares war because you took a banana tree)",1
"jes i would recomend dis game cuz its fun to play and i lek it vry mush",1
"this is one of the best stradegy games of all time and will be topped only when there will be civ6!!",1
"civ v is like most other civ games but with better graphics and more streamlined features. if you like any of the civ games you will most certainly enjoy this one.",1
"fun game... but warning it eats up time by the day!",1
"one more turn. one more turn. one more turn. its been 6 hours.",1
"deciede to play for 10 mins realise that the 10 years have passed then find out that civilisation viii is already out",1
"another great civ game from firaxis, sure to keep you busy for years to come. some good improvements over civ 4 while remaining faithful to core civ mechanics.",3
"the game is difficult when you first start but after that you feel that you wouldnt want to change anything. graphics are very good and adds to the overall experience. i would highly recommend this game to anyone even if they arent fans of the turn based strategy genre. 10/10",1
"no better way to stay up until 3am and then say, how the  did it get so late? well, ill play one more turn...",3
"what a great game. what a shmuck ive been to wait so long to try it out.",1
"i cant find the right words to explain how i feel about this game. its just...just perfect.",1
"worked for a week maybe two, very nice game but suddenly wont start at the loading screen exits back to windows, i have read a lot on the internet and there are a lot of reasons for this crash,other people have or had the same issue, frankly speaking after 2 days of trying to fix i gave up. i felt very sorry about it, i wanted to buy also beyound earth but i think is waste of money. if you release a game it is normal to be a functional one not put the clients to spend a lot of time trying to fix it. the game it is very nice but the support it is awfull. i hope that other users not to have my problem and to enjoy the game.",1
"youre sitting on your high horse. you, george washington, has eclipsed everyone in research. you are hailed as a god by your people. nothing could be better. but wait... what the hell? catherine of russia declared war on you? no matter. your mechanized infantry will wipe the floor with her crossbowmen. as you pile into her capital, the nuke sirens go off. wait what? the most advanced of your adversaries is in the at- dear god. you cower in fear as 7. seven atomic bombs pummel you and your people into the dust. soon after, while you are lying in a ditch, watching your palace fall apart, you hear this, a strange indian accent you should have given me that luxury resource 127 turns ago ghandi strikes again. 11/10 ghandi survival simulator",1
"probably the best strategy game to date, would recommend it to anyone.",3
"played with 2 friends. started at 8, got 1/3rd through the game by 1 am. super fun. also betrayals from one of them, currently plan to end his regiem.",1
"while i enjoyed civ iv, civ v is much more the just one more turn addiction im familiar with from the original game. the change to hex from grid makes a huge change in gameplay and city planning, and is a welcome addition. culture as a tech tree adds another dimension to the game and i find myself caring much more about diplomacy than ever before. if theres any real gotcha with civ v, its the design updates from firaxis. while i can appreciate trying to improve the overall play, theyve made significant modifications to game elements since launch that have changed the game. this is the kind of development mentality that can anger a playerbase--its not something an mmo company would take so lightly. beyond that, im heading towards 300 hours over the first year and plan on playing many hours more.",4
"great game, always adding new expansions and new dlcs. vanilla is complete garbage, please get gold edition or gold edition upgrade.",3
"im not sure why civ v gets such a horrendous rep from the civ community. it took all the unncecesary elements from past civ games (like religion and stacked combat units for example) and either streamlined them or got rid of them altogether. that makes the game less of a slog as far as im concerned. civ v is still part of the civilization series no matter how much people want to complain about it, and it still plays like a civ game. in other words, civilization is still the watermark for turn-based strategy games, and no amount of tweaking or nerfing is going to change that.",1
"one of the best strategy games of all-time, without a doubt. the sandbox mode is unparallled in scope-- every playthrough is completely different. the ai gets really, really tough at higher difficulty settings (emperor / immortal / deity), which keeps things challenging in singleplayer mode, to say the least. the workshop has some amazing mods as well, which add to the experience considerably. this game guarantees a thought-provoking challenge to all. 10/10",2
"the most polished version of civilization yet. a must own for anyones library.",1
"hi i havent got chance to play it as i have been crashing out on the loading screen going into a game or once i get into a game the screen flashes black but the mouse key still has the theme. can you please help ive tried all that i know",1
"started a game to kill some time before starting my coursework that was 8 oclock now its 7 in the morning and ive got 4 hours to do my work before class on a scale of addicting i put it at x-com out of 10",1
"its a great game. however multiplayer is a mess. i play multiplayer anyway thou. one of my favorite features is that you can see the person you are talking to in singleplayer. sadly multiplayer takes all of that away. civ can have its moments most of them in multiplayer but i cant help but feel like i am doing the same thing over and over. thats when u pause your current playthrou and continue later. dont recommend the single version. buy the complete pack for maximum value (alot better with bnv and gak)",1
"an exceptional political simulator. whether you are a micromanager wanting to ensure that every detail is right in you thriving civilization, or you are just a warrior with a lust for strategic battle this game will satisfy you.",2
"new to civ, and after buying gold and brave new world. i think this is quickly becoming one of my favorite games of all time. very highly recomemded. but make sure to buy the dlc. just wiat until theres a sale and gold upgrade goes down to $5 then get that and bnw. then, youll be set for a lot of fun.",3
"civ = strategy. civ v = best strategy ever. go. buy. now.",1
"get this if you want to waste 5+ hours in just one game :-)",3
"awesome game, very addictive, best played with friends.",1
"this game is really fun to build death robots and send them on missions to capture your friends and make them your hostage(slave/). i also like how",1
"really fun to play with friends or alone. i r8 8/8 4 gr8 m8.",1
"only 268 moves in and already have thought about fighting :)",1
"civilization v is a fantastic example of a turn-based strategy game, in this game you get to play as one of a large selection of civilizations and take them to greatness or death, they are in your command. this game has streamlined ui, great ai and amazing replayability. if you like turn-based strategy games or games that you run countries then buy this game!",1
"i though it was a joke. it wasnt a joke. i bought this game yesterday evening. i have 19  hours in it. i had things to do. take the warnings seriously.",1
"started a new game at 3 pm monday, 1 hour later it was wednesday....",1
"ive played this game so much that i feel obliged to make a review of it. civ v is absolotely amazing. its the best strategy game ive ever played. if youre new to civ, start with this game. this game, plus expansion packs and mods, is one of the best gaming experiences ive ever had. if you want recommended mods, message me. once you start playing, you wont be able to stop.",3
"civilization v is a fantastic turn-based strategy. ive personally have been a fan of the series for a long time and this is by far the best one. there is many different modes to play and multiple ways to win and no two games are ever alike. there is also a ton of mods for this game! so check out the workshop. you will easily lose hours to this game and i cant keep track of how many times i say just one more turn and never realize how late it is until after the fact. if you dont own this game already you are seriously missing out.",1
"if you want to never go to sleep on time. this is your game!",1
"its good if you enjoy turn based games. at first i didnt care for it, after a second try i enjoyed myself immensely.",1
"i played as ghandi and i took a giant poo on the attila and he was like woooooah man dont do dat i give you some salt m9 and i was naaah and then i took my elephants and i was all like no man u doooonne and i stepepd on his stupid face and i took all his  truffles and i was like dis mi kingdom now kiddy and i was like woaaah and then i stepped on all the other kiddies and i was like naaaaahhhh m9 and i ruled the world with lots of money and i was a big pimpin indian all up in dere and i started blasting my jam indians in paris and i was like yooo is dat m night shamalan on da track? and out of nowhere i hear this stupid fat lady trying to take my kingdm and i was like. naaah fatty and i told her she could have her  twinkies and cinnabons somewhere else but she didnt listen so i killed her and her family. rip fat lady family. anyway dis game is reeeal gud 8/10",1
"fun addictive time sink. can lose hours without realising. the addition of the workshop really adds to the variety. up there with 2 & 4 as the best of the series.",1
"if you wanna hate your best friends, play this game, its awesome !",1
"how this game works... just gonna play this for an hour or two than going to go on a date... hey where is the sun? oh my gawd! 16 hours passed! 10/10 one of my favorite games.",2
"excellent addition to the civilization franchise. it took a while to get used to the new culture system, but i would highly recommend this game to any fans of civ.",1
"fantastic turn based based strategy game, the political aspect of the gameplay adds a lot of immersion to the experience, as your cunning and persuasiveness can lead to your victory. varied gamestyles and multiplayer makes these attributes stick out even more when having to interact with real players, wielding a higher level of understanding and reasoning. 8/10 might not appeal to many gamers genre interests.",1
"oh my snick-snack patty-whack give this game a bone! this is one of the greatest turn-based strategy games out there, please give this game a chance because it it absolutely astonishing!",2
"they did it again, i strongly believe that the civilization series is one of the greatest works to teach about human history, achievements, our soul, our sins, our philosophy, our politics, our chances and decisions. it should be put on a working machine and send into space to show aliens that we are horrible, but at least we know how to heave fun. and where there is civilization, there is hope.",1
"fantastic game, super addicting. you start playing at 5 pm next thing you know it is 5 amand there is still more to do in the game. prepare to binge",1
"ghandi was being a smartass and then the game froze. i re-loaded it and ghandi was still a smartass.",1
"a truly amazing turn-based strategy that will have you gritting your teeth all the way through, i would 100% recommend it to anyone who is even slightly interested in the stategy genre. now if you excuse me i have to go and kill babylon this game keeps pulling me back for more!",1
"i think im napoleon. ghengis khan never stood a chance against an emperor.",1
"great way to spend a lazy weekend, slaughtering your enemies on the battlefield! 10/10",1
"i would make a joke about playing this til 10 am but it wouldnt be a joke",1
"uh. you get to rule a nation, acting as the driving force to world domination. choose your settlement, develop some resources, and  it, i was like one turn away from building that wonder you prick!",1
"time... what is time!? it was 7am and now its 1am.",1
"if u love turn-based games then this is a must buy.",1
"yes youre having fun now but before long you wont know what ing day it is. youll never get some of the best hours of your life back but  it youve just taken out bismarck, the smug german prick.",1
"i am so unbelievably addicted to this game. i have stayed up until 4 in the morning for the past three days, just trying to beat it on easy. i shudder to think what the tougher difficulties have in store, but i am definitely looking forward to playing with friends. and leaving it open to the steam workshop is awesome, because who knows what crazy  stuff people will come up with.",1
"very good for strategy lovers and generally a re.ally fun game",1
"is it an overstatement to say that this is one, if not the most addictive, enjoyable and intriguin games i have ever played: i dont think so.",1
"civ v is one of the best computer games i have ever played. the 2 dlcs, g&k and bnw, are totally worth buying. they both change the game a lot but it is in a good way. the amount of community mods that are aviable are exceptional. they add a ton of great content and make the game even better. i would recommend this game to anyone and everyone.",1
"it is a fun amazing game with so many different paths to chose from alone it works for hours and hours of fun and with friends years :)",1
"its epic luv it and its best strategy game eveer 2nd is clash of clans",1
"one word high price but addicting game wait thats more than one word my bad",1
"honestly id go for the complete edition for this game. you get way more stuff for $20.00 more, it sounds like 100 times more money but its a realy great deal.",2
"i played the demo great fun also watched youtubers play it recommend 10/10 also recommend the dlc brave new world 10/10! great strategy game for those who want to play with friends or alone rule your world and conqurer other factions.",1
"civ 5 is a great buy for nearly any gamer, have had a ton of fun with it! 9/10",2
"one of the best sim games out there, really well done, love the progression through the times although i can never get too far since i just get bored and kill everyone else.",1
"a decent turn based strategy in the civ series. unfortunately not as good as alpha centauri or civlization 4, but the combat system was pretty enjoyable. i did not like the loss of a lot of detail in many of the other systems in the game. also the lack of ability to stack workers can be a huge pita.",1
"gondi was being a total  so i stole that hoes nukes and nuked rome as china. 100% acurate story 10/10",1
"truely amazing game, at its base it can be a little dule but with all of the expansions its a lovely game.",1
"fun game to make you think, but you can get lost in the game and time flies by.",2
"i enjoy endless hours of fun on it and would recommend people to buy it. definatly worth the price i paid for it. the expansion packs add a lot to the game as well.",2
"sid meirs civilization... the game where you are the king of the world! purchase now.",1
"a really good game, however ive noticed if i dont quick save after a certain amount of time it shuts down on me for no reason.",1
"bore yourself to tears! watch turns load for several minutes! get famous figures of history to swear at you in a foreign language!",5
"if you like plotting revenge, or pre-venge, then this game is for you.",1
"play as a civilization and bring forth your country from the dawn of time to the end of it (or untill everybodys dead by nukes) create vast tech and armys and a stunning culture to shun the world in your mightyness or share it all and be a  but that will never happen",1
"if you want to be manly and own one of the most sexy, realistic and educational (no one cares about that) stategy game evvvvvvvvvvverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!! then dont get age of empires get sid meiers civilization 5. warning! game is only fun with gods and kings and brave new worlds, i recomend you stay away from babylon because they are the most op civ in the game this game cannot protect from doing homework it does the exact opposite of that we are not responsible of friend loss or any finger loss sid meier not included",3
"takes me forever to end my turn, other than that, fun game so far.",1
"remember the great viking-persian war of 1872 that lead to viking world domination? or how about the time that poland was denounced by all of its allies because it was about to complete a rocket launch to alpha centauri? what about atilla the hun being voted world leader? every game something hilarious happens, and every time you win just want to start again. if you like slowly thinking through your options, and watching a long-term strategy come into play, youll love this game.",1
"my god civ v is such an addicting experience. while it might not be the perfect grand-strategy experience, it certainly achieves what it tries to do. like every civilization game, its played best with expansions, and both brave new world and gods & kings are wonderful addons that really add to the experience in great way, the world congress is a perfect addition to the game, and that is just one of many features that these expansions succeed with. i dont really know what makes civ so addicting, its just so varied and you can either play as a warmonger or a peacekeeper, its up to you. this is one of my favorite games ever and ive had so much fun with it, as i will continue to have. if you like turn-based strategy, this game is a must.",2
"i whole heartedly love this game the first day i got it i spent the whole day with my friend playing it. stayed up till 6 a.m. this game is one of my top 10 its easy to pick up and play .the games are long but you can change settings to make it shorter this games makes me feel like the creator had the consumer in mind while creating this game 9/10",1
"we are anonymous. civ v is a great game. if you have not played any civ game, you have not yet lived.",1
"just gonna win by taking my entire army to delhi. *whole army destroyed by nuke* just got nuked by ghandi. 12/10",2
"i have played this game so much that i have wasted a month of my life on this game but in parallel i have conquered the world as the british the americans the russians the germans the morracans and the list goes on and on screw the other victory conditions all i want to do is conquer everyone as everyone so my journey may never be complete in that regard.",5
"first turn based strategy game ive ever got into, and i have quickly become obsessed.",1
"great game. can lose several days of your life engrossed.",2
"great game to play alone or with some friends, very easy to get caught up and play for an entire weekend on one game.",1
"some nice changes from civ iv, but it takes some getting use to. the city states are an interesteing complexity, not sure i like them. and the inabilty to stack armies causes some major strategy changes. over all i like it and will play it for many many hours, to my familys chagrin.",2
"play this with my friends all the time. if youre not into competetive this is a great way to waste a few hours on thinking of creative ways to beat the ai.",2
"cons: not ready for new mac os maybe stick to pc on this one. i cant recommend becuase it crashes constantly on my brand new top of line imac. the game is awesome if you can play it i have to save my game so often as to not erase hours of moves after a crash this stinks. i think os x mavericks could be casuing this game issues need patching to address the issue which doesnt seem likely from vendor from what im reading this is huge issue just read the reviews on apples app store version same thing.... i have purchased civ iv since v seem like a dud with technical issues. pro: when you can play it it has depth n greatness in redesign. they have taken this to a new level. im a long time player of civ iii on pc i will try and run v on a pc and see if this thing is stable and return to this review to update.",1
"this is one of those games where you intend just to play a couple of hours and suddenly its the next day. highly addictive and fun everytime you jump in, especially with friends.",1
"do you want to see king leonidas driving a jeep? do you want to see queen elizabeth nuke ghandi? do you want to kill the mayans with tanks and riflemen? do you want to have einstein helping create the first wheel? if you want this then you should get civ v.",1
"civ 5 has surpassed the other versions of civ by a mile!",1
"who earlier loved civilization should also buy here. it catches your attention for hours and makes the turn-based strategy honor.one only criticism is that it gets more profound with the latest dlc. various countries, various cards and much more awaits you in this part of a long tradition-rich game. go buy it",1
"eight playthroughs later and this game is still just as fun and thought povoking as the first. whether youre a warmongering tyrant, an inovative scientist, or a diplomatic politician, there is something for any style of leader in this game. what makes this game even more exciting is the mod system that was not only intigrated but encouraged. id recommend this game to anyone who enjoy games like stratego, risk, or chess.",1
"this game causes time loss. you start the game and the next thing you know, its 8 hours later and dark outside and you missed your shift at work. it is amazing though.",2
"i have no regrets buying this game and every single dlc. worth my time and every singe dollar. although it could use some bug fixes, a ranking system and more realism no doubt one of the best games ive ever played.",3
"if you want the same feeling as being hooked on heroin for a fraction of the cost, buy this game and every dlc.",2
"great game, would reccomend it to anyone who likes both fast and slow statergy games. great mutliplayer and singleplayer you can easily spend a long time in this game.",1
"best strategy game ever! perfect for multiplayer and extremely real when compared to real wars and world history.",2
"for tactic profis a must have! it is very logical and you can remember on your histories lessons ;)",1
"i have a problem with lusting over global domination. thats why i play a lot of 4x games (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate). and civ 5 is a pretty (visually speaking) fix for that problem of mine.",1
"ive been playing games in the civilization franchise for a long time (since civ 2). this is a great version!",2
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",2
"turn based rts with real historic nations/leaders (note controversial chatacters like hitlers germany isnt present) great game requires patience never trust gandhi",1
"ill try playing a diplo match... aaaaaand everyone else is dead. recommend",2
"world domination or peaceful living. all-round raging wars or calm afternoons by inventing new technologies? you decide, but before that, you need your own civilization.",2
"brate pa ovo mi se masu dopada ja bi rae igro ovu igru nego se opo spidom kompa moj pa jebe mater kurac u posrkat ovom jebenom liku koj je ovo napravio i kupit u mu kondom da me moe silovat u bulju",1
"fastastic game! i have not been disappointed by any game in this series.",1
"i have bought every civilization game ever made, i love this game and i still do, but i dont appreciate loosing my option to play the game without being connected & being forced to do so while paying full price. this is in my opinion a betrayal by the franchise i have grow to love over the years. i will not purchase another game. though i think this is a fantastic platform it is not how i personally like to handle my business. i dont want anyone to know what im doing at any given moment if i choose not to tell them. this is my right to have privacy any i feel kinda violated.",1
"i give this game a solid 10/10. i am a huge fan of the civilization series. in my opinion it helps me get over stress yet gets intense when your freind for example all of a sudden declares war and attacks you. it is one of the best games on the p.c in my opinion and with the current 50% off deal its a great game to go for.",1
"civilization 5 is a alright arcade strategy game and one i use to really enjoy but now that i have expanded into the strategy genre this game has become pretty dull to me plus the multiplayer is  and full of bugs also in the late game it can become overwhelming with a map full of cluttered . if you are new to strategy games and want to sink alot of hours into something then this is your game but if you want something a little more indepth and realistic then you should try the total war series.",1
"my favourate game. awsome tile graphics and great game interface whether you want war, peace, or something else. thiss game has it all!",3
"+gameplay +very entertaining multiplayer +graphics +longevity -pretty bad ai/difficulty levels -lots of micromanaging lategame overall: buy bnw to get maximum out of the game. 9/10, would throw life away again.",2
"fantastic game to play, especially with friends. it will consume all your free time though.",1
"me and my friends have had hours of fun playing civ!",1
"buy. this. game. i love it, and have nearly 300 hours played. it is addicting, and you will lose track of time and possibly your loved ones. so many things to say about this game. its beautiful, diverse, detailed and fun! you can chose from many different civs and build and empire to conquer or negotiate your way to victory. many fun achievements and easter eggs, special units and ways to win. this is my favorite strategy game!",3
"its civilization v, the just one more turn game that will get you addicted and make you play for hours. get this game, its extremely fun.",1
"yes. game addicting and fun. frusterating sometimes but good. i like being washington.",1
"this game is soo addicting. the problem with it, is there is no clock. you think, its 7pm...im just going to play a little bit after a bit you think, man, what time is it? andddd its 4 am. =.=",2
"i spent 5 weeks without internet and all i did was play this game. my wife left me (mostly because i lost my job and quit paying bills like the internet) but thats all behind me all thats left now is conquering the worlds as every civ in history and then slowing killing myself through many years of drinking hard liqour. buy this game if you hate yourself.",1
"its hard to go wrong with civ, but now 2 expansions in, the game has really come into its own.",2
"engrossing, worthy of the civiliaztion legacy. the hexes and stack removal make it very much more like a traditional tabletop wargame, something which i found enjoyable.",1
"best rts ever made, and in my personal top 10 games of all time. in civ 5, you assume the role of a past great leader, like washington, ghandi, queen elizabeth and so on. you rule and control their respective countries build your own empire. you do so by raging war, or making peace with others. i highly recommend buying at least the two major expansions. (gods & kings, and brave new world). theyre huge really game changing expansions. like adding religion to the game, which could mean the difference between friendship or nuclear war. as far as time goes, you start in the year 4000 bc (by default). and progress your empire through the ages all the way into the future. even though beyond earth (next entry in civ) is already on the horizon, civ 5 is a true masterpiece. buy this game now.",1
"i find myself sinking hours into civ 5 without realizing, arguably the greatest in its genre and my favorite strategy game. it has fun, intuitive game-play and (despite a lack luster combat system) a large sense of tension placed on your every move to achieve the final victory!",1
"wtf i cant play civ anymore it says i have to re buy it????",1
"brilliant game a++ really addictive build an empire and deestroy the world!!",1
"an incredibly addictive and massively fun strategy game thats great for passing the time and easily accessible for those not particularly used to playing strategy games.",2
"most fun ive ever had playing a moved based strategy game. if you like history and good games, this games for you.",2
"a very enjoyable and unique rts to play, even for those who are new to the genre/series. this game is one of those games that makes you addicted. be prepared for a long sitdown, gather food, drink, and a comfy blanket. after numerous playthroughs ive found myself awake at 5am. overall this is a great game that isnt repetitive, and the effort is worth putting into it. ps: dont trust gandhi in the late-game. especially when he gets nukes.",1
"civilization v is a game where you make your own civilization and then win.. or lose. when i bought this game one of my friends told me not to do it, ill lose my family. well... he was right. (only as a joke, i didnt actually lose my family) warning: this game is a good game. you will lose many hours of your life to it. i recommend this game for you to play, but make sure you get the complete edition for alot more fun. 10/10 what more could you want then to nuke barbarians?",1
"great game! i recommend this to anyone who loves world history and such.",1
"its like risk, but no one is liable to flip the table on you! the dlc is must have and the workshop community downloads are great for improving or mixing things up!",3
"best game i have ever played! all the extra packets and dlcs make the game even more fantastic. 10/10",1
"this game can be incredibly fun when mixed with skype, multiplayer, and ideas.",1
"civilization 5 is the ultimate strategy game. it not only combines strategic warfare and combat sytems in times of war but also the complexity of ruling a sprawling empire in times of peace. as you navigate through diplomacy, maintaining happiness, science, city output, wealth, and a slew of other concepts in this game that make it one of the hardest games to achieve mastery on. spending countless hours on your regular game grinding and laboring to get to some precipice of achievement is nothing short of an average game. civilization brings strategy gaming into a whole new light making each and every game a challenging exercise of the mind to outhink and outsmart your opponents whether it be ai or friends. all in all, this game deserves every recognition as it is truly a fantastic and intriguing game.",3
"it is really really fun. i got it not really knowing what it truly was. i just wanted to make the 2k sale worth it. but when i started playing, i was immediately entranced. i recomend it to not only fans, but everyone.",1
"very addictive game im glad i bought the game when it was only $12.49 for the complete edition but its really hard to install mods for mac :( shame.",1
"well... this game is definitely worth buying if you are into strategy games. create your civilisation, and watch it grow into the ultimate eutopia. or watch it burn to the ground in a great war against other empires. keep your friends close and keep your enemies in check in this strategy masterpiece.",1
"the expansions were pricey but ultimately this is one of the most solid strategy games ive played, as well as one of the most immersive.",1
"want a nice slow paced turn based game well look no further. this game is very nice with a nice little tech tree and getting samurais to slaughter you enemies who take your friken horses! to figure out that gandi is a  who only wants peace then backstabs you for some salt.",1
"just... one... more... turn.... this phrase basically defines this game. extremelly adictive, civ v is one of my favorites ever. just be careful, if you start playing at 7:00 pm, next time youll look at the clock it will be 4:00 am. true story.",2
"keeps me entertained for hours. sometimes i forget to eat.",2
"one of the only games for which i buy expansion packs with no resentment. civ is worth every $, and frantkly a lot more than that. workshop is amazing for this game, and has every mod you can think of. civ 5 improves gameplay significantly over civ 4. while some veterans have trouble adjusting, in the long run the changes are for the better. ai players remain competitive to the end, unlike old civs where one nation dominates to the finish. i only wish i could make the game go faster. no matter how much i overclock or upgrade my pc, a 16 player game on a huge map just starts to slow down near the end.",4
"an amazing strategy game. fun for hours (150+ on record). make sure to try out each different victory type so that you dont just settle for one. fun to play with friends and alone alike!",2
"quite possibly the best turn based strategy game on the market",1
"stockholm is now the capital of libya denmark is located on the ivory coast sydney is in iran gandhi has nuclear weapons the swedish king says gott mit uns yes. 16/10",1
"the game is so much deep and lot of mod to keep you have fresh experience everytime",1
"civ v is really fun buy it or regret not buying it",1
"one of my favorite games ever! no strategy game has made me think as hard as this one. with so many things to micromanage and decide it makes 10 hours go by like nothing. a 100% good buy for any strategy lover.",2
"when you first play this game if you have alot of players can last hours. this is not a bad thoguh becuase those hours will be full of fun if you like manageing citys buildings and an army. this game has replay ability but can get boring in multiplayer becuase you can be deep into a game and people will leave and it just turns into and ai match.",1
"ghandi got to the atomic age and turned my country into fallout 10/10",2
"if you like strategy games then this one is very fun, there is a vast amount of mods that make it even better. it can be a little restircing at some points but they are small things and did not take away from the fun, and even now there are mods that can give you that same preformance now so it does not matter. i recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed the civ games before or anyone just wanting a change from what they usually play, considering i usually play rpgs.",2
"you start playing this, you look at the clock, you have just wasted your saturday. love this game",2
"i love this game. i only have one problem is that i bought gold edition but do not have the gold edition dlc so thats my only down side. other than that great game, couldnt recommend it enough.",1
"this game is like the funnest thing evar !!! but no joke once someone declares war there is basically no way to stop playing until one of you is dead. i dont recommend playing this game if you have somehwere to go, because right when you want to stop gandhi nukes you, and you arent going to let that er live, even if you have something better to do.",1
"playing peacefully the entire game. becoming a highly technological civilization. gets invaded by a foreign country. defends borders agaisnt the invaders. gets condemned by the world for being a warmongerer. world congress embargoes me. builds nukes. takes over the world. 11/10 would take over the world cause i was bullied again",2
"i definitely reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys strategic turn battles and taking over the world. also, genghis khan can form an alliance with napoleon bonaparte :d.",1
"im not a strategy game at all. however, i think civ v is one of the more accessable strategy games, which made it fun for me to learn and play. prepare to spend a ton of hours playing games. this is also one of those games where its actually kind of fun to relax and play against the ai. of course you can also play with your friends, which is just as fun! there are a few bugs sometimes, but the game is absolutely stellar. i would highly reccommend to get the gods and kings expansion, as it really does smooth over combat a lot. still, the base edition is very fun.",1
"im near the end. ill just finish this game and go to bed, you say. you lift your eyes to the clock a moment later and its 4:30a.m. and your civilization hasnt even discovered the internet.",1
"very good stradegy game. highly recommended, good for newcomers to the series.",1
"my favorite game of all times. is it really necessary to explain why ? if you like 4x game, this is the reference, often copied but never (at least not yet) beaten.",1
"you build robot kill bots. what more do you need to know.",1
"this game is recomended it is very fun but if you have a bad computer steer clear of multiplayer and if really bad dont buy the game till you get a better computer (trust me ik) over all pretty fun gme i believe it is worth time into it",1
"excellent game, amazing graphics. gameplay is outstanding and i cant get enough of it! dlc has amazing content aswell, totally happy with this game",1
"games strategist with game play waiting per turn player. have a many resource to keep up your city to become best city then the other.",1
"this is an amazing strategy game thats fun and will always be challenging your skills",1
"10/10, utterly brilliant turn-based strategy, excellent purchase",2
"im not going to lie im just reviewing this for some steam xp. however, this is an amazing game that is fun to play with your friends. it is boardgame-esk in playstyle and can take quite some time. 10/10",1
"this is a spectacular and deep strategy game for those of you with a couple (read: a ton) of hours to spare. its various map generation settings, well-functioning hotseat and online multiplayer modes, plethora of unique and interesting civilzations to play as, and varying routes to victory will keep one entertained for hundreds upon hundreds of turns. one note- the complete edition is a must-buy. gods and kings and brave new world are instrumental to having the best civ experience, as they add awesome features and necessary balance, improving the game greatly.",3
"im pretty sure this is my most played game on steam, with, as of right now, roughly 177 hours or so of gametime. that tells you something right there, as thats a lot of time to put into playing a game. in truth, this is one of my favorite strategy games, and one i have played for years now, since i first bought it on my birthday a few years ago. the fun of building a civilization and dominating all of my opponents keeps me coming back again and again. with the addition of the steam workshop a while back, the game got even better, and now i only play with mods. 9/10",1
"good game to pass the time and some depth in strategie. online is terrible.",1
"its a sid meier game so by saying that, you already know what you are going to get out of it such as hours on hours of gameplay that youll keep going back to year after year.",1
"this is one of those games that you need time to play. i love the game dont get me wrong but, if you do not have alot of time on your hands, the quick games (unless in mp) are not as fun. so far i love the game and would give it a 9.5 out of 10",5
"pick babylon go pottery -> writing -> great library. geee geee",1
"an absolutely fantastic game for anyone who enjoys strategy games!",1
"terrible, its like total war but campaign map only. no battlemechanics what so ever, even if its not a wargame it should not play like a ipad game. the tech tree is dull too. overall - really  dont buy it, totalwar rome i is much better.",1
"awesome game, definitly worth the price! make sure to grab brave new world dlc to get the most out of the game",3
"you can choose to play one of many civilizations to play, each with its own unique unit and building, you can make your own maps with world builder, its simply awesome! gameplay is easy to figure out, lots of fun with managing production, income, trade, and your military. though there are some issues with multiplayer, like major lag and crashing and constant game sync screens... realy annoying.",1
"it is a very fun very tactical game. i like the play it. it. is. great!",2
"ive love this game ever since civilization i. always interested in their innovation.",1
"its a great time killer and is even better to play with friends. i recommend checking out the workshop for mods with this game as they can add countries or leaders that arent recognized in the game or in the dlcs.",1
"solid strategy game. just as good single-player as it is multi-player.",1
"one of the most addicting games from one of the most addicting franchises ever.",1
"i think civ4 modded to death still wins out. civ5 is catching up quick and i think it will take the place as my favorite civ. no matter what the panzer general type combat and terribly unbalanced build times will always throw me off. 7/10 - good game, but has issues, and i dont agree with the game mechanics direction the series took here.",4
"9.2 / 10 sid meiers civilization v i truely love this game and really cant hate but +amazing strategy game +good combat and movement effects +nice look to it / nice graphics - the leaders never change ex: russian leader catherine in 20th century -the friendship between different civs feels more of a job ex: they always mooch of you and you cant ask a favor back and when you dont give them charity they denouce you",1
"the troop limit on every hexagon ist a big minus. i cant blitzkrieg my enemies like i used to. still a great game.",1
"what a game, hugely reccomended to people who are interested in historical games, for me its like the total war series but you can start from the beginning, and thats what i enjoy, manipulating technology! but warning gandhi.",2
"civ v never gets old to go back to. i love making my own maps as well and all the customization that brings with the sdk. so pumped for beyond earth.",2
"the civiliazation games have always been amazing....i truly think it is worth every penny. highly recommended.",2
"any game where i can columbus columbuss house is a game for me. 10/10",1
"this is one of my favourite games ever, i love all the strategy involved, as well as the differnt ways to win and progress.it is also so cool that you can build the great wonders and be one of historys great leaders.",2
"love this game! you will need both expansions to truly appreciate it. the gods and kings expansion added quite a bit to game play but with the latest expansion brave new world, more elements have been included such as trade routes, tourism, etc. that enhance the game even more. all that being said, diplomacy is still poorly executed in the game so beware of this negative aspect and enjoy what is a very good, if not excellent (4x) tbs game.",5
"this has better battle parameters, diplomacy and character personalities.",4
"i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is interested in history and/or wants to learn about historical figures and events. this game allows the player decide the politics of the world you are in and that is why it is one of steams best selling games.",1
"whenever i play this game, i always say to myself oh, just one more turn. i keep saying this hours later.",3
"i love this game....ive always been a huge fan of civ games, and this one is just as good!",1
"have you ever thought why your parents, friends and even people who pass you in the street hate you. its because you dont own this game. it can be as satisfying as using sandpaper to pleasure yourself and after 50 hours it seems to lack depth. but yeah good clean christian fun.",1
"definitly one of my favorite games. i would give this game a 9.8/10. each civilization is unique and there are numerous amount of map styles and different ways to play through each game. gods & kings: this dlc added religon which made the game much more dynamic and also added more civilization leaders to play as which some have awesome perks. brave new world: completely changed the way the game is played but in a great way. the new caravans completely redesign how to make money as a civilization and the great writers and artist make winning a cultural victory much different.",1
"a great turn by turn strategy game like all the civ games, however almost necessary to buy the dlc. definitely worth the money.",3
"next turn........wait please.........next turn........wait please..........",1
"great game with dlc that actually changes how you play.",2
"this game tears family and friend apart. i started a game with my friends and by the end everyone had betrayed each other, bonds broken, friendships destroyed. 10/10",1
"such a fun stratedgy game. i reccomend this game 12/10 byoutiful 2 fab 4 u _ ###   #####  (_) f  < a /   b  // u   _ l // o  //| u (( s || |   ) | |) / ` )l (_ and theres even more workshop content and dlc",1
"absolutely fantastic, addictive game. it blends the classic likes of sim city with the command & conquer series to deliver an engaging, fun experience that you wont be able to look away from!",2
"its great if u love strat and a heavier board game",1
"pretty good. make sure you pick up all the expansions are youre missing out.",1
"allows a great story of the civilizations of the past and present! i highly recomend it to all you history obbsesors!!!!",1
"every the next part of this game is the best among others with no alternative among others 1010",3
"great strategic gameplay. unfortunately the games seem to go on and on and on. still a good game. 7/10",1
"great game, civ v will provide one with countless hours of stragetic fun. there is more than one way get a victory in the game which will provide many options on how to arrive to one. eac dlc only improves your experience and adds more hours of fun. the civ series gets better and better, so far this is a must have for anyones library.",2
"this game is amazing. it might seem as if each time you play its going to be the same but no matter what the game will always be diffrenet. the first day i got this game i played for 10 hours straight. this game is amazing. its like a board game but has so many more features.",1
"this game is my favourite when it comes to the strategy genre. get this with the expansions, especially brave new world and you will quickly have 100+ hours of fun.",3
"buy it if you dare, its like a one-way timemachine, once you start a game of it, youll be there for a few hours without even noticing!",1
"best stratigy game out there. compex but simpe, and there is plenty of epic civ 5 falures, and even victorys. buy it now, and i am off to play civ 5.",1
"pros: great game, and it is lots of fun, has tons of hours of play time. cons: a few small things that are annoying in certain situations.",1
"its okay, but when the game wants to screw you over, it will, gladly...",1
"i was one of the first to buy this game in 2010, and i was also one of the first to stop playing this because i, like many others, felt it was a watered down version of civ iv. however, with the two expansion packs that seem lovingly crafted by firaxis, the game is easily one of my favorite 4x and strategy games of all time. the end-game was brought to life by bnw, and g&k fixed all the ai concerns i had. if you like strategy games at all, buy this game.",1
"just one... more... turn... bang! *head hits keyboard* what?! huh!? where am i?! man its late, i really should go to bed... ooh, i can make that now! click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click... click.... bang!",2
"firstly and most importantly: i have never played a civ game before. secondly, the first time i sat down and played civilization v, i played for almost 8 hours. consecutively. the game is that addictive, and i havent had that kind of hook on a game for a while. there are many ways to play and ultimately be the best civilization. the game might look unappealing and boring to some, but the game is really easy to understand, yet extremely deep at the same time. im mostly a strategy/mircomanagement person, so take this game recommendation with a grain of salt.",1
"the latest in the long and impressive civilization lineage. while the core mechanics remain the same there are quite a few fundamental changes that really alter the flow of gameplay. the lack of unit stacking requires much more careful strategy when it comes to war and the games balance of culture, military might, and science pursuit really does mean any strategy has a viable chance of succeeding. if youre a fan of the civ series at all or even looking for a good starting point, id highly recommend it. beware of the dreaded just one more turn... oh god its 3 am syndrome! if you do buy civ v i would highly recommend picking up the gods and kings expansion. it seriously rebalances the culture tree, adds religion back in, and is generally more of a sorely needed patch than a seperate game but whatcha gonna do?",2
"i have sunk tons of hours into this game...great game for your money.",1
"fantastic game, but be prepared for sunrise to sneak up on you when you press that play button!",1
"hours of fun packed in a gorgeous setting. this requires dee strategy, and long hours.",2
"like civ 4 but different. still has tanks and nukes, and the computer is still insane. but its basically the same game.",3
"a real time-vampire, a massive time sink, a something of time a passer. i dont know, just buy the damn thing!",2
"just one... more... turn... bang! *head hits keyboard* what?! huh!? where am i?! man its late, i really should go to bed... ooh, i can make that now! click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click... click.... bang!",2
"dont need to say much. if you dont know about civ 5 then i cant help you. buy it, and say goodbye to friends, facebook, your goldfish....",3
"civ 5 has gotten to the point where it can now be crowned as king of tbs. be very careful with this game, ive sat in the same place playing it for hours...",1
"think board game without the messy packing and maintaining of pieces. think semi-intelligent, competitive ais. think age of empires and empire earth rolled into one, minus rts. time consuming, but when it comes down to pitboss (turn based multiplayer you can come back to any time), youll keep going, one more turn! this is a game for you if you excel at planning and predicting other players moves. just think chess that includes worker pieces, and against up to 31 other players.",1
"many hours canbe spent in this one, waiting on loading mostly;(",3
"one of the best and most addicting turn based stratagy games in existance. 10/10",2
"tacking on the noobs part kind of nullifies the whole gg part",1
"this game is fun and addicting i recommend setting the map type to massive to have a chaotic expirience",1
"one of the best strategy games i have ever encountered.",3
"got sucked into this pretty quickly, but you have to spend quite some time to learn how exactly the game works to begin with... and expect single rounds to take up multiple hours as well. but if you are patient and like strategy games, ya oughta go for it.",1
"still an awesome game. ive been playing civilization since the 2nd one and they just keep getting better and better.",2
"created the great empire of rome in 1980, also a good cheaper alternative to be. btw it will kill you social life just check the time i have wasted.",2
"the real game the best game the biggest game thumbs up",2
"amazing game, just keep in mind everyone secretly hates you, including your irl friends, they will backstab you if given a chance!",3
"if you like strategy games and nation-building games, this ones for you. ive enjoyed this game a lot, and i recommend it to any strategy game fan!",1
"i simply love this game, every game is different and enjoyable, you can customize enough to make it pretty darn challenging or a sandbox laidback session. i def. recommend this. seriously. buy this game. play it.",1
"amazing game and awesome with triple monitor setups.",1
"a simplified version of civ iv, but 1000 ghandi nukes greater in quality + polish.",3
"using united states. map size 4 players. playing againts ai. 6 hours had passed and the game even finished yet.",1
"amazing game, played it for weeks, not as much as garrys mod but still alot.",1
"with the brave new world expansion this becomes literally the best point in the series. no stacks of doom, trading, religion, tourism...only thing missing is that espionage could be a bit more fleshed out, with spy units that could poison water and sabotage and whatnot.",1
"i have put 100 hrs into this game and still find new and interesting things. the workshop really adds awesome stuff and makes it even more intricate. i highly recommend giving it a try.",1
"round 5 to come back as the mongol conqueror khan and use brute force with land force to conquer the world. or make peace with the world and win diplomatically as ghandi. show the world what your civilization is made of and win the space race in your capitalistic society as washington. or spread your culture and dominate the world through your taste in music and foods as ramkamhaeng. or... just nukle everyone else out of existence. civ 5 is epic and legit. you want.",1
"a highly addictive game that youll have difficulty putting down at the end of the day. even the quickest matches take several hours to complete. dont fool yourself into thinking thats bad, though! the more you learn about how to play this amazing simulation game, the harder it is to keep track of the hours passing by. just...one more turn...",1

"i cant explain it. you open the game...and then you look at the clock and youve somehow lost track of the last 6 hours. any game that can engross you that much is a definite recommendation! a definite must-have for any 4x strategy game fan!!",1
"it is a fun and great game if you like stratigic games i would recommend it for all strategy players",1
"a great game. good ui. runs decently well. fantastic art style. 9/10",1
"turn based strategy good graphics smooth gameplay. good if you have time to kill....",1
"also the game is much better with friends. a must buy for strategy gamers. 9/10 hope this helps and have fun with the game. :)",1
"seriously, what do you need to say about a civ game. awesome.",1
"civ v is one of my favorite strategy games. i was never a huge civ player in the past, so take what i say with a grain of salt, but ive lost entire weeks to this game. nothing else has come close to capturing that much of my free time.",2
"one of the best this kinda games! easy to play with friends also very fun! recommand this game for every person! go and get this game!",1
"liked the game but not as good as civ 4. i would get it but cant wait for the next one",1
"an addicting turn based game and a sequel to the past civ games.it came out just as i expected just as nice as the last ones but with better graphics and mechanics i look forward to the hope of future civ games! good job",1
"love the game, just cant finish the reveiw yet. im finishing off ghandi with nukes.  15/10",5
"the concept of one more turn has no meaning here. fantastically addictive game. 10/10 would play again.",2
"played as gandhi so he couldnt nuke me, and then started to feel this weird sensation come over me that i wanted to attack every nation on the map!!!! unlimated gandhi power!!!!!!!!!!! they didnt stand a chance! 10/10",1

"the easiest civ to get into and understand, itll suck the hours right out of you. a must-buy game!",1
"civililization 5 is one of my most played games with infinate replay value. the level of detail is just right not being to micro and not too big picture. however it is a little weak on the whole idea of foren policy withought the brave new world dlc witch adds it in and makes just going to war for no reason veary bad.",1
"one of the best games ever. if you love to run your own country, or have ever wanted to try, this is the game for you.",2
"there is no possible way to not say plz one more turn? after youve won a victory",2
"conquered the iroqois in the modern era while using infantry as carthage then got half of my cities nuked by gandhi and all the city-states declared war on me. 56/10",2
"this game is amazing if you love stratgy then get this",1
"its boring, lame and waste of time! its kind of bulls***!",1
"a game that makes time flow by as if it were water. amazing game, it definately makes you think with every game different from the last.",1
"so i bought this game because it was on sale for 8$. looking over the game from summaries it seemed like a good 10hr game but holy was i ever wrong..... i didnt pay heed to the reviews and i should have because i dont have a life anymore. and  ghandi that lying",1
"just plain one of the best strategy games/ series ever. i used to hate turn based games till i found civ!",1
"civ is a goood game that will test your strategy game ability, diplomacy and tatics to rule your empire. its a great game well worth buying.",2
"great game if you love to take your time doing research or going for all out war and domination. takes you by suprise how good it looks.",1
"turn based combat while building an entire empire. yes please play with any one with the game aswell. thank you. from the origional maker of the sims. great work sid. get it now and be amazed at how good a game can be if you take your time and craft an extremely rare blue, flawless diamond in the rough, a sea of b******t fps war games taking out americas enemies in the name uncle sam. get this to get away. rename queen elizabeth to seras victoria. dont be japan, be area 11 lead by zero. dont be france, be the saints lead by julius little.",1
"i`ll play it for an hour ... yeah, an hour :d time goes fast while playing civilization v <3",1
"when youre playing civilization, history becomes your creation, learn to write before you can read and build the taj majal right in cleveland!",3
"a great game for anyone that wants to burn a few hours. its a game of wits and brute strength, forging allies and waging war all to gain a foothold over your rivals. many or few, every game is different with a huge selection of map types and playable factions. i have played multiple runs of this game and still it is my favorite civ from sid so far. im sure ill have many more hours in this game as the acheivment list is 200+. multiplayer has a little to be desired as the matching can sometime take awhile and games tend to get overpowered one way or another rather early on. finding solid players that can last a match is uncommon. with all being said the game is definetly playing.",2
"certainly one of the best games ever made! it keeps me coming back time and time again.",3
"one of the best turn based strategy game ever made :)",2
"the best series of all time as always in good shape. its my favorite and the worst game ever... why ? because iv lost so much time playing this game ^_^",1
"only 4h on the clock, but im already loving it. if youre new to this type of games, you can learn everything from the gameplay, you dont have to browse for tutorials, like many games unfortunately require to even start doing something. the user interface is clean and simple, yet powerful. and gandhi is here :3",1
"great game but i feel it requires some of the dlc to have great fun",1
"i havent visited this venerable series since civ 1 or 2, cant even remember. im pleased to say the latest offering is everything i could hope for in a franchise that keeps sticking around.",1
"as the first civilization game i play, i must say its amazing. at first i found the hud a bit hard to understand, but after learning the basics, ive got hooked! its just addictive, in a good way. i also have to mention the educational side of it because i actually learned a thing or two about history and geography.",1
"probably my all-time favourite strategy game, if not a tie with the starcraft series. what gives this the edge is that it is all turn-based as opposed to real time, like a board game. with multiple ways of winning and games that could potentially last months (though i havent bothered trying that), the options are endless. highly recommend this game for strategy buffs.",1
"still the best long-run turn based strategy game series in existance. this version perfects many of the issues the prior iterations had and adds a ton of new content.",1
"an easy way to spend hours alone or with friends! this is an overall awesome multiplayer strategy game.",1
"i guess its ok but theres nothing really noteable about it",2
"this game is simply amazing. i nuke all the other countries. starting with ghandi.",2
"not as good as civ 4 but still great in its on right",1
"very good game, but games usually take several days to win.",1
"i only started playing this genre with civ iv. i really liked it. civ v is a whole new challenge with familiar surroundings. religion and espionage are ok, id like it if yo could have your spy sabotage or do more even if youve out researched your oppenent. its a good game and quite enjoyable playing againt/with friedns.",5
"probably the best game in the civ series, especially with the expansion packs adding additional content. the dlc also gives more options as to how you want to play - pretty much every aspect is customisable to your own playstyle. at no time does this game feel like a slog to play, as your civilisation moves through the ages different challenges and priorities appear for you to focus on.",2
"really cool game :) very complex game and i like it :)",1
"this game is the spawn of satan which is why it is so addictive and fun. i hate the last turn syndrome. omg the new one is coming out in a couple weeks!!!!",5
"great game, but seems like firaxis wont make a linux client, forcing linux users to use wine/variations or buy windows. i cant recommend this! its against my ideal updated: they really do a civ v linux client! finally i will play seriously civv like i played civiv and civiii on past! :)",1
"hours of endless world domination is always bound to please the conqueror in everyone.",4
"holy  balls is that civilization v?! you bet your sweet non dairy  it is! this game is ing hardcore to the max. commit gennocide, brainwash another culture with your propaganda,  space with your giant science ! this game is so ing good you would suck a  to play it, then play it, then suck a  again to say thank you for the game.",1
"i love the entire civilization franchise; civ 5 is no different. its an amazing ton of fun to build your own empire. with the expansion packs of gods and king and brave new world (in addition to the other civs), the game becomes full - i highly recommend them as well. new to the game are city-states and a one unit per tile rule. this adds a great amount of strategy when thinking how to manage your military or dealing with other civilizations.",4
"great game. i have played a few of the civ games and liked them to varying degrees. civ 5 though has probably the best all around game play though. i thoroughly enjoy both the long and short run games. the workshop makes the game even more fun. i also highly recommend all the dlcs as they add a lot of unique features that increase the playability of the game and various scenarios that can be quite challenging",2
"get this game so you can waste precious hundreds of hours of your life in a meaningless compilation of 1s and 0s.",1
"words cant describe how much i love this game... but numbers can: 8/10",2
"i nuked the aztecs as an egyptian warlord. what other game lets you do that?",1
"i had played civilization iv and had loved it instantly. later, when civ v released, i used to dismiss it as hex tiles and stuff, until i played it with all expansions. its the best game from the series in my opinion. :)",1
"the game takes some time to get into however once you do get into the triumph and conquering youll never want to stop winning!!!!!",3
"5-way nuclear war between ghandi, alexander the great, bismark, theodora, and genghis khan resulted in the total annihilation of my civilization. 10/10",2
"i once played a hot seat game with a friend starting at 10pm. 1 turn later it was 8am in the morning. does not dissapoint",1
"if you like turn-based strategy, you need this game like you need air. if you arent sure what a turn based strategy game is or if you like one, youll likely still find this game pretty awesome.",2
"really good game its nice to build an empire from the start",1
"i absolutely love playing civilization v. ive never played any of the previous civs before, but my husband has always been a fan and got me into the game as well. im also not much of a gamer, so to me, the graphics are great for the functionality of playing. the music is beautifully done and the personalities of each civ mostly mirrors actual history. its fun, and the civlopedia helps me learn a little bit about each culture. this is a fun and captivating game.",1
"well you all know my satnce on this glorious game 11/10",1
"interesting game. really liked it. i pleayed it with the mediteranian mod which made me so proud to play alexander the great! i had some problems with it crashing but a quick google fixed it",1
"a really enjoyable 4x type of game. just sit back and relax and watch ur people grow from savages into everyone living in this world right now. become a leader now",1
"great strategy game has now become even better. it has come a long way since i played the first civilization on a ibm 386 :)",4
"sid meiers civilization is a series that has, deservedly, garnered many fans for its unique and enthralling strategic gameplay. all you ever want to do in civ v is press that end turn button one more time. brave new world makes everything so much better and adds a layer that was previously missing. but with civilization v, comes the knowledge that this world is one that we must share and with that come the responsibility of knowing that the decisions we make today will have a lasting impact on the generations of tomorrow.",1
"gandhi wont let me complete a game not worth the money.",1
"i recommend this game for those that like the turn based stratedy types. civ 5 gives you the right ammount of control over your civilisation without information overload. a well contructed game.",2
"this is the best game ever made for home computer systems.",4
"as a major supporter of turn based stategy games this has been one of my favorite series of games and sid meiers never never to impress. they are fun and very friend friendly for multiplayer gaming. its easy to get lost in the country that you built from the ground up and every game you learn something new. whether it be a useful game strategy, a famous quote, or some useful historical information from the civilopedia this game will always keep you interested.",1
"the game itself is good but after a good 20 hours you get really bored of the gameplay. it is the same everytime, start out crap, build up your cities, get attacked, launch attacks, win by defeat or science.",1
"this game is great, endless fun for those who enjoy rts games.",1
"this game is amazing.. its eating up every moment of my free time.. which is somehow a good thing :)",1
"a brilliant strategy game for loooong and many nights ;-).",1
"destroy any sympathetic/peaceful bone in your body with sid meiers war simulator v (now with real extinct languages!)",2
"i loved this game while it worked on my computer. after mac osx (maverick) came out, civ has no longer been compatable with my mac. waiting for aspyre or someone to come up with a patch, or some information to fix this. -_-",2
"great game, spent many hours on it. its most fun when doing multiplayer,",2
"why are you checking the reviews?!?! just buy it!!!!!!!! now............. why are you still reading buy the game!",1
"ive logged 250+ hours on this game and thats still noob status. maybe someday i will see my family again, but the war rages on and there are lands not under my grasp. just one more turn...",2
"once you learn it the game can be addicting 10/10 i have not played any previous civ game other than the console version",1
"this is one of the best games ive ever played in my entire life, if youre a fan of strategy games, this is your nirvana right here! 9.5/10",1
"windows 8.1, this game is cactus, will not run on startup direct x 9, 10-11, or 8.1. will have to trouble shoot but not a good start",1
"warning!!! this game is ridiculously addictive! i bought this game a while back and never really had a chance to sit down and give it my full attention but when i did decide to do so i was glued to my seat. a playthrough that i originally thought would last a half hour quickly become a 13 hour marathon and after many defeats ( being a noob) i still felt like going back for more, each time being rewarded for my persistence by learning or discovering something new about this wonderful game. if you havent bought this already, what are you waiting for?",1
"8/10. great game that will suck the life out of you until you know everything about the roman empire. ai is wonky at times, but is almost always a fun experience.",2
"you cant call yourself an old school gamer without having civ",1
"er countries develop just as fast as european countries. 2/10",1
"this game is great, i still dont know how to play this game and yet is not frustrating",1
"civilization v is an amazing game that you can play for hours.",2
"my first civilization series game experience. thoroughly impressed. hours upon hours of gameplay and still feel like ive only cracked the surface of this game. awesome.",1
"please disregard my play time as it has not saved. let me just say civ5 is a must have game for anyone, this is my favourite strategy game as of now and you should not miss out on a game this great!!!",1
"i installed the game one evening looking for a few hours of fun. i checked my phone at 3am only to realize it was actually 8am and the sun was peeking up over the horizon. oh god, what have i done?",1
"a really fun, easy going, not hard but still complex strategy.",2
"civilization. sid meiers. its as great as it will ever get.",1
"its a great strategy game thats great by itself and even better with the brave new world dlc.one of my favorites",1
"this game is so deep and complex but is made so even beginners can play no problem. 9/10",1
"civilization ruined my sleep schedule and made me hate gandhi. best personal moment? when every single nation went to war with atilla and i got to sing mulans be a man. ten outta ten",1
"this game is amazing to the point of rebuilding great empires or civilizations and breaking them down to control the world.",1
"this game is greatly time consuming which would be the only real flaw to the game if you were to ask me. overall the gameplay is smooth and is fun, really wish you could make the game a bit more fast pace and the fact there was no single player story line was kind of dissapointing. great time waster if you need that, is really fun in multiplayer and single player. great variety of playable historic people.",1
"great game! involves alot of thinking, but it was worth the price, and also, get the complete pack cuz it saves money because of all the dlcs in this game",1
"holy time sink batman, this is one good game. never played much of the first 4, but i really am enjoying this one.",1
"this game is a fun strategy game, with a very steep learning curve. but once you get past all that its pretty fun.",1
"very good game. hours of strategy fun. great for challenging friends and laerning a little about history at the same time! what not to love? 9/10",3
"engaging and offering many layers of challenges. the feeling of accomplishment and acquiring a skill at championing culture is in the face of opposition is both mentally and graphically a lot of fun.",1
"ghandi is a huge  in this and wants to nuke the world. 10/10",1
"civ v is a black hole of human life; ive spent hundreds of hours revising human history (and more often than not delivering a swift nuclear coup de grace to its menial suffering). if you can hobble together a few reliable friends, and are willing to invest a handful of doomed games to learn the basics, theres nary a fellow who cant or wont love this frankenstein of marriage-killing fun.",3
"great game, always loved civ games. i was very glad to see civ5 beeing released on linux. it worked great for a few months, however recently the game started crashing while playing and that is a pitty. crashes are not very common maybe every 2 - 3 hours. neverless it would be great if it would not crash at all :)",2
"i highly reccomend this game. currently my favorite civ to date. although there are some aspects of the game that are still left to be desired, this game is all around well built for long-term longevity and entertainment. the expansions are key for truely complex scenarios but are not necessary for a truly amazing experience. what are you waiting for? click that buy now button!",1
"you will never lose more of your life playing a game other than this one, and for good reason, because this is probably the most time-consuming, addictive game there is.",1
"some people have compared this game to other strategy games such as empire earth and age of empires, however i see civ as cocaine and other strategy games as flour. sure, theyre both white powders which you can snort, however which one is going to keep you up til 2oclock in the morning wanting more?",3
"civilization v is a brilliant game. at first i only owned the base game and still loved it, could have endless games and it would be fun regardless. then i bought the expansions and they make the game so much better. i highly recommend this game and the expansions",1
"most addicting games ive played yet. can play whenever you want. during when doing homework, work, etc. so far my most played game.",2
"beep boop i am simulating a person having fun at a vidya game. beep boop. the enemy is attackiong. oh no. grow crops. traint teh armies. whee woo whee woo oh no. ooh no. get a beat down. army attack. grand ball of dance and wisdom. of fiht fgight fight",1
"incredibly fun for people who enjoy 4x-style games. just make sure you have enough time to play before sitting down.",1
"its a great game but its even more fun with friends.",1
"its a awsome game. i like how there is no adds that pop up while you are playing. i like all the different civs.",1
"love this game. spent many a day taking over the world and usually stomping the french into the ground. it can take quite a while to get through each round, but thats expected since you go from a couple thousand bc to the modern age. the scenarios offered are a nice little change from the base game.",3
"you wont be able to just have one more turn, you fool",1
"if rtss arent your thing, this game does the job, no zerg rushing, just ghandi and his mission to destroy your life and civilization. so remember to rip out and eat his heart to gain his courage, his tasty courage....",2
"great game the game just keeps moving on and you got to try to be ahead",1
"just got the gold edition upgrade, very good well worth the money :d",1
"fun game to play with friends. completely for my steam achievements",1
"this game is just magical, i really enjoy rewriting history:d",2
"woah, i played that for 300 hours? ive been in comas shorter than that",2
"prepare to spend 5-6 hours on this game without realizing youve been on for more than an hour. one more turn really does become a mantra that dominates your thinking. that said, the number of possible game setups and possibilities results in nearly endless gameplay.",2
"love this game would recommend it, missed the first time expansions went on sale but got it the 2nd time arround",1
"one of my favorite games of all time and compared to the newest one, which is about space(forget the title) it is by far better. it will seem old and dated graphics wise but, the concepts are wonderful and i could play this game endlessly. i used to play it on my laptop(not my gaming pc) and was forced to quit whenever turn 100 got around because my computer would crash. litterly 400 hours of life gone on civ and i didnt even play with people. great game but, it is amazing if you have friends to play with(which can last awhile, dont have any plans)",1
"nice game. even though your new to series its still enjoyable and easy to get basics down.",1
"getting screwed by ghandi and maria theresa, the epiphany of gaming. great game and even better with friends.",2
"this game is definately built for people who went from risk to axis and allies because risk was too basic, then thought this isnt complicated enough either... that being said, i love it, 5 stars.",2
"great game. youll spend endless hours playing this. the tutorial is enough to get you going. also the tips and recommendations will help you continue to learn more about the game as you play. i recommend it as a must have game for any pc gamer.",2
"a fresh next gen take on the classic that shaped pc gaming on earth, this is a beast of a game, no single human born after the 90s can say it never heard of sid miers civ game... to review this i would need some 2 history books and a couple of pages....",1
"man this is a good game but barabarians can easily make your game a living hell. also, other civs will get real mad for settling like five tiles away. what the heck is up with that.",1
"in what other game can you spread the great religion of herpes across the land?",2
"this game is amazing if you want to have a time comusiming game that is fun as hell and even more with friends. i would recommend this game to turn baces gamers, statigect gamers and even history fanatics. one nay i can think of though is that there are some civilisations i would like or expect in the game like australia. but serisoly put australia in as aboriganals. they have been on this earth for centeries.",1
"civilization v is a really fun and great game to play!",1
"buy this strat game if ur into strategies and turn based cuz this was my first strat game, my one and only favorite too. youll have a hell of a time especially with all the dlcs.",1
"great game for multiplayer and single player. love this so much, so many options to play and difficulty settings. wide variety of ways to set up the game too.",1
"you will fall asleep playing this game, wake up, and continue playing it.",3
"civ has always been a game i go to when i want to think, but not be hurried. i enjoy having decisions being made without the pressure of ongoing attacks. fun game that i continue to invest in.",2
"if you want something to do with friends this is the game for you",2
"456 hrs played, all single player. this is the best refined civ game ive played. this versions ui is the best by far. it is a great game to pass some time and build an empire. the main weakness of civ v is the ai. none of them follow the personality of their historical counterparts. they all have basically the same personality: psychopath. nothing like having ghandi break an alliance and declare war on you. but all in all, its a game i have played a lot and continue to come back to.",3
"ill be going to bed soon honey! just one more turn!",1
"this is by far and away one of the best strategy games you can buy. it rivals the fun factory of even games like starcraft 2 and dawn of war.",1
"i enjoy spending 6 hours playing a game and then the whole thing being deleated 10 out of 10",1
"civ 5; a bundle of sleepless fun, concentration, mistrust, and an unhealthy (yet effective) amount of instant coffee.",1
"great game...... once u start a game you just,..... cant stop!",1
"i have mixed feelings baout his game. i like civ4 better but i like the hexacon map and clouds on civ5. also the multiplayer on civ4 is wayyyy better. if youre new to civ5 and/or want to play send a request.",2
"i have two things to say about this. 1. nuking your friends is fun. 2. dont trust gandhi",1
"- so youre saying that i need to accept the religion of your civilization? - yes, dido! from a conversation with the babylonian missionary for 8 years before the fall of babylon.",3
"if you like being america and conquering everyone and everything like i do, then this is the game for you!",1
"6 out of 10 great graphics. i am still learning how to play this game i havent figured it all out. it is a lot different than the old civilization games.",1
"must have for everyone who likes turn-based strategy games. it demands stronger hardware, especially in later stages of game when there are many civilisations left and most of map is opened.",4
"a really fun turn based strategy game, some issues with multiplayer, and optimization, but its well worth it!",1
"utterly addictive. its always fun to ttake over the world.",2
"this is the best game steam ever introduced and succeeded magnificent",1
"this game destroyes my social life almost as fast as ghandi destroyes my cities with nukes. that nig. 69/8 goty sid meier is love, sid meier is life.",2
"this game is fun. you should buy it so i can get my  kicked by you too. im getting tired of death threats from just ghandi.",1
"civ 5 is one of those games that people who like the idea of owning their own empire will enjoy. you can wage war with other nations and be happy with fruits of your conquests, even though many risks were taken. with dlc, you can watch as your religion spreads across the world. also, for diplomats, you can negotiate land, resources, and forge alliances. i would recommend this game for people who have a lot of patience and time on their hands, because this game is addicting as hell.",2
"fantastic game. over forty different civilizations to choose from. tons of options. numerous ways to achieve victory, and various strategies to support those paths. alot of value for the money.",1
"historical fiction: yes famous world leaders: yes interdependant trade: yes as many bugs as skyrim: no",1
"another installation in the civ series, and a fantastic one at that. i just dont see how anybody could hate this game. its a polished version of the amazing civ iv. great job sid mier! i doubt you will see this review, but keep up the good work! 101st hour edit... i regret nothing",1
"love this game so much! love the entire series! been playing since civ iv. the combat system is so much better improved from civ iv, and it looks beautiful. anything could happen... will be looking forward to beyond earth!",1
"this game is a great top to civ iv. an awesome game for friends to challenge wits on. very stragetic if you play on hard mode with plenty of city states and other countries. i love this game. it can be very relaxing.",1
"very good and fun way for you and your friends to have fun on an afternoon, but i would get the dlcs as well, makes it more fun.",1
"you can tell developers poured their heart and soul into this game to make an extremely addicting and replayable experience. 11/10",2
"if you enjoy strategy, youll love civ v. also, its probably the best turn-based strategy game around.",1
"ive lost about 12 hours to this game in the first 2 days......its fantastic!",1
"i cant spend just an hour playing this - every time i play, its always a large chunk of time, and its always worth it. 10/10.",1
"excellent game. i cant say anything that hasnt been said probably a dozen times already, so i will just give civ5 another thumbs up.",5
"i dont know how many times ive said just one more turn. its to the point where i cant trust myself... amazing game!",2
"the one thing that the civilization series lacked, for me, was tactical combat. civ5 adds this new layer to the game, and the result is fantastic. unfortunately, the civ ai has never been formidable in warfare and, with this more complex war system, the flaws are more noticeable than ever. nonetheless, this game is extremely engaging and re-playable, a very easy recommendation.",2
"without the expansions, this game is indeed fun, but pretty lackluster as well, especially when comparing it to civ iv. however, add gods and kings and brave new world, and you get an extremely fun strategy game. singleplayer has its pros, such as being moddable, but, in my opinion, nothing beats the fun you can have with friends, either working together, competing with each other, or warring with each other.",2
"this game has ruined my life, in the best possible way. this is a must have for every pc-gamer. i can sink hours upon hours into this game.",1
"my civilization established the internet before learning to throw  at grass to make it grow faster. 10/10",1
"awesome game. very in depth and addicting to play.",1
"if crusader kings and total war had a baby, this would be it.",1
"if you like a good strategy game, this is the game for you! so much love for this game brah!",1
"this is a great game and a must have for pc players. it is easy to get the hang of. get the complete edition the normal civ v is ok. the complete edition is what makes it a really good game. 9/10 only due to the fact you need to get the main dlcs.",1
"theres a mod to make hitler the leader of germany. -then you can make judaism germanys religion -be friends with england, america, russia, and france -and finally, win the diplomatic victory -enough said write your own history book simulator 2014: 10/10",1
"sid meier never disappoints, amazing gameplay. a blast with friends.",1
"this is the biggest time destroying game ever created. there is no way to have a quick game in civ, to really enjoy it you have to start from ancient,you have to be playing agains friends and you must kill gandhi! 10/10 i love this game and i havent even wasted many hours on enough civs yet.",1
"i love this game! this is one of my favorite games to play, but i dont like how the dlc costs so much",1
"great game, worth every penny. it may seem complex but once you get the hang of it, it will become one of the best strategy games, in my opinion.",1
"i retract my previous statement and apologise to firaxis, this game is lightning in a bottle, dont bother with beyond earth, this is the best strategy game you will ever play.",5
"really love this game so addicting and so much fun be requires the brave new world expansion pack",2
"this is by far is the best most in depth strategy i have ever played. i would recommend it to any strategy fanatic out there, you can get sucked in to this game for eight hours at a time. i give a huge thumbs up.",5
"whats there to say about civilizations 5 except it provides epic proportions of nation building, conquest, and even diplomacy and trade with the new dlc. if you like building empires or armies then you should get civilization 5. if you have played too much of civilization 5 and dont own the dlc then you are missing out. i would wait until all the dlc is bundled togeather along with civilization 5. you know it is only a matter of time until that is done again since there is a new civilization game coming out shortly. also there is a massive mod community, albiet something i have not explored much, which can provide tons of new experiences on top of the normal game.",1
"far too easy to spending hours playing this game... you may miss meals, blow past your intended bed time... and yet still a great game.",1
"i enjoy this game very much, sadly it makes the hours fly by without notice. multiple ways to win with diversification on the races. plenty to try with great replayability.",1
"my chair broke from siting 4 so long 11/10 ign <>< find nemo 3 cuntfirmed",1
"good game. but dont plan on finishing the game in one hour or so.",1
"this is probably one of the best games i have ever played and with my total of 60+ games (console and pc) this is definetally #1. i think everyone should own this fine masterpice of a game. the single player and multiplayer options are very well balanced.",1
"honestly one of the most addicting games ever!! dont play this before bed, or you will be up all night!!",1
"when civ 5 came out, i didnt like it at all. i still wouldnt like it, if not for the exceptional expansions that address pretty much every flaw (except the ai, which i still find a bit silly, but i find almost all ai flawed) its friendly and fair to the new civ players, and has enough content to keep the veterans occupied. i especially loved the scenarios.",1
"i try to be friendly but then i end up conquring the world. 10/10",1
"seemed boring at first, but then i actually started to play it it slowly became more intense as i built my first death robot, i was like wtf.11,,1. on a serious note really good game, recomend getting gold version, (i thought i bought it but apparently not)",1
"oh man. 10/10 soon ill nuke england. gg washington founded buddhism.",1
"as of this writing, i have played 430 hours of this. feel the satisfaction conquering the fictional world that you dont get in the real world where the most you conquer is getting out of bed in the morning and gathering the strength to go to work.",4
"robert e. lee spawned as a great person for korea. 10/10 would question my history degree again.",1
"this is no game. it is a time warp. apparantly i have 91 hours played. it feels more like 10-20. you have been warned.",2
"if you are going to play with your friends and if you have lots lots of time and if you like strategy games ( turn based), just buy it. one of the best games you can buy.",1
"murdered nobunaga as senator armstrong from metal gear rising. then got nuked by ghandi. 10/10",1
">dont know jack about civ >buy steam sale >play 3 multiplayer games >mfw 14 hours >11/10 would buy again",1
"really really fun, especially if you can play multiplayer with friends :)",1
"this game is great, hours of entertainment, beware giving uranium to gahndi destroyer of worlds",1
"ghandi pointed a nuke at me and told me to rate this game good. 10/10, would nuke again.",1
"a new twist on an old classic, civilization v brings a whole new experiance to the civ series, be it leaders, or gameplay in general civ v is worth a try.",1
"holy crap this is fun archers op 10/10 would nuke everyone again",1
"an amazing game, super fun even with friends! if you like domination, and power, this is a game for you!",2
"this game feels like every single game in this series has been building up to this- all the positives of the series and none of the negatives. some say it has faults- and it does- but it is regardless my personal favourite civ game yet.",4
"such a fun tb game to play. if you like playing turn based strategy games, obliterating enemies, or just want to try something new, civ v is the game to play!!!",1
"the pricing structure for this dlc is so bad, i want to cut my eyes out. buying two expansions is more expensive than the game, and the $120 worth of dlc. i cant even....",1
"civilization is one of those games that will never get old. for strategy fans this game is a must-have, and with all of the maps, civilizations, steam workshop items, and competitive multiplayer, this game will continue to suck up all of your freetime for years to come. civlilization 5 is easily one of the best strategy games that i have ever played (its up there with the original supreme commander and sins of a solar empire). i dont know how many times i have watched the sun set, loaded up a new game of civ, finish the game, and then stand up and strech while i watch the sun rise. i have discovered very few bugs/glitches, and really dont have anything bad to say about this game. easily 10/10 for me.",3
"this game is absolutely great. the best turn based game ive played",1
"one of, if not the, best civ games to come out. the updated combat system make the game more interesting. also the dlc is well worth it. just make sure you dont have anything that needs to be done in the near future once you make the plunge! ...one more turn...",1
"the best turn-based strategy game of all time. period.",1
"an extensive and deep strategy game that is easy to learn and consistently fun. a large array of content, enhanced by numerous dlc packs, a blast with friends, singleplayer can drag over time. relaxing in times of peace, and thrilling in war.",1
"best turn base game out there if you have all the dlc you will get bored after 500 h +. it is amazing !!!",2
"theres something strangely satisfying about starting out as a village in the middle of nowhere and ending as the industrial power of the world.",1
"my first tbs game absolutely love recommended it to all of my friends. dlc is a must if you want the full experience this game has to offer",2
"ive sunk two hundred and fifty hours into this game and i can say i couldnt be happyer! this is a sold strategy epic well worth the investment. 10/10 edit: as of 25/01/2015 that be 601 hours hun",3
"a great turnbased strategy game, really fun when you get the hang off it.",2
"the later expacks have made the game somewhat intimidating for new players, but youll be playing this game over and over - every time is a different game.",5
"having played civ 4 alot, i did initally really enjoy this game.... but eventually the game got to repetitive for me and after a game you look up at the clock and wonder where did all that time go? the reason fo rthe game getting so long is probably atributed to the amounts of units you aquire by late game, making it almost a chore to move your armies around every single turn!!! all in all its a pretty good game, it just has some glaring flaws that can piss you off after awhile :/",1
"when i try to open it, the game closes and does it over and over again",1
"civilization 5 is a fantastic turn-based strategy game that keeps you playing for hours. its addictive and a must have game.",1
"its civ, 5, which is like 5 civs, you should civ with the 5 civs because its civ, and that is that. really, if you have somehow managed to remain entirely unaware of the civilization series, for what like almost 20 years at this point... just... buy this one and figure it out. the combat and end-game can still be a little tweaky but its still one of the best game archetypes ever created. now if you will excuse me, i have to take one more turn and go to bed..... ...... ...... ...... ...... <alarm clock blares at 7am> ... . .. . damnit! x.x (9.9828471491523902845/10)",1
"decent game where you can kick ceasars or queen elizabeths bottom hard. global domination by military, economical means is my ultimate goal here.",1
"do not purchase this game if you want to do anything else. prepare to wonder where the time went, wonder why you havent eaten all day, and wonder what that stain on your chair is. civ 5 is the ultimate time sink, even more so than any illegitimate children you might have. barbies op.",2
"this game is a fun game for people who likes strategical games.",1
"its like civilization iv, except it has a v instead of an iv. there are a few other changes as well...",2
"each morning, a missionary advertises neon sign. he tells the native population that civilization is fine",3
"base game was okay, but with expansions it became soooooooooooo much better.",2
"this is real value for money i would recommend this to anyone, i would also go as far as to say that it is better that the forth civ which i loved and played for months.",1
"very addictive. i launched a rocket as the mongols in one game and got nuked by the mayans in the next one. then i downloaded a mod and curbstomped the greeks as a country led by akemi homura. none of that makes even the slightest bit of sense, but i love it. some high number/10, excellent game.",3
"this is one of my favourite games it just does everything right in a strategy game",3
"i bought the gold version and my understanding is that when youbuy any games gold version it includes all released dlcs whereas, i bought it and it did not come with all released dlc so therefore i will recommend this because i enjoy it but i will not recommend buying the gold version because it did not come with all dlcs",1
"fun strategic game but takes too dang long to complete a single civlization/game.",1
"one of the best turn-based strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing. whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer, or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player, this is one game that any strategy enthusiast, or, hell anyone strat-curious should check out.",1
"best game ever, i wasnt sure if i would like it as i had not played the earlier versions, but as i had experience with age of mythology and other similar games, this was only 10x better. (though age of myth will always have a place in my heart)",1
"great game, still needs community support in the form of multi player mods.",2
"this game is wonderful, but a major time sink. the only problem i have is that i find it really hard to get into a game file that i have saved, and it usually takes several hours to play a full game, even on your own.",3
"great game worth the money, but you might want to wait for a sale like i did 10/10",1
"i opened the game and didnt close it for the next 10 hrs... this game is awesome! i play alot with 2-3 friends and it is great to just chill with while building your empire and making your grand strategies to take down your enemies. civ 5 has so many different elements to it that it is hard to understand at first if you have not played a civ game before it but when you begin to understand the game you can scratch the surface of what the game has to offer. great game, would recommend playing with friends and getting the brave new world expansion at least.",1
"this game is by far the best game on steam, i enjoy killing ghandi so much that i could possibly be admitted to a psych ward",1
"this is a genuinely great game, and its easy to get into. my only problem with it is that the camera control is a bit awkward if you use a laptop, but apart from that, i havent found any problems with it",1
"endless replay potential hence the ~1000 hours logged... :/",5
"pretty good game. not for anyone who is unable to spend hours planning one move only to lose the game. over all though very fun.",1
"no matter what you do, never trust ghandi!!!!!!!also, every once-in-a-while, check your clock, cause it probbably been a couple days since you started playing. 20/10",1
"its fun, but way to expensive if youre just going to play it single player imo. however playing it multiplayer with your friends is just the best, end of story.",1
"ghandi nuked the  out of me. 10/10 would get nuked again.",2
"i just baught this last week...should of waited. great game if you enjoy taking hours of your day and turning them into a strategically turn-based time killer.",1
"hours and hours of replayability. money well spent",1
"a highly addictive game that youll have difficulty putting down at the end of the day. even the quickest matches take several hours to complete. dont fool yourself into thinking thats bad, though! the more you learn about how to play this amazing simulation game, the harder it is to keep track of the hours passing by. just...one more turn...",1
"not nearly as good as its predecessors, but still an enjoyable diversion. made much better with the gods and kings dlc.",1
"its so much better now than it was at launch. great game to just drop some time into.",2
"this game is great and is fun to play with friends.",2
"i finished 3 games in 56 hours. 10/10 would invade again",1
"what can be said about this game that already has not been said. this is a very fun game that combines the playstyles of boardgames such as risk and settlers of catan. buy this game",1
"this game is one of the best games in my steam library, if i start a game ill probably play for about 9 hours with no breaks (besides the lue) and my friends and i love the  outta this game xd i would definately buy it again if anything happened to it 1010 my favorite game ;)",1
"declared war on ghandi because he wouldnt give me any free horses. 11/10.",1
"cmon. its a civilization game. its a bit meh without any dlc, but wtih brave new world, the game is great.",2
"really good game that after a couple ai levels, challenges you. a bit long but with the brave new world expansion one of the best games ever.",1
"10/10 great game, small bugs that can be worked around or removed with the expansion packs.",1
"amazing game 9/10 would do a world war again and kill brazil first pedro you piece of  >.>",1
"great game, i advise you limit how often you play though. over the summer i torrented it and thats all i played and now plain vanilla civ just seems boring to me. dont be like me. play it in moderation.",2
"you will be assimilated. - me, every cultural victory. i love this game.",1
"brave new world expansion just made this game even better. ever wanted to play and take part in a subtle satire towards western worlds policy of subtle collonisation? finally i can be a coward and hide behind trade sanctions and luxuary bannings. starving millions and salting the earth of my enemies take that darius!",2
"great game overall. takes some time to get to know how to do everything, but it is worth it. once you have learned you will be hooked.",1
"i recommend sid miers civilization v because it is cool and you can learn about historiclal figures.",2
"one of the best games out there, better than civ iii waaay better than civ iv.",1
"fantastic game! if you really like empires and kingdoms this game is for you :) i really recommend this game!",1
"only play this game if you have a lot of patience. good idea and design, but poorly executed. everything seems to take so damn long, and when i finally get up to some good tech, the game clock runs out. 6/10",1
"honestly one of the best games i have ever played. the replayability is unreal. i own the complete version and the dlc just adds so much depth to the game. the only problem i have is how hard mods are to install. pros gameplay ui replayability depth graphics mods (though limited they are there) cons sometimes wish there were more diplomacy options wish i had more control over my citizens sometimes",1
"this game is simply amazing! love it! beat the game 2 on prince, thrice on king , and failed epicaly at godmode. the mechanics and gameplay are immersive and flow like a nose on a cold day. i got a black friday deal that go tme civ 5 and the gold edition for $19.99. () like a boss. the bottom line is, get this fricking game.",1
"noone ever gets good at this game. luck carries them, of that i am convinced. has levelled many a playing-field between friends, and for that, how could i not recommend it. good luck!",1
"amazing game, really! spent so many hours saying just one more turn! ive lost countless hours to this and plenty more to come. keep up the great work firaxis!",1
"overall, this is a really dynamic and great game. i recommend getting the add-ons, as they add depth to the game. the only thing i have against the game is that the maps are so damn small. now i, being a slowroll explorer type, dont like it when i already know what the world looks like in the first couple hundred turns. but overall, a great game.",3
"i recommend the crap out of this game. buying this game is like giving away your soul. great fun. 10/10",1
"i read one review that referred to civ as filling up buckets and that made me think.",1
"the best until beyond earth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"civ v, visually more attractive than previous civs, seems not as immersive and deep. the addition of ranged units that can attack across multiple tiles is nice, the city states and barbarians are interesting. definitely worth picking up this game if you catch it on sale, but when its at full price, stick with previous versions.",2
"still getting to know the game, will post a better review after a couple hundred more hours.",3
"great game easy to get into and yet extremely deep its a game where youre going to have to take risks and rely on the fact that your enemy takes risks, with great planning and organization and strategy needed",3
"this is possibly the best strategy game ive ever played i recommend this game to any and all!",2
"my giant death robot died to a barbarian archer... 10/10 would nuke gandhi again!",1
"a great game and easy to get in to. just dont start on deity if you are new to the civ series. 10/10",1
"very depthful game, worth the money and with so many ways to win and play out your games, youll never get bored. several means of winning, several means of those means of winning, difficulty ranging from a joke to pc defenestration, tons of empires available through dlc, plenty of multiplayer options and amazing visuals, from the world to the leaders. comes with a massive civilopedia explaining everything and in-depth game customization to make whatever you want out of it.",1
"i cant recommend civilization v because it didnt evolve the right way. the gameplay is decent, but could be improved a lot by listening to the community. mods, even interface ones, arent supported in multiplayer. there are a lots of bugs in multiplayer too. and finally, the artificial intelligence is terrible; or to be more precise, the tactical ai is terrible, unable to fight a war decently. there are a lots of good idea and improvements in civ v compared to civ iv, but it doesnt make it a best game. go for europa universalis iv instead.",2
"this game is so addicting... just a sec gotta finish my turn first.... its absolutely amazing, its the best game ive ever played :d (to my opinion then)",3
"wasnt convinced at first but was soon dragged in. engrossing. time flies. 93 hours so far and into my longest game at about 1200 turns. five stars.",2
"i highly suggest you get the gameplay enhancement dlcs for civilization v. do not just buy the raw game. wait for all of them to go on sale as a package then buy them. im a civ fanatic and i have been since the 90s. it is the heroin of games. you will play it past the night and into the morning before you realize the time. the mod community is huge and the options you have to playing a game are immense. however even though it has an absurd amount of depth, it can also be played very casually with a helping holding hand from the game itself for new players.",2
"can lose yourself in gameplay for hours with many interesting scenarios to play out or create for yourself. very nice graphics and soundtrack. go for it.",1
"great strategy game, dare i say unparralled. the hex system is revolutionary and makes for a greater experience, especially in combat. the base game is great, but that said, i could never return to the base game after playing with the two gameplay expansions of gods and kings and brave new world. however, the base game allows for so many different experiences in itself, its still an amazing game on its own feet. the diplomacy is wonderful too, and the ai, especially as the difficulty is raised, react to every action taken by the player, whether it is a good-faith trade or the assembly of troops at the border. ive spent hours on end playing it and my only negative comment is that you cant play it if you have plans that night, because you will cancel those plans. enjoy.",2
"this is an amazing game and it is definitely still my goty, weve played hotseat mode for hours at my friends house. but sadly, after getting my own computer (windows 8) and attempting to start the game, it just closes before i can even get to the gameplay. it is still a very good game though, so rock on firaxis, keep making great games!",1
"civilization v is a massive improvement on civ iv which, despite being a great game, was nowhere near as detailed or graphically pleasing as civ v. come on, its a civ game, of course its going to be great!",3
"pros: great game, and it is lots of fun, has tons of hours of play time. cons: a few small things that are annoying in certain situations.",1
"the only problem i ever had with civ 5 was that the multiplayer tends to lag super hard even over local networks. the single player is next flawless though.",1
"i started facism in america while germany was practicing democracy. 97% will approve.",1
"invaded the u.s. with an army of roman giant death robots. 11/10 would declare war again",1
"i downloaded a hitler mod from the workshop(addons that are free and take seconds) and his relgion judaism 10/10",1
"probably the best strategy game ive ever played.its the most fun when youre playing with friends.some problems with multiplayer.9.5/10. also, evil gandhi, catharine and alexander.",1
"cant get enough of this game. any strategy fan out there really needs to give this game a chance. it goes on sale all the time, so pick it up!!",1
"so many hours gone, because you just need 1 more turn. first time i played all of the sudden it was 4 in the morning. the variety makes it a new challenge everytime.",2
"fantastic! a very in-depth game with a variety of ways to win. you will find yourself in many different situations that require decisions that are both difficult and unique.",1
"one of the best games out in a long time. it takes up all of your time, so make sure you have a good 5-12 hours to play.",1
"this is a 4x game about building the biggest and best empire known to man. it is very fun and can/will steal hours of your life away.",1
"this game is highley recommend for any one to who wants to play it",1
"great game, easy to play and very fun. after playing too much it starts getting boring, maybe the multiplayer its a great thing to try. 8/10",1
"countless of hours spent on this game, one more turn untill you fall over your pc. worth the money. and its a game you will always come back to to play a round of. i remember when i just got it, belive i did a all nighter. :)",2
"addictive, easy to pick up, and more than worth the price in the hours youll get out of it.",1
"i have loved and played civ for many years now. this one, they changed it so much!!! its difficult to get into it at first, particularly when used to the other game play. still an amazing game though!",1
"best strategy ever, best in the series. p.s. oh, wait, just one more turn...",2
"buy it, its worth every cent, you will have endless hours of fun trying to conquer the world and being the best civilization ! :)",1
"ive spent hours on this game - its great. you can build  and go to war with people or be all diplomatic. great way to kill time with some buddies.",1
"feeling as though i am in a time portal with this game start playing at 8 in the evening and finish at 10am. could of sworn i was only at the game for an hour!!!",1
"this game shows thing that happen in the past, the present and the future which you can combind many stragtegy to win over your enemies.that include be common enemy to someone or make the alliance to overthrow the most powerful player from his seat of this game which can be done throught many ways either direct or from the way that they would never notice what coming for them.",1
"best. game. ever. watch out for ghandi he is evil though.",1
"this game takes up all of my free time. 10/10 would recommend.",2
"this is my favourite game at the moment, and has been for quite some time!",1
"emmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm i like this game its good graphic if you like strategy you must try this game :)",1
"ive never seen a game that is so good at coming up with stupid ways to completely screw you over, no matter what you do, something will spawn or appear or disappear and you will be screwed, every time, without fail",3
"just by looking at my play time of this game, youd think i would be biased. youre likely correct, however the satisfaction you recieve from pilaging pocatello, racing rameses ii, exterminating elizabeth and angering attila are but a few of the unique moments found in civ. i highly recommend any new faces to civ v to grab the gold edition, as it fills gaps that are otherwise very dry gameplay wise, whereas brave new world ups the complexity even further then what it initally is. one final warning, dont let gandhi get nuclear weapons. he will use them with no predjudice.",2
"i like it but every time i play, i just wants me to play age of empires more.",1
"the most addictive game i have ever played. 100% would recommend, but clear your schedule.",1
"ive found a problem with the game i cant click on the help menu or the menue or add to the que or do anything with other people not even click an anwser whe nthey offer something like a declaration of freindship so my game will get stuck and i have to close it any idea why this is happening? i use linux by the way and i think this might be something with just my comp. im not sure though",1
"definetly one of the best statagy civilization games out there. but you need the dlcs that go with the game, they make the game sooooo much better :)",1
"with almost 200 hours on record, i can say this is one of my favorite games to play. i made sure to have all my friends buy it so we could enjoy another beautiful, and sometimes very very competitive and intense, game together. while it didnt quite get stale, it just sometimes felt a little repetitive. then i discovered the dlcs for civ 5 and my loe began again. now to begin my next 100 hours of creating memorys to last me forever! amazing game!!",1
"a really fun game to play if you dont mind slow paced games that can take quite some time. the best part for me is that you can make your empire big and then crush your foes like small insects under a boot.",1
"one of my favorite games, never get bored of it! 10/10",1
"the gameplay is quit bareboned without the dlcs. ai is plain stupid even on hardest dettings.",1
"if you like strategy and board games then this is for you. outstanding title.",1
"it was very fun and it imbrases that its amazing stragie game and i look forward to evry turn.",1
"amazing game! ive been playing games of the civilization series since civilization 2 on pc and snes, and this has all the magic of its predecessors. very smooth gameplay and interface with regular updates via expansions and dlc. this game brought me to steam.",4
"ive started from civilization 1, then 2,3,4 and now 5. alone civ5 has lack of religion and more trade/politics options but still good game, with brand new world dlc, fantastic game.",1
"fun game both as a single player and multi player! expect to put a few hours in at the very least. its addiciting, you wont be able to pull away.",1
"this is probably the best turn based game out there. never attempt to play before bed.",1
"9/10 accurately shows how many world leaders live 5000 years",1
"spent playing this for some time and none of it make me regret it. awesome game with the expansions and especially the brave new world addition. the mods are great aswell which can buff up the barbarians and add more worlds or terrian from shows and things like got (game of thrones) or skyrim. check this game out and definitely buy it with the expansions!",1
"if you like turn-based strategy games you should have it already",1
"great historical turn based strategy game, recommend if you like this genre.",1
"a turn based strategy game, civilization v continues the classic civilization series.",1
"you ask yourself if you should buy this game. you buy this game based on a reccomendation. you open game. then the next twelve hours of your life on gone, never to be seen again.",1
"this game is one of my favourites of all time. having racked up plenty of game time, its clear, from my point of view, that the game is addicting and will chew through hours and hours of your free time once you start playing. 10/10, would buy.",3
"honeslty, with all the expansions, who wouldnt own this game?",2
"i played civ ii when i was a 13 years old child, and i still remember these long, sometimes even overnight sessions ;). i skipped civ iii and iv, as i was always feeling of it being the same than before, but then i found civ v on steam winter sale and bought it. and it still feels like in my memories. so one might say that there wasnt much innovation, but when civ wasnt played a long time ago or civ hasnt been played at all this feeling of growing a nation and becoming more and more powerful is still great. and still it produces the same one more round feeling as always before. personally i recommend civ v to everyone who hasnt played civ at all or where it has been a while. for the ones who played iii and iv i have the feeling that its still the same.",1
"great game. it is accomidating to both beginners and veterans alike. looking for hours, and hours, and more hours of replay value, this is a great option. and who doesnt love a good sid meier game?",1
"awesome strategy game, one of the best ive played so far. first, when i entered the game, i was quite confused with bunch of options, but after a while, things had more sense. the game was made perfectly, with no errors at all, for both, singleplayer and multiplayer. battles, science, culture, wonders, religions, maps, characters, bonuses, expansions, all of them are harmonized magnificently. playing with friends is exciting, 6 hours marathon escalates quickly. at the end, just one more info, ive been playing civ5 for almost 7 months and even now, i feel no boredom while playing :) 10/10",1
"one of the best ones, not as good as civilization ii multiplayer gold edition, but still a good game.",3
"this is the most addictive game ive ever played. the relationship you have with other civs is complex and rewarding to those who try to be a good diplomat. unfortunately, civs sometimes do things randomly and ruin relations with other civs because of it. the game demands for planning and careful thought for each turn. this is not a fast pace game. it is for those who like to micro-manage and work best at a slow pace. future plans for your empire and war with another will always have you chanting just one more turn.",2
"fun game, great strategy elements and combat elements. its very awesome to watch your small settlement grow over thousands of years into a world power (or fail trying). very highly recommended, just make sure you have a few hours set aside when you play. they forgot to put for min sys req: 8 hours for game session.",1
"good game nice replayabilty and nice military dictatorships =d",2
"i have already played this game for 5 hours and i started playing last night. your first game is going to be a bit tricky, because you have to learn all the symbols and figure out how to maneuver, but after a few hours it gets really fun. with some games, i would have already gotten bored, but there is so much content that i doubt i will ever be bored with this game.",1
"its civilization, the latest edition. the civ ais all seem pretty similar, and politics means jack. expect every world leader (except maybe one or two) to constantly lie to you. they will form a city near you, then complain to you that youre building cities to close to their territory. the politics actually reminds me a lot of alpha centauri. just expect a fight, constantly. get as many of the city states on your side as possible, its the best way to stay ahead. i did manage to surround germany with submarines while i was poland and constantly lied about not worrying about the buildup of troops near the borders. felt a little poetic when i just invaded because i felt like it.",1
"ive never been to turn based rts, but this... this is a whole new level of rts. i played civ iii for a short time, than lost several years with iv and now im loosing my precious free time even more. im also looking forward to beyond earth, but it wont have the classical touch. great game! ps: never trust ghandi, he is... just dont.",1
"played japan and was a war-mongering warlord, then later became a science desired nation. everyone even the city states declared war on me. but its okay because when i have guns and infantry units they have basic warriors. they all sent peace treaties :) i rate 11/10 would laugh my  off again.",1
"forgot to save. would play it all over again. 10 out of 10.",1
"this game is awesome. i would recomend to all ages. keep up the good work civ fans!",1
"ive lost all my friends and its completely worth it.",1
"go from being great friends to ing hating eachother. would recommend",1
"just pure awesomeness... havent been so addcited to a game since pokemon.",1
"i am the god king of all races, bow before me! a damn fine successor to the franchise.",2
"do not buy this game if you have anything you want to achieve. it will consume you",1
"that grin that ghandi has, is the grin of no mercy.",1
"good strategy game. very enjoyable experience and you really do feel like youre building a civilization. my only complaint is that the war system is lacking and the tile system limits a lot of the gameplay. however, the game knows this and makes up for it with various in-game features. definitely recommend. for a clearer decision, i recommend looking at some gameplay.",1
"great game with the exception of a few minor annoying features such as no unit stacking.",5
"great soundtrack, has some sense of education to it for people who are vaguly interested in history. obviously if you play with ghandi he will be historically accurate and stock up on nucleur warheads and put the entire world consisting of 3 continents into a cold war or m.a.d. and when you play as venice make sure you become a real life banker and get loads of bonuses and make sure everyone is denpendant on you for their economy. also the multiplayer experience is not that bad the connections between players can be dodgy so frequent saving is an order, and combat is ok despite the quick animations. if you dont have this game....get it on sale or wait until the next civ gme in a few months....listen to your advisors....exept your military one...dont be like me",3
"super fun strategy game. ive played a lot of strategy games trying to find one that satisfies and i keep coming back to this one. the only dlc that i purchased was the brave new world and it has pretty much everything i needed.",1
"i recommend this game for my friend rey the game is amazining and very strategic 10 cats out of 10 dogs would play if intoxicated",1
"amazing, territorial expansion is slower than civ 4 but it is still great.",1
"its quite good, but without both major dlcs the game isnt as good as the other civ titles.",4
"probably the best strategy game ive ever played.its the most fun when youre playing with friends.some problems with multiplayer.9.5/10. also, evil gandhi, catharine and alexander.",1
"have you heard your friends talk about strategy? have you wanted to play it but never found an introductory game? then this game is for you! be any civilization you like, go through different eras, create various cities and get nuked by ghandi! all the fun in one game! (gods & kings and/or brave new world make it so much more fun!)",1
"amazing and fun strategy game! only the best can win it all!",1
"11 hour games... just did 3 in a row. loved every second of it. wtffff this game too addicting",1
"if you are looking for a fun, creative, and awsome game, you have found it! this game is well worth the money. i recomend it. 5/5 stars!",1
"amazing and very fulfilling game, and not too complex.",4
"great game with dlc that actually changes how you play.",2
"this is hands down the best game i have ever played. tons of replayability with all the different civilizations available in just the base game, but gods and kings and brave new world are a must just for the addition of tourism, religion and espionage.",2
"10/10 would nuke civs three eras behind in technology again!",1
"this game is awesome if you love controlling a nation and turn based strategy games. it can alos teach you alot in the games civilopedia. if you prefer fast paced games this isnt really your game, but if you like patient games that require you to strategize this is your game to play. steam workshop adds alot of cool stuff to the game and if you have the expansions such as brave new world or gods and kings then the games depth and amazingness increases triple fold.",1
"great fun at some points and a tad dry in others. best at sapping away at your day without you even noticing, especially since a standard match tends to last around 15-20 (or more) hours.",1
"each civ game adds enough features to give the feeling of a new game, while still holding onto the civilization familiarity that weve all loved for decades.",3
"ill be going to bed soon honey! just one more turn!",1
"one of my favourite strategy games, sometimes its all in your favor, other times you are getting  on. 10/10",1
"its civ. you just take a couple of . . . its civ. 92%",1
"this is one of the greatest games ever made. for anyone who likes startegy games this is the game for you!",1
"this game has very fun, addictive, and well polished gameplay that makes you play for hours on end without realizing it. i recommend getting either or both of the expansions for the game, as they both improve the gameplay greatly.",2
"got nuked by ghandi, ending my 5-hour peaceful victory attempt. would recommend.",1
"civilization v is a great game that really lets you play however you want. its also great if you want to rip apart any friendships that you have. in all seriousness though, get it, if you have the cash.",1
"b-17 and nuke raid alexander while he has spearmen. 5 stars.",1
"very boring game. it does not have the splendorous and enjoyability of his predecessors. i do miss the time when games were more than graphics or animation, those who played civilization 2, for example, may be able to understand it. the advisors were real animations, there were videos for the wonders and so on... okay, what you did not have on graphics you had on creativity. i really miss these times, sierra and all.",1
"this game will suck your life away. right through your . like satans vacuum cleaner. 10/10 would buy again",1
"amazing game, can get you fixed for hours just building your cities up and dominating all opponents. the multiplayer is really fun too, not knowing what your friends are up to just teases you as you create your civilization.",1
"my alltime favorite strategy game. i start a game and it ends up being the next day in what feels like minutes so be wary of time my friends! - xeph 9/10 strategy is fun for me",2
"good game but a little hard for beginners but if you know how to play and stuff it w ill turn out to be 1010 recommend this game.",1
"before you purchase civ 5 weigh the pros and cons--- cons- -your job may be lost, from lack of productivity due to day dreaming of civ5, or worst case, youll be fired for job abandonment. -your pets may die from starvation, unless they are resourceful and can find an alternative food and water source. -your sex life may suffer, unless youve already gone celibate, or have a partner that also plays civ and will indulge you by the computer(yea right) -you will lose friends (diplomatic friendships in game dont really count) -you will see hexs in your sleep -bathing and personal hygiene are no longer priorities -getting good grades -going outside and seeing the sun(can be supplemented by vitamin d) -using your legs. if these things dont bother/offend/apply to you, then yes immediatly purchase and play.",1
"tried it. not my sort of gameplay at all. i thought it was going to be like crusader kings 2 or either age of empires 3. dissapointing.",1
"i loved it however this is simply my kind of game. the game practically plays itself considering its turn based you only have a few decisions to make then its up to the computer. so it probably will be boring at times.",3
"addicting strategic gameplay that we keep you involved through all ages of civilization.",1
"when people point to console exclusives and say the pc doesnt have any i simply point to civilization v, the civilization series is the best strategy franchise ever. youll feel like an evil mastermind as you plot world domination, and the expansion packs gods and kings, as well as brave new world bring new life to an old game.",2
"8.7/10 im civ fan since civ 4. civilization v has a huge potential and its easy to get addicted to one more turn. in this game is always something to do, but play at big map after 100 turns can make gameplay slow :( ... so play in bigger maps req more fast cpu and better graphic card. civilization v is the revolution? rather not, but its one of best games of last years.",1
"whilst this is simpler than civ 4 (especially with all the beyonf the sword expansion) it is more enjoyable to play and retains the depth",2
"my advisor told me to make friendly status with atilla. so naturaly atilla attacked and beated up living soul out of me... history learned us one thing: history is written by victor and those who has bigger stick. but this civ made it quite bit far from original civ game so you are able to win here in other way, not only war. make science, trade, do politics, raise your culture and make other countries jellous. what you get for any price with this game is what will last to you for many years. just enjoy the complexity and make your nation proud!",1
"you can nuke george washington as augustus caesar. :)",1
"if your into civ then buy it. i find it boring until the fit hits the shan, then its just frustrating.",1
"next to super smash bros. best way to show your friends whos boss.",1
"i never thought i would say the words gandhi is a  until i played this game.",1
"i am addicted to this game and love playing it. the combat is turn based but i love it anyway and i cant get over the city building idea. i enjoy the easy setup for multi-player and play regularly. the race for the wonder is amazing when all your friends are rushing the same wonder and well all finish at the same time, but wait he just got more production points hes going to win. this game is for all ages above 10 and is always great for multi-person games. i recomend to all civ building fans out there and even if you are not one yet. pass on the recomendations to your friends and families! have fun ;) i would rate this ****** (6) stars",1
"very good game! i normally dont play these type of games but i had the chance of getting it for free from someone and i said why not. i havent looked back since because this games gameplay although challenging at first and very complex to understand again at first in time becomes very useful and although i dont have brave new world, i did manage to get the gold edition upgrade recently and have discovered that getting dlc for once changes the game alot even with the ui which i find every game should do and would actually justify buying dlc now.",1
"i... cant... stop... pleae help me. just one more turn.",3
"one of the best games ever played, is so fun with friends but is also fun on single player. the long hours put into one game makes it very rewarding once the game has finally finished what i love about this game.",1
"the best turn-based strategy game ive played. deep, and every dlc pack adds enough to make it feel like a new game. well worth the price, especially when on sale!",1
"my eyes hurt . i havent been outside for days .but my empire is happy so i got this going for me which is nice",1
"america was the founder of the shinto religion. 11/10 would get annexed by native americans again.",1
"probably one of the best tbss ive ever played. definitly an improvement and a new wrinkle since the third installment which i also own. some of the new mechanics make it really interesting and im also glad to see the days of a warrior beating a tank are over. very nice.",3
"one of the best turn based fps games: good story, use of cover system, no scope, rekt m8.",2
"an improved hexagonal movement/combat system as well vastly improved graphics, a new interface, and a diverse technology tree makes this a worthy entry in the civilization series. its not terribly different from previous titles, but the improvements made are welcome, and its just as addictive as ever.",1
"this game will challenge your perception of yourself. starting as gandhi does not stop me from unleashing nuclear armageddon upon the rest of the world. whats wrong with me? 10/10",1
"this game is addicting, the only thing i wish they would fix is increased movement and range as you advance through the ages",2
"the only reason i stopped playing, and the reason why i will not install this game again is because im afarid ill just wont stop playing. ever.",1
"this is by far one of my favorite pc games of all time. the reason i think this game is so good is that it never really gets boring, there are so many mods for the game, and its so dynamic, its just really hard to get actually bored of this game. to top it off, it has great graphics, which in all honesty arent really required for a game like this. i might be a bit biassed of course since i love all of sid meiers games, but this one really takes the cake, i would recomend buying this game to all of my friends.",1
"so i owned this game for about 6 months before i started playing it. i have fallen in love with this game, whether because i feel like a badass when i crush each little city-state, or because dido is one hot mistress, im not sure. but i would definitely recommend this game to anyone that likes to feel like a badass, and play like a cheat. this game is also a good way to get your brain into a very strategical mindset. after 150 or so hours of playing, im sure i could be a 5 star general. in short: buy this game. stock up on extra food first.",1
"great game for anyone who likes strategy games. varying difficulty choices allows for beginners and the challenge seeker. hundred of combinations between rulers and land masses make it almost impossible to play the same game twice. multiplayer just adds to the fun. playing with friends (or backstabbing friends) never gets old as you play your new favroite strategy game!",1
"this game is the most addicting game i have ever played. warning do not enter if you plan to be out anytime soon.",1
"best turn based strategy of this generation. challenging for most.",1
"youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you, but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter. 20/10",1
"a great game that really is replayable. brilliant with friends and i really recommend the gods and kings and brave new world expansions they really help expand the game especially later into the game.",3
"amazing the first few playthroughs, then it gets boring. absolutely awful replayability. still probably worth getting if its on sale, but dont expect to be playing more than a few games.",1
"i would recommend the game, cause it is hours and days of fun. as for steam... it sucks with the logging in to their system. also they make it hard to do any upgrades. so unless youve got about a day to screw around with them having you log into their system.",5
"civ 5 is great. with dlc, you see, buy the golden pack, and brave new worlds, then it will be worth your time. absolutely. a fantastic grand strategy. the base game is alot worse than civ 4. so, with expansion pacs, absolutley, its fantastic, without. no. dont.",1
"no baba yetu, no wonder project animations, no leonard nimoy. dont get this garbage. civilization 4 was much better buy that instead.",1
"this game is fun to play when your trying to burn time",2
"using mods, i can have big boss as a jedi conquering the world using culture whilst up against blasto the hanar, hatsune miku, cthulu and canada. best game",1
"civilization v: complete edition is a rich and deep strategy experience that will entartain you for hours and hours to no end. you will always want to press the next turn button....so prepare to say goodbye to any social life you might have had because it belongs to civilization v now.",2
"youll see true nature of yourself and your friends. 9/10 will play from time to time with friends.",1
"been playing civilization since the first one and they just keep getting better.",3
"the addition of the hex grid map and the removal of stacking units makes planning military campaigns a much more interesting challenge. the addition of policies also makes this game very intriguing, as you can choose to build up your strengths or overcome your weaknesses. the civilizations are also much more defined in their play style, and having an ai that plays the civilizations as they were led makes for a much more memorable game.",1
"this game is just plain fun. i love the turn based strat. gives me time to plan and scheme my way to victory. you can win many different ways too. not just domination. can win with science victory, diplomatic victory. cant stop playing.",1
"very good game and it never gets boring played 24 hours strait plus food breaks",1
"a thinking mans game. plenty of options for winning with different play styles and pregenerated leaders/characters to experiment with, very enjoyably time consuming!",3
"they declared war on me because i tresspassed their borders once some millenias ago. good times. surely recommend. 10/10 would play again.",1
"i love this game! its very realistic, allows you to change history with each action in each time period or stick to the books on what really happened in the past. the various ways to win the game gives a lot of choice in how you want to become the greatest civilization in history. there are a ton of mods that add many new ways to play aqnd win. also you can invite friends and have massive battles or simply be peaceful with more then 10 players. overall this game is amazing and is 5 out of 5.",3
"this game. over 100h and it still isnt old. buy it now, or feel the wrath of firaxis",1
"this game, this game... the game itself is brilliant, with so many different ways of doing things and dlc only makes it better. the civilopedia is really accurate and non-biased, the same goes with gameplay and the ai. over all this game is brilliant and i wont stop playing for a long time.",1
"well, there goes hours of my life that i could have spent doing something useful. jk it was totally worth it! i like watching the comps try to make peace treaties with me as i walk over their countries with giant death robots! now all i need to do is get the futuristic one, whatever its called :. 10/10 would kill city-states again.",2
"i had played civilization iv and had loved it instantly. later, when civ v released, i used to dismiss it as hex tiles and stuff, until i played it with all expansions. its the best game from the series in my opinion. :)",1
"civilization v is a drug addiction. 10/10 would get addicted to again.",3
"day killer. extremely fun, but it takes forever to play!",1
"fun strategy game. while there are some minor bugs and glitches, as well as some minor annoyances, there is still that just one more turn play that has been with the civilization series. the game looks great, and allows many playstyles. just be aware of sometimes scumbag ai, happiness issues, and most of all, be prepared for the long haul. one game ive been playing accounts for roughly 15 hours of my playtime, and im only about 75% done with it. this is on standard time and map size, and normal difficulty. but anyways, great game, highly recommended.",5
"you will start playing this game at 4pm next thing youll know its 4am. this game is awesome and while its not fast paced its a great attention holder. just dont play it if you have importain things to do the next morning.",1
"fantastic. the streamlining they did hooked me right back into the franchise. i cant say a bad thing about the game, except maybe dealing with ghandi; stop denouncing me!",2
"just got the brave new world dlc and i didnt think they could make an already awesome game any better but, they sure found a way and i dont know how i ever liked the game without these new features. it added so much depth and more to do that it feels natural and that it just belongs there.",1
"amazing game alot better than i thought it would be. a must buy!!!",1
"its a great game full of adventures and upgrades. you can research really excisting projects and monuments. it looks a bit like age of empires ii, but i think this game is more fun (and more expensive).",3
"this game is just magical, i really enjoy rewriting history:d",2
"an amazing turn-based stratagy game that will have you saying just one more turn late into the night.",1
"buy this game, and give it a chance. a couple of hours in, and you will be addicted. when youve reached the addicted-stage, it can last for hundreds and hundreds of hours. when the addiction slowly disappears, the game will still continue to give you a fair amount of entartainment for the years to come.",1
"liked the other civilization games? this one follows the same basics but with new rules. i think its an upgrade but a lot has changed from civ 4.",2
"dis gam so gud! u can lyk b a hella craze guy lyk mongols or evn lyk gandi who is actly dik hed! hela tite yo!",1
"very addictive game which will keep you entertained for hundreds of hours! will also significantly improve your knowledge of history.",1
"the game overall is fantastic! but does need a good pc to actually play without lag. but overall 5/5 on gameplay and enjoyment! cant wait for civ 6",2
"oh the days ive wasted away on this game... honestly one of the best games to kill time. you literally have no idea where the time disappears to.",1
"civ 5 is like playing an epic game of chess, with more than 2 players, dozens more pieces and nukes. add a side of diplomacy and espionage, to top it off with some awesome strategy sauce.",1
"civ v is one of those games that you start playing at 8pm, and are like, alright, ill play till midnight, then stop. next thing you know, you look at the clock and its almost 4am.",1
"played for five hours and i havent even finished the tutorials :d 12/10 would play turorials again.",1
"love this game tons of strategy, tons of ways the game can play out, tons of replayability and full mod support. if your not sure you want to get this game or not, just get it. trust me if you like strategy games you wont regret it.",2
"ive played this game at least 20 times and never finished it. 10/10.",1
"a great turn-based strategy game. this most recent development in the already loved series of nation-builders has added many a new mechanic both to multiplayer and to singleplayer. the hex grid tiles make movement much more dynamic, and the wonderfull city building mechanics bring me back to the older days of civ ii and civ iv. the only downside that i miss is the built-in worldbuilder mode that allowed me to create my own worlds. other than that, civilization v has blown me away with gameplay, the build-your-own-world and create-your-own-nation mechanics, and the great competition that your friends can provide for you in this stunning game. i highly recommend this game...",2
"faptastic however kill ghandi first hes nuke happy jew",1
"just wow. great graphic addicting gameplay and makes you hate ghandi for betraying you",1
"ive never played any of the previous civ games and im a huge fan of catan (a board/online game it reminded me of) so this automatically won me over. civ 5 is more complex than catan in that it has more features to offer and its more organized, less random, and more relaxed whereas you can never predict what your opponents are gonna do in catan so it gets pretty intense. you play a historical leader (each civ comes with perks) and choose how you interact with other leaders and their civilizations. you can build whatever you want, from armies to cities, as the technology and resources become available to you throughout the centuries. its addicting and so much fun; i can only imagine the shenanigans and how awesome itd be to get a group of friends to play. plus im really diggin a lot of the references made with the achievement names. cant believe i didnt get into this sooner.",1
"like turn-based strategy? like age of empires? then this game is for you! its a fun game, even though the ai is a bit off at times, but that wont interfere with the gameplay. with the challenges, there are many different ways you could play, and win. you may declare war on everyone and go for a domination victory, or you can gather enough science to build a spaceship and go for a science victory. its a fun game, and it gets an 8/10.",1
"this is the best game ever made on the planet. period.",1
"they did it again, i strongly believe that the civilization series is one of the greatest works to teach about human history, achievements, our soul, our sins, our philosophy, our politics, our chances and decisions. it should be put on a working machine and send into space to show aliens that we are horrible, but at least we know how to heave fun. and where there is civilization, there is hope.",1
"civ might be a little slow, but that is why you save the game. this game is really great if you have patience. if you dont then well get some because you are missing out.",2
"crashes frequently to desktop, never managed to finish a short game.",1
"steam workshop makes it a whole new gae, i recommend getting the complete edition and downloading some mods, r.e.d is a good one.",2
"in my opinion, the best civ game ever made. you will sink countless hours into this game without even realising it as you tell yourself just one more turn. just buy it now for gods sake.",1
"very addicting game. really intense and i reccomend people buying this game!",1
"a+ material. i love this game, the soundtrack, and how relaxed it makes me. i cant wait for civ 6 if it comes. everybody should get this game. bless sid meiers heart.",2
"the good: thrilling, replayable, unpredictable gameplay. amazing detail and texture. ai difficulty that spans from extremely easy to impossible. many many settings to choose from, customising your gaming experience with ease. extremely friendly to new and experienced civilization players. the bad: none that i can see! () 5/5 xalii3nx",2
"awesome game, i had a 1000 year long war with japan... then i got nukes.....",1
"i love the game but it crashes on me almost every hour...",1
"i have played civilization since the very first one and after spending $60 on this game when it came out i am sad to say i will no longer be playing this series. the best game in the series by far is civilization iv (4). civilization v (5) ruined every aspect of the series that i found entertaining. i cant mass my units, the hex system is a huge bummer, and the game is slow and clunky. they needed wayyy more polish than they were willing to put into it for being a major game series. i read an article online where the lead game designer even admitted that he messed up, which just confirmed what i already know, this game sucks. thanks for ruining my hopes of playing civilization in the future. ps- would love to get my $60 back from this terrible game.",1
"youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you, but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter. 20/10",1
"a good update to a good series. with the brave new world expansion, i think this beats out civ iv, which is no small feat. civ v is a very addicting game and easy to lose track of time in. the game can go many different directions. in addition, the modding community is very strong with a lot of really cool mods.",1
"best by far strategy game ever created, and best civilization game. civilization iv is nothing compared to civilization v on average a game takes about 24 hours to complete on average time setting. there are 8 difficulty levels, 1: settler - 8: diety warning: diety is only for the most harcore gamers. tons of achievments, around 280 in total. steam trading cards are avaliable for this game. got nuked by ghandi even though it was made in 2010 dont let that discourage you from buying it. quality game. create friendships with other civiliztions or go to war with them. remember there are several ways to win. domination victory, cultural victory, science victory (space race) domination victory is the easiest way. can you build a civilization that can stand the test of time? 10/10",1
"i have played the civilization iv as well, and i got to say that this truly beats the iv. i will absolutely recommend this game!",1
"like its predecessors before it civv is another example of just one more turn addiction.",2
"civilization 5 is awesome! from becoming the greatest empire of all time too becoming the greatest military force ever known, cilivilization will keep you entertain hours on end.",1
"this is a great game has some what oof a learning curve but other then that itys great",3
"a game where you spend 10,000 turns and 10 days of your life trying to claim yourself the best civilization of them all... just to get nuked by gandhi. 10/10",1
"amazing game! definetly buy if you can, and every dlc they are all awesome. i think that civilization v + dlcs is better then the new civilization: beyond earth, and if the dlcs wont do it, try mods! als epic.",3
"what can i say? its civilization. you come in for a turn, you stay for the night.",4
"the newest game in the civilization series and the best in my opinion since civ 2.",1
"if you enjoy any turn based strategy games then look no further! for those who played past civ games, you may be dissapointed by some of the new features. civ 5 does a good job introducing new players so the seies, which could be a neggetive affect on civ veterans. all in all, great game.",1
"great game, would reccomend it to anyone who likes both fast and slow statergy games. great mutliplayer and singleplayer you can easily spend a long time in this game.",1
"11/0 would buy again. after saying that i truly enjoy this game its absolutly addicting, and even better with mods and friends. never trust ghandi",1
"this installment brings what feels like a rebalancing of the battle and advancement systems allowing a skilled leader to upgrade their techs before their real world equivellent, before decimating their opponents on the battlefield. as someone who has been playing civilization since the beginning, i really enjoy what theyve done here. my only complaint is that some civs that have been around since the beginning (babylonians and zulus for example) are now dlc if you didnt start out with gold edition.",2
"deeply strategic, great fun with freinds, you will play entire days on it, even better with all the dlc but try to buy it during a sale (its really expensive).",2
"its a very good game. time consumer yes. can take a whole weekend on a single game. not the best when playing only against ai opponents, religion is kind a dumb system if compared to civ iv, also why no technology trading? still i recommend this game.",1
"id like to play a short round of civ v! oh damn, its 2 am and i just played for about 4 hrs.",1
"love it! i have played sid meiers civ since the board game! it seems to just get better and better",4
"if you buy sid meiers dice roller v, youll often find yourself saying,wow, what a great game of dice rolling. if you love dice and want to put a skin on your dice then this is the game for you. a plethora of different situations to roll dice in and an impressive number of civs and units to roll dice as. ill give this handfull of dice an 8/10. -eel",1
"is game with fighting and culture and religion and buildings and farms and roads and walls and pyramid and science is good",1
"poassibly the most addicting game that exists. easy to learn, difficult to master. this edition of sid meiers franchise is the new standard for turn-based strategy.",2
"awesome game!!! love this game and the way it makes you actually create strategies to beat the game. i love the game play and all the characters that you can play as.",1
"amazing game, be wary of getting stuck for hours on end ;)",2
"civilization v is a fantastic game for the turn-based gamer inside everyone. filled with content to the brim and great dlc expansions, this game is a must own.",1
"any one up for 12h+ game? maybe? that said, great game! your best bet is to wait till there is a summer / winter sale to buy the games and dlcs (cheaper 75%) . and as always, watchout for gandhi...",2
"oh god, how long have i been playing this game for?",2
"not much to say other than its a great game. ive spent plenty of hours planning moves, building troops and utterly destroying other colonies and countries. really fun game if you like turn based, strategy games",2
"a great strategy game. i have played this game constantly since i bought it, and have loved it. the dlc expansions add a whole new life to the game, and even without it is fun. be prepared for long games though if doing multiplayer, they can last for 3 hours+.",1
"definitely the best civ game thus far; the combat element is far more tactical when you are restricted to a single unit per tile and dont just end up with a stack of trebuchets like in previous releases. as always, there is a good spread of difficulties to play on, and you should be able to find one to suit you that is sufficiently hard to win against without seeming impossible.",1
"im always resisted playing games like civ because i used to think they where boring or not enough action. man was a wrong, i love this game and it has risen quickly to my top 3 favorite games.",2
"this game is about as boring as they come. i would give this game away for free. ill toss in garbage/nuff said. {end turn}",1
"great game, freaking love it. 9.8/10 lost the 0.2 because ghandi. that mofo!",3
"this is probably a drop in the bucket as far as review for civilization v go, but all the good reviews dont lie. this is really a just one more turn game.",4
"this game is great for strategists. youll sink in hours and hours of time into this game and will never be bored. just one more turn, one more turn. thatll be the chant you repeat everytime you make a move.",1
"only in civ can you be in the future era in 2014. 9000/10",1
"sid meirs civilization v is a easy get to know if your a starter at strategy games. the dlcs add mroe complex things which allows the starter to enchance their experience and become a intermedient. civ v is basically a building block from where you can decide which strategy games you choose in the future that offer more challenging experiences. overall civ is a great game and is highly reccommend if your just getting insterested in stategy. if your a right on pro at strategy games get civ still because why not? greece pwns 10/10",4
"i got three things playing this game. time leap, joint stiffness on my hands and waist and a great fun!",1
"when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold, dyes, and ivory, take my advice. ready all your tanks and nukes, arm them, and shoot them like your life depends on it. they are evil, traitorous demons. never trust them. however, genghis khan is my best friend. he came up to me and was all like, de full do bu la chi mendo. and i said, okay! lets be friends! i can never understand that guy, but something about our relationship just works. ghandi hating simulator 2014 11/10",1
"this game is amazing. even though it has been out for a few years, civilization v is becoming one of my favorite strategy games on steam",1
"civ 5 is a brilliant game. it provides hours of fun and entertainment, takes some time getting used to but when you do you wont stop playing for a while.",1
"a great way to question your trust of your friends as you stab each other in the back , multiple times.",1
"a big huge 4x turn based strategy game from fraxis and 2k games. worth every penny in your bank account or steam wallet. must buy!!!!!!!!!",1
"great game! it blends together strategy, micro-managing, and action, to make the perfect genre!",3
"this game lets you act out your anger on the chinese by building a mass army and taking over their cities and renaming them stuff like land of the small weewees 10/10 goty",1
"just... one... more... turn! >playing for 3 days in a row. no sleep needed.",2
"this game is fun, just like the other civs. i cant wait to play the new one.",1
"it is really fun, although it may look pretty boring, it is actually much more fun than you think. dont judge a book by its cover c:",2
"for the love of god, dont buy this game! youll end up completely without time and the just one more turn... will be your most frequent sentence! not much more needs to be said. maybe that if you feel like buying it, buy the comlete edition. and, of course, that this game is awesome. now, if you excuse me, i think i wanted to play some mass effect and dark souls... but damn it, im gonna end up with civilization again!",2
"one of my favourite games, 200% better with dlc. civ v is totally a game to get",1
"this is an amazing game, would recommend it to anyone.",2
"easily the best turn based strategy game line ever made.",1
"this game is extremely addicting and fun a must buy",1
"took one look at the artwork/graphics and said nah. and that was that for a long time. i eventually gave in to all the hype when it was on sale and omfg, its only like the best grand strategy ive ever played! entire days have been happily lost since.",1
"sid meiers civilization, might be the best game currently available on steam! the a.i is wonderful, and the civs are great! 10/10 highly recommend.",2
"another brilliantly addicting romp through history, sid meiers civilization v builds on the past successes of the franchise and gives a whole new level of detail and gory gregarious beauty. for a real good time, play in slow mode and watch as the world passes you by.",1
"one of the most awesome games ive ever played, extremely addictive... great gameplay and the historical details on units, buildings and civilization leaders makes this game a masterpiece of his kind. the new religion system is an improvement to the one used on civ iv and the battle system is also much better. still, i miss the wonder videos and certain things like corporations that civ iv had.",2
"great 4x strategy game. no matter how many times i play it, it is the one game i always come back to.",3
"260 hours and no sign of stopping.... this is quite possibly the greatest turn-based game ive ever played.",2
"pretty fun for those into strategy games, but will consume hours of your life at a time.",1
"if you are a fan of the civilization games, dont let this game fool you. no you cannot stack units like previous versions, but there is such a layer of depth involving unit placement and strategic attacks that makes this game much more than any civ game that ive ever played. the dlc packs add a new level to this with religion and tourism, but the multiplayer aspect does need some work. mostly the connections can be quite bad. so save often if you are hosting.",1
"a wonderful game. very detailed. have played it regularly for for a couple of years.",1
"explore, expand, conquer and then stomp on the romans with a giant robot and nuke the americans just because you can. worth every penny.",1
"very good game if you like risk then you will like this game",1
"this is civilisation! intitally i couldnt get into the hex grid which was a departure from the earlier games. however after a while i barely noticed it. the expansions have only added to this. if you havent played this by now and it is your type of game then you need to own this. (and what is wrong with you?) get it at any price.",2
"this is a great game, nuff said. there are hours of fun awaiting you if you pick this up. not for the faint of heart.",5
"this is by far one of the best games i have ever played. do you enjoy taking over the world with: - force - science - religion - tourism - culture - diplomacy yeah...this is definitly the game. you can play it over and over again wining the game in many different ways and playing as so many different civilizations. the online multiplayer is excellent, although at times can be a little glitchy. i highly recommend the expansions. i have only played with gods and kings, but plan on getting brave new world as well.",1
"addicting game that will get you playing for hours, dont let the graphics fool you although its not much the gameplay hooks you up into a whole new level",1
"civ 5 is one of my favorite strategy games to play. it can be challenging to learn but once you learn to play itll be hard to stop. it hols a wide array of options and ways to play. with this game youll hardly feel bored.",1
"ia have some problems, but, its civ, its cool, is amazing, maybe the best strategy game ever made. so, buy the game, make they profit so they can make the civ 6",1
"great game, hours of fun building societies and crushing others.",1
"no such thing as a quick game. you have been warned",1
"one of the best games i have ever played. buy it now!",1
"excellent game. you will lose sleep playing this game. good repeatability and re-playability. one of the best games ive owned. expansions are actually old fashioned expansions as they add to the original game.",3
"ayy lmao, this game yer, is one of de_hecticest gameys that ive played, it is full on with explosions and gunfire. i might even join the war sometime because of this gamym. 8/8 m8",1
"great game and definately very happy, as always from the civ franchise. the new features are definately a great addition to the franchise and the dlcs definately dont disappoint either! definately worth a buy.",2
"civilization v hits the spot if you want turn based strategy on a global scale. best civilization game to date and still. sid meier and his team have made a must play game.",2
"time to go to bed,... just one more turn,... and you see the sun rise again. 10/10",1
"great game! needs some work with online play, but other then that pretty good. best strategy game out there",2
"great game would recommend its beyond earth with more content",1
"one of the finest strategy games around! the replay value is huge and each game can suck many hours out of you life. theres this just one more turn virus which is unique to the series, this game has it too. there are many different civiliztions to choose from and the game is very flexible, by that it is both friendly to new players while still offering challenge to veterans. theres a huge modding community for this game which makes the game even better. if you bring a friend or two, you wont feel how time flies as you play, the multiplayer is also great and there are many people playing it. overall, if you are a strategy fan, this is a must buy!",3
"i highly recommend this game, one match could keep you entertained for hours!",1
"just one more turn... completely losing track of time is a pretty strong indication of whether a game is good in my book, and civilization 5 may be the best by that metric. as a newbie to the civ series, managing a society through the ages had sounded a bit daunting, but thankfully the game is very intuitive for series beginners. the visuals, narration, and music are all pitch-perfect, evoking a grand ambience fit for a game about world conquest. individual games can take hours, but it never feels tedious or repetitive. computer opponents seem to have plenty of personality, and multiplayer with friends is a blast. i realize turn-based strategy games may not be for everyone, but it would be difficult for me to find someone i wouldnt recommend this game to.",1
"this game is pretty rad, but only comparable to civ4bts with all the expansions. best wait for a sale on the whole package beore picking up, kek",1
"even though the game is fun as is, adding the gods and kings dlc will enhance the gameplay to more interesting levels.",1
"fun game to play alone or with friends. few improvements needed for the ai when playing against computers but still, i played many exciting hours. multiplayer is a bit tricky as one game can last many/many/many hours. all players have to be available at the same time. i recommand this game. you can start playing alone but then play with friends and your alliance will give the game a new dimension.",3
"great game to start into the franchise even if youve never played previous installments. i would also recommend getting the expension as it fixes a lot of minor inconvenience from the main game. pros - interesting unique ability from each civ - smart different type of ai (conqueror passifism etc) - each game is different from the last playthrought - more to come con - once you become too aggressive, there is no redeeming yourself - no defense against certain things (ie : atomic weapon) - ai is smart, but single minded, they should change with time",3
"such a fun tb game to play. if you like playing turn based strategy games, obliterating enemies, or just want to try something new, civ v is the game to play!!!",1
"i absolutly love it!! just such a superb commbination of stratagy, history(sort of) and city domination. in my opinion brave new world has just made civ 5 even better with the addition of great people, better trading, and more civs.",1
"civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have ever played. its awesome! :d",1
"love it and its intention. if its intention was education and enjoyment ,i rate civ 5 as n#1",1
"get the game if youre patient. also, taking over cities is the best part >:)",1
"absolutely amazing game especially with brave new world as well i recommend this to any turn-based strategy fan or just a strategy fan.",1
"one of the best turn-based strategy game :d buy it and then mod it!!!",3
"another game of the category why is the sun rising already?. this is not a fast-paced game, you can easily sit there for ten hours straight and enjoy the calming, yet epic music. of course it lacks the historical background of total war or europa universalis, but it gives you an entirely different sort of satisfaction to build your empire from scratch, to place every single city. you have to consider strategical positions, ressources, farmland - and all that while your civilization advances from dusts of the ancient era to the invention of the internet. the diplomacy of a multiplayer game is much more fun than reading game of thrones, but you can always try to achieve your goals peacefully (except when you live next to gandhi).",3
"just play it. no words can describe this game. just. play. it.",1
"a classic, cant go wrong with this. i just wish more people played it. sure, the graphics arent the greatest. it is however fun. very versatile in game play and style. build up armies, make treaties, beat people down, build em up,  em off and then be at war with the world. its great, fun, learn cultures, and history all at the same time while having fun. what more could ya ask for ?",2
"civilization v is probably the best balance of in depth customization mixed with easy accessablility. it can be as hard as you want it to be, or it can be very easy to allow you to learn the mechanics. ive played through a few games, and im very impressed with the way this game feels and plays. i know when it comes to civilization games, nostalgia runs wild and everyone always thinks the older ones are superior. but i honestly think, combined with at least the gods and kings expasion, this is the best civilization game to date. if youre interested in this game, you have to at least get the gold edition. this game feels pretty incomplete without the gods and kings expansion, but with it, it feels perfect. i havent gotten brave new world, but i hear it is amazing. anyway, civilization v is highly recommended by me, and should be picked up by any strategy/civilization fan.",1
"this game may literaly be my favorite turn based stratagy and i play it more than any of my other games on here or on my xbox/ps4. i like this game because its so interactive, you can just get so into andaddicted to this game in such a short amount of time. what i dislike is how the dlc is lik $30 thats silly that just as much as the game costs maybe even more than the game but they are worth it nontheless.",2
"brian yis civilization v is one of the worlds wonders beacuse it not only helped me pass my macro final, but it also consumed 35% of my soul along with it. good deal, game of the millenium.",1
"this is a great update to a long running series. ive got the gods and kings upgrade and i like what the religion aspect adds. i got really pissed at gustavus adolphus for converting my capital, so i did it back to him!",2
"i realy love civ v!!!!!!! i like the historical way they have it and all the countries makes me happy :d even sweden and denmark :dddddddddddd the culture is amazing with religions and stuff :p and you can name your own religion to make it special. the graphics are amasing but doesnt need hightech computers to play without lag :p you can play offline and online which makes the game fun with friends :d the animations when talking to a leader and when they talk on their own laungage is amazing. altough it had some problem (for example the modify glitch that they didnt remove in a long time) it was still awesome. but next time, dont make norway a part of denmark and finland a part of sweden :p 10/10 must play again",2
"strap a toilet to your , because you wont want to move for a good long while once you start a game.",1
"very good game. title is deceiving though, sid meier is not a playable leader.",1
"civ v gods and kings is a good game to play although it an older virsion than brave new world dlc its a great virsion",1
"great game! i have spent 245 hours on it and i dont regret any of it.",2
"this is such a good 4x game, although nostalgia keeps from ranking it higher than civ4. definitely worth the purchase.",1
"george washington offered one of persias captured cities and all of his goods before i nuked his major cities for the 15th time.",1
"firaxis and 2k are becoming my new favourite game studios, very much thanks to civ v and xcom... this is one of the most complete games ive ever played.",1
"civilization 5 is one of my favorite games! not only is it extremely interesting what will happen the next turn, but it even keeps you wondering the next day! it is very addicting, has many nations to choose from, and has a very uplifting soundtrack. however, the price is a bit high, and i suggest you wait until a sale for the game comes out (for example, $7.49 instead of $29.99). overall, you should definitely purchase this game.",1
"epic game. if you like strategy games you must have it,but you have to put up with lots of waiting turns until it gets interesting",1
"awesome game to play against your friends! worth every minute playing!",1
"i have sunk so much time into this game, and i must say, it was worth every penny spent on it... i enjoy the level through which many of the civiliazation aspects are entailed and connected to each other, but i do not enjoy the amount of time i have to wait for things (as an impatient person) but i understand why these things take so long. i havent developed a strategy that works yet, but i am sure that ill get the rhythm with more playtime! :d",1
"all i have to say about this game is you will lose many hours playing it. its a great game!",1
"good game but not quite complete without dlc. overall an amicable continuation of an amazing pc game series.",1
"for those who love strategy games this game is for you. i have played countless hours of this game. theres alot you can play around with. especially get the game with brave new world because it adds a lot more to the game.",2
"better than beyond earth.and i recommend::::::buy dlcs",3
"i avoid the play button because when i play it the game gets me hooked. this game will make hours feel like minutes and minutes feel like seconds.",1
"build it. bash it. build it again. nuke that . united nations. :(",1
"great game. loads of content and loads of fun. 10/10",1
"one of the greatest stratergy turn-based games of all time. easy on the eyes and an extremely enjoyable game to wrap your head around. turtle and amass your strength, or spread everywhere as quickly as possible and claim everything.",1
"this is probably one of my alltime favorite games. i can spend the entire day playing this game, as you can see i have over 500 hours into it. easy controls (you only need your mouse!) it is a simple fun fast turn-based military economy nation simulator. with thousands of fun mods to pick from to play with from the steam community! i highly recommend this game to anyone interested! worth the money, and also the expansion packs to this game. it seems like a lot of money to buy it all, but at the end it is worth it!",4
"okay, so ive now played one full marathon game in sandbox mode. won with a domination victory, took over half of the world, and completely hunted down and offed 3 civilizations.. 40 hrs for one game. wow. after you conqour the scenario, you can then press the just..one...more...turn button, and completely obliterate the remaining civs in as many turns as you desire. pros: very long gameplay, tons of historical facts(for us people who like to learn while playing), the giant death robot. cons: no more stackable units, planes are dedicated to where it was manufactored (meaning you cant wonder around the map as a big @$$ bomber), cant break a peace treaty.. :(",1
"i highly recommend this game to any indepth strategy game geek, like as myself. lots to learn soooo many different possiblities with endless games, which never play the same twice.",1
"great graphics and its nice that i can choose from a lot of different options to get different game plays. i never tire of this game.",4
"love this game its a must have if you love turn based strategys.",1
"this game eats all your time, but you will be so entertained in the process. a+",1
"fantastic game for turn based gamers and fans of fighting a war like gandhi!",3
"amazing. played it for years. may have problems with crashing if your pc isnt very good (may seem obvious but this was more evident than with other games)",1
"one of the best rts games i have ever played! its so fun trying to dominate your opponents or beat them by reasearching enough to build the apollo space program or by getting enough votes in the united nations to win! a lot of fun but frustrating when you lose!",1
"really great game. gotten all of my house mates to get it and we play it together almost every weekend.",1
"do not buy this game if you want to play multiplayer. multiplayer is broken and each turn lags for 15 secs to 4 mins.",1
"civilisation v is a quite complex (and lengthy) strategy game. if you are into strategy games and have several hours to kill, then civ v is my prefered game of choice. despite what you may hear, even the worst of computers can run civ. however the problem with civ v is that for it to be a decent game you need to get dlc. i personally suggest saving up about 30-40 and buying all the dlc in the summer sale, where it is much cheaper.",1
"great game, you have to understand the game is great!!!!!! but if you dont know how to play, dont give up instantly... actually try to learn it. if you dont know what youre doing youll love it.",2
"my first game took 24 hours. 24 hours for the aztec people to conquer the world... and then we went to space. deal with the historical and cultural anachronisms! they are probably one of the best parts of playing this game. solid strategy game, very large, a few different ways to play, music is good, and it runs well. 10/10 would nuke augustus caesar again.",1
"you play an immortal warlord in control of your units, pretty fun and time consuming",1
"best game ive played in 10 years! extremely addictive. beware, you will have no life after you play this!!",1
"a great turn-based strategy game! great evolution and pace.",1
"a very good strategic game but requires a lot of patience and time. gripping adventure to conquer nations in peaceful or war ways. a must have for strategic awe.",1
"the obsession.....unending, unstopable, all three expansions....so addicted....help me......",2
"wish it was 3 hours in the future and dont want to deal with life? here is your answer.",1
"the game feels finished, and plays well. its an improvement over civ 4 in every way, save mutliplayer, which is awful, lacking mod support, animated leader heads, etc. fleshed out multiplayer would be much appreciated.",3
"for friends of turn-based stategy games very recommended. it wont get bored and is even for players with less experience and time.",5
"exactly as intense/relaxing as you want it to be; and the modding community is great. would be much better if one could utilize the mods online.",3
"great game but needs more options so that i can make more than opne or two of a unit before its obsolete and cant build... eras move way too fast without option of control... only complaint....... edit: cant play past turn 500 due to late game lagg... its very horrible........... so you spend weeks playing just to get screwed over in your final moves to win the game..... very frustrating!!!!!1",3
"my favourite civilization game yet. 10/10 would buy for a friend.",2
"for all its issues, this game is so insanely fun either with friends or single-player",2
"youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you, but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter. 20/10",1
"its a really good strategy game, if you want to buy it buy the complete edition because youll need it later...",2
"just one more turn... *3 hours later* just one more turn...",1
"i absolutely love this game. my favorite turn based strategy game hands down. will be amazing once the steam controller is released. i like the depth and customizability of this game, and the workshop support is a godsend. really fun game to play with friends, i cant imagine the online being that much fun, but lets be honest, people only ever play this with their friends. i love this game and i love how complex and strategic the battles are. the only tedius thing about the game is tending to all of your 150 units every single turn... aside from that, the game is practically flawless. i highly recommend this game! 10/10",1
"the pinnacle of the series. if youre already a fan of the series, this is a must play. if youre even the slightest big curious about the series or the rts genere as a whole, this will quell any doubts you may have.",4
"great game, infinite replay value. i highly recommend!",1
"im not usually a turn-based game player, but i really like this one",1
"solo play? sure, this is a great game. multiplayer? have fun with the re-sync. its going to haunt you every 1-3 turns. a patch to fix bugs ruined the game completely, and this was a month ago. firaxis has a track history of not releasing patches for millenia, so im not expecting one any time soon. only buy this if youre in it for the single-player gameplay. if youre not, wait for the next patch, if there is one.",2
"ba ba yetu yuaaaaaaaa. this game is probley one of the best games i have ever played. better than watchin fail videos. try it out because i can tell you one thing. nobody and i mean nobody plays as china",1
"this is one of the best strategy games out there. definitely pick up the expansions, as well!!!",2
"one of the best strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing, or simply losing a entire night of sleep to the replayable single player. this is one game that any strategy enthusiast, or casual player can enjoy!",1
"civ 5 one of the best games it is so good words cant describe if you get this get all the dlcs because if you dont your not playing it properly. when playing this set aside a whole day maybe 2 from my experience dont trust egypt... they hate me.. some say dnt trust ghandi i say hes a nice guy totally worth the money con a few friends into getting it and youll have the best time of your life one does simply not dislike civ 5",1
"just one more turn...wait its what time in the morning?! fantastic game with fantastic mod support thanks to the steam workshop. vanilla game is great too",4
"one, if not my favorate games of all time. highly entertaining statagy game that is fun to play with friends. just wish there were less bugs d;",2
"in my top 3 games, the best strategy game i have ever played and has an amazing singleplayer with tons of different leaders to play as, and then tons of different units to battle/generate food/generate income/generate research with. its a real pity that the multiplayer is somewhat buggy as playing with friends is a real joy. highly recommended, especially at such a low price.",1
"you can spend absolute hours in this game thinking how to fight that one invasion off, how to deal with that one other player or what to build next in this one city.",1
"ohmahgahd this game is incredibly good and fun and i will always recommend it 90,000% of the time. seriously, play this game.",2
"honestly one of the most addictive games ive ever playd, 10/10 :) with all the playable civs all i can ask for is more! :d",1
"this game is just plain awesome. it is endless fun, and it wont feel repetitive. you can play hour on end, always say youre going to do one more turn but then you never do",3
"addictively good. currently the best turn-based strat game out there. high replaybility. simply love this game.",4
"one of the best and most engrossing strategy games i have ever played. just prepared to have your time get  like a blind-mute in prison.",2
"i think im playing for 45 minutes, i play for 5 hours.",1
"i searched the universe for more ducks, but sadly i only found meese. obama approved this message",1
"i can never get enough of this game. i beat my friends all the time!",2
"with way more than 200 hours of gameplay (steam is always about 40% of what i actually played), this is my most played game in my library. this is not the greatest game of all time, but it is probably in my top three, with portal 2 as the greatest game of all time. while this game does take long, it is worth it and very consuming! i love this game and i would most definitely recommend it! i love this game!",2
"if you love turned based real time strategy games, then this is the game for you. just be sure to get the dlc for it it makes the game infinitely more thrilling.",2
"very fun games however each game (on fastest setting) will literally take 5-10 hours. on the marathon setting, expect over 24hr games. as a consequence, i havent played a single full game yet! (about 5 hrs) pros fun multiplayer + cons long games - gameplay= 8/10 graphics= 7/10 sound/audio= 5/10 multiplayer= 9/10 re-playability= 8/10 total= 36/50= try demo, if you like it, buy it! i payed 5 but its worth the 20!",1
"i havent played this game at all yet! dude buy it!!!",1
"i played as george washington and killed every other country as god intended.",1
"probably the best bang for your buck as far as replayability. you want to go outside again? stay away!",2
"fantastic game! quit diferent compared to the other civiziltions! hope to god civ vi comes out",1
"dont trust anyone !! and dont play this before going to bed or u will be panda !!",1
"amazing and fun in evrey way the only down side is it takes so long to loud",1
"i like just keeping to myself and having large cities until i take up most of the space then i expand my military just in the off chance im attacked. im usually able to go without a war and win in another way. 10/10 you should play",1
"quite addictive and a good bit of historical fun if you like turn-based games. they did a great job.",1
"best turn based stratergy out there. if you have friends with skype tell them to get this game and play it with them, you will have countless hours of fun and then just be dominated by that guy!",1
"this game is addicting what else is there to say just one more move... fun to play with friends",1
"multiplayer is entirely broken. this is not acceptable for a game of this standing. every time a turn ends, my friends and i are forced back to the loading screen. this must be fixed asap.",2
"sit down after work and decide to play a bit. wife tells me to come to bed soon. only a few more turns and....its 3 am in the morning and im still playing. this is not a quick or casual game. in fact it took me almost 15 hours to play through on a small map. after acheiving a victory i kept playing because there were still goals i hadnt yet accomplished. long story short, its a great game, it has a lot of replay value, it is deep and challenging on many levels, i would recommend it to others but i dont want them to throw away their lives...just one more turn!",1
"quite enjoyable if you like turn-based strategic gameplay",1
"this game is absolutely amazing. buy it. buy the full version. now",1
"if you wanted to dominate the world or live out your fantasies of becoming the ultimate scientocracy, this is the game for you.",1
"the thing with this game is you have to span one game across a few days otherwise you are going to get bored with it, like with aoe iii, you can only play one campaign in one sitting or one game so it works out ok. with this you need to get the idae out of your head that i can do one game in 1 sitting its never gonna happen, unless you overdose on caffiene or cocain. i do not promote either tho also its best with friends, not at night tho as everybody goes quite whilst secretly planing how they are going to roll over you quicker than nazi germany on france or amassing great amounts of money to call war on you. its still a solid 8/10 tho just problems with workers not doing work sometimes? bit anyoing and even more time consuming.",1
"great game. it gets boring after a while so try some mods out. 7/10",1
"this is a great game. definitely the greatest single player turn based strategy game out there. everything is polished and the ai is memorable. brave new world is without comparison. every person who plays it loves it. non gamers can get into it, and realize how much fun it is. i recommend this to anyone. (with the brave new world expansion of course).",4
"a game that really can spend whole day sitting infront of the pc and play. even more interesting and fun when you have lots of friends playing together as all of us can plan with their own style and battle among each other to know whos the best strategist.",1
"when you play lan battles with friends, do not go to the bathroom. somehow, like magic, almost all of my cities and gold and almost everything somehow came under his control. he claims it was the ai that took my stuff. still hate gandhi. 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 would reccomend",1
"if you are into strategy games, this is one of the most challenging ive ever tried. its fun and exciting like its predecessors. i would say its one of the better games ive tried. and if you dont find it as challenging as i do. well you just jump to deity and see if you can keep up your pace!",3
"definitely not a game you should start up when you have something important scheduled. you know, like... sleeping or eating. the just one more turn syndrome will keep ordinary things like these well out of your mind. try the marathon mode if you dare... the multiplayer mode used to be bit wonky but it pretty stable after the last patches. definitely get both expansions for the best experience (the complete edition is usually up for 10 bucks during the steam sales).",4
"this game is frickng awesome. its well worth the money, and you save a lot if you buy the gold edition. its crazy.",1
"little too different from the good old original games",1
"civilization v pares down a lot of the unnecessary elements and game mechanics that have been creeping into the series, bringing it down to a very polished set of basic mechanics.",1
"very nice game, easy to understand. strategy is very important here, but theres a little of adventure too. with new dlcs it is much funnier to play! you can win the game in some different ways, personally i always won with science victory. with the workshop contents, it is more interesting, but most of the addons require dlcs. soometimes it can be buggy. 8,5/10",1
"with all the expansions, gods & kings and brave new world, this is the best game of the franchise! 10/10",2
"been an avid player of civilization series since the very beginning on the amiga. a great addition to the series and a worthwhile buy for anyone who wishes to lose a weekend one does not simply play civilization for an hour",2
"u must ask? it is sid meier civilization! take my money! (tell humble bundle to do it pretty please? :) )",1
"great game. played hours and hours on it by myself and with friends.",1
"if you want to throw your life away then i recommend you this.",1
"its enjoyable right up until about the 1900s, then the game really slows down when there are more untis and turns take excrutiatingly long to manage, especially when at war. war takes way too long to fight out, the system for battle should be much quicker. i would have recommended this before, but now i think its fundamentally flawed due to the time investment required when at war.",1
"great game you start playing at four look at your clock a little later and its alreadt ten",1
"quite possibly the best strategy (in both rts and tbs) game i have ever played, and ive played a lot of those. this one takes the cake from under the noses of strategy game greats like age of empires, age of mythology, starcraft, the total war series, and of course, the previous games from the civ series. if you buy this game, be sure to get the gold edition for the best experience!",3
"civ 5 bes gam i play fur man day. it 2 gud. luv it",1
"this game is an awesome strategy game. for those chess players who like to build like in games like minecraft. pros- in depth gameplay. multilple difficulties, various game modes. always expanding and you can always find a mod to build whatever world or civ you want. con- lengthy for anyone who only wants to play for short periods. some civs are imba and others stink.",3
"i didnt think this was going to be my thing, but after realease i had missed two meals while doing my first playthrough it became obvious how well-made this game is. if you like anything about history, turn-based games, or simcity - but dont like cities - then this is the game for you.",1
"great strategy game for everyone. and by that i mean you can make it either super easy or super hard or a really quick match or a really crazy long match that could literally take days. whats not to love!? its also quite amazing to see your civilization go from hut dusters to mech riders.",1
"an epic game where you are a country, and you go through eras fighting and having peace with other countrys",1
"such an addictive game def. a must buy if you can snach it up during the sale.",1
"i strongly recommend this game for avid strategists. your objective is to nurture a civilisation and become victorious over all others. there are numerous victory possibilities thanks to a large range of ingame concepts from tourism to science. each civilisation has its unique units/buildings as well as an ability through their leader. moreover, the dedicated mod workshop enhances the game further still, bestowing upon it astronomical replay value. give it a try, you wont regret it !",2
"loads of strategic fun. play with friends for some added competition!",1
"been a fan of civilization since civilization ii, so the fact that i like this doesnt come as a surprise. i will say that i do miss some of the things that were taken out of the games as they progressed through the series (building your throne room was always something i enjoyed), but i can definitely understand why they changed things. all in all, if you like to sit down and play a game, and, lose your whole night then this is the game for you.",1
"so me and my friend have been playing this game for two days now and i have to say it is pretty sick! but watch out when you make trades online the person can steal all of your things if you are the one who started the trade! i was play playing as khan and he was china and i stole all of his citys and razed them all!!!!!",1
"a great game to play when you have a few hours of spare time. the fantastic gameplay, as well as firaxis games amazing attention to both detail and historical accuracy, make this edition of civ its best yet.",1
"a game solely built around strategy. without it, youre not going anywhere besides maybe europe or japan.",1
"firaxis took a lot of risks with this game, changing so much from civ 4. however pretty much all of them have payed off, and made the game much better for it. one great change is leaders speaking in their actual language making metting leaders more interesting. no stacking of military units is a massive plus, in civ 4 you were just smashing stack after stack into each other, it felt like there was no strategy. now it is much more interesting and feels like it takes skill. the only real thing i dont like about it is the announcer, he has a very boring voice. no where near as interesting as leonard nimroys.",1
"strategically challenging game that can force you to change your strategy in an instant.",1
"a super fun, super deep game that keeps u interested with lots of replayability, a pc must have for anyone with an interest in strategy!",1
"i was gonna play this game for a while and go to bed at 10 pm, a few minutes later i could hear birds chirping outside.. 10/10",1
"this game is amazing! except watch out for ghandi, hes a ing !",2
"this game is fun. countless hours of enjoyment await you if you decide to play it. i prefer to play eith others, but this game still manages to pull me in for times when im alone.",1
"this game is the worlds slowest marathon... and i cant get enough of it. ill admit, when you start to reach endgame (1800s-2000s), 9/10 times i just get bored and end the game through warfare, but the first few thousand years are so much fun, i keep coming back for more... i love the battle for territory and the fragile relationships with the other leaders, i almost always take perks to increase the rate of border expansion for increased chance of conflict. overall, the game costs to much, pick it up on sale and you wont be sorry!",2
"this game is by far the best turn based strategy game i have ever played. why are you reading this? you could be trying to build a civilazation that can stand the test of time! if you dont own it, you should.",3
"8/10 this game takes so much time off your day and it is still so much fun, even though you just sit there and use one hand (just like watching adult films).one game takes hours, and that is when your settings are on quick mode (well i am not really sure, i am a casual gamer, not really competitive). fun with friends. it is always so much fun building your own empire, whether you overpower your enemy or just simply build a utopia for your people and win through peace, the game is awesome. p.s. just press next turn already...",1
"a fun turn-based strategy game where you can build your empire and conquer the globe. its very easy to use and will suck the hours away if you arent careful. be careful in the tutorial though, you cant save.",1
"civ is a gerne defining game, an absolute must play. the good: - one of the best turn based games youll ever play - every civ has his own strengths and weaknessess - you can customize the map, victory conditions and opponents to your liking - dlcs actually add good content to the game the bad: - some civs are stronger than others awesome game and a must own 9/10",1
"one does not simply play just 1 hour of this. itll ruin your life 11/10",1
"best turn based strategy game on the market hands down. you must be nuts if you never have tried at least one of the games in the civilization series.",3
"started playing at 10:00 pm. played for one hour. watch said 4:00 am. 10/10.",1
">playing single player >ghandi goes to war with me >cries >2 or 3 barbarian armys come out of nowhere and attack me. >cries harder.",1
"a good civilization game, im glad with what theyve added to this part of the series and how they fixed other things with dlc. not much to say extra about it, if you liked civ 4 youll probably like civ 5.",1
"ive literally never spent as much time on a game in my life as i have with civ 5. massively addictive.",5
"while some of the game dynamics have had a slight overhaul (lack of unit stacking is he biggest departure,) this is classic civ. and the changes are welcome! if you are a civ fan you have this already. if you have caught the turn based 4x bug and cant quite understand why everyone raves about endless space because you find that otherwise fine title a bit empty and samey then this is what youve been missing. now, i dont like dlc as a rule, ( i always feel that the publishers are just bolting on features that the dev would have had in the game in the first place with proper investment and respect to their craft,) but in his case highly recommended with the gods & kings and brave new world dlc.",1
"amazing game, especially if you have alot of your friends playing together!",1
"a really fun stratagy game that i would rank number 1 on its list its a must have for any stratagy game lover, also fun with friends, always fun to see whos better",2
"ive had the base game a long while now. and the expansions just make it better. this game will never grow old for me",3
"god has given us the glory of bretrayal and nuclear war with gandhi, thus i give the title of funniest/ funnest game to civ 5, but realy its an amazing game and worth the money.",2
"this game is amazing the design the graphics how smooth everything is in the games its great",2
"since everyone else is placing their reviews, and having around 30-50 hours of gametime, i figured id put my word in and close the time gap. this game is amazing, you will not regret getting it. its not a waste of time, nor is it a waste of money. this game will have you playing it over and over repeatedly. replay value? definately a lot. in fact, if you were to buy this game right now, and youve liked the gameplay videos and screenshots, im positive youd like to play the game for yourself. go ahead and buy it if its your cup of tea! its very fun, and youll enjoy yourself. :)",4
"does not work, freezes after the opening cinematic. steam will not refund, and its happening to tons of users all while not being solved. dont risk your cash for another one of steams broken games. finally got it to load, went thought the tutorial, still dont like it, mainly bdue to at the end when victory is assured you have to spend 2 hours clicking attack,attack to whittle down the last 2 crappy cities",1
"amazing game. easy to lose hours while playing it though!",1
"i always end up staying up until it gets bright out bc of this game.  you sid meier.",1
"i used to recomend but recently the game has begun to crash in the loading screen after the movie intro if anyone can find a fix plz tell me but i have tried verifying the game cache and reinstalling but they dont seem to help so if you can find a fix plaz telll me",1
"i am new to the series, wtf did i wait so long for? i have never played this type of game ever, but i was hooked after about 30min in my first game, literally once i started to figure out what i was doing i considered calling into work at about 3am in the morning..lol..theres a pretty good learning curve if youve never played one of these but i highly recommend it..side note: i bought the complete edition off of greenmangaming for $25 and activated it on here...",1
"this game. . . i dont know where to start. its a whole new history. a whole new world. you make history your own! not the way it was made. greece could have defeated rome! america could have lost the revolutionary war!",1
"i dont even want to think about what my overall playtime would be if you took into consideration how many hours i pumped into this game when i owned it through less than legitimate means.",1
"this is one of my favorite games to play, the realistic physics engine and amusing themes cast this game into one of the most difficult and fun strategy games ive ever played, especially now that they have added monetary constraints, the community development is superb and the game is constantly being updated and patched.",1
"the best strategy game ive ever played. its replayability is its best feature.",1
"possibly one of the most dangerous games to play if you have any plans on being a productive member of society.",2
"civilization 5 is one is the best ever strategy games and i highly recomend it to any new steam person",1
"this game is too much fun i highly recommend this!",2
"want to rewrite history? and nuke everyone? then this is for you.",3
"civ5 is an epic and complex analytic game. whatsoever, i can recommend it to everybody who likes turn-based strategy and folks who like to use their brain. when youre playing call-of- and else, dont buy civ5, i really believe your neurological structure mass will be damaged when you try to find out how the game mechanics of this dainty videogame would work. hm, yes, im really certain you would die. exruciating and without blessedness and love. doesnt matter, the game is easier than civ iv and it has its own stupidity (click the right thing, next round, click the right thing, next round - oh a nuclear bomb! - click the right thing, next round) but its in principle good mastered so that it isnt in evidence. enjoy - or buy civ iv, both are good, the older is better but the recent is more modern.",1
"created the great empire of rome in 1980, also a good cheaper alternative to be. btw it will kill you social life just check the time i have wasted.",2
"hell yes bad  strategy game. spent tons of hours on this game and im still just a noob, recommended for you and your friends.",1
"many hours spent playing this game, big time-sink. fun way to pass a weekend with friends or by yourself.",1
"i played the demo great fun also watched youtubers play it recommend 10/10 also recommend the dlc brave new world 10/10! great strategy game for those who want to play with friends or alone rule your world and conqurer other factions.",1
"play this far too much! love it, always have. plenty of detail, gameplay. graphics as you would expect. the whole game is nicely polished but what i love the most is the amount of mods and stuff available in the workshop, pretty much change the whole game. 9/10 (looking forward to the next installment)",2
"if you want to chill and play with friends after a man plays chess with you at the same time then this is the game! i would say that civ 3 is probably superior in most aspects, however this game i find encaptivating which leads me to spend many hours on it at a time!",1
"should do a fun mod.. make the barbarians zombies ..",2
"this game has got to be one of the best turn based strategy games in the entire pc gaming universe. i recommend anyone to play this if they have time on their hands and like to have more strategy in gaming.",1
"a fun game to play with friends spent alot of time into this game.",2
"made ghandi found catholicism and killed america with war elephants in 1000bc",1
"as always, civilization is fantastic. i personally enjoy civ v over iv. the hex system and military unit changes were a fantastic edition. movement and combat requires a little more thought now than the blob of death from iv. the game is beautiful, runs well, has wonderful music, and with the workshop, adding mods is even easier now.",1
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",2
"this is an amazing game it is my favorite turn based stratagy",1
"ok this is starting to get a bit boring, ill just have one more turn... 1 hour later damn i need to get to work!",1
"crashes so much after you start getting big in the game dont install unless you have a good computer my brand new laptop with only 2 games installed at this point cant handle it very dissapointed 4 g of memory too was an expencive lesson for what seemed to be a pretty basic looking game",1
"amazing amount of rich and diverse civilizations to choose from, beautiful animations and scenery, fantastic to play with friends",4
"civ 5 is the captain captain, the captain of all captains of all turn-based stragedy games. its really the mother of all tbs. its epic! as i have started with the game (civ 5 gold edition + brave new world), i played directly 12 hours at a time. you can really enjoy this game.",1
"a great addition to any strategy-addicts collection.",1
"holy  balls is that civilization v?! you bet your sweet non dairy  it is! this game is ing hardcore to the max. commit gennocide, brainwash another culture with your propaganda,  space with your giant science ! this game is so ing good you would suck a  to play it, then play it, then suck a  again to say thank you for the game.",1
"ive been a fan of civilization all the way back to the first or second one. while my favorite one in the series still stands to be civilization colonization. this one stands true to the ways of civilization with adding even more if you get it on steam. the workshop aids it in its everlasting glory of timeless fun for all who play it. while the multiplayer can be glitchy and sometimes unreliable in the beginning of a game, or with people all across the u.s. (eu cannot play matches with the us on multiplayer unless you join through steam)i still recommend it in every situation although you may need to watch out if you dont like spending hours being drawn into one match. graphics: 8 (for a civ game) gameplay: 8 (10 with bnw) performance: 7.5 (took a hit in multiplayer because of connection, thats about it) overall: 8",1
"this game is absolutely incredible. if you are on the fence about buying this, just pick it up when its on sale. i initially was sort of put off by the negative reviews stating the game was buggy, too easy, broken, etc. no, its incredible. just pick it up when its on sale. make sure you get the gold edition, as it will include all of the dlc that add to this game greatly. --buy it--",1
"the only game where ghandi is an  and you want to be allies with korea. 10/10",1
"one of my fav games and i would recommend this to anyone even remotly thinking about it!",3
"i was nuked by ghandi and i have never laughed more in my life",1
"great turnbased strategy game, one of the best within its genre. you will sink in a lot of hours into this game, maybe to many. so to speak this game is extremly slow paced. youre litterary playng a board game on the computer. you might end up playing this game a tremendous amount of time without even finishing one single game. but if you can look past that, then by all means grab it during one of steams many sales. i highly reccomend you to buy the gold edition because it fixes so many problems civ v hade within its launch. if you want to improve your game expirence even more then you should grab the brave new world expansion, however after you have played the gods and king or it will be to much to take in. so yeah it is truly an awsome game.",1
"another great addition to the civ library. not quite as polished as civ 4, but once you get the expansions it easily exceeds how great 4 was, even with beyond the sword.",2
"great addition to one of the best video game franchises ever.",2
"i cant believe how ing bad snowy is at this game. in year 1990 wanta to try to get domination victory against 2 untouched civs when we couldve won in like 3 turn from science. we fukin lost by diplomatic victory 5 turns later. dont play with this kid unless you want to disable all victories that arent domination.",1
"two pieces of advice kill ghandi and dont  people off",2
"awesome game to kill a couple hours when you should be sleeping.",1
"civ v is one of those games that you cant really say no to. as a turn based strategy made by the famous sid meier, this game lives up to the name of civilization. although ive encountered a few, but rare bugs in the game (such as a ship magically jumping into a lake from the sea) this game is a game you cant put down, you spend hours on it because you want to see what happens in just one more turn, what you can accomplish. 5/5 id say for this game. i recommend it to anyone from every part of the gaming spectrum",1
"this game has made me forget how to sleep and love. 10/10",4
"alexander the great insulted my army saying they were **** i declared war on him he was right",1
"i once decided to start up civ v, hoping to play a couple turns, then get back to work. i managed to quit at 2:00 in the morning.",1
"love the series! i am very happy with the linux port as well! a must have game.",1
"an addicting, strategic masterpiece putting you in position to rewrite all of human history from the moment we discovered agriculture. a game that will have to getting pissed at america for building the pyramids before you do, and will have you clapping at your own cleverness when you convince genghis khan to help you attack egypt.",2
"gods and kings makes this game really fun. think beyond the sword and civ5, then take out the boring parts of control. religion is done the best it has ever been done in civ imo. if you liked civ4 then give civ5 gods and kings a chance.",2
"i have been playing civ since civ2:tot. tot still remains my favorite as far as interesting game modes and simple mechanics. civ 5 is no louse though. i love to complicated ways i have to work and the mods are absolutely a blast to use and give me back the civ 4 and 3 experience.",4
"i have owned this for a year and made it through 2 or 3 games. in other words, a reputable sequel to the predecessors.",1
"love the game! but as of recently, the game will not load previous saves really disappointed...",1
"very addicting, be prepared to sink a hundred hours, that you didnt mean to, into this game.",1
"worse than drugs. do not play if you value real life.",1
"great game. civ is one of the most addicting game with great replayablity potential. highly recommended",1
"quite possibly the best and most complexly amazing game i have played! 250/100!",2
"ive just recently bought the game, and have played it for 4+ hours non stop. just as soon as you think you are at a good break point, you just keep on going. i had my doubts about this game, but even with the arcadish, non rts, battle mechanics, the game makes up for it in content, and flexability to bring your empire where ever you choose. coming from a real time strategy enthusiast, this game, definitely delivers. a must have, especially if you have friends to team up with online ;).",1
"i have played this game so much that i lost my job, my wife left with kids and my monkey. i said take the kids but you leave me my monkey, unfortunately my wife took my monkey which i was gonna feed bananas to, ive got a surplus of bananas so ive got that going for me which is nice. but gethis 3 years later it turned out that my wife was having an affair with my monkey so i was heart broken and ofcourse the bananas had gone rotten, all in all this is a great game, but you should note that i loved my monkey he was like my best friend and now hes with my ex-wife, so i found a new friend hes called oscar the chicken, he wasnt as friendly as my monkey but he did taste good.",1
"played 3 mostly, 4 some and ive been playing 5 for a few weeks. vanilla is really fun, challenging too. cant wait to get gk and bnw!",1
"great game. slow starting but ramps up to a lot of fun.",1
"awesome to play with few people, but only if you can afford to buy all expantions. if not then simply buy one of previous parts.",2
"made friendship with the some other civilization, 10 turns later, they declared war. great real life simulator. would recommend!",2
"best civ yet. great people, religions, and new wonders are great added features over previous version. i also love the tactical component created by non-stacking units - archers/etc. and catapults/etc. have value now.",1
"very addicting. never count on allied npc countries helping you, though. you are on your own.",4
"i love this game, it is my go-to when i cannot decide what to play. the pace is as quick or as slow as you need it to be. you can play an intense round of world-domination, or you can go for a leisurely cultural victory inbetween errands and household chores. i wish i could say specifically what i like about this game, but it is a combination of little things that keep me coming back. i like the music, the way the ai rulers feel real, i like how i can easily play with my friends on steam. after a rough day, civ 5 gives me the chance to annihilate my enemies, in style.",2
"have you ever wanted to take drugs? well go no further! this game is so f*cking addictive you wont need drugs! this game is the best tbs (turn based strats) game out! you will not find a better tbs game! and dont get me started on the dlc! sadly multiplayer has a few issues but its sooooo worth it! you can overlook all the bugs for this game. oh annnnnnd this game also has mod support! so if your into strat games then this is for you buddy! you buy! you buy now! 8.5/10 one of my most fav games!",1
"this game is an  plasmated into code. i never truly liked this genre of gaming, but this game changed my mind completely on it. it gives the player a lot of freedom on how he wants to play and getting things done is quick and easy. the game makes you think hard before doing something, as just starting random wars with everyone may lead to a very quick game over. the only thing i can blame this game for are some online problems ive had whilst playing the game, but they arent too bad. it is perfect and it completely deserves to be in your steam library. 10/10",1
"id inject this game into myself if that was possible",2
"an amazing turn-based stratagy game that will have you saying just one more turn late into the night.",1
"it was interesting i couldnt find the tutorial tho",1
"this game has taken over one full day of my life. please send help",1
"civilization isnt a game so much as it is a hobby, but if you are into turn-based strategy, civ v is some of the best. ive been playing this series for years and i am still learning things about improving my game. ...just dont buy this one if you like sleeping. civilization and sleeping are not compatible.",3
"i loooovvee this game. it got me back into gaming. all i need now is all the dlc!",1
"i built a tank and captured three cities with it. 10/10",4
"wasnt really my favorite but if you like the series then this game will keep you up at night and will enjoy it(until the point when you die).",1
"you forget what time irl is when you play this game. gods and kings dlc wasnt too good",1
"ive been playing civ v for quite some time with friends, and while it has a few glaring problems like  ai that runs units to their death in your citys with no chance of taking it and gandhi and his opness. its otherwise a great time vampire more so with all the xpacks adding sorely needed features like religions in gods and kings and actual trade networks in brave new world. if you have tens of hours to drop into a game per setting this is the game for you as hours just disappear before you know it, you start playing at 3pm and in the blink of an eye its 1am.",1
"170+ hours on record and at least an extra 100 off record from before, so yea; this game is a lot of fun if youre into strategy games, but be prepared to spend countless nights awake at your pc taking just one more turn",1
"a reveiw? its a sunday waster. sit at your computer for hours micro managing! youll enjoy the time you wasted. and feel acomplished when victory is achived.",1
"there are two types of people in this world - those who dislike civ and those who buy the game and lose the next 16 hours of their life clicking on the next turn button. as a 4x game civ does it all: economics, diplomacy, strategy, empire macro-management, city micro-management, religious disputes, etc. and it does all of it in an immersive, attractive environment that progresses with the state of your civilization. the only real cons are that public multiplayer games take forever without a good method for pausing/saving/resuming but this can be remedied by joining a civ steam group or just playing with friends. at the very least, give the brave new world demo a try and find out how expendable your sleep is.",2
"this game will make you have sleepless nights, 10/10 would buy again (y)",1
"easier to get into than civ 4. ive caught myself saying one more turn plenty of times while playing this.",1
"in cases where i feel like warmangering and cackling maniacally, civilizaion v is my go to game. worth every cent.",2
"addictive game. do not play this game if you have anything productive to do.",1
"started playing, thinking that i play for an one hour or so. i find myself playing 6 hours later... 10/10 you have to learn the rules of the game. and then you have to play better than anyone else. -albert einstein",1
"very good but i reccomend you get the collection pack with it as it gets fairly old after a few hours with no dlc",1
"great game but will eat up time quickly. havent played a civ game since civ ii, just turned this on and 4.2 hrs later i stopped. jeeze i need to watch the time better.",1
"its an amazing game its just so fun to play as one of the nations that exsited in the worlds history and play it over in your own way. it is well improved from civilization iv in a lot of ways. i defenetly recommand this game.",2
"this game is cool get it but get the complete edition",2
"im not a fan of turn-based strategy so i was going to be quite a hard sell on this. however, in the 50 hours ive racked up in the first two weeks of owning the game, im fairly thrilled and enjoying it. you can tinker with a single or multiplayer game for days on end and just calmly murder that bloody irritating ghandi in your own time. ive barely even touched the available mods for the game, so ive still got that excitement coming to me. all in all, a nice timekiller, and can even be played while youre doing other things.",1
"came in with over 10 divions of rifleman and 4 divisons of cannons againts the zulu , the result my people are enslaved gg no re 12/10",1
"bought this game nearly 1 year ago. 500 hours game time. i have divorced my wife and bought shares in dominos pizza.",4
"i once played three days straight without realizing it.",1
"great game. played a short time and im convinced id like to play it a lot more. not only do you get to conquer the world in multiple ways and in different senses of the word, but the road to that victory is eternally customizable. runs great, only a few graphic glitches and almost never has performance lag. the audio isnt bad at all, and the sountrack adds a rather great touch. smooth gameplay allows for coordinated or improvised moves. the entities and environment both look amazing. definetely something to consider buying for both strategy and non-strategy gamers.",1
"addictive and fun but... some annoying bugs here and there prevents this from being the turn based game anyone wanted 9/10",1
"you can play this game for hours at a time. honestly you lose track of time as you head right through the game into the modern era. 66 hours is a lot if you ask me and thats how long you can spend time playing this game. they did a great job with the game. my only complaint is the automatic camera movement. it can get annoying at times and you might accidentally move your unit to the wrong spot because of it. other than that is an overall great game and i reccommend it to everyone who loves turn based strategy games.",1
"from the dawn of mankind, from the point where humans finally band together to create societies, you the player take control of a variety of nations that have actually existed in history, such as china, america, england, russia, germany, and japan to name a few, to write your own version of history alongside other great nations of the earth. researching technologies, adopting social policies, building cities, conquering other empires, these are just some of the powerful decisions and abilities you are able to wield as the leader of your people. you will watch the ascension of your meek, primitive people into what you aspire it to be. a powerful military empire? a technologically advanced society? a flourishing nation of arts and culture? will you be a tyrant? a philosopher? a diplomat? as the narrator states before each match, can you build a civilization to stand the test of time?",5
"this is amazing, a huge improvement over civ 4. the graphics are way better, and the hexagon like grid system makes it alot easier to move around. you can see mountains through the fog, the game no longer continually nags you to build unit a when you want unit b, gameplay is fast and fluent and it steam workshop support is a big plus. my only issue is that there is no way to turn off the camera moving when the mouse is at the edge of the screen. i seriously recommend this to anyone who has played any previous civ game, or any fans of the rts genre",1
"epic. i love how this game really makes you think. great game to play while tripping.",1
"i have always loved civ and have played them all since original and i love this iteration. my favourite change is making each hex only able to be occupied by one military unit. no more single stacks of doom, your units will need flank and rear protection to be successful.",3
"played on deity. montezuma spawns right next to me. invades me and destroys me in 1 turns 10/10 would watch the destruction of my civ again.",2
"absolute masterpiece. a true tribute to civ 4, excellent example of if it aint broke, dont fix it. no bugs or crashing at all.",1
"as a loooong time civ player i was a little underwhelmed by the inital civ v offering, though it was a good base. but with the first expansion it achieves a lof the potential i had hoped for. awesome game, theres a reason so many people are always playing it.",2
"regularily steals 5+ hours of my life. well worth this and all dlc",1
"i like the gameplay and the smooth transitions of the early-game world. there is a huge break in the game however, by simply ammassing wealth you can win the game flawlessly. i have always been a fan of the civ series and this game is an amazing game with high replay value.",3
"its civilization, no stacked units, more strategy, less tilling and it time wastes great.",1
"incredibly fun and rich of legitimate histortical information.",1
"the best if its genre by a mile and a half. highly recommended if you like your strategy games with a friendly learning curve, but still with that intricacy that can take a long time to master. (has an in built user friendly modding system in the main menu)",1
"excellent replay value. great old school multiplayer through giant multiplayer robot (dont use pitboss unless youre a masochist). solid turn based strategy.",3
"my definition of a perfect game! takes quite some time to get used to and learn, but once you do, there is no limit to how many hours you will want to play this game! spent 100+ hours on the campaign edition (not through steam)",1
"cant believe ive waited so long to play this game! ive owned it for ages, i decided to give it a go after watching the trailer from e3 for civilization: beyond earth and got really into it! the graphics are good, the gameplay is fun. considering i love playing strategy games ive no idea why i havent played this sooner :p! granted the match did last 9 hours, i dont know if thats just me being new or the fact theres so much to do and plan out in the game that a good match takes that long to complete, thankfully it was in single player mode so no one was waiting on me to make a move haha! if you like strategy games & enjoy getting into all the mechanics of a well thought out conquest then this game is for you! i would highly recommend it!",1
"made my friends pay me gold in return for not nuking them as japan. 1945/10",1
"the kind of game you can easily get lost in for hours. not a game you can start up lightly, but with interesting strategic decision, and many paths to victory, this game never gets old. even with over 300 hours in game i feel i have not given the game anywhere near the time it requires to fully exlore.",2
"nuclear warheads, what more could i possibly say other than death robot. oh wait, it has those too.",1
"sid meiers civilization v is possibly one of the best stratergy games that you will ever come across. it topped all civs before it and is even better than beyond earth. you could be sat there saying to yourself just a quick game the next thing you know youve spent over 5 hours of your life and jumped over 200 turns. this game is a must buy!",2
"a great game that quickly sucks up hours of your life, the civ series never fails to disapoint.",1
"was neighbours with gandhi -- didnt get nuked! 10/10",1
"great game, hours of fun. can definitly eat up a day. always remember, just one more turn...",1
"sickest game ever! such a step up from civ 4 and the dlc makes it so much better!",2
"sat down to play it for six hours timed session and looked at the window and fifteen minutes had passed. the window double functioned as a rolex. i have since moved house.",1
"this game is the slowest and most painful rage(quit) that youll ever experience in your life 10/10",1
"playing rome in a multiplayer match and spawn next to two guys. one of them lose a settler to barbs and i take it for free worker both of them knew eachother so they decided i needed to die i completely destroy them until they spam the chat and rage quits 10/10 would defend against warriors and spearmen again",2
"great game. dont trust ghandi. oh btw dont trust ghandi did i mention not to trust ghandi?",2
"this game in very many ways feels unfinished. most parts of the tutorials & guides seem to fall short. there are parts at which multiple voice overs play at the same time. i appreciate them shaking up core mechanics of the civ series, but dont appreciate it in an unfinished game",1
"building on the originals its a very time consuming game. but very enjoyable.",1
"whats there to say? ive played over 170 hours and im still not bored. on first release, civ v was full of bugs and almost unplayable. there have been several patches since then, filled with fixes and content changes. overall, civ v is an incredible product and the available dlc ensure that no two games are alike.",2
"i bought this and played it with my friends for a couple hours. they soon left (i think) and then i went into singleplayer. i made some progress, then my friends called me up to play again. then i realized what time it was. 10/10",2
"maybe just one more turn.... mmmm just one more. wait why is it 4 in the morning now.",1
"this game is always fun, it takes your time so easily and makes you want to play forever. caution, this game can make you addict as hell once you start a game.",1
"addictive, time-consuming, friendship destroying. everything you could want from a game.",1
"great turn-based game. amazing graphics and infinite possibilities and endings.",2
"civilization v is a truely wonderful experience for those who love strategy games. the gameplay feels realy smooth as well as the multiplayer, local and online.",1
"great game but needs more options so that i can make more than opne or two of a unit before its obsolete and cant build... eras move way too fast without option of control... only complaint....... edit: cant play past turn 500 due to late game lagg... its very horrible........... so you spend weeks playing just to get screwed over in your final moves to win the game..... very frustrating!!!!!1",3
"best game ever , i usually hate strategys of any kind but this series sucks you in and doesnt let you go . some games could be 15 hours and some could be an hour but no matter what youll restart agin and keep going to you win . -luke 10/10",1
"like why? why would u not play this game? its an epic fantasy for gods sake. u can do whatever the hell u want!",5
"ghandi and napoleon conquer the world in the greatest conquest in the big  universe. no man, tank or nuke can stand a chance against ghandis elephants. 10/10 will fear ghandi",1
"just buy it now, play it for a bit, then look at time played! enjoy :d",1
"if youre a fan of turned based strategy games, this one will certainly not disappoint. i played and loved civ4 and i consider this to be an upgrade, countless hours of just one more turn await.",1
"this game is awesome civilization 5 recreates milatary and graphics throughout the series. the main idea is to create a civilization that will stand the test of time. the diplomatic meetings have also been recreated.",2
"ghandi is a piece of  lying trash watch your back, hes a scumbag. would not trust/10. you can actively be burning down the ais capital and theyll still demand you give them gems. fantastic.",1
"the greatest civ ever, period. if you have monies to spare, buy this, infinite playablillity, the best turn based strategy scince civ 4, down load 2day!go go go",1
"this game took my life, its destroying my social life and i have lost all ability to sport. 10/10",1
"the most epic game ive ever played (and i have minecraft)",1
"fun time burning game :) awesome to play with friends.",2
"what a game, hugely reccomended to people who are interested in historical games, for me its like the total war series but you can start from the beginning, and thats what i enjoy, manipulating technology! but warning gandhi.",2
"if only i had more hours in the day to play this game!",2
"this game is amazing. words cannot describe the sheer amount of fun i have playing civ 5. the already enjoyably vast content is expanded by the workshop. and if there is a civilization you want to play as that isnt already there, than most likely its already been added to the workshop. if you like a game where you can run your own empire in a hundred differnt ways, this is the game for you. i recommend everyone with at least a single commanding bone in their body get this game. only in civ5 will you here yourself saying, thank god ghandi is dead.",3
"great game, way better than the first. but its very addicting",1
"civilization 5 is the ultimate strategy game. 10/10!",5
"the only game that makes time dissapear. start at 8am end at 8pm. my favorite game",1
"amazing game that i have enjoyed for several years now, and the expansions are really good too :)",2
"songhai and india cannot be trusted. you have been warned.",1
"one of the best games this decade. a work of genious.",2
"brilliant game, tactically makes for a true iteration of the civilization series. a wonderful game all round.",1
"a different game from civ4, its finally starting to grow on me. leaner in some ways, more tactical in others. still feels as if it suffers from consolitis in that many power-user controls and options are missing (hello, can we get an in-game clock at least?). gods & kings expansion is a must.",2
"this is a great game that i could play for hours and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to play it.",1
"this game is by far the perfect strategy game. the gameplay, ai and general fun surpasses all of its competitors, and its ability to eat up your life is completely unparalleled. i would recommend this game to everyone. gandhis a  though.",1
"this is the best strategy game i have ever played. there are so many things going on at once, you really fell involved with the short clips and battles. its almost impossible to play the same game twice.",1
"lots of fun. great game to dump a couple hours into after work.",1
"bismarck is worse than gandhi, dont trust him or he will redefine your friendship.",2
"this game is awesome, just flat out awesome! its one of those games where when you first get it, youll play it a ton, then you wont play it for about a month, then one day when youre bored, youll look through your steam library and find this game, and youll start playing it again. oh yeah, and this game has a ton of steam dlc, each one adding in more gameplay mechanics, more civilizations, and more everything else. so if you feel like youll enjoy it, you probobly will. and if it looks kinda dumb to you, itll probobly seem pretty dumb when you play it. or maybe youll still enjoy it. thats possible to.",1
"if steam had a boycott list for publishers, i would be the first to subscribe. i regret spending money on this crap. im sure the game is good if you can load past the intro video. i dont know. i never got that far. i tried everything to get this game working but come on, if i had try that hard, then this publisher obviously did not create such a fantastic product or a finished one. it should work with minimal technical knowledge. this is my first review and its a negative one. thanks a lot, 2k games.",1
"this game has so many ways to play its ridiculous. you can play as a warmongering america, or you can play as a cultural germany, or a scientific iroquois. the game is easy to pick up if you put a little time into it. the game runs clean and smooth on nearly everythng and for a over the top strategy game its awfully pretty too. multiplayer games can get very intense if youve a friend who has this game. great for lan parties because anything can happen. 9.5/10, only problem is it can get a bit gltchy in multiplayer with loading, but only vanilla civ v has this problem. definitely recommend getting the dlcs when they go on sale.",3
"this is a must play game..it feels quite a good..got it cheap after 4 years :p. played it and had much fun..a 10/10 game..even if i am not a big fan of strategy and simulation games",1
"i am by no means a great rts player, but i still love games like civ v and other 4x/strategy games. this game series, more than any other, has the ability to make me lose track of time. the one more turn mentiality is easy to fall into as the game looks and plays great.",2
"oh man. have you played this in game? no? what is your problem asshat? buy this game now or you should just hang yourself. god. 10/10",1
"probably the best strategy game ive ever played and i am now going to be a long time fan of the series",4
"super fun game! i thought it was a little slow to start outwith, then i realized i had been playing for 11 hours",2
"i said i would only play it for a couple of hours to try it, now look at me",1
"an awesome game of strategy. gives you an education bit too, world wonders, different empires, etc.",1
"because nuking a pre industrial civilisation, that is no threat to your plans, never gets old",1
"deep down, its really not a different game from the pixelly dos one i used to play late into the night, very badly, way back when. still simple enough for a kid with plenty of depth, a decent learning curve and enough variety to keep you entertained for years. the multiplayer definitely needs some work, still buggy and cant be modded, but single player still has plenty of depth to go around.",2
"dont play late at night unless sleep is unimportant. and never trust ghandi",1
"worthy sequel of the best turn-based strategy game franchise of all time. its great, buy it.",1
"ive enjoyed civilization v since the original release. it did feel a bit lacking late game and resulted in a lot of tedious simple battles. theres room for improvement, the ai is still kind of dumb and you do end up in some tedious spots, but with the two expansions i think this is the best of the main civilization series now. the linux port is excellent too! the only thing lacking is some of the graphics options available in the windows version, but its a small difference and the game runs very well.",1
"just dont play it in the night if you value your sleep or have things to do...",1
"the game has quite a few bugs but definitely one of my favourite games to play with friends.",2
"this is on eof the most fun games i have ever played!",1
"one of the most complete and advanced games in the world!",1
"good game. takes a long time to play though. better dipomacy needed.",2
"playing to lose or barely survive as a weak civilization in the high difficulty settings is actually quite interesting. with scenarios, real world positioning mods, and ai enhancement mods, survival through defense and diplomacy against dominant civilizations creates a different gameplay from trying to win. too bad multiplayer isnt quite feasible due to constant screen jumping to allied battle...",1
"i am a big civ fan and have enjoyed all the previous versions. this version how ever i think is one of the best ones of the series. its very nice graphics go well with the wonderful music. the game can be very overwelming to people who have never played civ, thankfully civ 5 has a very in depth civ advisors that can help you get use to this game. from complete new people to the series or people who have only played a little civ. this game is a must have. you will be drawn into the game in just a few minutes.",1
"ing mongolians took control all of my land and  my people",1
"dis gam ta bestt eva.. this game had me non-stop playing for a whole weekend. i recomend this to anybody really. unless you cant stand turn-based then this is the best game ever. 10/10 cities will destroy",1
"this is one of the best ever stragety games ever with millions of mods and in just plain you can go online to become the greatest leader ever!!!",2
"like the previous civ games only improved by more dlc and game options",2
"i dont like turn based games much. feel very slow paced and combat is boring, especially if u are used to fast paced rtss.",1
"solid game, a few nice updates from civ 4, a few drawbacks... but still really fun gods and kings is a must",1
"words can not express how much you can not trust ghandi when he gets his first nuke. this game is crazy addictive, i advise people to play at thier own risk. stuff will not get done around the house when played, it doesnt matter if its turn base youll wind up saying to yourself ....just one more turn then ill get off...",2
"just amazing, turn based, think ahead strategy game. when on sale, its really worth your money.",1
"this is an addicting game, i definitely recommend it.",1
"i opened this game and played it for 20 mins before i was going to go out with friends and then after i closed it i checked the time and its been 42 hours. 10/10 would play again",1
"great game, but 2k offers absoultely no support. i bought bnw and it broke my game. i can no longer play without memory leaks (only program on my comp that does this). i feel ripped off because the only person who made any progress in helping me fix this ing game was my cousin.  you 2k, im not buying any more of your games because your support staff are . when i ask a question i dont need a copy and pasted response. then when i answer that  response, you have the ing nerve to copy and paste another response. treat me with respect. im a ing customer that used to support you.",2
"i like this game a lot. but the trade is too hard too make.",3
"super fun, but also super time-consuming. think risk but politics focused and without all the ruined friendships.",1
"dont let the title fool you. this is actually not trusting gandhi simulator 10/10 would get rekt by gandhi again.",1
"i havent plaed it dlc free but with gode and kings or brave new world it is amazing",1
"you start at the dawn of your civilization with a small city and build up over thousands of years to forge an empire spanning across sea and land. wage wars or play it safe and let others do your fighting for you via diplomacy. the gameplay is rich and deep with many different civs and units and a long tech tree to research new technology. each game is different and provides unlimited replayability. the game becomes much more and generally a better experience with the added expansions, and i wouldnt recommend playing it without them but, the whole set can come at a price. overall i highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone should have it in there game library.",2
"i picked this up during the summer sale. i never was a big fan of strategy games until now. 80 hours later and all i can think about is napoleon is a  and if people dont stop sending missionaries into my land, im going to nuke every other civ to ashes... and theres giant death robots so theres that too.",1
"cvilization v is one of the best turn-based strategy games in existence. especially after the release of brave new world, the new expasnion for the game, it has gotten alot more interesting. even though the combat is kind of dull and weird compared to other games, it makes up for it in the grand scheme of things. its really fun to see your empire spread across the maps, which vary to endless variations, with the new map-tool for modders its almost impossible to say what cant be played on in this game. the multiplayer is also very very fun",2
"i hate ers dont add me . i ing hate your black skin. you suck big black  you  ucker english my  go back to ing africa you ing noob.  you and your  profile pic.  you ing",2
"i just wanted too come here and say rome total war was the best game of all time. all times",2
"i did all i could to be peaceful. i then got nuked by gandhi. im not sure if that says something about me or the game. anyways, yeah",1
"streamlined for fast fun, the most approachable civilization yet.",2
"11/10, easily the best game i have played in.. so long it has everything a strategy game needs, all the ways to win, you dont have to go around and killing everyone, no, you can trade and just search for what you need, you can form alliances in order to get what you need.",1
"ludicrously good game. but somehow manages to not be as good as previous installments. i love the game, but it feels somehow dumbed down.",1
"this game is by far the best turn based strategy game i have ever played. why are you reading this? you could be trying to build a civilazation that can stand the test of time! if you dont own it, you should.",3
"great game but you really need brave new world to make it the best most addicting game ever otherwise great game",1
"i played for many years the civ 3 , but civ 5 is the best of the series in my opinion!!!",1
"fantastic game! if you really like empires and kingdoms this game is for you :) i really recommend this game!",1
"complete edition on king uin . com 15 euro max +300 hours = profit",3
"once you start, you wont be able to put it down. great entry in the civilization franchise",1
"played as sweden got rekt by russia 10/10 historically accurate",1
"yknow that guy from siam? ramkhamhaeng? yeah.  that guy.",2
"pretty damn good, and this is coming from a guy that doesnt like strategy games",1
"i can play civ 24/7 without stopping... addictive, great game. if you get the patch gods and kings is complete!",3
"this is a great game of stragety, and dominance. i ighly recomend it, if you are a strategy type of person",1
"awesome multiplayer, does take some commitment though",1
"warning: this is a time machine that only goes forward. you will lose hours of your life.",2
"civilization 5, it is hard to stop your self. the addictive game play goes on for hours in one match. then when you finish that match you play a billion more with differnt options for fun! 10/10, the only rts i can play!",2
"if youre going to get it, make sure you pick up the major expansion packs as they add significant depth to the game that could otherwise be said to be a bit shallow.",2
"this game has made me forget how to sleep and love. 10/10",4
"this is a great game. is a good starting point for anyone who wants to play a 4x game. it can be simple. but as you start to gain more experience with the game you start learning how much is acutally going on within the game. it is a great single player game and a great multiplayer game. i have had tons of fun playing with others on this game. the games can be long, but they are a fun ride the whole way through.",1
"deep engaging god game with overtones of the best of everything you would want. up too late is normal as is the desire to succeed at one more something. you will eventually want to play.",2
"buy this game and you wont pay for a week of your life! dont let this special offer go away!",1
"ive played them all (civ i through this one) and i like civ v the best *now* with the additional expansions. the hex-based map is much better for realistic environments and movement. single unit stacking is also much better - no more soak-off attacks (where you have a stack of spearmen with one modern armor and the enemy kills off your spearmen one at a time while your armor remains unharmed.) it also makes upgrading your military units important because now it matters if you are holding a mountain pass with a single legion versus using a rifleman unit. beyond combat there are a lot of nice additions with diplomacy, religion, and civics that give you more ways to play and win (replayability is very important to me.)",1
"when i discovered the mods, since then i only play the msf-nation civ/civ would play another turn",1
"great game. if you are willing to sit there for hours and controll the direction a civilization evolves over the eons this is for you. if you want a fast game loook else where",1
"this game has its ups and downs: the ups can be from the statisfaction of winning a near loss victory or maybe completely wiping out some  in a war that you could only justify out of fustration with them. the downs can come from the complete failure early on in a game that has a some militarisitic  steam rolling your cultural civilization before it can get past turn 50 (im looking at you napolean!). but overall this game is an experience in itself to play with a friend or by yourself. it builds its character and charm from the antics you pull on friends during a cooperative play through, or from the complete hypocrisy of some a.i in corelation to the leader they are playing as (cough cough ghandi cough cough). all in all, civ 5 is a good game that is fun enough to validate multiple playthroughs, which i think is really important for games to be able to have nowadays.",1
"entertainment value through the roof. value of life rock bottom. do not buy, unless willing to risk life. sorry review was short, needed to warn *cough* *cough* *blarrrrghhh* ... transcript ended.",2
"basically one of the best strategic games known on pc. its vast choices of civilizations past and present to play as, different ways of achieving victories; this game is a good 8/10! i fell in love with this game the first time i layed my eyes of its gameplay and scenarios on youtube. although i would reccomend more scenarios, this game is a great game. 8/10. for strategy game lovers, this is a game you would enjoy!",1
"great game, its really easy to lose track of time when playing it. nothing like world domination to get through the day.",1
"celebrating 20+ years of gandhi nuking you off the face of the ing earth",1
"civilization v is slowly taking my social life away but im fine with that, i got my friends to buy it so theres no need for me to leave the house anymore. i highly reccomend this game, its well worth it to buy the expansions.",1
"not only the best turn-based strategy out there, also one of the best game overall. pressed play tutorial and played for 5 hours!!!! thats just the beginning.",1
"awesome game. i love the enhanced diplomacy compared to earlier civ games.",1
"with the latest expansion, brave new world, this is probably the best turn-based strategy game out there. civ 5 has now reached the pinicle of the evolution of the civ francise. i say this as a player who first played civ over 20 years ago on my 386 and has played all the civ games apart from civ 2. whereas most 90/early 2000s pc games that have been rebooted or updated in the last 5 years have been dumbed down as if developers think we are all xbawks kiddies with adhd (im looking at you simcity, hitman, wolfenstein, thief, etc), the civ series has actually been improved with time and has become a deeper game.",3
"spectacular in scope and depth. perhaps it could use more, but i think its epic as it is.",3
"civ v is an absolutley incredible, immersive, and addicting game. my praise for this game truly cannot be expressed in words. if youre on the fence about buying this at normal price, just buy it when its cheap during the summer sale, you wont regret it!",1
"a fun fame that takes very long to finish 1 game and that really helps when bored. also the multi-player is fun but a little buggy. like the city trade bug. (when someone keeps modifing a offer they can get a city for free) but besides that the game is his price worth, and you wont become bored for a long time.",1
"amazing game that forces you to balance between being nice with others and destroying your enemies to expand your empire.",2
"ive been playing sid meirs civ games for many moons. this latest incarnation is everything i hoped it would be. many hours of fun at my own pace.",1
"this game is emaculate in my opinion, par the ocassional issue with playing with people across the pond... whether you enjoy smashing the ai or making alliances and betraying your friends.. this game is one of the best strategy games out there for it.",1
"great game as long as you have paitence and dont quit like 20mins into the game. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- gods & kings is a great expansion adding religon, new units, new civs, espionage, new buildings, new tecs. five stars sid meier much better than the clustered insanity of alpha centari.",2
"the only game where you can become germany and beat england in ww2. 10/10 would hitler again.",2
"civilization 5 is very time consuming, but a fun game even the less. i can recommend this game to people who like strategy games based on board games like risk. there is not as much action as in other strategy games, but theyve improved the combat part since the last game.",1
"lost some features from civ4 but overall great sucessor",1
"there is no reason why this game shouldnt be in everyones library! this is possibly the most addiciting strategy game ive ever stumbled upon! totally worth paying for! its that perfect blend of military strategy and simulation game. youll be on here for god knows how long when you should be studying for that electronics exam (thats me) buy it!! with the dlcs!",1
"one... more... turn... the wiseman said at 5am...",1
"awesome gameplay features, truly a game for the strategic mind. a easy game to play, yet difficult to master. the wide array of features and multiplayer possibilities can make one wish they could play all day. all day or for an hour every once in a while the singleplayer mode can be just as challenging and equally as entertaining. a 10 out 10 game!",1
"probably the greatest turn based strategy game ive played to date. with all the different victory conditions, map layouts, and leaders, its like playing a different game each time. the games do take a long time though, especially playing with others, be prepared to sit down for 6 hours and play. or you can do pitboss games and the game also alows you to safe it and pick it up later.",1
"this game....this game. its like nutella. seems kiddy on the outside, but the goodness damn epic. ive never actually attracted to strategy games frankly. i was the kind of guy that was all about pew pew...pew pew games. but damn this game is easy, and enjoyable. ive heard that the older civilization games are harder than this. but this games is like an opening to anyone who wanted to try or know what a strategy game is like. now excuse me, nuking gandhi back.",1
"extremely well made turnbased strategy game, easy to play and fun. very timeconsuming.",2
"this game is a next-level strategy game. civ v is a masterpiece and now the standard for all strategy 4 ex games, and dont be suprised if you see more hex based games popping up. civ v isnt the great game it is without the expantions, unfortuantely, and you might think it wanting for more civs unless you get the expansions, which are huge by the way. civ v is another classic in the series, and it is an experience that you should want to be apart of unless you hate strategy games in general. this is one of the priemer games on pc, and is definately a must buy for any hard core gamer.",2
"the best strategy game of this gen (yes, better than starcraft ii), and its so insanely addicting games are literally played for hours on end. plus theres an attack on titan mod. nuff said.",1
"its one of the best strategy games of all times and one of my favorite steam games. with improved graphics and more in depth features than civ 4. the dlcs are definatly worth buying. also the game isnt to hard on players so players not used to strategy games have a shot on easy settings. also many people like this game. the only con is the price of the dlcs and the game. t overall 9.5/10",1
"with the brave new world expansion civ5 is probably the best turn based strategy game i have ever played.",1
"sometimes i spend >8 hours playing this at a time, my butt hurts after that. definatly 10/10",1
"a fantastic strategy game which is extremely addicting. where you lead a civilization from prehistoric times into the future! you can play on your own or with friends. if you get bored of the game you can purchase some dlcs to make your experience even better. a must buy for anyone who loves strategy games.",1
"the vatican city wants islam. 10/10 would vatican again",1
"this game is amazing (more so with the 2 expansion packs) however it is a massive time sink. if you are prepared to spend hours playing a single match and enjoy turn based strategy games then get this game",1
"its like chess on steroids. if you hate gandhi this is the game for you. 7/10",1
"great game! very addictive. i have logged around 350 hours so far.",2
"amasing strategie game really good deal especially on sale",1
"the greatest strategy game ive ever played. possibly the best game ive ever played.",3
"civ 5 is strangly addicting. i have never been a fan of turn based games, but after playing civ 5 i can say i really enjoy the strats that go into winning a game. buy and play this!",1
"what a great game, i like that you can win with methods other than barbarically taking over the world. lots of replay value, be careful this game can make the hours zip by!!",1
"all of the wonders being the same every game grates on me, because i think ill hear some campy pro player doing the pyramid rush strat and ill get sad. that aside, its a realy nice game. worth every penny of its discounted price.",2
"civilization v is the first game i played in the civilization series, recommended by my friends. the game slowly robs you of your time, absorbing you into its gameplay, until five hours have gone by and youve gone from trying to not be overrun by barbarians to blasting foreign cities with cannons while building the lourve. brave new world made the mid-game a lot more interesting and balanced, and its fun finding which nations suit your play style (burying your problems in gold, researching faster than everyone else, converting everyone to your religion, etc.). in my first playthrough, i was a militaristic japanese nation who nuked washington d.c. for some meta humor. 10/10",4
"ill try playing a diplo match... aaaaaand everyone else is dead. recommend",2
"when i play this game, i just cant stop. i always say, just one more turn, but then i look out the window and its six in the morning. 10/10 would reccomend",2
"bought civ iii a few years back. just bought this one for my mac to play at school when im bored. never thought id get into this type of strategy game, but it has me hooked.",1
"highly addicitive and fast paced - this game is perfect for any fans of turn based strategy games and is a brilliant starting point for people who want to play them. the plethora of leaders and winning conditions make the replayability of this game huge. i highly recommned it! :)",1
"good, fun, thoughtful, intense. all words i would use to describe this great game.",1
"its very addicting, and very easy to pass hours without realizing youve done so. ...just one more turn...just one more turn...",1
"each civ game takes five steps forward but one step back. for me its difficulty curve between each level is very and unnecesarily sharp, but beyond that its a very replayable game just like all of its predicessors. anyone who liked it before must buy this version.",2
"this is a very, very addicting game. if you plan on having a social life, do not get this. make sure you leave the dog several bags of food before you start, because you will forget everything once you start playing. also, get the expansion packs for the best experience, and try out the mods because they are easy to get. make sure you use the directx 10&11 version, not windows 8 touchscreen version, unless you are on a touchscreen device. you will spend hours on this game and it is very fun, i recommend this game highly.",1
"really fun, if a bit hard to get used to, but prepare for a very, very, long game. like 3 days long....",1
"this game is pretty good, but after about 50 hours, i got bored of it. still a good game though.",1
"theres nothing you can do... start playing, and youll end up knowing only one sentence: one more turn. nuff said.",1
"its really fun if you have time on your hands. its better if you have friends to play with.",1
"i cant do any work anymore because i end up playing this 10/10",3
"long fun games. just make sure you get all the dlc. the game is pretty useless without all dlc.",1
"amazing game to play with friends or single player",1
"a fascinating game with a fantastic gameplay. a strategic and very beautiful game filled with different empires and civilizations. as i say to my friends its like chess but more advanced! and that is what it is, as nobody makes peace with the person you are playing chess with for money etc. its also amazing due to all the mods thatre very easy to download to the game, thats where i usually find realistic mods, like true start locations for real world, global warming etc. and then i play as denmark and go full viking all around the world! its an amazing game that one can use too many hours on.",4
"the most adictive strategy game ever made. every time i play, the game has a new interesting challenge for me. i wouldnt know how to improve a game as perfect as this particular one. 100/10.",2
"civilization is a great game for people who want to take a few hours and think of all the ways they want to take over the world as the next super power. whether it be by having better science, creating a massive and superior army or just bribing all of the other world leaders. the choces are pretty much endless.",1
"i liked the turned based pace of the game that was not frantic like other real time strategy games. it is also much more involved politically and socially than other strategy games such as age of empires.",1
"this game is just like the movie lincoln...really boring and goes on for ing ever.",1
"peaceful strategy game with fantastic music, wonderful quotes from famous people, and amazingly accurate historical information within. due to its slower and highly strategic gameplay, its probably not for everyone. but it is easy to learn; it plays like a much like if chess, risk (stratego), and warhammer 20k had a baby; but with historically accurate units and structures. however, be aware that this game is a horrendous resource hog. no matter how powerful your machine, this game will slow it down.",2
"beautiful and intrigiung game. highly recomend for all audiences.",1
"its the only game where you can start at 8 am and stop at 8 pm, and realise that 2 whole days has passed.",2
"i once was a normal college student, then i discovered this game. there went my nights of sleep, my days of classes, everywhere i went, there was civ. civ took me for a magical ride, we had much love. i introduced civ to my friends, they were hooked. we all played civ, but sometimes they played without me! how dare they, i say! civ is mine. and so i killed them. civ belongs only to me. civ is love. civ is life.",2
"great game, very fun to play and make decisions with friends.",1
"become irrationally xenophobic in only a few playthroughs. 10/10",2
"great game, but it has taken over my life! i just cant put it down.",1
"a wonderful game to waste away hours on. so many possibilities and strategies to learn, all played at your own pace. this is a great improvement on previous civs, totally worth the money 100%.",1
"great game to pass the time .a must buy if on sale!",1
"this is a very enjoyable game if you have the patience to play it to its full potential",3
"best gandhi nuking simulator out at the moment. ++ can nuke the gandhi ++ addicting -- gandhi can nuke you",1
"quite honestly one of the best games i have ever played. start off by playing single player, get good at the game, and then play with friends and in reliable online communities online to get the best out of civ 5. tons of replayability and easily will become one of your most played games. 10/10 would pay full price again.",5
"time sucking. youll startat 8 am and next thing youll know itll be dark out.",2
"control youre empire, rule the world, and destroy youre enemies! ive had amazing fun on this game trying to be the best civilization, its hours and hours of fun that i would reccomnded to anyone that loves stratergy games",1
"if the real world was like civ 5, russia would own all ov asia and england would still be pissed at america for going t war 3000 years ago 10/10 would nuke as gandhi again",5
"start up a game of civ 5, lose a day of life, worth it",1
"holy hell this game is fun as heck! i freaking love it so far, even though i barely played an hour. 10/10 so far.",1
"great game!!!!!! they need to come out with more mods to make the game better",1
"after many many many many many hours of playing civ i can assure anybody that it is fantastical. for maximum pleasure ensure that you get all the dlc - gotta catch em all!",2
"this game has very fun single player that i have spent hours on my only complaint is the fact the multiplayer is very weak",1
"this is one jewel of a game. this has to be the greatest kingdom managing sim out there, if you get the expansion packs then it is the best. i wish it had most of the expansion pack fetures at start, and that kinda feels like a money grab. but the money is worth it.",1
"excellent gameplay, a must-have for every strategy fan!",2
"a very enjoyable game that requires strategy, depending on what difficulty you choose. its really fun because of the four ways one can win the game: domination, science, culture or diplomatic. in my opinion, the easiest victory to get is domination because the ai is aggresive but that shouldnt hinder getting achieving victory by other means.",1
"this game is great i have played over 100 hours and loved every second. you can settle, trade, fight, make alliances, make enemies, get ing owned by barbarians, and build nukes. 10/10 will build more cities again. map editor + mods + multiplayer + single player ++ ai (very mean ghandi declared war on me) +-",1
"just one more turn before bed. just one more, man. just one turn. 6 hours later, still playing civ. 9/10.",1
"this game is my favourite strategy game that i know of. lots of depth, tons of content and replayabliilty, dlc is completely worht it, and with mods you can play this game for days without realizing what time it is. great graphics, beautiful ui, and immersive gameplay creates a must play. do yourself a favour and try this game.",2
"the gold standard of city building rts. this game is visually beautiful and everytime i play it i discover a new strategy to give myself and edge. combined with multiple ways to win it gives you endless replayability.",1
"have you ever sat down and wondered i want a game where all you have to do is make sandwiches for cats? well then you came to the wrong place, because this game will take you on a journey where every turn is a new adventure. you can destroy nations, launch nukes, make cats sandwiche- wait......... no, yeah thats right. so i recomend you pick up this game as soon as you can 2/10 would play again.",1
"one of the best strategy games ive ever played and it keeps getting better with each expansion. the complete edition is very much worth picking up, too - very few of the dlcs arent worth going through.",1
"if someone could donate me all of the dlc, i will shove a marijuana needle up your  out of love <3",1
"its a great game,but you should get and least gods and kings to go with it",1
"premium title that is fun, civ is the standard for turn based strategy games.",5
"really nice game if you like the turned based strategy stuff",1
"what can you say that hasnt been said? im not funny enough for a one liner review...every iteration of civ is better. love the new non stackable units. much more strategic and puts emphasis on each individual unit. smooth graphics, fun mods, better luxury management. aaa title for a reason.",1
">founded a new religion >used icon for shinto >called it gateyness >10/10 would make drunk religion again.",1

"if you value your social life, dont buy this game.",1
"cannot stop playing this game. ruined my life. 5 stars.",1
"this game is the best strategy game i have ever played, i truly think it is a great game to get have fun!",1
"where ghandi is a nuke-utilising tyrant, a 17th century ship of the line has a further viewing distance than a naval vessle of the 20th century, with its back-dated telescopes and even then, you can build a pyramid in the water. ill have you know that because of this, im sold. goty 1000/10 a++ *explosions*",2
"reading all these reviews are really adicting, ( i finaly beat ghandi",2
"my friend and i started playing...i became a warmorger...he unfriend me. 10/10",1
"great entry in the civ series if you dont mind the glacial pace the game runs at. even on my quad core i find that the turns take a while to process long before you get that far into the game, slowing things down to a crawl. still, the graphics are nice and are quite an improvement over iv. recommended for fans of the series.",1
"472 hours in and the game is still as dynamic and engaging as ever.",3
"i recommend this game due to the enticing game mechanics. the sense of actually building your civilization from the ground up starting at practically stone age all the way to futuristic technology and 4 different ways to win the game... i find this game inticing.",1
"very fun game to play. ai is incredibly stupid at certain things. also if you get the game buy the complete edition. the game is incomplete without them.",3
"this is a must have for any kind of strategy player. hundreds of hours of potential game play. easily a 10/10, a gem of a game.",1
"my first actual pc video game... i remember ruling the world as otto van bismark, annihilating all those who stood in my way. i was only 12 when i got this game, but it definitely changed my gaming life, from ps2, to glorious pc rigs. get this game as soon as possible, and if possible, get the brave new world dlc. not only does it add to the game, but it also could stand on its own. 9.5/10",3
"the best strategy game i have ever played 11out of 10",4
"epic - if youre not that in to fps games and such and like a good thinker and strategy with a civilization thats constant developing their tech to kill an enemy or get loved by the ppl then i recommend that you buy this game now while its on sale on steam!!!",1
"this is the best strategy game i have ever played. 10/10",1
"if you have a lot of free time its game for you :))",1
"civ 5 is an awesome strategy game; its definitely the best turn based strategy game ive played. its not like most other strategy games which are just war, civ 5 lets you take any path, weather it is war or peace, and still win. the scale is also much larger than other strategy games; youre building a country on a planet, not making a military base in a mile x mile map. the interface is very informative and there are so many ways to play that anybody can become an accomplished player. there are very few things i have to nit-pick about, but i wish there was a system of authorizing mods to be fair to use and still get achievements, because i have some legit mods i really like, but using them turns off achievements. still, i highly recommend civ 5, but beware, they arent kidding about just... one... more... turn... it keeps you wanting to play it!",1
"one time i peed in someones pool while standing on the outside of it. good game.",1
"i really do love this game. even better get it on sale for $5 off!",1
"this is great for those of you who love strategy games. thats all ill say. its that good.",1
"this game is so much better than beyond earth! beyond earth isnt that great of a game like this one, my favourite thing about this game is that you go up in ages from a round wheel to space age, but beyond earth its all in the same age with only technological upgrades and the units you get.. well lets just say theres not a lot. prefer this game 10 out of 10 than beyond earth! well lets just wait, the game was only recently released hoefully they will put in a lot more dlc into the game to make it more fun, at least put in more units than just the basic ones. still have no idea how to use the jets yet so complicated or maybe its just glitched out because i cant make them move any where around the map or to hover/guard a tile",1
"civ 5 is a complex and unbelivebly polished game with great expansions to boot. the mechanics are simple and the inteferce is generally well done. diplomacy, religion, science and combat are so well intertwined with each other and makes for countless strategies and hours of gameplay. i personally feel that there is not much that is lacking apart from perhaps a better way to give new players an idea of what each victory condition means and also give certain hints, e.g for cultural victory have a set amount of wonders that are required so new players can work towards them. 10/10",1
"civilization v ranks in as my favorite pc game of all time, hands down. the depth, the strategy, and the amount of fun in this game while playing long matches that take several days just to complete is wonderful. there are so many countries to choose from and each have their own special stats and boosts. it takes a long time to be able to play at higher difficulties, but thats the beauty of it. the replayability is the highest of any game ive played. this is by far, a 10/10 game.",2
"very good looking modern strategy game. although many would say that it had its work cut out for it following civ4, civ5 manages to still offer an amazing strategic experience.",1
"civ 5 is one of the best games out there!!! honestly the amount of time i have spent playing this one game is astounding the modding community is great, and firaxis games are one the best and most caring devs ever the expansions add a absurd amount of contect for an already amazing game for $12 for all the dlc why do you not have this game!!!",3
"very catchy, well designed turn-based strategy i spent over 24 hours on in 3 days. i was kinda surprised how much fun it was to play it. so far, i played only multiplayer, so i cant comment campaign. early phase of game is very dynamic, its little bit more lazy in late game. pros are also very nice graphics, which are pleasing the eye. a small con is quite high hardware requirement for turn-based strategy generally. hosting a late game with a lot of troops was quite pain even on decent gaming computer.",1
"one more turn.... just one more turn... just one more-- oh, whats that? ive been here for four hours? oh well, im already running late, just one more turn shouldnt hurt... and maybe one more after that...",1
"the newest game in the civilization series and the best in my opinion since civ 2.",1
"you guy should get this its so much fun with multiple people.",1
"is the fifht symphony of the strategy games ever created",1
"i dont understand how this game can be one of the most popular strategy games... its s-h-i-t... im not kidding, awful hexagone-style gameplay, didnt like it at all, but i have to admit that in the beginning when i first tried it out, i liked the diplomacy aspect of the game... the rest.. no so much",1
"super fun time consuming game if you like ruling and creating an empire! especially with friends :d",1
"i really enjoyed this game. cant wait for beyond earth.",1
"i have over 150 hours on this ing thing and ive still only won one game. buy it.",1
"i just love this game, the only thing i am not into is the long loading times. but the music and description for each culture, the quotes for every new technology and just the all out game play is great.",1
"its civilization, the latest edition. the civ ais all seem pretty similar, and politics means jack. expect every world leader (except maybe one or two) to constantly lie to you. they will form a city near you, then complain to you that youre building cities to close to their territory. the politics actually reminds me a lot of alpha centauri. just expect a fight, constantly. get as many of the city states on your side as possible, its the best way to stay ahead. i did manage to surround germany with submarines while i was poland and constantly lied about not worrying about the buildup of troops near the borders. felt a little poetic when i just invaded because i felt like it.",1
"its a fun strategy game that makes you feel like youre a god and tactical genius, so yeah; at the end of the day, you had a good time.",1
"this game will take all your free time away, and no matter how long you try and resist and walk away from you computer, you will always return.",1
"this game sucks you in. like a black hole. a giant, scary black hole. youll be wondering at the end of the night how several hours have passed so quickly...",1
"as one great meme would say.... nuke all the civs!!",1
"a game that fails to justify its very existence through sheer lack of innovation; and that doesnt say when that started. one of the most overrated games of the past several years.",1
"love civ v! unlimited replayability, great modding community and endless hours of fun!",1
"i love this game, but honestly i had no idea how i got to play it or that it was even in steam for purchase, i purchased another steam game and this was all ready for me to install. had i known i mite have bothered with the multiplayer setting i loved this game since i a kid id still loved it and cant wait till the development team decide its time to upgrade it even more so and give it a awesome out of this world make 3d first person view make over.",1
"anyone that is a fan of turn based strategy games will enjoy civ can you stand the test of time",3
"i have been using this game to predict upcoming world events, and it has been about 85% accurate in 60 cases. 9/10",1
"a in my opinion. i started with civ 3 and loved it. then civ 4 came and disapointed me. after the release of gods and kings, civ v has become one of the best turned-based strategy games of all time, later brave new world does a lot to improve civ v. this game is super addictive, be careful.",1
"the best strategy game ever, making days feel like hours. really time consuming but in a way that you do not even notice",2
"i used to think this would be to hard for me to play, but when i started its was easy and fun. i recommend this game.",1
"our words are backed with nuclear weapons - mahatma gandhi the terrible of india nothing more to say. 10/10",3
"you get to go after a medieval rome with a b17 fighter, destruction ensues",1
"some features surpass civ4 but the combat system is still something i sorely miss. however, with the brave new world dlc, the game became more interesting for me! trade routes and defending them game my game new life. i still wish paradox would get a budget like this for their games.",1
"civilization v is a huge step forward in the strategy genre. 11/10, 3 thumbs up!",2
"this is a fantastic game. it heavily relies on strategy and skill, very little luck-based. the dlcs also make it much better.",2
"this game is so much fun, and can consume so much of your time. i hear alot of things from people who have played the series saying that its not as good as iv, but having never played the series, it was amazing. pick up this game now.",1
"real classic: it would be shame to miss it if you are even slightly interested into strategy games.",1
"beautiful graphics, and a great strategy game. if you have some time on your hands, pick up civ v. rating:",1
"a huge improvement over civ 4 and the dlcs for the game are brilliant.",1
"this is hands down the best turn-based strategy game i have ever played. as soon as i got into my first match, i knew this game was amazing. if you ever sit around and say if only i ruled the town/country/world things would be better! nows your chance to prove it by ruling your own town/country/world. will you be a ruthless tyrant, or a shrewd diplomat? will you destroy your neighbors, or peacefully coexist with them throughout the centuries? its your choice. thats what civ 5 is all about: you shaping your empire the way you want it.",1
"sick game, has me hooked for hours every time. alot of depth to how it work.",1
"absolutely epic game. a vortex of time consumption.",2
"one of my favorites. when you first start the game, you can hardly stop. you can choose a famous leader from throughout the time. and each have it speciality, and you choose how you will conquer the world; by by war, by politic or science and more. its all up to you. this game is a must. prepare to be consumed for hours. :d 10/10 <3",1
"this is a time consuming - high learning curve game. not as difficult as the older ones though.",4
"with the release of brave new world, the mecahincs of civ v finally feel reasonably streamlined. always something to build, lots of ways to achieve victory, and culture and tourism really feel like epic options to pursue. i would have to recommend getting both expansions to get the most comprehensive experience. the map and civ packs are also great additions, as each has radically different civs to try. theres a civ for every playstyle",1
"nice, civilization on linux. it is working realy good. tryed it on both ubuntu 12.04 and 13.10.",1
"ghandi-is-an- simulator 2014. 11/10 would get nuked by ghandi again.",1
"civv (with all its major expansions included) is the ultimate civ experience. they have taken all my favorite features of past games & smoothed them out and just generally made the whole game more accessible to a larger audience.",2
"for pc users great game loads of fun but for mac users the game crashes at around turn 150",1
"best strategy game ive ever played, its silly how addicting this game is. once you start a game and you get into it - you instantly forget about time.",1
"civ 5 is one of those games where you look at the clock, and 6 hours have passed. a game where you will stay on for one more turn 10/10 would buy again",1
">gets brave new world expansion >selects germany as civilization >industrial era has been discovered >fully levels out autocracy >declares war on england and france >burns and pillages any city that has judahism as its religion. 10/10 sieg heil",1
"dominated the world as ethiopia with banana exports through the roof 10/10",1
"you will not regret buying this game. i highly suggest it. please buy.",1
"this game is super addicting, its enormous fun. with the steam workshop, hundreds of custom content are at your fingertips to control.",1
"this game is awsome.... with dlc. its not as fun without it and having more civ to play with is always better",1
"playing since civ iii, the series just gets better and better",1
"veryy good game. amazing with friends but also very good for playing alone.",3
"extreamly fun game to play! would defintly recommend!",1
"civ 5 has finally become better than civ 4 thanks to g+k and bnw expansions. brave new world expansion is definitely worth picking up as it gives the game critical mass of features to make it fun to play finally.",1
"this was the first civilization game i ever played, also one of my first pc games as well. being a first timer to the game, and the 4x genre itself, i was pleasantly surprised by the expansive tutorial and how easy the game is to get into. easy to learn, difficult to master, as they say. the base game is quite good, but i would really recommend the complete edition, brave new world being my favorite of the dlcs, refining the cultural victory type into an addictive way to dominate your enemies, not to mention the new world congress where words and legislation are just as sharp and damning as swords and military might. this was my first pc game to break 100 hours, shocking me at how soon and easily this feat was achieved. it is an endlessly playable game with layer upon layer of content. i heartily recommend this to anyone, even if new to the genre.",1
"ok, even the base game by itself is to fun, now add dlc to mix this game is gold if your a strategic thinker!",1
"great game, meiers never seems to disappoint. the expansions are a bit pricey in my opinion but what game doesnt have expensive dlc anymore? but yeah, id definitely recommend. game for everyone with steam",1
"an amazing game! spent days playing. plenty of mods available to spice things up. ultimately, my favourite game :)",3
"civilization v is one of the best games ive ever played. buy it.",1
"a good game~and it spent many time to play i can play one game up to 12 hour",1
"great game, i only wish their were more option when interacting with other leaders.",1
"this game is great for all kinds of players. for those that like to be a war mongering leader, to those who want to out class their opponents in technology, and even for the peace lover who wants to win by diplomacy or culture. with all the expansions there are so many choices for civilizations and ways to play, the replay value is amazing. i love to personally play team games with my frineds online, but the options for freestyle single player or situation games makes this a game that i cant get enough of.",2
"great game, if you get the dlcs called g&k and bnw. only thing i have against it is that mods are not supported for multiplayer.",4
"highly addictive game! recommended for all turnbased strategy fans",1
"frankly this game keeps me hooked longer than i thought one year later i was astonished to see how much time ive spent on this game",2
"my first review in steam. so, firstly this game very addictive and fascinating, but sometimes it can be very difficult and confusing. the game develops skills in person, such as tact, thoughtfulness, develops in different fields of science: economics, politics, military affairs, etc. the game has bugs, lag, crash (in multiplayer), but they are rare",1
"good game! never plaly this before going to bed. its way to addictive.",1
"do not buy this game. i bought the game, started it once and immediately it crashes. i open it again, select the right direx and nothing hapens. i have tryed all and i mean all!!!!",1
"bought the civ 5 brave new world expanison a day before it went on sale for 7 dollars. fml 10/10",1
"killed a knight with a bazooka best game eu m8! 15/10 ps: all hail to the zulus!",1
"amazing, epic game feel, tons of stuff in game, great multiplayer setup.",1
"really good product, ever since i first tried kfc i couldnt get enough of it. thanks to kfc i will never be hungry again. 9/10 (could have better nuggets).",1
"super great strategy game, but it gets a little old for me. if youre a fan of strategy games of its type, it is one of the best.",1
"brilliant all round really, excellent if you just wish to pass the time, or if youre up for more of a challenge! 5 stars!!",1
"before i played civ 5 i thought the series sounded confusing and boring... 150+ hours of game play later i realize that i love sid god damn meier.",2
"now i know why so many people talked about one more turn. this game somehow stimulate my reward center in my brain and making me addicted to it.",1
"this game should come with an addiction counselor...",3
"extremely well thought out and balanced game. if you like turn based strategy, this is one of the best ones out there.",2
"this is the strategy game ive waited for a long time. challlenging concepts but easy to master controls makes you feel like you hold the civilization in your hand. best of all is that multiplayer with friends and players is even more exciting by adding a whole other level of depth and mystery to the game. for anyone interested in strategy or military games this game is an essential for your personal game collection. happy gaming!",1
"its really fun. i dont think its fun without the gods and kings dlc. (havent gotten it yet but looking forward to it). there are many achievements as well.",3
"civilization v is one of the best games ive ever played. as a lover of strategy, i would recommend this to anybody that enjoy thinking long hours. if you love to build empires, fight wars, and conquer and rule empires, then this is a game for you!",1
"very great game! too bad im too stupid to know how to play xd",1
"this is by far the best game i picked up during the summer sale. i didnt think i would enjoy it very much, but its been a blast. even though the majority of the gameplay is clicking text boxes and moving along a map--its strangely engrossing and extremely compelling. if you enjoy turn based games this game will likely entertain you for hundreds of hours. put history in a blender, hit puree, and see what comes out.",1
"a very enjoyable turn-based strategy game. a quick game of civ has ruined many lan parties by taking up all our time.",1
"one of the best strategy games ive ever played. its charming, witty, funny, and plays very smoothly, with very few bugs. the ai is intelligent, the maps excellent, and the game suceeds where so many others havefailed to captivate me.",1
"welp, 1.) im very picky about games 2.) i dont usually go for games like this. 3.) i was pretty skeptical when i got it. i dont regret anything, its an amazing game. except if youre looking for friendship... i asked william for friendship about 13 times and each time he denied me until i took over all his cities. and now brazil hates me... so yeah thats cool. 15/10 would get again <<<",1
"the one series where you can effectively say  you to a nation/leader that you hate. high replay value and you get a different experience each time you play.",3
"this game should have a surgeon generals warning on it. i mean, look at my play time ffs...",2
"never thought id get into a game like this but now im addicted!",1
"the joy this game has brought me is pretty much unlimited. i can say my grad work and home projects have been neglected mutliple times because i got knee deep in a new campaign. addicting game with lots of awesome game mechanics. i dont play as much anymore mainly because i dont have the time but whenever i get a spare moment, i hop on to play for as long as i possibly can. love this game!",1
"great game to play with friends, i suggest if your gonna get this games dlcs, they bring alot to the table 10/10",1
"let out your inner leader and nuke the world to send your rivals back to the stone age!",1
"civ v has taught me much about everything. from handy quotes such as dont trust a computer you cant throw out a window, to ghandis true nuke-loving personality. seriously, this game couldnt be better. in fact, i tried to think of ways it could be better, and my head started leaking red fluid. true story. best enjoyed, in my opinion, with some hot chocolate and a ham sandwich. now you that, and im going to go to a hospital",1
"the only time youre ever going to see germany ask greece for money to stay afloat.",1
"brilliant game is you like strategy games espicially if you have a day to spend creating an empire or taking others as your own . lots of fun for hours on end and gets better with friends",1
"a very fun and strategic game where you lead your armies and into battle or have allies to boost your economy, the way you play effects the entire game, not the civilizations bonus.",5
"you have to get this game as it is amazing and the mods give even more replay ability",2
"this game has many choices, just make sure you make the right ones",1
"when you first start to play the game you think oh, this is a cool game. then, as you progress and develop the bill paying skills, you press the steam workshop button and you realize hey, theres a mod for that. ipso facto your playing a game with hitler, churchill, hirihito, mussolini, stalin, and fdr with an iron man rolling through your enemies cities while your helicopter gunships rain nukes upon them and your cities have over a hundred citizens and 500 production...then stalin declares war on your capitalist *** and your sending sitting bull with your tanks to lay down the law. at least i think thats how history went...sure why not, theres a mod for that anyway.",1
"this is real laggi and sheet. bi ths fukin game asshol",1
"love this game. civ is just one of those games were you could casully play and dominate the world, or play competitivly and still have the same amount of fun.",1
"great game. just make sure you get the expansions.",2
"great when you have friends to play with but can become boring when without friends to chat with. if you love fast pace action packed games this is not for you, if you love strategy then youll have a blast.",1
"nice game. really njoy it but the multiplayer got some problem. hope fixed soon.",1
"good casual strategy game for people who like to lead.",1
"hands down amazing game, very simple gaemplay, and very very very addicting, must do one more turn!!! is what you will be saying.",4
"civilization v is a very fun game for just messing around on or playing with friends. i have played this game for hours on end and keep finding myself coming back for more, i highly recomend this game. 10/10",1
"its alot of fun building from the ground up! its a very long game,but very enjoyable.",2
"an amazing, addictive, turn based strategy. modding and multiplayer are incredibly easy to use. brave new world is an awesome expansion! if you havent played it, go buy it. now.",1
"its a really fun game. you lose track of your time as you try to conquer the empires near you to win the game. i would even recommend this to people so they can lose their social lives too lol. 10/10 lose your life if you buy this game",1
"great game! love taking turns with my friends, takes awhile but is worth it!!",2
"this game does not even start up or anything. does not work.",1
"i beat ghandi in a nuclear war but lost to korea in science...fml 10/10",1
"probably my favorite game ever. took some time to get used to changes from iv, but i said the same about iv from iii...",4
"if you are looking for an action packed game were you can rapidly take over cities and take over the world this isnt for you. i played the game for a couple of hours and i just got bored. there isnt really anything wrong with the game it is just slow pace and if you want fast pace action you are out of luck. however if you are pacient and dont mind spending hours on one game session then this may be a game that you enjoy. please tell me if this comment helped you decide whether to buy the game or not.",1
"very fun game to play on both singleplayer and multiplayer. great strategy game that allows you to test different scenarios that you choose to craft. highly recommended to you guys!",3
"an extremely complex strategy game that sucks you in with its mesmerizing depth and unregulated pacing. it may seem overwhelming at first but you will find yourself glued to this game for hours while surrendering former real-world provisions such as food and sleep. the only major shortcoming this game has is the ai, which is often irrational at best and stupid at worst. the game clearly favors war over diplomacy, but regardless there is more than enough strategy to last you for hundreds of hours.",2
"spend 20 hours playing one game just to get nuked by ghandi, 11/10 must buy",2
"really fun and addicting played 12 hours and its so fun. i recommend this game to everybody who likes strategy games.",1
"a massive time suck lol but its supposed to be. if you liked the other civs youll like this one.",3
"whenever i try to play it i end up playing it for way to long. great game.",1
"excellent game. you end up spending a lot of time, but its very relaxing. the expansions make it much better.",1
"developed nukes before ghandi. won. 420/69 would irradiate again.",1
"got to say, i received this game for free, tried it... and didnt like it.... but then... how do i have all the dlc? well, if you are one of those who didnt like it at first.... give it a try for several hours, i dont know how but it hooks you up and then drives you through unsuspected hours of fun. the basic game is good enough, but there is a point at late/middle game where you may feel it lacking your interest, the dlc fixes those and completes the game holes. some may remain but hey, give it a shot ;) i bought it later with all the dlc included, for me... the developers did a good game, earned my money.",1
"i won the game on babylon, even though they died out at about 334 b.c. 11/10 would defy history again",1
"i took over the world as a facist george washington. 10/10 would nuke again.",3
"i have lost too many hours to this game, but its all been worth it. this is hands down one of the best strategy games out there, if not the best.",1
"a very fun and easily recommended game. sid meiers civilization v is a game sorta like age of empires where you build up a colony and then fight. the replay ability is awesome but there is something you must know. this game can get tedious. one game took me 2 days to complete. it was lots of fun while playing but i had to do tons of upgrades. it is really fun though and i recommend playing with your friends. 8/10!",1
"im writing this at 6am. i woke up at 11am the day before. this games terrible for my health =( 11/10",1
"very addictive, highly suggest people play this game. i also find it passes time, a lot of time, infact days! no really, it is addictive!:) 10/10",1
"i was egypt and didnt build the pyramid, had the greatest science base in the world  you newton kappa 12/10",1
"when i play i cant stop. it has ruined my life. my wife has left me and i cant see my children anymore. i havent been outside in 2 weeks. 4/5",1
"must have pc game. civ v is brilliant in almost every way, you can easily drop a few hours into a single session.",1
"this game is tons of fun with any expansion and if you play with friends it only gets better.",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. such addictive one more turn gameplay. everybody needs to try this at least once.",3
"this game game is the virtual military version of monopoly it consumes lives and time and will destroy freindship, still a great game though.",1
"if you are a fan of the civilization series, you will enjoy this game. great replay value.",2
"not as good as civ 4 but still great in its on right",1
"a grown up classic, for strategy lovers. i can re-play it several times after years and never get tired of it. fight wwii soldiers with medieval archers in 1800. chinese and polynesians.",1
"sid meier still get it, civ 5 is awesome ! with the first addon gods and kings it kicked civ4 from my favorite place of all civilization parts (played 1, net, 2, 3, 4 and 5). new tactics with a few changes like the hexagon fields on the map, only one military and only one civil unit on one field. great looking graphics and still one of the best gui i ever used in a strategie game. top !",3
"an all time favorite. removing stacked units has really changed the strategy in this game compared to previous iterations.",3
"i saw this game, and was willing to give it a try as it was cheap in the 2013 christmas sale on steam. man am i gald i did buy this game, if you are looking for a fun to play and interesting strategy game that you can stress over and sink countless hours into, then this is the game for you. oh and one last thing, dont trust ghandi, youll thank me later.... 8/10",1
"simply amazing. i love it and in my opinion it is the best game ever created on any platform",4
"probably the most-played game in my library. highly recommended!",2
"i recomend it because its fun to play with friends. just watch out so you dont make them your enemies.",1
"why are you reading the reviews and not already downloading the game!?",1
"this game wont let me play with my friends using game share can any1 help me",1
"if you like this type of game then how come you arent buying it and reading this instead!",1
"civ 5 is a great game for those who have patience and time to waste.",1
"very fun, but also a very long game. pref playing with a bunch of friends. but single player is just as good.",1
"just. one. more. turn. seriously. as a person pretty inexperienced with civilization, i had a lot of fun learning the game. i love how the game play and objectives can change depending on which civilization you decide to pick! there is plently of replayability, and i think both people new and old to the series will find a lot of enjoyment. picking up the bundle is highly reccomended so you can at least get gods & kings along with some dlc.",1
"lengthy gameplay, with little to do other than spam-build monuments. the way combat works is very bad, but the way you build up your civilizations country & cities i like. overall, i dislike the game and have pretty much wasted 35 on 11 hours of gameplay of which i generally hated.",1
"love this game! not really used to playing these types of games. however im really into this! the best thing about it is the amount of people you get in a game (wheher its ai or online players). its just means there is always something to do, be aware of and work towards. some games, you have to wait a many turns to accomplish something. in civ 5 it seems like you are constantly working towards a goal.",1
"it is a good game, yes, but to be very enjoyable and to have any mentionable replay value, you need all of the expansions. dont forget to grab them as well. it goes on sale often, so keep an eye out. it is definitely a fantastic game if you enjoy real-time strategy, and i highly recommend it.",1
"a relaxing, immensely stimulating, and imaginative game. i recommend it more highly than anything else i own; wtih 274 hours currently on record, it is by far the game ive played the most. managing empires with the highly varied gameplay of random maps to explore and different alliances to make ensures that, at least for me, it never gets old. difficulty ranges widely as well. its the kind of game that can be played anywhere and is fun to show people. playing with friends is a blast, as you ally and compete on the global stage. if i could pick one game to play for the rest of my life, it would be civ 5.",2
"a game about growing cities and giant people and animals that protect them. gandhi nukes/10",1
"awesome game. endless replayability. cant wait for the next one!",2
"this is one of my favorite games ever. if you dont have this game something is wrong with you",2
"i thought i knew how to play this game, but then i realized recently ive never even thrown a nuke at someone in game. i have so much more to learn. ill keep playing until i can win the space race by turn 3.",1
"i played civ v for 4+ years before i got the expansion packs. i love the game as a whole, but unfortunately the expansion packs have taken away a lot of the fun that i had while playing civ v. there is quite a lot more going on than there was in the original game, so much so that the it is almost too much to handle. im sure ill get used to it in time, but, as of now, i would recommend either only buying the game and not the packs, or buy it all, but play without the packs until you get the hang of the game.",2
"fun game but it can be kinda laggy still very fun!",2
"seriously, hi is one of the best games ive ever played. theres amassive world, aninfinite amount of possibilities for playhrough, and a great community in the steam workshop. especially great with the gods and kings + brave new world dlc. also, really appreciated the mta nui map mo. brought back some memories.",1
"amazing... must have for any people who enjoy rts games.",3
"beware, this game warps time. what seems like 2 hours is actually 5 days",1
"all the usual reccomendations. old game by now but still solid, especcially with expansions and dlc.",3
"fantastically well done game, each expansion pack completely revamps systems.",1
"basically you get to reright history so you can be gandhi the great warmonger or atilla the fun or even have the great wall of america who knows the rome could even go to space and its good and you should play it cuz its good yaay",2
"simply a perfect game. buy the game, play it and be happy!",3
"my favourite in the series and all in all an amazing game",1
"although i used to play civ v religiously (one more turn!), ive turned into grand strategy games for more depth and strategy. civ v complete is still a good game but i can never play it the same way after gsgs.",1
"1 whole game took me 15 hours.... worth it. live ruining, #never see outside world again! 11/10",1
"good game, brave new world and gods and kings are good addons. played as denmark and butted the rest of the world alongside sweden. ww3 confirmed",1
"most addicting games ive played yet. can play whenever you want. during when doing homework, work, etc. so far my most played game.",2
"its a fu strategic game which allows you to see what countries would be like if they started in different parts of the world or with different resources",4
"another great game. though i stopped bying the addons. samey samey..",1
"highly addictive and would recommend to anyone who feels like they dont want to see the sun for a while. i have had many sleepless nights cursing the queen of england, or the emperor of rome.",1
"this game is so addicting... i always find myself saying just one more turn, just one more turn. its incredibly in depth, smooth, beautiful, and fun. so many different ways to play and win. if you like strategy games then this game is definitely worth a look.",1
"come enjoy the worlds first fifth nation management simulator!",1
"very good. best gameplay out of most of the civ games",2
"this game is addicting it turns someone who hated turn based strategy games into an addict of them and its amazing...might want to not start a game of it before you go to bed because you will stay up all night and play it this is a very long game but i recommend it to everyone! it also is steam workshop enabled so that means you can mod it up and play on the same maps as tamriel in elder scrolls and the lands in the lord of the rings! giant death robot nuff said",1
"good turn based addiction 1 turn to 200 in a blink of an eye. cant stop yet ....and suddenly your whole day is gone.",1
"i know people have some gripes with this game, but with the new expansion packs this game could be one of the funnest turn based strategies out there. its very unique and a very fun game to play at a lan party. i recommend this game.",1
"pretty fun with all the expansions. vanilla civ is meh",2
"on my first playthrough, i got to play as washington. i got the opportunity to liberate the indians with freedom and nuke japan. 11/10 would murica again.",1
">think it wont be a great game buy it anyway >love it >play it all day think about it all night >stop doing basic things (sleeping, eating, bathing), my civilization is more important >play all day and all night, do nothing else >ruined my life 11/10 would play all day and all night again. i without a doubt do not regret playing this game, even though i hated strategy games i was persuaded by friends to buy this and am i glad i did. this is one of the best games i have played its one of the top 3 which include bioshock infinite and skyrim. each play through can be different (depending on who you play with... im talking about you alfie). the amount of different ways you can play is amazing i cant get enough of it.",1
"on my first play through every other leader declared war on me. for no reason. 10/10.",1
"if you ever wondered what it would be like to use stealth bombers on knights, this is the game for you.",1
"i could play this game every day of my life until i died, and id still want to play more.",1
"warning: play only if you have a decent time to spend. you dont play 14 hours straight in a bad game. 11/10 would recommend.",1
"what is this game, and why have i suddenly lost 6 hours of my life",1
"i completly forgot to vote on election day because of this game. thanks obama/10",1
"the perfect balance between complicated and playable, the dlc is a must though.",1
"do you think you sleep too much? do you have too much spare time? worry no more - the nevest civ is here! get started, and after you have played one more turn... ...your alarm reminds you that 18 hours have passed and its time to get to school again. great game!",2
"i played quite a bit in lan so far in coop mod against ais... its alot of fun and quite addictive... and well, you tell yourself after lunch... ok lets play half an hour! then you look outside after 15 minutes and its getting dark... well you get the picture... i guess i / we are gonna train a little more vs. the ai taking over the entire map and then do the same in online mp (yeeeeaaaa right) :p on a slight downside though... your view constantly jumps around to units needing orders or your allies battles. this can get very frustrating after a while since you can not do anything while the battle is going on either. there are ways to stop this from happening but often this causes the nice battle animations to not show at all. i have not looked at anything from the modders community, perhaps they got a solution... anyhow... the game is an overall very awsome experience.",1
"excellent game if you are into macro style strategy games. the graphics are pretty good and run well on lower end computers. its unfortunate at higehr difficulties the a.i. gets unfair advantages to compensate for poor coding.",1
"dooooppe. only thing that could be better is if the tech lines werent so direct.",1
"a somewhat flawed diamond in many respects, currently lacking some of the multiplayer features one would expect from the latest in the series. the expansions help soften the blow, adding much depth to the game. plus, in regard to multiplayer, the service provided by giant multiplayer robot allows the asynchronous play sorely lacking at this time.",1
"i really loved it! the game was fun. i loved rts games for as long as i can remember, and this was my first turn based strategy game. i saw some youtube videos of other people playing the game, and i thought wow, this game looks really good! so i begged my dad to get it for me, and he bought the dvd version, and both dlc packs. i have sunk so many hours into the game because it is so addictive, and really fun! the advisor council was great in teaching you how to play, and really taught me the ropes. i do recommend this game to anybody who is interested.",3
"civilaztion v takes some time to get used to, however once you do it is so much fun to play. the turn by turn play style allows you not to forget about certain areas or cities that need work. overall it is a fun game to play which for me takes a good long time to finish.",1
"at first i didnt think strategy games were the type of thing i would like, but i love this game. i would recommend this game to anybody. warning: you might be at your computer for a lot longer than you originally planned to if you play this game :)",1
"civilization v is a must buy for any turn-based strategy gamers out there. it allows you to grow a civilization of your choice through the ancient era all the way up to the information era, if you can survive until then that is. the vanilla game itself is decent but is lacking in some areas. i highly recommend buying the complete edition which includes two major dlcs; gods and kings and brave new world, with some other small civilization and map dlcs.",2
"an awesome experiance for new and experianced players. if you liked the idea of running a nation over history, but found the first 4 civilization games difficult to master, then you might find this one the easiest one to understand yet.",3
"if you need my review to decide whether to play this game, you probably dont want to play this game.",5
"fantastic, but im currently waiting on the next installment. still, highly recommended",1
"clearly one of the best games ever created. to miss this game is to miss a masterpiece.",1
"very well made and deep. easy to learn but hard to master. also very expandable. 10/10",1
"over the course of the last week i managed to play for one day. the rest of the time the game refused to start. i tried everything from driver updates to windows updates, from restarting steam to rebooting the whole machine... but no, the game doesnt work correctly anymore. there also seems to be alot of people who also have that problem, while others dont. i dunno why that is so and i dont care. if its an error with the program itself, they have to fix it. if its an issue with steam, they have to work wit valve to fix it. since its pretty much gambling wether you can start the game or not, if you dont have the game yet, i would say save your money. also the last civ ill buy for the next years, since i dont trust them to do better with the next one.",2
">rome asks to go to war with spain >gets tired of romes requests, accepts >takes over spain, rome doesnt even help >gets denounced by rome for warmongering 10/10",1
"there is no reason not to own this game. have played lots of hours with the base game and all the expansions and even if i got tired of it there is a large moc community on the steam workshop.",3
"i love this game, and reccomend it to anyone who is a fan of strategy, 9.5/10",1
"what can i say. real-time strategy, interaction with amazing ais, and just an overall awesome game, especcially with the dlc, though still awesome without dlc. if you havent tried it, well, you are gonna be blown away.",1
"this. game. will. destroy. your. life. and. you. are. going. to. love. it.",4
"well wicked. got it on the cheap on humble bundle tho lol.",1
"i think the civilization series is great. overall i give it a 8/10 concept: same as other civilzations, 7/10 gameplay: outstanding at how many options there are! 8/10 graphics: incredable: 10/10 price: waaaaaaaay too pricy,but thats what happens to big company games. wait a couple of years it will go down though.",1
"a fantastic game even further improved by the addition of gods+kings and brave new world.",1
"very good game but can get a bit boring after about 1-2 hours",1
"id highly recommend getting the complete edition with all the dlc for the best value and fun! defiantly a great choice if you want to get a strategy game",1
"it is a great game, i dont really see any flwas and its straightforward. since it is turn based it is pretty slow so i would recommend being patient and having alot of time to just finish one whole game.",1
"amazing game if you like strategic turn based games.",1
"highly addicting and lots of fun. you really need to put your planning skills to work in this crown jewel of the series.",1
"fun game but very addictive i would finish this but 1 more turn",1
"one of my favorite franchises of all time, civ 5 has brought a lot of new and exciting content to the table, and a boat load of changes to boot. while some changes are better than others, the experience of building your nation, fighting for land, trading for resources, and the over all global experience is something great to be a part of. if you see that im online and not playing this game, assume ive been kidnapped and im trying to signal you.",1
"a big disappointment. play civ iv or ii. this must be a joke.",1
"120.2 hrs on record oh look at that ...........................................................",1
"i wouldnt know...steam wont let me play it! get messages like app already running when its not... this is the second time steam driven games have done this to me. beware of games powered by steam",1
"i have been playing civ 5 since release, it didnt quite hit the mark, as all the games that are remakes or a new version of classic videogame era franchise it was a lackluster. this game embraced almost perfectly (not ea perfect) the new era game selling paradigm, tons of dlc, not so cheap expancions, tons of bugs and exploits, at release this wasnt a 60 bucks aaa game (altough they charged like it) it was a beta at much. too many policy*civ exploits, ai simplifying it had two modes stupid and op stupid, and no matter what you do they end up hating you for everyting. after two exp now i get a game i like, the way they should have released it since start. still has his problems but now you can actually enjoy it.",2
"-caution- this game can be really addictive!!! dont play if you have any of these condition: girlfriend, children, job, studies or any other reponsabilities. beware of the consequence...",3
"this honestly has to be one of the best games ever written... middle aged mba educated widely read guy here, and i derive intense intellectual stimulation and learning from this game. sid meir is a genius. he just maps out how civilisations really work so well.",2
"great game, i reccomend having patience if you are going to buy this game, a beautiful strategy game of what-if. for example, what if the great wall of china was made by america? (the great wall of america) well, thats possible! watch yourself holding history in your hands and bending it to your will! 10/10 great game! :d",2
"sweet game with an amazing amount of replay options",2
"it is a grogeous game but it is manly for poeple who have the time to sit for a good hour or so... highly recommend this game.",1
"where do the hours go? it will take everything you have to pull yourself away from this game...",3
"best civilization game out yet, beyond earth is good but in this game you go throughout the years and your troops can change due to the era you are in such as industrial era and modern era. this is hands down the best clivilization game ive played. i highly recommend this game.",1
"this game took my friends from me. ill get them back in just one more turn...",2
"its really fun. i dont think its fun without the gods and kings dlc. (havent gotten it yet but looking forward to it). there are many achievements as well.",3
"if i a had a nickel for everytime i said one more turn i would have more than enough money to pay for the college im failing out of because of this game. 10/10 would waste another 250 hours of my life.",2
"hours of endless stress and strategy, probably the best non-competetive microcosmic strat out there.",2
"play this game if you like lengthy and in depth strategy style game play. although the game has various speed settings, often times the longer the setting the easier the gameplay becomes when versed with aggressive computer ai.",1
"this is a great game for a parent of a high maintenance infant. the game is turn based and will patiently wait for you to feed and change your kid. then come back and pick up where you left off!",1
"trust fear down there. he knows what hes talking about, haha. its an amazing game to play while grinding on a xbox or ps game or with friends. worth a buy. 100%.",1
"addictive, challenging, and ridiculously fun. wholeheartedly recommended.",3
"refused to upgrade my soldiers had war elephants fighting against germanys panzers 10/10 would get dominated again",1
"this game is the epitome of turn-based strategy. since its release, there have been so many major improvements across the board. dlcs, multiplayer fixes (multiplayer is basically 100% different than when it first came out, and thats a good thing), amongst other things. i cant say enough good things about this game. my only beef with it? when i pick random leader and it gives me venice.  venice. anyways, get this game, and dont choose venice as your civ. one of the best games in history.",3
"this is the first civilization i played. previously, i thought it was just a boring turn based game. boy i was wrong. its like playing chess on a hexagonal map with lots of different units. in this game you can really win (or lose) because of your strategy. the first turns are quick, but as you approach the end of the game you have to consider lots of things, be careful and think ahead. excellent game. i dont have many dlcs and im ok without them. they may add some interesting variations, but you can totally play it without them!",1
"great game. played hours and hours on it by myself and with friends.",1
"ever wondered what the world would be like if the shoshone tribes had tanks and machine guns to battle some samurais? or if ghandi was held prisoner by genghis khan and after many centuries of captivity, india was saved by the irish? civ v is a very well furnished strategy game where the smallest quarell over some truffles can cause heinous wars. building, trading, invading/evading, civ v is all about those stuffs. some drawbacks though, it is a real time consummer. also, the game is less meaningfull (not complete) without gods & kings and a brave new world: two extensions that make this game a killer. so prepare your settlers and equip yourself with some fine diplomacy and strategy! (with numerous and technically more advanced troups on the side just in case).",1
"just started the game, but im already getting hooked.",1
"try to nuke napoleon and accidentally drop it on quebec on the way there, quebec hates me for life, oops",1
"this game is as addictive as hell. it is well balance, takes no time to learn it but takes hundreds of hours to master. cannot reccomended it enough, 9.5/10",2
"this game is very strateigic and cool, there are many countries to use and lots of things to do.",1
"great game that will offer hours of enjoyment for completionist",2
"so far have about 40 hours on this game. not much to say other than it is a good time consumer and lazy-one-handed type game game. good to play when you just want to chill, get comfy if thats your thing, and attempt to take over the world. dont think about it that much, go with the flow and build/take paths in the game that interest you. also, this is a really fun mutliplayer game. get some friends on skype and play a game, it will be the most fun youve had with friends in a while, trust me. ive been a turn based fan forever and if your into fire emblem or advanced wars and your not palying this game then your doing something wrong. go get it and nuke some cities and",1
"amazing turn based strategy game and it gives a new look on strategy",1
"i really enjoy this game it is good fun. one downside is that it is long, but in the same it is good for me anyway because i love games that take a while to complete. i recommend it to anyone that enjoys building, war, or just playing with friends",3
"if you could take your  and  any game... it would be this game.. trust me ive done it, real nice.",2
"civilization 5 is the best civ game yet i like the game play",1
"i have 69 hours on record. thats just the best thing in the world.",2
"more addictive than the addiction a 55 year old baby boomer has with his cigarettes.",1
"finished installing at 1am, ended up watching the opening scene. next thing i know its 4 hours later and everyone on the map hates me. 10/10",1
"too easy. ai is dumb. was able to win deity level on first try. on civ 4 i had a lot of difficulties on monarch and higher.",1
"india is directly north of england (me) and is constantly trying to slaughter me with guns and cannons while i crush their armies with swords, bows and catapults. 11/10",1
"if youre in to turn based strategy games that are quite complicated and require you to be really efficient and smart with how you spend each turn.. this is the game for you!",2
"hours and hours on this game and still there is more to do! one match of civ is like a whole game of other games, 10/10 not found a game as good as this!",2
"this game is extremely addicting, for alot of reasons. you can play as civilization leaders and guid your civilizations to war, peace, production, and much more! you can make tons of diffrent types of troops! some cost resorces (sorry if i spelt that wrong) but in the end its worth it. you can make tons of buildings,creat citys farms, fortresses, mines, and much more! if you lose happiness and money, alot of bad things will happen. in the end this game is extremly addicting and has tons of stuff that im sure youl like!",1
"excellent game, many hours of play time. brilliant turn based strategy, most fun when played with friends. like risk? of course you do, this is longer, more complex and more fun. for more and longer reviews go to",1
"i can deffinitly recommend this game to all strategy game lovers, if anyone ever played any of the earlier civilization games, you should not expect it to be too much like the older ones. yet even though stuff has been changed or even taken away, that is more than outweighed by new additions, extremely well done graphics, the new soundtracks, and the new combat system.",2
"a great game with many many hours of fun. the bnw dlc is amazing and i would recommend buying the dlc too. the multipalyer is also great.",3
"this game is absolutely immersive and utterly amazing. most who have watched me play the game are reminded of the board game risk, but i find it to be much better. the tech tree is ridiculously thorough and even includes everything from pottery to giant death robots. the gameplay dynamics are complicated, yet, elegantly integrated, and very rarely get old. i can find almost nothing bad about this game, other than perhaps unreasonable ai. 9/10.",1
"fantastic game!!! buy it!!!!! i would say though that - although the vanilla game is great - buying the brave new world dlc adds several whole new aspects which really improve it.",2
"i stopped wearing towels as a sign of rebellion to my master gandhi 11/10 ign",1
"stupidly addictive. ive just begun playing and i already cant put it down. looking forward to getting my hands on brave new world.",2
"if you are considering getting this game - then you already love civilization/alpha centarui. this isnt civ4, but it doesnt try to be. with all dlcs/expansions to date, it stands very strong on its own, and is jsut as fun, if not more so (imho) than civ4. if we could get an alpha centarui remake on this engine i could die happy. once again, if you love these types of games - get it (with all expansions/dlc - a steam sale will throw them 50-75% off) you will not be disappointed!",3
"its an amazing game with a large modding community. if you havent got this game, you should get it when onsale.",1
"bye it bye it bye it bye it bye it bye it bye it bye it bye it bye it bye it bye it bye it bye it (hipno toad)",1
"great game, period ! but be very careful ! the complete pack is not, its the gold pack which does not include brand new world as its featured ! got screwed by steam... :/",3
"great game where there is no limit to the amount of hours you can spend on it. great to play with friends. running on max specs requires some fairly intense cpu power.",1
"im writing this at 6am. i woke up at 11am the day before. this games terrible for my health =( 11/10",1
"got several copies for me and friends. great stradegy game, not if youre short on time though....",1
"extremely well made turnbased strategy game, easy to play and fun. very timeconsuming.",2
"it was gr8 would r8 8/8 m8. but seriouly its a super good game to play either singleplayer or with friends on multiplayer. the dlc are epic as well and add so much to the game.",1
"easily my favorite strategy game. hours upon hours of enjoyment, great dlc, and satisfying victories make this game worth the money.",1
"amazing game for any great thinker. this game is for people who are smart and know what their doing",1
"this is a very entertaining strategy game. hours and hours of game play.",1
"with the gods & kings expansion the game is nicely rounded out and i think a worthy civ title.",1
"ghandi may look good,but it will be bad when the manhatten project starts.",2
"the new entry in the civ series hits it out of the park, it is great fun that i replay over and over. the new changes to the game make it much easier for new players to get into the game, and the depth is still there for returning veterans.",1
"do have friends? then the best use for them would be to play this game with them. the graphics are amazing, the gameplay is engrossing, and the concept holds it own. you really should pick it up and become a master of civilization!",2
"civ is an amazing empire building game and very realistic i definetly recomend this game",1
"this game can either build friendships or tear them apart.",1
"very good, top end turn based stratagy! 85/100 graphics 70/100 sound 90/100 gameplay 60/100 replay 30/100 customization dont expect customization to be high in a game like this, although for this game it doesnt really matter, good game great to play with friends can get repatitious/ boreing after a while.",1
"just one more turn. that is what is going to happen if you play this - actually, no, dont even try it. this game is great, everytime there are sales i feel temptated to go around giving it to people and watching them get sucked into being addicted to it. game had its downsides when it was vanilla, but hole cow batman, its great now - if you have free time and think what a log knows is worth to heed, youll play the hell out of this!",2
"great game, best empire building sim ive played in a long time, and the dlc adds an amazing amount depth to the game making all those boring turns where you had to wait more interesting by giving you spies to control, a religion to build, famous works of art to create and collect and dozens of new buildings, multiple changes to cultural unlocks and culture trees a complete re-work of the culture system, and several new units that fill gaps that never should have existed. (no more 300 years of archers followed by 500 years of crossbowman fights.)",2

"i dont think there has ever been a game that makes me lose track of time as much as this.",4
"if you want a strategy, buy this. if you dont, buy this.",2
"this is way too addicting. if you need to sleep or socialise within 72 hours i would not recommend this game as it is far too good to leave for less than a 2 minutes pee-break tops.",2
"lots of competitors, none do it as well. hope you have a comfy seat.",2
"russian socialist federative soviet republic is bae.",1
"youre damn right i recommend this game. it may seem silly with some of its cartoonish interactivity, but, once you get past that, it is one of the most addictive simplistic games ive ever enjoyed within the strategy genre. i play it for hours without even noticing such time has gone by, yet i dont feel my time wasted. i enjoy this game and i believe you will to.",1
"this game is great fun. if you like strategy games that are also fun to play with friends this is your game. however, vanilla civilization v is terrible, no strategy just war forget everything else. so if you do buy make sure you also get the brave new world dlc too. (it adds trade routes, world congress, spying, religion, other improvements and much needed additional civilizations to play as) otherwise vanilla will just get repetetive and boring really quick. hope this helps i love civ v so if you have questions just ask.",3
"i love this game, but when it comes to time it really isnt the best option. i think ive played a total of 3 games and it came to 44 hours.",1

"the best strategy game i have ever played! great graphics, gameplay and dlcs! playable for hours on hours!",1
"lots of replayability and enjoyable. just some problems with multiplayer in terms of connection and some bugs which after months is still not fixed. singleplayer has no problem at all with lots of mods for when you need some extra touch at gameplay.",5

"sneak attack nuke from gandhi? declared a war mongering menace to the world by atilla? fun stuff right there. i didnt enjoy the game play changes from civ 4 to this game at first. but as the hours have burned by ive discovered that this game is very intuitive and enjoyable at every difficulty level and era speed. i highly recommend.",4

"i love this game, i am updated to gods and kings. i dont like how many civs have far too situational uas and uus, but i have heard that has been mostly fixed with brave new world. that said, i wish the expansions did not cost your first born child. like seriously, upgrading to brave new world doesnt even build off gods and kings! you have to have both if you want certain things. also many mods on the steam workshop (side note: the mods offer a whole new range of experiences and thats great, it keeps me coming back) require both g&k **and** bnw. you can spend a lot of money on this franchise, but if you have the dough its worth it. many mods fix some balance issues and its addictive as all hell. id recommend to people with lots of free time. if you cant spend hours in one sitting, this probably isnt for you.",1
"every game is different so there is always a new experience. its a fun turn based strategy that wont get old.",2

"this is most definitely one of the best strategy games ever created",5
"fun to play with 2 other people. games can last quite a while but they are never dull and there is always deep strategy involved.",1
"another creat tittle in the civ series. fans of strategy need to get this game. plus all the user created mods really add more replay value. i mean who wouldnt want to be their favorite character from mass effect? a must by for the thinkers",1
"having played all the civilization titles from the start, including the spinoffs, i definitely will say i have enjoyed civ v the most. many of the questionable mechanics have been refined, and playing militarily actually takes strategy as opposed to unit spamming.",1
"lost many hours of my life to this game. its pretty awesome",3
"i love this game of stratagy and thinking ahead. its good for training yourself to think ahead and think what your opponets might do next.",1
"great fun civ v has great single palyer and for me runs smoothly. however multiplayer on the other had is terrible. you cant stay in a single, well functioning game for more than 10 turns at the most. i would recommend for people who will play it single player but would recommending not buying it for multiplayer until a patch is released.",3
"fun but takes a long time to play a whole game. better to take breaks and pick it back up at a later time.",1
"i didnt thought it would be possible to make civ v better, but bnw redefined what an expension should be. an exemple for a lot of games !",2
"excellent strategy for long nights with extremely well made multiplayer",1
"i was never a big fan of the civilization series, but this one has made me rethink my concepts about the accoladed turn-based strategy classic.",1
"first time ever playing a civilization game.. i played nonstop for five straight hours. 11/10",1
"this game (as you can probably tell by how much ive played it) is quite addicting. its beginner friendly but still has advanced aspects for more experienced players. the major downside is that if you only buy the base game, its quite repetitive; i recommend to purchase the complete edition. the game also has a workshop, which adds more variety to the game. i once used a mod which spawned all the civilizations in true geographical areas which actually taught me some true locations of countries which i didnt previously know. overall, good game, 10/10, could ruin your life :)",2
"at first i didnt know what to think about this game, but now i am addicted. gotta get the nukes ghandi is a swag lord 11/10",1
"civ v simultaneously simplifies and adds depth to the long-standing civ series. with the brave new world expansion, civ v is now my favorite civ game and favorite turn-based strategy game.",1
"good strategy for long hours - new plot every game. you may choose the way to win and lead your civilization.",1
"perfect game if you want to kill a lot more time than you actually have to spare.",2
"such strategy much countries many faith such resources",1
"this game is probably the best money i have ever spent on a game. it has beautiful graphics, mod support, scenarios, so many things i have not even delved into. everyone should get this game.",2
"8/10 better than 4 in combat and tiles, worse in everything else. expansions fix it though to be 10/10.",1
"one of the best stategy games i have ever played :d",1
"amazing strategy game. cant describe how much fun you can have and how well thought the game is all around.",1
"love it. just love it. so in depth. i played this game in a free trial when beyond earth came out, and i couldnt stop playing it. i now have to wait until christmas before the next big sale until i will get the game, and i am dying. i might not survive... if you have the money, get it.",1
"its civ. its sid meier. why havent you bought this yet?",1
"a grate game. just lose for civ ii, who was the first civ game i played. this game have a love of community content like maps, civs and game modes. the just one problem is the multiplayer mode who never should exists, this game type wont be made for multiplayer.",1
"took me 15 nuclear missiles to kill a lvel 13 city with 38 defense. then i had to take it with a mech infantry",1
"um...its civilization. this game...ive been playing it since high school. so yeah. love it.",1
"ive invested alot of time into this game worth it yes it has alot of different play styles and other civs especially on harder difficultys one of my top 5 games only thing i could put down about this is some of the starts are awfull and the crash bug i experience after around 80-85 turns of playing overall good :)",1
"it took two expansions for this game to really shine as a 4x gaming experience. trade routes, ideologies, tourism, and the global community all play an interesting role now that add some much-needed dynamism to the game. its biggest weakness is the ai, from constantly offering terrible trade offers and begging for free stuff, to asking you to go to war and then calling you a warmonger after you satisfied their request. tactics-wise, the ai needs a full generational military advantage or more to really bring the pain, and rarely understand how to siege a city without large numbers of troops. i would recommended playing with as many human players as possible. overall, an addictive game that has drained many quality years of my life.",3
"due to the fact i havent written any reviews for a long time, i feel it is about time i started again with this unanimously magnificent strategy title! what civilization v constitues is the climax of a renowned series. to begin with ..it looks stunning and its world shines with beautiful and well designed environments. futhermore when you start immersing yourself deeper inside its universe you will begin discovering more of its many virtues. not only has this game one of the most sophisticated in-game mechanisms i have ever seen in a strategy title but also it can maintain your interest for years. trying to offer a detailed insight into civ v could easily make me write pages over pages though i dont want to become tiresome. just keep in mind that this game needs patience in order to unfold all its features. on the whole i have no doubt that especially stategy friends are going to adore it!",1
"ive only played civilization iii before playing civilization v. to be honest, i was just expecting better graphics and thats it, but i was completely wrong. this game improves almost everything in civilization iii. new rules, and new dimensions make the game refreshing, while keeping it still familiar. it still feels like civilization iii underneath, but with a more realistic gameplay. games take longer to win than what ive used to. ive spent the first 3 hours of the game only knowing of 1/3 of the map. ive skipped civilization iv, but i dont think i missed anything. civilization v is a winner. also, the linux version works better than i expected.",1
"excellent, addictive game...so many scenarios, and situations to build or conquer, may pull some all nighters for some games.. my only complaints are the multiplayer(its like running the game on the lowest settings) and sometimes the ai is just plain stupid. i highly reccomend this to anyone who likes strategy games!",3
"just started playing but i really dig it already. little slow paced at first but it picks up steam fast!",1
"i wanted to have a good amount of hours in this game before i recommed it or not, guses 200 hours have to do ;). i would like to start to say that the game is great. you can have fun for hours on end even if you just chose one civ to play as. the replayabilty is high with different maps and others civ to play againest.the games do take a long time but once you start you will lose track of time, one miutue it would be 3 pm and 135 turns later its 6 or 7pm. overall a great game, cant wait for beyond earth to get here.",2
"it is about people, and they are all enemies. kill them all xxx kill the jews xxx love, hitler",1
"i have one thing to say about this game..... nukes",1
">start game >become friends with everyone >attila declares war on me after years of friendship >destroy him down to his capitol >attila offers peace >denied >kill attila >get called warmonger 10/10 would warmong again",1
"fun game. lots usefull features like saving multiplayer games for later which is useful because these games can take alot of time.",1
"time just disappears when you play it. i started off thinking itd be ok, just a few hours here and there. yeah...no, it doesnt work like that. you have to have a reason to look away from it or else you wont. your social life, your friends, and even your family are non-existent when you play it. i started on oct. 10, 2014 and at the time of writing this i have 31.2 hours. and ~25 hours of that was one game that ended at 500 turns due to a time victory. so many hours gone but i couldnt be this happy about it with any other game, this is just the best ever. also, try to limit yourself on how many turns you go through in each play session. youll be thankful you did when it saves you from falling into complete addiction.",1
"i loved all the civ games but civ 5 and its expansions have really brought new depth and strategy to the genre. my only complaint is how quickly the ai will turn from friend to foe...but then again maybe thats how real politics work. 10/10",3
"i do not know how to describe civ v except for amazing. this rts game may be slow moving but its stratagy is beyond compare. civ v incorporates history and gaming in a way that makes it one of the greatest games ive played.",1
"civilization v is an awesome game and one of the best (if not the best) empire management games available. well worth the money.",1
"one of the best games i have ever played. i recommend it to anyone who enjoys strategy games and taking over the world!!!!!!!",1
"another great installment of one of the greatest video game series of all time. the replay value of this game is unrivalled.",1
"this game is unique in so many levels. they make all the leaders act the same as if in real life and every difficulty has a diffrent strategy that only trial and error can solve. will you be warlike? or cultural? or even a gleaming beam of hope of technological wonders can your civilization hold as you conquer barbarian nations. can your empire stand the test of time?",2
"i start up a small, quick, earth-shaped map. and to make things quicker i set the era to the industrial era (a bit past halfway through the tech tree, the game becomes fun after that point). however, i turn on only domination victory. after conquering all of earth for the chinese, i realized that 10 hours had passed. this game is the ultimate time-killing addiction, and its a ton of fun, even for an impatient gamer like me. the game is actually very simple, but the way its designed makes it feel more complex. dont get if you want to do anything productive.",1
"this is probably the most addictive game i have played in a long time. i love it. this will definitly keep you up at night!",1
"the hexagonal layout and new city defense system refreshes the gameplay and fixes the absurd unit stacking of civ iv. though its not as deep and diverse as civ iv. online mode is bugged and nearly impossible to enjoy which is a major downside. many balance issues and some bugs are fixed via the civilization v unofficial patch (civup) and vanilla enhanced mod (vem). overall its worth giving it a try as there is a demo on steam. its not the successor everybody was waiting for but its a step into the right direction.",1
"great game, the biggest complaint for the game would be the fact that no matter what, once your borders get close to another ai civ, not only will you be at basically guaranteed war, (no matter what previous relations) but the other civs and the one that declared war on you will categorize you as warmongering 95% of the time, when i wasnt even the one that declared the unprovoked war, deteriorating relations with allies that arent near my cities. plus, this scenario is almost definitely bound to happen, unless you play with 3 or less ais. its difficult to really push ahead of the other civilizations for a science or culture victory when your resources are being nearly forced toward military due to they covet lands you currently own!",1
"this game is awesome especially with a group of friends! i recommend this game to everyone! if your new to this game it isnt terribly hard to learn it but the is a steep learning curve which is a huge part of the fun!",1
"amazing game i got 240 hours currently on this always fun to play. but kind of has bad multiplayer support",2
"anybody who likes 4x games, turn based strategy games or micro-management should get this.",4
"this is the best game ever, you cant stop playing you gain such a determination to advance your culture.",1
"interesting game, very well done. i strongly reccomend this game to people who like strategy!",2
"what can i say, civ has been amazing for over a decade!",2
"this game is so worth the money. in the past year i have put 250 hrs into the game. 10/10 would do again.",2
"epic good game, mp is kinda nightmare tho specially with random guys who keep quiting",3
"addictive, beautifully desingned, polished gui. expect to lose several hours of your life playing it, its worthy of that.",2
"i would like to make some points on why civilazation 5 is a great game for every one. i first would like to start with the civilazations leaders. they made a great decision with the first game. the last two dlcs have been a great addition too everything including the leaders. now with the gameplay. you start out with a settler and a warrior unit and first need to settle your city. after you get going people awlys turn on you whcih is annoying but it happens xd. combat is good and realistic but it gets harder as the difficulty goes up. you need to really play itt o see everything and everything (trust me anything can happen) in this game ive played over 300 hours lol. so great civilazations, gameplay, and leaders so when u learn the game... it becomes so addictive. so i recomened this game! :)",2
"was my first game in the civilization series will be looking forward to future installments.",1
"one of my most favorite games, be passive to bring victory, or wage war and destroy others for victory",1
"if you like strategy games at all, then you will love civ v.",1
"one of the best turn-based strategy game :d buy it and then mod it!!!",3
"i started playing at 5. i looked at the clock 1 hr later. it was 6. the next day. 69/69",2
"built statue of liberty and nuked murica as russia 9001/10",1
"this is one of the most amazing turned based strategy games ive evr played, althought the multiplayer disappointed me a little bit its still definitly worth the buy!",2
"if i had a choice between having sex with kate upton on nantional televison or playing this game, id pick playing this game 10 times outta 10",1
"excellent game with almost unlimited replayability.",1
"i would love to write more but ive got to go and destroy another city. all i will say is that it is a super addicting and well designed game.",1
"i just love the strategy in it. definitely keeps you moving, and your enemy ai appear real enough to fill out the worlds nicely, if a bit dangerously. =p",1
"10/10 will drain all of your energy and social life into a dark void never to be retrieved again because that would require you getting off this game.",1
"i love this game so much that i have literally played for three days straight through, only stopping to pee! didnt even bother to eat! i was too busy devouring anyone else who did not succumb to my will. playing as america is fun but boring. playing as russia and nuking america is priceless. omg the mushroom cloud, omg. how about world domination as the brazilians?! or austria destryoying germany while the brits are tied up with the zulus and the aztecs while the whole time mogolia is attacking and expanding everywhere like a disease killing anything in its path and all you can do now is hope that the barbarians dont take advantage of the fact that you were at war with every civilization and city state and take over your capital whilst dealing with a rebellion in the cities because half your cities were destroyed and everything pillaged........great times. 10/10",3
"a really fantastic strategy game. ive played it for hours at a time, and it never gets boring or repetitive.",1
"this game is like crack, you always want a little more.",1
"a grand strategy for people who dont have time for real grand strategies.",1
"great game, i would reccommend everyone gives it a try",1
"this game should have a surgeon generals warning on it. i mean, look at my play time ffs...",2
"want to start a game at 7am, look at your clock and think about maybe going to bed at 3am, realizing you just fastforwared through time? buy it. buy it for a friend. travel through time together.",1
"i didnt think i had time for another civ game, but then i just stopped sleeping. or socializing. problem solved.",1
"decent game to play when you are bored  of playing everything else. not as good as the previous civ game",4
"having not played civ since my old uni days (many a decade ago) i found the latest iteration simple to pick up and get my hands dirty with, the ui is pleasing and aside from some minor gripes well thought out. gameplay is still addictive and the one more turn ethos still permeates through and it is very hard to put down i havent yet played mp as yet as i am just getting my old head round all the mechanics before i dip my toe into that",1
"fun to play with 2 other people. games can last quite a while but they are never dull and there is always deep strategy involved.",1
"hmm, only a 5/10 from me, im afraid ... id dearly like to recommend this but there are still (after 3 years) outstanding bugs, freezes, lock-ups & crashes that detract from overall gameplay & enjoyment, paricularly with larger maps that have more going on. buy it if you must (& then only when steam have a sale on) but be warned",1
"this game definitely has the potential to be (one of) the best strategy game(s) of all times, but is one example of a messed up dlc policy. their are literally hundreds of purchasalbe dlcs. buy them in a bundle to save money.",2
"civilization v is, simply put, the greatest strategy game of all time. i highly recommend this wonderful game to anyone even remotely serious about gaming; it is an absolute must. civilization v is easily a 10 out of 10, and stands at the top of the mountain as the undisputed strategy experience of a lifetime.",3
"this was once a really good game, but due to recent updates the multiplayer now sucks and it cant even go 5 minutes without having to reload (which itself takes 1-2 minutes). to summarize; its a good game... for single player... only!! (as of 11/15/14)",2
"absolutely amazing game! this game shines if you have 3+ friends to play with because of how the diplomacy in the game goes. making alliances and the double-crosses. 100% recommend for an all nighter with your mates!",1
"ive only played civilization iii before playing civilization v. to be honest, i was just expecting better graphics and thats it, but i was completely wrong. this game improves almost everything in civilization iii. new rules, and new dimensions make the game refreshing, while keeping it still familiar. it still feels like civilization iii underneath, but with a more realistic gameplay. games take longer to win than what ive used to. ive spent the first 3 hours of the game only knowing of 1/3 of the map. ive skipped civilization iv, but i dont think i missed anything. civilization v is a winner. also, the linux version works better than i expected.",1
"love playing this with my friends. a little headache inducing as time goes on, though...",1
"i love the touch screen option for windows 8. now i can take civilization with me anywhere on my surface pro 2",1
"awesome game, one that will be played over and over and over. always staying up late for just one more turn. expansion packs will add more depth to the game, with the vanilla version only containing rise of the mongols scenairo.",1
"i like civilization but after the newness wears off its either declare war to win or race to discover all technologies. i wish the game was more intricate, more things going on, more variety in different playthroughs; but every game is the same which is too bad because the different civs seem so unique, but there is just not enough there to make it truly different. i have played the game with the other expansion packs but its essentially the same; its fun for a couple of hours as you play with the new features but this too wears off. it is kind of like playing monopoly; buying all the properties is fun at first but its a grueling roundabout way to the end.",1
"i liked the game. and i never liked any other strategy games this much!",1
"best strategy game. so many options, multiplayer, great graphics, mods etc. expensive dlc though. 9.5/10",1
"no doubt the best of the best! just one...more...turn!",1
"fun game. still playing the first marathon/huge map i started 390+ hours ago...",3
"fun when played with people that arent warmongering s.",1
"fun game play , hardest ai i have verus always a tough fight even on normal. easy to learn and figure out",1
"when you first play civ v you wonder... how many times will i need to restart this until jolpe finds a decent spawn place. then you wonder... will that guy just hit ing next turn already.... but the true magic of civilization v is when barbarian  come and burn down your horses, so you repair them with a hammer. only in sieve thive",1
"i once went over to a freind of mines house at 9:00 am. i sat down at the desk next to him, grunted a hello, then loaded up civ v. his parents kicked me out around 11:00 at night. i proceeded to go home and play it for another few hours before passing out on my desk. woke up the next day with a migrane and an overheated laptop. all of my progress was gone. almost killed someone. game was pretty good btw.",1
"gandhi can comite genocide anainst the ice king with storm troopers in tamriel: 11/10",1
"excellent game! totally worth the money, intricate while simple 10/10",1
"keep playing in strategic mode and offset the turn loading times later in the game - otherwise 10/10 would play leisurely, still doing actually.",3
"this game brings real time strategy to a whole new level. this game is a must buy for anyone who likes rts games.",4
"good game, great turn based strategy, a little of a grind sometimes but still a great way to pass the time.",1
"best stratedgy game ever. this game is a must in your library :d",2
"best civilization game i have ever played, very very addicting, and above all really fun.",1
"a really fun game to play, used to play this on the xbox (the xbox version) which i used to play all the time when i could or had time, i highly recommend this game to you all if you like long endurance games, where you start of with a group of settlers and grow your empire to be the strongest and rule the world.",1
"i have owned civ v now for almost two years, and it has always been nothing but awesome. even more awesome now with the brave new world dlc, and the addition of religion, spies, congress, tourism, trade routes, etc. this has made the game even more interesting. i lose track of hours on this, building my economy, while trying to build my army and not breaking the bank in the process, watching other civilizations machinations with my spies, and increasing border expansion to an all-time high without pissing off my neighbors. it is indeed very complex and i am always learning new tips and tricks. besides skyrim, this is most definitely my favorite game on steam. i give it 10/10 cupcakes.",1
"hm wow what is there to say about civ five.... a whole lot. its a good game",1
"[ one more turn, then ill do break ] ...6h later... [ okay.., seriously, this is my last turn now ] 10/10",1
"probably the best game i own. many hours spent on this wonderful game. not only the gameplay, but also the amazing community. 10/10",2
"i came. i saw. i got crushed when ghandi turned on me game of the year? no. its the game of the universe from the dawn of real civilization to today",1
"its an alright game...multiplayer could be better?",1
"stupid ottomans took over my main capital and forced all my archers into forceful labor were they were slaughtered and put in piles. i can still smell the burning of the bodies from my other city on turn 60. they are moving their units to me burning everyone in the way alive inside wooden barns. the screams can be heard for multiple tiles away. great game 10/ottoman -cameorn",1
"great game!! play this game 24/7 and is the most fun ive had in a game, especially on multiplayer!",1
"60 hours within less than 10 sessions, addicting, simple but elegant.",1
"this is possibly the only game i could sit down and play for hours by myself. cant reccomend it enough.",1
"i love this game. i cant really get enough of it. i never really got into the earlier civ games for a multitude of reasons, but i love this one. i dont necessarily think its better than the earlier ones, but i hit a tipping point somewhere in there. its incredibly accessible, and has hundreds of hours of gameplay locked away inside it. its challenging and deeply engaging, with tiers upon tiers of difficulty and an insane amount of replayable content. this game is deep and complex, and there is a lot to do and learn, and it will reward you every step of the way.",3
"my allied ai decided to nuked me while i was busy having war with other countries. 11/10",1
"this is way too good killer of time! spend like 10 hours to win 1 large map",1
"improvement on the definitive civilisation building game. move to hexagonal tiles makes an interesting dynamic.",1
"just one more turn... completely losing track of time is a pretty strong indication of whether a game is good in my book, and civilization 5 may be the best by that metric. as a newbie to the civ series, managing a society through the ages had sounded a bit daunting, but thankfully the game is very intuitive for series beginners. the visuals, narration, and music are all pitch-perfect, evoking a grand ambience fit for a game about world conquest. individual games can take hours, but it never feels tedious or repetitive. computer opponents seem to have plenty of personality, and multiplayer with friends is a blast. i realize turn-based strategy games may not be for everyone, but it would be difficult for me to find someone i wouldnt recommend this game to.",1
"you can say alot about civilization... how it kills your social life, sucks away weeks and months like a black hole... but non of that changes the fact that civilization v with its expansions is one of the best tbs games abount, if you enjoy detailed, engaging tbs - that will give you an unforgiving challenge if you ask for it, or just a casual relaxed game you cannot fail with civ5. to my wifes despair - take a look at my hours in this game.. :)",1
"this is a wonderful game i have poored so much time into this master piece and i look forward to its sequel.",1
"one of the best games i have ever played! it is so addicting, and when you start, you cant turn it off.",1
"i cannot recommend this game enough. incredibly deep and varied gameplay, great music and graphics, and a superb all around experience.",1
"insanely addicting. first you think just a few turns but that turns into 500. for the best experience buy the dlc as well.",1
"im a huge fan of real time strategy games, and i have to admit, the last civilization game i played was civ 3. either i am older and wiser now or this is a superior game. incredibly addictive (one more turn turns into one more century, etc) i still prefer real time, but i think im coming around to turn- based",1
"no israeli leader. cant kill german leader with jewish leader. :( game still kicks .",1
"top 4 drugs never to do in life.....crack cocaine, heroin, meth and civ v",1
"this is by far the best game that i have ever played. entirely worth getting it, however civ beyond earth sounds like its going to be even better than civ 5, which is a difficult criterium to fill.",4
"this is real value for money i would recommend this to anyone, i would also go as far as to say that it is better that the forth civ which i loved and played for months.",1
"if you like strategy, challenge, and sitting at a computer so long your  fuses to your computer chair, sid meiers civilization v is for you. just wish the dlc wasnt so ing expensive.",1
"theres a few features that would really improve the game massively, but it still retains addictive and satisfying gameplay. as someone who adores history and strategy, this is a brilliant game. i feel as if it is a true celebration of human history and culture!",4
"franchise never lets me down, one of my favorite turn-based strategies.",1
"although i do love civ4 so much more i have enjoyed playing this.",1
"actually one of the best games on steam there is worth your money",1
"i have been an avid civ player since the first release, and of course i had to have v as well. but i must say i was somewhat disappointed. its not that the game sucks big-time or anything, but i dont like many of the new stuff. firstly i hate the city states. they are way to expensive to be friends with and since war is always a slow and costly procedure in civ, they are not worth invading. i quite frankly dont see their purpose. secondly the new religion creator doesnt appeal to me. the idea is ok, but i get to choose from a lot of perks that are not that well explained, so i end up choosing randomly. its not a terrible game, but i will just go back play civ iii witch in my opinion is the best one yet.",1
"what a great game so far... i havent really played it multi yet, but single, online or off, is fun! i recommend this game to all my friends!",1
"this game is so much better than beyond earth! beyond earth isnt that great of a game like this one, my favourite thing about this game is that you go up in ages from a round wheel to space age, but beyond earth its all in the same age with only technological upgrades and the units you get.. well lets just say theres not a lot. prefer this game 10 out of 10 than beyond earth! well lets just wait, the game was only recently released hoefully they will put in a lot more dlc into the game to make it more fun, at least put in more units than just the basic ones. still have no idea how to use the jets yet so complicated or maybe its just glitched out because i cant make them move any where around the map or to hover/guard a tile",1
"fun in depth game. if you dont like turned based games then this isnt for you. the dlcs expand the game alot and add alot more to it. you will learn to hate the world congress if you do not own it. and no matter what you do on the higher dificulties like imortal and diety, you will struggle. but you will go out with a bang. or you play lower level and are equal to everyone. or basic and destroy everyone",2
"smart, strategic, and civilized combat engine with brilliant graphics and the potential to create an entirely new world. whether you prefer to build your empire solo, or engage your friends in an epic session of multiplayer conquest, this game is one for the ages. i recommend it to all my friends.",1
"i enjoy playing this game however i wouldnt rate myself as a serious player for it. i like that you can attack other players however i prefer much smaller games as opposed to large games as unfortunately i get bored after a while. im much more of a skyrim girl. good game though and my husband loves it, he can play it for hours!",1
"this game is like heroin, you just cant stop playing it. youll tell yourself just one more turn and then ill quit but later realize that youve sunken six more hours into the game. youll alienate your friends & family just so you can teach those dirty huns not to  with your cities while gandhi nukes your  of the planet. so yeah, get this game if you like doing hard drugs.",1
"very good game. sort of like age of empires but with turns",2
"a very addicting game as you can see by how long i have played. be ready to sacrfice time and all your energy as it can be intense but it is a must have game on steam! you go through different eras faced by man and try to make your civilisation prosper and win with the different victories.",1
"i enjoy the game. but i cannot get any tech support from steam. now when i try to start the game i get an immediate steam error: missing executable. i have followed the suggested guideline for correcting this, but it did not work. i have e-mailed steam twice and have waited 5 days since my first call for help. i would appreciate some type of assistance with this.. if onw cannot acquire tech suppport, i guess you need to consdier whether you should purchase games from steam. if anyone can asssist me pleas send email to",3
"more friendships have been tested through this game, truly it is a game that many will play for entire weeks without pause. great game overall and all friends must endure it!",2
"get this game if you plan on also getting the gods & kings expansion to go along with it. the revamped combat and naval warfare systems, along with the introduction of religion, really round out the base game.",3
"this game has been one of the most enthusiastic and addictive games i have ever played and i recommend this game to anyone even if you dont like strategy games in general you should get it; overall i give 10/10; one of the best games ever made...",2
"people want money and power. in the game, you can have both.",1
"if you enjoy waiting and wasteing time, then this is the game for you! xd",1
"civilization v is an excellent addition to the sid meiers series. add in the expansions, and you have more tools and playstyles then ever before. i would highly recommend this game to anyone who like turn based stratagy games.",1
"its a great game to play with a friend.. besides the whole disconected after every turn for a 10 minute loading screen to restart the game",1
"i had a bit of coffee, i didnt realize it was 3:42..",1

"one of the most stunning strategy games currently on the market. innovative and fun gameplay with huge replayability. divsersity of civilizations, units, technologies, cultural policies, etc. add a wealth of ways for you to enjoy the endless possibilities. highly recommend to all those who play or want to play a fantastic turn-based strategy game.",1
"i played this game. why i still play it: 1. trying to outcompete that annoying oda. 2. i likez nukes 3.lead conquering armies to conquer almaty. 4. scare civilizations with your sheer might that when they want peace, you get all their stuff.",1
"one of my favorit games well worth the price, the dlcs will increase the enjoyment multiple times over",2
"a truly excellent turn-based strategy game. just be careful not to get sucked in- its addictive, and games tend to last several hours each.",1
"the ultimate strategy game. the good: lots of strategic choices, stunning graphics, culturally very rich. the bad: too long games.",2
"i got beyond earth when it came out, but with expansions civ v is a much deeper, more enjoyable experience so far. ill probably keep playing this one for years. also, slightly longer load times let me multitask better",2
"one of the most amazing pc gaming of this generation that is base in around the board srategy game. two expansion release came out, the god and king which i have gotten before then the second expansion release of the brave new worldhave an incredible playthrough of new civ and new thing to look at, the rating i would have given with the regular civ is 8/10 but the first first expansion given 9/10 and the last expansion is given of a full 10/10.",3
"improvement on the definitive civilisation building game. move to hexagonal tiles makes an interesting dynamic.",1
"sid meire is a strategic genius civilization 5 is one of the best games i have played in a very long time with over a hunded hours in to it making it my current most played game. thier are 2 major dlc i would recommend that you buy with this game which are gods and kings and brave new world these add and change alot of the content in the game and make the game better by adding new features such as the world congress. their are alot of civ to chose who to play as from morroco to america their are tons of civs with each on the own strengths and weaknesses at different victory types. some of my personal wins were as china -domination and morroco-science. this game offers lot of advice to new civ players and even advice for the more advanced players in to the game who have been playing scince the start. if you like stratergy games you will like civilzation 5 :).",2
"amazing game. goes very in-depth into establishing a civiliziation and being able to sustain throughout time.",1
"addicting, youll keep saying one more turn then next thing you know the games over and your starting another one.",1
"simply stated, the civ franchise is the best turn-based strategy games. civ5 has done the franchise justice while continue to improve the game overall from its predecessors.",5
"this game is amazing... simply put. it is extremely addictive and you loose all sense of time. you start playing at 5:00 pm and suddenly its midnight and you realize you didnt eat anything.",2
"i dont know if there is a game series i have played more than the civilization series. i fell in love with civ iii and civ v blew all my expectations for a sequel game out of the water. in addition, the dlc is fantastic. gods and kings is a wonderful compliment to the game, it makes it feel more complete (by adjusting the battle system to be more multi-turn, for example) and the aspect of faith factored into the gameplay adds a fun new twist. the extra maps and nations added by the other dlc also makes the game feel very vast, but wonderful. brave new world adds a whole other side of the game, and i found to be delightfully challenging. and if you dont like the dlc, you can even turn it off in-game. the only downside is the loading time, this game takes forever to load. other than that, i have no complaints. i highly recommend this game. you can trust me, ive played 115 hours of it.",1
"one of my favorite games of all time, ai pathing is a bit wierd but not all the time, a great amount of dlc and alot of fun if your willing to put in alot of hours",1
"easily one of if not the best games on steam. check it out!",1
"this is an amazing strategy game for both hardcore and not so hardcore players. it can relly take you hours if you are building you dream-emprie so i warn you. for civilization fans=buy for turn-based fans=buy for people thinking about buying=buy for people who can only play 20 min a day=sadly dont buy it can be played in shoter burst but i still prefer playing for atleast the 40-45 min. at a time.",1
"a fun game that is recommended to people that like building crap",1
"a classic revamped well, my last play of this game was civ2, so im jumping to this, no longer need to have roads everywhere, a more intuitive system, you can play many different ways with many different advantages. still this feels quite military based, almost forced, a great new and polished version of a classic. the simple view is a perfect idea for lower end computers too! speeds up gameplay alot. the addition of marathon mode is quite highly recommend to try, it really feels like you grow with your empire, then play a standard game and you can see how much you learn playing a very long game. i would recommend this for beginner to advanced players, it can suite the toughest, and the newest to gaming.",1
"variety of expansions and civs to choose from keep this game fresh and very re-playable.",4
"multiplayer is a little slow, other than that it is a great game.",3
"when i lost contact with my friends the ai in this game did suffice. overall a really fun game, can be a bit enraging if youre not prepared for a situation. 10/10",1
"i honestly dont have much to say aside from the fact that this is the single most boring thing ive ever spent money on. a very popular game that gets lots of love from everyone, but requires too much patience for me. im having a hard time finding fun in this very slow electronic board game. i paid my hard-earned money expecting a fast-paced strategy game of wars across the world, piliging my way to victory. instead, i have to shove a tazer up my  to be energized enough to stand to play this for more than fifteen minutes. if youre dull, boring, and hate having fun, this is the perfect game to blow you money on. if you like fun and excitement, a cardboard box is much more enjoyable for a much smaller price.",1
"as you can probably tell, from the number of hours put into this game (550 at time of writing this), i enjoy this game. but then, i do like a good strategy game, and sid meier titles usually deliver on that. civ 5 takes the formula of the first 4 in the series and refines it into a sleek, glossy, next gen-feeling game; civ 4 all grown up, if you will. new civilizations available to play, a plethora of new gameplay and map generation options, a quality soundtrack, revamped multiplayer, and delicious visuals are just the icing on the proverbial cake. however, i do feel that the user mods dont always integrate as well as they should, and the absence of an integrated sdk (like civ 4 had) is lamentable. but hey, nothings perfect.",3
"i bought this games code on amazon and it wont even open. so, do i reccommend? no. its a scam and a waste of my money and time.",1
"if you love turn based strategy games, or have yet to try one, i highly suggest civ v. its the most refined in the long standing series and will take away your social life, and what could be better than that? x)",1
"well.....what a game. i was worried about getting civ 5 as id only ever had civ 3 and clocked a good few hundred hours on that a good few years back until i got civ 4; civ 4 is awful and wouldnt recommend it but civ 5 ye, youve got world congress (can become united nations), the units are amazing, so many more buildings, better techs and graphics are quite good. strategy games may not be your thing but i think civ 5 will be.",2
"my wife asked me what we should get my son for his 3rd birthday, i told her well talk about it after this next round. today he turns 6 years old....",1
"worked my way from 2000 bc to 1950 ad. proceeded to research nukes. completed manhattan project. denounced by ghandi the next turn. 5 turns later... 2 cities destroyed. farmlands ruined. lives destroyed. bent the warmongering scum over backwards. 10/10 would nuke ghandi again",1
"started playing this game one day. didnt realise how time much time had gone by till it was too late.",1
"i have sunk a lot of time into this game, by my standards at least. completely reccommend to anybody who likes the genre.",1
"i love the game, i always tell my self one more go",2
"great game i know my hours are small but i have played other civ games too, and i really like them. better to play with friends though :d give the game a try you may like it alot.",1
"play it once, shame on you play it twice, shame on the game play it trice, and youre addicted",2
"this game started off great, and with the exapnsions and dlc it has only gotten better. it requires a good chunk of time to get the full experience, so if you plan on doing a playthrough in one sit down, expect o be up until the wee hours of the next morning. this games has taken everything about strategy games, thrown it together, and amplified it. i love the way the game is and i cant wait to see how it grows. if you like strategy or are interested in testing the waters of the stratedy genre, jump right into this game.",1
"my favourit game to d8! just got it and already i played for 8 hours! probaly going to be playing this all summer!",1
"amazing game... just amazing, but twice as amazing with brave new world",2
"great game, keeps you busy for hours and you forget all about your worries. 16 hours in to a game i started friday morning, it is now 1:06am saturday... okay its getting late, just one more tu....oh crap, forgot to pick the kids up from school!",1
"we must show them our peaceful, loving ways, by force",1
"theres very much that can be said about civilization v, but in short: it is certainly worth a purchase, but make sure you get the gold edition at least as its kinda empty without it. multiplayer can be pain to set up too, but apart from that its a game you could get lost in for days. hopefully we get even more dlc!",1
"got elected the leader of the free world, then next turn nuked ever major city on earth. 10/10",1
"another amazing entry to the 4x genre with civ v. prepare to burn many hours, turn after turn after turn, possibly declaring just one more turn. lots of changes to the series with an nice ui overhaul, improvements to combat and more. watch out for that crafty ghandi and his nukes.",1
"games strategist with game play waiting per turn player. have a many resource to keep up your city to become best city then the other.",1
"awesome game that will keep you saying one more turn.",3
"this game is pretty hype, not hard to pick up and pretty entertaining, many things to do and whatnot.",1
"this is a fun / calming game it takes forever and is turnbased",2
"oh my god, i cant recommend this game enough! whether you like strategies in general or not, civ 5 is extremely easy to learn and addictively fun as hell. you shall not regret the purchase!",1
"sid meiers civilization v, or civ v for short, is like the description says a turn based, stratgy game that, basically lets you control history from the beggining to the unsure future. it also has a very large amount of military units. does this game have midieval knights? yes! does this game have battleships? yes! does this game have every piece of major military weapon frome throughout history, including nukes? a massive yes! to me this is one my most prized games ever!",4
