"just as addictive as all the previous civilizations. a wide variety of civilizations to pick from with different units and benefits that give you a slight edge in certain playstyles. a worthy successor.",1
"civilization 5 is a fantastic turn-based strategy game that keeps you playing for hours. its addictive and a must have game.",1
"if u love turn-based games then this is a must buy.",1
"i love everything about this game except how to long it takes to get achievements.",3
"i could easily play this game for the rest of my life. 10/10",1
"just one more turn i promise just one more and i am done. honestly.",2
"i strongly recommend this game for avid strategists. your objective is to nurture a civilisation and become victorious over all others. there are numerous victory possibilities thanks to a large range of ingame concepts from tourism to science. each civilisation has its unique units/buildings as well as an ability through their leader. moreover, the dedicated mod workshop enhances the game further still, bestowing upon it astronomical replay value. give it a try, you wont regret it !",3
"this is probably one of my favorite games. in my youth, i played axis & allies the board game. when i got older, i played the pc versions of a&a. civilization v, while different, brings back that nostalgia. i enjoy playing civilization v for hours on end.",3
"great game you start playing at four look at your clock a little later and its alreadt ten",1
"perhaps one of my all time favorite games. whether it be peacefully gliding your way to victory or crumbling everyone in your path to global domination, its always a blast!",2
"this is so addicting and fun if your good at point and click games",2
"wow. so stratergy. many culture. much fun. wow wow 5 doge out of 5 doge",2
"this is a good sim if you wannt to play and control a civ! i actually havnt played a whole lot of it and its been very far and in between but i enjoy it when i do play it.",2
"started saturday morning now its monday and im not sure ive slept... eh i can afford one more turn.",1
"worst game to play if you want to lose hours upon hours out of your life! in other words, i like it! now to go conquer some continents.",1
"buy this game if you like to imagine ruling the world... enough said.",6
"truly a classic, normally a series would have shown signs of slowing down or stagnating in terms of content or quality but the civ series is still going strong.",4
"it is one of my favorite games cant wait to get it.",2
"only one thing about this game that i can say. it is amazing!!! the graphics are awesome and let me tell you my graphics card and processor are horrible but this still runs very well, even on higher graphic settings. each game can will take you a good amount of time to complete and if you want all the achievments youll be at this a long time. each game is different so youll need to work out a different strategy each time. all the different dlc adds so much to the game (in my opinion they are a little overpriced so i reccommend buying the game of the year edition off of amazon) and wait for a sale to get brave new world and gods & kings.",1
"the ultimate time suck. caution! may result in death due to self-neglect. at this point, get the complete version for the best deal on expansions.",2
"a very fun turn based strategy game, civ 5 is one of the best pc games i have ever played. no two games will be exactly alike, and you can play with 8+ friends in one game in the multiplayer. this is one of the games that got me into pc gaming, and it was my first steam game ever.",3
"this game is amazing! i love the strategy and the many different ways to play the game. you arent just limited to doing just a few things to win, there are so many! i would reccomend this game to anyone, even if they arent a fan of these types of games.",2
">start new game >you play as time passes >wake up and see civ v running >2 weeks have passed basically what happens when you play this game.",1
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",3
"this game will ruin your social life, but will leave you very satisfied afterwards",2
"this is a horrible game! you start playing and just cant stop. i played the original, many many years ago when it came on one 1.4mb floppy. it was already a good game then, where i wasted a lot of time on. i bought this when it came available on steamos and look and behold, the game is still as great as it ever was, still wasting my time like i have nothing better to do. man, i hate this game for being so good and not letting me go. whats more, the game creators know this, when you complete a game and win, it leaves you an option of just one more turn ... but it never is just one more turn is it? as with any addictive drug you think you can quit, but you cant. buyers be warned!",1
"sid meiers civilization v is a brilliant game with improves the franchise with a good tutorial for new players. there is information avalibal for everything throughout the entire game. there is mods as well like game of thrones or other that improves gameplay. it is a clear must-buy for any one who is a fan of stratgy genrer.",1
"never have i played a game in which just one more move... means 3 hours worth of gameplay (and waking up horribly late for work the next day). its a good strategy game, just dont let gandhi get nukes....never let that skinny freak have nukes.... gandhi. buy this game and kill gandhi today :d",1
"one more turn addiction, check. lots of nations and emergent storylines, check. send people to thier deaths in the name of religon, just like in real life, check. annoying advisors, check. unlimited replay value, check. should purchase, check.",2
"this game ruined my life, its the only thing i ever do. i have no friends now. 10/10",7
"amazing and fun in evrey way the only down side is it takes so long to loud",2
"its a great game, if youre not familiar with the series check out youtube first. its a real time sink.",2
"games take forever, but even if you stop after 5-8 hours its still fun to do. great for everyone who likes to be able to fine tune forever.",2
"say i will only play for an hour at 12. the next time i look at the clock its 4 the next day and i despise numerous historical figures especially ghandi.",1
"really enjoyed all the play time this game gives. i havent even touch online yet and im still having fun! some games take time but if you have time to speare then this is defently worth the buy. i run on a laptop and cant run alot of games but this has no problem providing a fun experence.",2
"the temptation that is a steam sale is too much for one with a will as weak as mine. at first you remember the strategy games you used to play, cnc, starcraft, lotr b4me. you then run the game to get serenaded by its wonderfully, eloquent intro. you then play the tutorial, as this game is more in depth than justin biebers social life. never did i think this game would suck up so many hours of my time. a tutorial, which took me a good 12 hours as i went and read what things do, and think of what i should do depending on the situation. you will learn to hate barbarians, you will learn to hate them, and then you will destroy them. the satisfaction of getting the barbarians away from your capital, and saving your first workers is just too much. if you play this game you will forget what day of the week it is, and realize that you got fired from your job for playing civ 5 for 3 days.",1
"have you heard your friends talk about strategy? have you wanted to play it but never found an introductory game? then this game is for you! be any civilization you like, go through different eras, create various cities and get nuked by ghandi! all the fun in one game! (gods & kings and/or brave new world make it so much more fun!)",1
"great game, spent many hours on it. its most fun when doing multiplayer,",3
"this game involves destruction and death! the graphics are amazing. i love this game and i recommend it to all of you hardcore (and patient) gamers! oh, and i think i forgot to mention that this game has destruction and death!!!!!!!!! lol xd",1
"one of the best turn-based strategy game...one more turn",2
"i7 quad core, 16gb ram, crossfire dual grpahics card. no performance, freeze, kernel freeze. this is garbage",1
"civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have played in a long time. i played civilization revolution on the xbox-360, so when i bought this game, i was not expecting what i recieved. i love the gameplay. the civilizations are well balanced, because one you learn how to manipulate a certain civilization, you can dominate any civilization after. all the dlcs are worth paying for. they add more funcions that caused the gameplay to change drasticaly. brave new world added trade routes and that alone can change the outcome of the game. you can have a city in the middle of the desert, but have all your other cities sending it food and production, making this city able to grow and eventually be stable on its own. love the game and if anyone wants to play with me, add me! if you have any questions about the game, ask away. 10/10 in all aspects",3
"at first i was like:yeah this building is nice. but right now i am just starting to discover the game and its ways. strategic thinking is a must, just as patience is. but the game is worth it. the expansions gods and kings & brave new world do make the game a little bit more difficult, but theyre also worth it if youre really into it.",3
"i thought this would have been a boring game to be honest. but i liked the choices you can make and the replayability this game has. now i just gotta get the dlcs and get started on a whole new level of just one more turn",1
"fun turn-based strategy game, a lot like settlers of catan or risk.",8
"civilization v is my favorite installment in the civ series! especially with the two expansion packs. buy them, play them! you will not regret it!",7
"omg dis game is soooo gd but 2 be honest u need a bunch of friends for it to be as fun as possible",1
"just dont think about it, it is a steam must have!!!!",1
"a really dang good strategy game that can be really addicting. reaching end-game and trying to kill all of the opposing civilizations was always one of my favorite parts. just dont get too into the game, or youre gonna realize that youve been playing the game for a whole year.",1
"the game is really good. i have spent about a good bit of time playing. its not a total waste of money. the game feels more like a simulator than strategy. all the cpus can have different personalitys and actually have a think more. even on easy the cpus are making good descisions. the game also lets you choose a historical figure such as alexander the great, washington, ramses, elizabeth, and augustus caesar. multiplaye is pretty good to. with a special chat syste, you not really need any voice speaking. all the mechanics make the game intresting and fun. i would say sid did a good job on this game. my rating is 9/10 (this game is one of the best i have seen)",2
"having been a civ addict since the original civilization release over 20 years ago i was initially disappointed with this release as the game did not appear to have the depth of other civ games, particularly civ 4. however the more i played this it became apparent that the game dynamics were far more intricate than i first percieved, offering challenges for both beginners and civ veterans. with 2 well planned expansions adding a level of depth that rivals, if not superceeding civ 4, i now rate this game as the best in the series. with nearly a 1000 hours of gameplay, ive probably invested more time in this game than any other game in my collection and it still offers exceptional replay value on the higher difficulty levels. i cant recommend this game highly enough, quite simply it is astounding!",10
"great turn based strategy game. its relatively user driven, in that you can make one game last for 10 hours or 100 hours, whatever your preference. you can fly through the game using auto productions and other ease features, but there are great opportunites for micromanaging galore if that is your suit. loads of dlc make the game a lot more fun, especially the addition of religion, as well as the reworked global political system, cultural victory, and diplomatic victory, as seen in the brave new world expansion. i would suggest playing on prince difficulty or above however. aside from learning the game, anything lower then that is rather broken in terms of ease of victory. watch out for ghangis khan.",2
"i am totalu hooked to this game! i recomend this to everbody who likes controling large empires!",3
"even after 850+ hours i still love this game! if i want a simple time sink or a super stressful tactical slug fest i can find it here. i would suggest this for all ages by the way.",9
"hours apon hours of clicking and dicision making. will i ever have a computer that can load the map in under a min durring late game? i dont think so.",1
"this is an amazing games, got it on special. i wouldnt say its worth the 80 odd dollars but id gladly pay 30.",1
"i hope you dont have plans for the next 12 hours.",2
"a highly interlectual game with many qualites love the many victorys and the gameplay just a brilliant game and i certanly recomend anyone to play it",3
"amazing, i love it! always fresh and calming. playing single or multi player give different feels for the game, so i suggest trying both!",2
"civ v is without a doubt one of the best games on steam. everyone i know who played this game enjoyed it thoroughly. the replay value is amazing! both expansions add some real new dimensions and do a great job to alter the game mechanics in a way that no other expansion has before. stop reading... you should be playing civ v",3
"dont worry, you can always eat/sleep/socialize right after you finish this turn... or after this turn.... okay, after... well, you get the idea. its addicting and time consuming...",1
"bit expensive with all the dlc but, is still plenty of fun if your into a turn based take-over the world game.",8
"my rampaging aztecs and i have found this game to offer countless hours of quality world-conquering entertainment.",9
"just look at the hours ive spent on this...... and im about to play again right now.",6
"look how many hours everyone who reviewed this has wasted. run away now before it gets you.",6
"this game is pretty good, ya know? ive played it quite a bit and i continue to have fun playing it. games. games. review.",1
"it was geuodas i promise soooo gfooodlsa; suck civvs  noooow",1
"by far one of the best turn based strategy games ever.",6
"ive never played any other strategy games likes this before, but that didnt stop me from getting addicted to this. my first night, i played something like seven hours.",1
"the best civilization so far. a must have for all sid meier and/or civilization fans!",1
"extremely addicting game, and is the sole reason that i have an adequete history background knowledge",1
"slow and meticulous but draws you in. fun like risk with friends on a late saturday night.",1
"i joke its the best game ever made , and better than rome total war 2 ! must buy it",1
"up to 399 hours of gameplay. ill finish this game any day now...",5
"awesome game i could spend days playing this game. just leave me my laptop with civ 5 some food and soda and i am set for a long time",4
"free from gmg / golden joysticks, but this little gem has seen more playtime than anything else the last few weeks...",2
"i was going through a heartbreak when i bought this game. now civ 5 is the only woman i need. 10/10",2
"in my opinion, civ v is a great game. personally i have never played any previous civ games, and this one only a bit over 30 hours. but for some reason, even though its great, i lost intrest in playing it a few months ago. i have the brave new world expansion, and without it (or gods and kings) the game isnt nearly as much fun. i beat the game once, with venice, wich is an interesting faction to play as. it was the diplomatic victory introduced in brave new world (i think so). i think civ v is worth your money, but i dont know why i lost interest. hopefully you dont do the same.",2
"-first leader i meet: alexander the great -best buddies, trading and stuff -meet china -befriend china -alexander wants to kill china and asks me, i decline -2 turns later china denounce me, say ive got pitiful army and hates me -alexander, asks me for 3000 gold, i accept -2 turns later, alexander and china declare war on me -i die...",3
"addictive and can be as complex or simple as you want, with help from the plethora of mods out there.",4
"dont trust anyone !! and dont play this before going to bed or u will be panda !!",1
"games take 20 hours, where did my 20 hours go....give them back",3
"very good turn based strategy with very complex elements.",1
"great game, the lead designer was really into board games and the balance in movement is evident in this game. the hex moving system of panzar leader from the 1970s works perfectly like a complex and beautiful chess game.",3
"ace game tonnes of fun online and off if you havent got no internet and you wanna submerse yourself into your own world for a few hours (more like 8 hours)",1
"very fun, but not sure about the mechanics, and games take a very long time; which i guess is good :)",1
"what can i say about this game? if youve ever played previous iterations of this game (i started with civilization ii), then youre probably already addicted and own it. for newcomers, i think firaxis have done an amazing job simplifying the ui and providing useful prompts for new mechanics as they appear, so this is a great version to start with. even with the simplifications, all the depth youd expect from this game is still there and you can expose it easily (the city management screen for example). with the gods & kings and brave new world dlc, firaxis have made what i think is by far the most entertaining civilization yet! so, to summarise: buy this game if you have any love for strategy and a w streak. just be prepared to lose entire days to it.",5
"awesome strategy game if you have no life, because you will play for 4+ hours at a time and not even notice it. just make sure you get the complete edition.",2
"i played this game. why i still play it: 1. trying to outcompete that annoying oda. 2. i likez nukes 3.lead conquering armies to conquer almaty. 4. scare civilizations with your sheer might that when they want peace, you get all their stuff.",2
"while the initial launch was rocky and multiplayer was a joke, they have since resolved most of my gripes with civ5. it is a fresh and streamlined approach to the old system, and while it is not necessarily better than civ4, it provides a much more interesting (imho) tactical experience while eliminating a lot of the micromanagement that tended to bog down previous titles in the series. worth getting on sale.",3
"great game highly recomend it. be aware that you will be adicted",1
"over all civilizatiohn v is one of the best, most addicting, and at times most frustrating games i have ever played. the concept is ideal and the variety is awsome but unless your willing to go out of your comfort zone you will get bored. try new maps and civs, your stylke might always win but it might not always be fun. other than a bit of lag and lack of servers, online is fairly promissing and mentally stimulating, given you have the right players agaisnt you. single player isnt as realistic as i expected but what can you expect out of ai who have to counter your every move. all in all i give it a 9.2 out of 10.",1
"this game is awsome i love every aspect of this game i love this game i havent played a turned based game in a while",2
"great game. civ is one of the most addicting game with great replayablity potential. highly recommended",2
"i really liked the graphics in this game because i only have civ 2 before this. there are alot better selections to control your nation and i really liked the scenarios.",1
"blow up ghandi. rule as washington. do nothing with queen elizabeth. 10/10",1
"we all know that feeling when another civ put a city in your spot and you nuke all the citys in the game 2000 years later",3
"civilization v is one of the best games to play with a good group of friends. during my playtime ive had tons of fun alone and with group. also it has many mods that will make the game diffrent and fun. everyone should definetly have try with this. plus its also playable with hangover!",2
"truth be told, i had no idea what this game was until my firend showed it to me one day, and i liked it ever since then. the total freedom you get with this game is, well not as much as say, minecraft, garrys mod, or spore... but it has alot of freedom consitering of its genera of interphace glory. brave new world just adds frosting to the cake, with new game mechanics and an utter overhall of the cultural and rework of the diplomatic victories, which were way too easy in vanilla and g&k (diplomatic is still easy) but it takes planing for the long hall... if you dont need the great wall... then dont build it you have bigger fish to fry! overall, this game is great, cant wait for beyond earth! also called nuke simulator v",8
"much play. so civulizashion. such addict. wow. 10/10 doge aprooves.",1
"fun edit: was fun multiplayer has been ruined on oct. 27th by devs latest update. the devs didnt even admit to it untill almost a month later, and only deep in a random forum post. possibly the worst dev teams public relations ever. so well over a month later and no fix yet they sell the game in steam store and make no mention of it. **buyers beware!** this is what you will get when you buy this. multiplayer is broken. so for single players its great fun. *****edit #2 : after a month and a half, quietly they let loose a hotfix for the multiplayer problems they created, very poor customer service, great game though.",6
"good game for every conspirator, war driven fanatic, or diplomatic peacekeeper. recommend to play with friends",1
"its civ v, what more do i need to say? buy it on sale.",1
"with the gods & kings expansion (and now brave new world), this is still the best grand strategy game overall. you could cherry-pick features from old versions and probably make the ultimate strategy game, but as it is, this is great work.",1
"so addicted to this, love the new game play updates from civs 4 .... looking forward to the spain and inca expansion pack, and the viking one as well. :)",1
"well say goodbye to your live, this game is amazingly fun, with endless playtime, and it never stops being fun, if you want to buy any game for endless playtime, this is the game. xd",4
"ermahgerd i can take over the world! buy it, its fun, like really fun",1
"its a great game. if you like history you will love this game. conquere the world, be a deplomat, nuke gandi, build the pyrimids, and descover philosophy and found a religion. awsome game. totaly worth it.",1
"ive been playing civ since it first came out. this version works well with steam and on the mac. the units and action are enjoyable. lots of content included in the basic version. theres a slew of downloadable content. my only complaint are some interface bits that could be better explained. looking forward to downloading all of the dlcs.",1
"great game with loads of content and options - multiplayer works fine now that its fixed. very addictive - just... one... more... turn!",2
"honestly can say of all turn based games i highly recommend this to be the best. not to mention the dlc has so much potential and adds a lot to the game play.",2
"waste your time with this what time is it, again? simulator!",2
"great game cant fault it apart from a few bugs fun to play for long periods and to just chill on an easy going strategy game",2
"civilization v updates the series to a hexagonal board that feels natural to play on. the rich style and artwork along with the graphical uplift provide a sense of maturity to the civ series. recommended to those that like era spanning strategy games as civ v finds the right blend and variety to provide endless hours of strategy.",4
"addictive and well made. cant wait for the next civ",1
"hello! i have done a few stupid reviews however i am going to do a real review so lets begin. so civilization v has many dlc packs however people will rush straight into brave new world but dont its a great dlc pack however you will miss alot that civilization v offers to begin with, i see many people only getting this to download modded players like winston curchill: with the united kingdom of great britian and northern irelan, or lenin with whatever the ussr stands for (sorry my patriotism is showing xd). but lets be honest you are missing out on alot of content which in evry enjoyable! so civilization v by itself is 8/10 but with brave new world is 10/10 for me!",1
"even after 850+ hours i still love this game! if i want a simple time sink or a super stressful tactical slug fest i can find it here. i would suggest this for all ages by the way.",9
"play this if you can afford to become a neet. its a very fun game, but far too addicting to the point that your first gameplay will last you at least 10-15 hours. thats only the tutorial. i would give this a 10/10, but this game takes you far away from friends, family and loved ones to the point of no return. 8/10 - would play it never again (unless i suddenly had no one in the world)",1
"one of the most addicting games i have ever played. nothing feels better than upgrading your empire and conquering other empires. in game tips make a complex game easy. everything down to the simple gameplay mechanics is great. beware: this game will eat up your time!",1
"one of my favorite games ever i could play this games for hundreds of hours and never get bored, especially if im playing with a friend. highly reccomend 11/10",2
"one of the best turn based strategy games there is!",2
"this game has stolen my life from me! 5/5 would buy again",4
"live the life of scrooge mcduck and play as venice",1
"largest tiome sync in the world and i mean that in the best possible way!",1
"a cursor would greatly improve game play (and keep me from being a curser) i had no idea where the mouse was which made clicking on buttons for game play near impossible. other than that graphics are good and game play is much like prior civ games.",1
"the game is really well build and its fun to play over and over again",2
"frustrating when you lose. glorious when you win. fun either way. buy it.",1
"a great new take on the civilization series with hours and hours of playability.",5
"who wouldnt like to play as gandhi and just own everybodys faces? because thats what this game makes him look like. just kidding, its lovely and absolutely fabulous. 10/10 swedish great people.",2
"excellent strategy game that you can get lost in for hours. disapointed in the fact that nearly all the multiplayer servers all require you to have the dlc brave new world ( a ripoff in price). other then that good game.",1
"very good but i reccomend you get the collection pack with it as it gets fairly old after a few hours with no dlc",1
"gods and kings always crashes when i reach end-game - such a shame as it utterly mars hours of build up.",1
"this is the game that help my sleepless problem. whenever i play this game i will so sleepy in 1 hrs.",1
"want to build your own country? a empire that can go through the test of time, war and economical issues? then take your settlers and start the journey. you decide how your empire grows, will it make war or diplomatic influence. fight with barbarians and other countries, explore the world, gain resources so your name will be carved in stone for eternity. strategic balance of battles, smart ai, lot of leaders to choose. at the end you want to make jest... one... more... turn...",1
"one of the most awesome games ive ever played, extremely addictive... great gameplay and the historical details on units, buildings and civilization leaders makes this game a masterpiece of his kind. the new religion system is an improvement to the one used on civ iv and the battle system is also much better. still, i miss the wonder videos and certain things like corporations that civ iv had.",3
"durr, dis geme gud, u can rekt someune, u can take dem teritori, u can blew dem ap, u can be king, hurr hurr",1
"very nice and relaxing and not so stressfull at high levels like real time strategy games.",2
"this is possibly the best strategy game ive ever played i recommend this game to any and all!",4
"this game is a very fun, unpredictable, learning experience of a game. the graphics are great during leader scenes and are either rough or smooth during the main game depending on your graphics card. the game takes a while to learn the more complicated portion of the game. your civilization is completely based on what you make it whether you want a strong military or lots of farms. i myself have both. i hope this review has convinced you to buy sid meiers civilization 5!",1
"not much to say other than its a great game. ive spent plenty of hours planning moves, building troops and utterly destroying other colonies and countries. really fun game if you like turn based, strategy games",3
"this game is an amazing strategy game. its not fantasy or anything like that. what i love about this game is how realistic it is. you really have to think what your stratgey will be against other players and npcs. the only bad part is the time you have to spend on this game. if you are willing to spend a lot of time on playing game or games, then you will enjoy this game for sure.",1
"its good, but this game will just eat up all of your time.",1
"this game is absolutely incredible. if you are on the fence about buying this, just pick it up when its on sale. i initially was sort of put off by the negative reviews stating the game was buggy, too easy, broken, etc. no, its incredible. just pick it up when its on sale. make sure you get the gold edition, as it will include all of the dlc that add to this game greatly. --buy it--",1
"very time consuming, but in one of the greatest ways possible. imagine risk with over 9000 features added.",6
"one of my favorite games! i will always recommend this game to anyone who has played the civ games before!",1
"this is, im my opinion, the best strategy game that i have ever played. i recommend it to anyone who wants a challenging, fun, immersive expirience.",1
"by far, my most played game on steam. i have ruled the world many a time and i shall again many more times thanks to this amazing game.",4
"one of my favorite games ever i could play this games for hundreds of hours and never get bored, especially if im playing with a friend. highly reccomend 11/10",2
"they make it easy to mod the game with built in search tools to browse mods guess that is why i have 600+ hours logged in... 750 hours and counting and with the expansions it is like a whole new game",8
"wery good game but europe universal is much bether",1
"i spent 4 hours on this game in a single match. it was worth it.",2
"to be honest, i learned more about world history in this game than in school. then yet again, video games are always more interesting than an old man reciting facts out of a thirty year old textbook.",3
"crushed old bony under the might of the royal navy, god save the queen 10/10",2
"this game is amazing. all the civilizations are great and the game provides endless fun because you never really need to stop playing a world.",2
"a great game for itself but the gods & kings and the brave new world expansion packs are more or less vital because they add a whole new variety of awesome and severely gameplay-changing features. with buying those you lift the fun and entertainment level even higher.",1
"very fun. easy to waste hours or days on a complex game.",3
"awsome game highly recomend to anyone who likes strategy turn based games buy it and chalenge me!",1
"befriended ghandi everything went well actually hmm...",1
"best game ever but i think more civilizations are needed",4
"seriously addictive, youll play for 1/2 an hour and end up stopping 3 hours later.",1
"i am really enjoying this game,and after i have spent more than 200 hours,i can say that this game is perfect for someone who likes to play historical/strategy games.scenarios are really great,which lets you start as civilizations on real locations in the world.this game gets 10/10 from me.",3
"realy epic tbs game.it lets you redifine history as you know and puts you in the role of histories most important leaders. nearly endless singleplayer replayability with every playthrough beeing different and the multiplayer ,although buggy, is realy awesome. all in all epic game 11/10 its oke skyrim with less rpg and more strategy.",2
"this game could be one of the the reasons crime rates have gone down while obesity rates go up.",4
"ive been a fan of civilization all the way back to the first or second one. while my favorite one in the series still stands to be civilization colonization. this one stands true to the ways of civilization with adding even more if you get it on steam. the workshop aids it in its everlasting glory of timeless fun for all who play it. while the multiplayer can be glitchy and sometimes unreliable in the beginning of a game, or with people all across the u.s. (eu cannot play matches with the us on multiplayer unless you join through steam)i still recommend it in every situation although you may need to watch out if you dont like spending hours being drawn into one match. graphics: 8 (for a civ game) gameplay: 8 (10 with bnw) performance: 7.5 (took a hit in multiplayer because of connection, thats about it) overall: 8",2
"currently burning the cybermens cities to the ground and plundering their cyborg technologies to further enhance the tech level of tokyo-3 9/10 the fact that i spent days on this game scares me",3
"i love this game a lot. it not only makes you think about your military but also your economy. i love playing as the japanese and russians.",1
"its like sex. fun with other people but still fun when youre all alone.",1
"great game, keeps me playing hours on end even single player is fun enough to keep me playing for hours. every new civs they come out with gets better and better.",1
"this game is crack dont play it (actually, play it. its awesome)",2
"best strategy game i played so far and very adictive. i would recommend to people who love this type of game.",2
"saw that there could be an option for raging barbarians. turned it on and disabled all other civilizations....me against the non-governed world, just how i like it :)",1
"great game i know my hours are small but i have played other civ games too, and i really like them. better to play with friends though :d give the game a try you may like it alot.",1
"civ 5 is complex with a healthy does of options however it remains balanced with very simple mechanics. easy to pick up and play with enough depth to keep you coming back. it may seem off putting if you have played civ in the past but this is a different beast, great with freinds or alone.",2
"i nuked an enemy 22 times and my friend called me a nuclear psychopath...yeah its pretty fun (other playstyles are available).",4
"turn based strategy good graphics smooth gameplay. good if you have time to kill....",2
"i have 77 hours played on this game and ive probably played no more than 10 games",1
"anyone that tries to play this game competitively is literally the worst person",3
"kind of boring for me. i guess it depends on what pace you like your game to be at. other than that, really good game. 9 out of 10 if you dont mind how slow this game can be. otherwise 6 out of 10(my personal rating). edit: ghandi is a complete jerk. a nuclear powered jerk. whatever you do, kill him first.",1
"civ 5 is an absolutely fantastic game, and i cant recommend it enough. its incredibly addictive, believe me when i say you will get sucked in and lose so many hours to this game. but, i will warn you that the game is incomplete without the two expansions (gods and kings & brave new world.) 10/10 nukes.",1
"civ v is by far the best of the civ games i have played. also i highly recommend the brave new world dlc.",3
"one of the best games ive ever played. the in-depth strategy has you thinking up new ways to play everytime!",1
"this is the first of the civilization games that i played, and i can say that by far, i have not been disappointed with my purchase. this game is fantastic and great for anyone who loves games like it.",2
"you know, this game is amazing, 10/10. but at some points in playing this, it causes you to ponder what the  you are doing in life. when a major holiday just passes you by when you have all intentions in participating in things with your family and friends it kinda hurts. but then you realize that youre about to start a nuclear war and you just kind of think well  it. that just about sums up this game.",4
"if you ask me none of the other civs seem all that civilized. gandhi nuking my capital twice screw you gandhi",1
"an extremely addictive game, will have you playing for hours!",3
"i started playing this morning, why is it dark now?",1
"little too different from the good old original games",1
"very educational game but at times not historically accurate such as( a nortedame in bismarks empire located in india) it is very fun adn u can spend hours to days just playing this and with a friend it is fun its a fun command and conquer game or u can choose many diffrent victories with many diffrent civilizations",1
"totally awesome game. great waste of time if you have it",1
"very good. recommend to buy all the expasion packs althought",2
"i played civ v for 4+ years before i got the expansion packs. i love the game as a whole, but unfortunately the expansion packs have taken away a lot of the fun that i had while playing civ v. there is quite a lot more going on than there was in the original game, so much so that the it is almost too much to handle. im sure ill get used to it in time, but, as of now, i would recommend either only buying the game and not the packs, or buy it all, but play without the packs until you get the hang of the game.",4
"this is an amazing game. you can easily spend hours on end playing and it has matches that can last easily over 20 hours. with varying difficulty levels, it allows both casual and hardcore gamers a tough experience. although, the game is a bit incomplete and unbalanced without the expansions, it is still a good base game. i strongly recommend getting brave new world and gods and kings along with the game. it adds so much more functionality and realism to it. ive sunk many hours into it and it is by far one of my favourite games of all time. with hours of replayability, you can entertain yourself forever with this game.",3
"if you have the time for this game its surpringly fun and replayable. matches can take a while but its definately worth picking up.",1
"wish it had the civ iv sound of it. baba yetu, and leonard nemoy but great game still similar no stacking of units like in iv, the expansion packs are worth it also. the scenarios are hard, and the achievements are (good luck) impossible to get them all.",3
"fun game, but my friends are  and never stick with a game. 0/10",1
"civ 5s logic. what?!?! you rejected my friends friend request for a trade agreement that was completely not in your favor?!?! how dare you! you dugust me you foul warmonger! prepare for war!!! uhhhh, why did you just claim a tile thats 20 tiles away from my civilization??? are you trying to acttack me?!?! warmonger! how dare you kill one of mongolias units after they nuked you! we happen to be friends you know!!!! how dare you vote against my proposal to embargo you! denoucement!!! 10/10",5
"this game is a lot of fun. just dont get into war with the strongest civilization in the game! already made that mistake. twice.",1
"is awsome i have played 223.6 hours and is still fun",3
"id write a better review, but my turn is coming up.",1
"awsome strategy game, for all sid meyers fans: this is one to pick up. bought at steam sale, well worth every cent.",1
"who needds sleep? napoleon is talking junk, time to kick his derrire!",6
"in my first game, i gave away all my cities because i didnt read the fine print but i still came back for more. great game and worth while if you just want to relax a bit.",1
"so much fun and strategy. i have played this game nonstop for the past 2 weeks.",3
"this game is great, but to get the full experience the brave new world expansion is a must have at this point. i have stacked almost 50 hours into the game and just now started playing on prince difficulty. ive had the most fun playing while drinking with some buds. 10/10",1
"this game is a sensational thrill ride that sends strikes of pleasure down your leg.",1
"the ultimate experience in video gaming. this game will make you think, a lot. that may be why you play it. or you are a power-hungry sociopath and you get off on watching people succumb to your will.",3
"must have pc game. civ v is brilliant in almost every way, you can easily drop a few hours into a single session.",2
"do u reallly have to ask why u should get this game its freaking awesome <3",8
"i said i would only play it for a couple of hours to try it, now look at me",1
"great game! ai either too weak or to strong sometimes",2
"hands down on of the most effective turn-based games ive played in a long time. only downside is in large player matches...fighting against other people eats up a serious amount of time.",3
"i fell in love with this game the second i played it.",1
"this game stole my life from me and made me a hermit. then i bought the dlc. if you want to have your life stolen from you, click add to cart now. enjoy.",4
"absolutely awesome game! but dont get it on steam. after civ: beyond earth came out, civ v started crashing when setting up a new game. i couldnt find a way to stop steam from updating to the buggy new version, so getting it on dvd is probably the best way to get a working version of this game, i downloaded an old version and its working perfectly (as long as steam is turned off)",9
"very entertaining. just as enjoyable as civ iii. really eats away at the time though ;)",1
"ooh... this game.... let me explain. there have only been two issues in this game, one was a graphical thing. not a big deal. the second... the second was losing the ability to save. so that was fun... this game plays well, handles well, looks great, has excellent ai (sometimes) and has infinite replayability, no game will ever be the same. with around 40 civs, 280 achieves and 10 scenarios and hundreds of map combinations... i dont knnow how youd run out of content completionists note: hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours. have fun :)",4
"one of my all time favorites. a must have for any fan of 4x games.",5
"addictive and well made. cant wait for the next civ",1
"a brilliant strategy game. fighting opponents that act correctly to your actions. fighting real situations such as poverty, starvation etc. my favorite game of the civilization series. great work!",1
"takes a long time but its pretty neat. not enough pictures of monkeys though. 3/10",1
"you start out trying to be nice to everyone, as they all offer you  deals and denounce you for no reason. as you get further and further ahead, eventually someone declares war and you, having had quite enough of their , bomb them back into the stone age. then they offer you horses if youll stop murdering them, while in the midst of the modern age. you seize one little capital, and suddenly everyone in the world hates you for warmongering. so you decide to live up to their expectations and conquer the world. such is life in civ v. - anonymous, of fj",1
"its good if you enjoy turn based games. at first i didnt care for it, after a second try i enjoyed myself immensely.",1
"i recommend this game to everyone who likes strategy/board games. it feels like playing a board game but much more fun! go buy now",1
"great game thatll make you forget you were supposed to be somewhere hours ago.",3
"ghandi is a piece of  lying trash watch your back, hes a scumbag. would not trust/10. you can actively be burning down the ais capital and theyll still demand you give them gems. fantastic.",1
"its actually good and i dont even like strategy games.",1
"bought this today, ive already played 7 hours. 10/10 will ruin my life",1
"i bought the gold edition which includes gods and kings by default, so i wont know what the vanilla civ v is like. however, critiques have been saying that without the expansions, civ v is not that good. that said, i also have not purchased brave new world, the newest expansion for the game. theres nothing much to be said about a civ game. it is good looking as hell, especially with the graphics turned all the way up. also, i am not an avid civ player; never really a fan of this kind of grand strategy games; but civ v has enough humour and tounge-in-cheek moments for me to enjoy it. i played 15 hrs of civ, which is about 2 games, and enjoyed both thoroughly. if anything, get it if its on sale. totally worth it.",1
"just when you thought you were out, they pull you back in again. and again. and again.",3
"a classic game that keeps me entertained for days on end.",2
"the most epic game ive ever played (and i have minecraft)",2
"one of the best strategy games ive played in a long time. thank you civ.",2
"best game i have ever played! all the extra packets and dlcs make the game even more fantastic. 10/10",2
"i have been playing this game since it was released, and i still love it. this game is a strategic wonderland. the graphics a great... but that isnt what makes this game great. this game is great becase of the great thought put into the game and its mechanics. its balanced well and has great diplomacy and war mechanics.",2
"you start the game, you play for a bit, then you look at the time. crap. its been 4 hours but im almost done capturing this. 3 hours later. game is over. if you have a lot of free time on your hands, heres your stimulus.",2
"im still learning, but i am totally addicted! my husband and i both bought this game to play with our son. love it.",1
"pretty fun. takes a while to play through 1 game fully.",1
"amazing game, really pulls you in once you get the basics. a lot of variation and endless fun with your friends. definitely a must have.",2
"great 4x strategy game. no matter how many times i play it, it is the one game i always come back to.",5
"a very nice tbs game, with great graphics and addicting gameplay. altough it misses some strong points from civ iv, you really need to buy it if you like civ. with upcoming dlc, updates and mods, youll never get bored!",3
"dont ever play this  vanilla. thats a mistake. boy get the expansions, both if you can but at least gods and kings. now lets build an empire.  your workers were stolen by barbarians. go find their bandit campm all right, there it is. lets get our worker back, yeah? warriors and archers all up on that camp! get rekt bandit nerds! hahaha! yeah, now we can finally improve some tiles and maybe build that great library you wanted.... the great library has been built in a far away land.",5
"another excellent entry in the civilization franchise. switching to a no-stacking model is a big change, but one the game pulls off. expansions only improve the game; buy all of them.",9
"i am in the late atomic era playing on the earth map and their is a world war going on and 8 civs left. rome(me) america and japan vs huns and germany and mongolia. india and korea are netural. i discover atomic bombs and proceed to bomb germany. india gets angyr and launches 10! nukes at me i lose game after germany retalites 12 ghandi nukes/10 ghandi nukes",3
"gameplay/playability:9/10 art/graphics:6/10 story/lore: 7/10 multiplayer/coop: potentially 10/10 overall: pleasantly time consuming strategy game. extra: you get to choose your own civilization and start building it from the ground up in the ancient era. compete with other civilizations to grow into a superpower of the modern era. the way the game is scaled, one could easily find his or her self spending many hours in a single playthrough.",4
"fun little turn based, great for testing your wits, use mods to have added fun, 8/10 in my book.",3
"great strategy, worthy continuation of the series.",1
"ive been playing civ since the first civ1 and what they added to civ v is fantastic!",6
"i cant rave about this game enough. at first i was playing civ v regular edition, but after buying gods and kings i realized how truly awesome this game is. definitely worth the money regardless of the price. 10/10",1
"played 37 hours of this  in the last 3 days. if you buy it, dont expect to re assimilate back to the real world.",1
"its streamlined but that doesnt mean its bad. troop management on the field is more important now with the stacking roops being gone and cities being able to defend themselves.",1
"a great way to kick back, relax, and have lots of random discussions with your friends.",2
"awesome game. the single player is fun and playing against mates is even more fun! if you want to play this i recommend also owning the brave new world expansion pack as it adds heaps of content making the game much more enjoyable.",3
"as washington, i amassed an army of such great magnitude that i decimated every other inferior countries except germany. i left bismarck with a tiny isolated island. then i nuked them later. best 10 hours ever.",2
"this game has invented time travel. it is only forward and skips about 5 hours at a time.",1
"very good turn based strategy with very complex elements.",1
"i never played this series before civilization revolution for the xbox360 and at the time i found the game a little underwhelming. i saw this come out and i immediately fell in love with it! it has enough complexity for those with strategies and yet it doesnt fully require you to take advantage of said complexity to win a game...",2
"with two expansions civilization v is absolutely amazing. yes, its a little bit complicated for beginners, but with every new turn youll be more and more addicted. shut up and give your money!",2
"it is the peak of the series of great strategy from sid meiers it has gone from avarage to best civ game i have played since 4 with its 2 addons that are must for the ultimate experience. you can spend hundreds of hours to this guaranteed if you like almost any strategy.",2
"this game is the f**king room of spirit and time().",3
"a great game to play with friends. definitely worth picking up",1
"a great way to spend a lot of time on a strategy game. first time playing a civ game and it was very easy for me to get into and understand after a few playthroughs. the achievements for this game definitely give me something to play for, as well. highly recommend!",2
"the wee hours of the morning will sneak up on you while playing civilization v. highly recommended!",1
"very well done, good soundtrack, good gameplay. many countries to choose from.",2
"best turn-based 4x strategy game, even better with g&k and bnw",2
"civ 5 is a long, drawn out, and more complex game of chess. where your knights can take pawns, and be upgraded into apache helicopters. if you want to play a game of civ, make sure you have asolutely nothing to do! it will consume your time, but its not like youre doing anything important right?",1
"i definitely reccomend this game for those of you who loves strategy game to your core. you will learn a lot from this game. starting with how to build your own population, how to maintain happiness in your civilization, how to achieve greatness by working together, and finally how to understand how human mind works! try it, or better yet buy it!",2
"kind of slow to get into but once you start a game with a few friends, its very hard to get out of xd i highly recommend this game!",1
"i havent been into civilization since civ 2, and i must say this one was much better than the last few. the diplomacy tends to work, and combat has been balanced out a bit (no stacking). although, whenever i put the difficult up to prince it seems like the competition has some serious advantages. i managed one prince level playthrough without getting my  handed to me (thanks siam). then again, i suck at civilization. i have never been good at the series, but i do enjoy it when i want a simple strategy game. love those giant death robots.",1
"my only experience with civilization before civ5 was freeciv, and this game is a big improvement! note, though, that it may not actually run on your linux install. i have to boot into windows to actually play it, which of course means i only play it very rarely. this is sad, because its a good game. if you run linux, only buy this if its on a serious sale; that way, if it doesnt work, you arent out the full price.",1
"a brilliant turn-based strategy game with many different ways to play.",1
"between all of the great mods and the strong strategic skill that civ v requires and all the tools provided that help introduce people new to the civ playstyle you simply cant go wrong with this.",4
"due to the fact i havent written any reviews for a long time, i feel it is about time i started again with this unanimously magnificent strategy title! what civilization v constitues is the climax of a renowned series. to begin with ..it looks stunning and its world shines with beautiful and well designed environments. futhermore when you start immersing yourself deeper inside its universe you will begin discovering more of its many virtues. not only has this game one of the most sophisticated in-game mechanisms i have ever seen in a strategy title but also it can maintain your interest for years. trying to offer a detailed insight into civ v could easily make me write pages over pages though i dont want to become tiresome. just keep in mind that this game needs patience in order to unfold all its features. on the whole i have no doubt that especially stategy friends are going to adore it!",1
"hardcore strategy freeks this is a must buy but i cant recomand this for anyone else youll be irritated by its pacing and how nearly every match becomes a battle for who can aquire the most uranium.",4
"this is a fun strategy game that looks and acts like a board game would, as luck plays quite a part in this game from time to time. although it is horribly optimised, it does not talke alt-tabbing kindly, and after youre done playing this game and want to do something else, you should reboot your pc. dont get me wrong on this, though, this is still very fun to play, although the games take long, and you should limit multiplayer gaming to friends only, if you ask me, these games can easily take 8 hours or more. go get it if youre into strategy board-like games, its a great pickup at the price. brave new world also isnt a bad pickup, as it expands the game greatly.",2
"best game i have played in a long time! one play through and i have played for over 13 hours!",2
"i have been playing civ since the first dos version and i own every iteration of the game since, including now - beyond earth. civ for me is the gamers game - like chess - its open ended, always different, challenging and educational too ! - the interface is stunning. this is the only game that has kept me up all night long to day break - where still i just have to click - one - more - time .......",3
"if you dont have this game... just get it. it is one of the most entertaining games i have played in years, and i know its kinda pricey compared to alot of steam games but i am 25 hours in and have no intention of stopping",2
"highly addictive - the bnw and g&k expansions make the complete a worthwhile purchase after the original. only complaint is mac users are prevented from every earning the download a mod achievement.",5
"a game that makes me feel great. creating the single most authoritarian superior atheist society on the planet, while i send my crusade of euphoric intelligence across the planet in a stream of blood, tears, and nukes. all in the name of chairman walrus. all hail the hail the master of euphoria 7/10 it was okay",2
"it is my favorite of the series. it simplifies the game compared to 3 and 4 which was always a turn off to me. the matches will last a good 8+ hours even if its against a computer. 8/10 for me.",1
"very addictive. i launched a rocket as the mongols in one game and got nuked by the mayans in the next one. then i downloaded a mod and curbstomped the greeks as a country led by akemi homura. none of that makes even the slightest bit of sense, but i love it. some high number/10, excellent game.",5
"a realy good game, a must play for those who want to alter history and lead a civilization to glory",1
"i think that this installment into the series is about as good as you can get in a stategy game. it is turn based and is definitely an addicting game. the dlc that theyve added makes it all the better. i cant wait until civilization vi comes out!",1
"oh gandhi congratulations on building the manhattan project i wonder wh-",1
"probably the only game ill ever play for over 100 hours ten ata ten",2
"it isssss ammmmmmaaaazzzzzziiiinnngggg game could play for hours",1
"this game is an amazing game to play with your buddies or by yourelf! highly recomended and not banned in china... yet",7
"definitley buy the brave new world dlc with this to enhance and add many new mechanics missing but even the base game is very addicting. you will yell at yourself to stop playing yet will always succumb to one more turn. great strategy game from my favorite strategy franchise of all time.",1
"best turn based strategy game ever made. i have played over 1000 hours of civ 4, and while people like to say it is the best i dissagree. civ v with all dlcs is by far my favorite. besides crusader kings 2 it is the deepest strategy game that is also enjoyable.",3
"great game that for once makes me feel so powerful and that nothing can stand in my way. almost like adolf hitler, but im not going into all that type of stuff. 9.75/10",1
"money, power, world domination of the commonwealth",2
"the commericals were not kidding, this game is addicting!!! you buy now yes!? you buy now yes!?",1
"last time playing civilization 1, now it is civilization v. what an incredible graphic change.",1
"its fun, can be challenging at higher levels if your not on your game for real. would recommend.",2
"a fantestic mindstrecthing strategy puzzle game you can play as quite a few civilizations and it can be easy or hard (there are 7 levels of difficulty) it may cost a lot but is absoulutely definitely worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"i been playing thi game since it came out. and now its original and have many other feature like mod,and expension packs! this game is really recomanded for those who like rpg games,like c&c.",1
"sid meiers civilization v is definately worth a play. alot of people say its pretty much civ 2 with updated graphics, which i donot think is a bad thing.",1
"time sink: the game holy , its 4am. no like seriously, im writing this at 4am. youd think im up this late because i was playing this game, but youd be wrong. im too lazy to go to bed. but still, this game is amazing. 4.75/5",2
"after an unplanned first play in a 8 hours, dabu begins to realise that his journey to find true game may be coming to an end. this game fueled him with all things he looking from ideals, moral principles, religions (dabuism is the best religion though), and political views, he soon discover a great deal about his feeling about this, and he know you should buy it. twice!!",1
"addictive, beautifully desingned, polished gui. expect to lose several hours of your life playing it, its worthy of that.",3
"wonderful game. through, in-depth, and hard to put down. 9/10/",2
"three words best game ever!! great game to kill time.",2
"vary good game not hard for new people to civ and vary fun you old ones to. i say all should get this game",1
"i sit down thinking im only going to play a few turns...next thing i know its 2am. 10/10",2
"one of the best turn-based strategy games ive ever had the pleasure of playing. whether teaming up with my friends for some multiplayer, or simply losing a whole night of sleep to the games endlessly replayable single player, this is one game that any strategy enthusiast, or, hell anyone strat-curious should check out.",1
"ive played every civ, and all i can say about civ v is that it is absolutely fantastic. 10/10 must buy for anyone who has played any civ title ever. you can lose hours at a time and not even notice until you check the clock. amazing game, and cant wait for the next.",1
"only play if avaliable to play for more than 10 hours, otherwise dont bother buying.",2
"this game is a really good game you can play it in many hours without getting bored. it is also a very good multiplayer game. you have to use your stratistic mind to win the game wich i like. so it is a really really good game. 6/6 stars",3
"i like the game very much, is realistic and enjoyable. 9.5/10",5
"one of the most fun and all consuming games ive had the pleasure of playing. from holding a small mountain pass against multiple waves napoleans cavelry all 300 style with a single group of spearmen to fostering new trade agreements with the egyptions across the sea this game is fun. you sit down thinking oh, just a few turns then ill save and make some dinner, but the next thing you know its 4am and you need to be in to work for 6am. simple mechanics that are easy and fun to learn. multiple ways to win, from the classic rts plan of kill everyone to the more complex cultural and tourrism victory. tons of replay value as every game plays out diffrently.",1
"great game but prepare your life it wont exist much longer after playing this once",1
"hands down the best strategy game in existence. there is literally nothing wrong with it in any way, shape, or form, and it is superb. id say if you like games like halo wars, the total war series, or any military/war game, then you should get civ 5. and if you do, i strongly reccommend getting the dlc. best purchase ive ever made (just look at how long ive played it)!",1
"just one more turn... -said everyone who has ever played civ v. *played just one more turn* -no one who has stated the previous quote. oh yeah, and f*** ghandi.",1
"i should not have bought this, not because its bad, but because its very addictive.",2
"very fun and worth the money if you can get it on sale. the combat is much more enjoyable than civ 4 (no more making huge stacks of units on one tile and rolling around the map... no more 500 year sieges on cities with 30 units stacked in them). i like how the terrain matters much more for both combat and empire infastructure planning (no more having a road to every tile unless you want to be bankrupt). embarking is a nice feature which means you dont have to wait for transport boats to go to sea... other than that its basically just another civ game. entertaining but not head of the pack by any means.",2
"any fan of civilization will love this game, beware: just one more turn can quickly turn into just 400 more turns, dont make any plans.",5
"i have enjoyed the civilization series since the first game rolled out in the 1990s. although civilization iii and iv had some really great features, i do like the flexibility that civ v offers. the addition of religion as a victory standard is good. the traditional means of attaining victory are still there (cultural, science, conquest, diplomatic), so not much of a change there. i do like the hexigonal map base better than the squares of past civ installments., however, there are a few things that i do believe needs to be altered in the game. in civ iv, if your culture was dominant, it was possible to expand your borders through culture. this feature is missing. i would also like more freedom in using the spies, as was available in civ iv.",4
"civ = strategy. civ v = best strategy ever. go. buy. now.",2
"it is a game which is well worth it once you learn the in-game mechanics. i have spent far more time on this game than any of the other games i have, and the satisfaction when you completely destroy a civ that stabbed you in the back is unmatchable.",3
"unfortunately, not everyone in my country is as committed to non-violence as i am - gandhi",1
"this is one of those games that you start playing after work and then, before you know it, it is time to go back to work...",1
"this game is awesome. got it for $10 when it went on sale with all the expansions and stuff. great buy!",1
"civ 5 is an excellent blend of singleplayer and multiplayer. the singleplayer is fast paced and fun. it can also help you build skill in the game. the multiplayer is a great blend of backstabbing, friendship, and war. it is fun to explore different worlds and bring your civ to greatness and glory. overall, i give this game a 9/10. an excellent game!",1
"love the game only upset is its unstable multiplayer.",2
"every time i open this game i lose 8 hours of my life. its kind of fun when youre waiting for the next day for whatever reason, but it has taken a toll on my livelihood. 10/10",1
"this game has eaten up my life. ive lost everyting my wife left me but in the end i still have civ the love of my life",3

"when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold, dyes, and ivory, take my advice. ready all your tanks and nukes, arm them, and shoot them like your life depends on it. they are evil, traitorous demons. never trust them. however, genghis khan is my best friend. he came up to me and was all like, de full do bu la chi mendo. and i said, okay! lets be friends! i can never understand that guy, but something about our relationship just works. ghandi hating simulator 2014 11/10",1

"another turn please need to finish that wonder filing for divorce",5
"while some of the game dynamics have had a slight overhaul (lack of unit stacking is he biggest departure,) this is classic civ. and the changes are welcome! if you are a civ fan you have this already. if you have caught the turn based 4x bug and cant quite understand why everyone raves about endless space because you find that otherwise fine title a bit empty and samey then this is what youve been missing. now, i dont like dlc as a rule, ( i always feel that the publishers are just bolting on features that the dev would have had in the game in the first place with proper investment and respect to their craft,) but in his case highly recommended with the gods & kings and brave new world dlc.",2
"i made a civilization in this game. a civilization of fun!!! (not the band)",2
"great turn based strategy game and interesting changes to this series of game.",2
"this game can literally turn your 10 minutes, into 2 hours without you knowing it. absolutely recommended, assuming you can repel the just one more turn spell of this game.",1
"brilliant game, you will likely end up playing til like 4am saying just one more turn",3
"i started my empire in the year 4000bc. through thousands of years of building, dominating and advancing,my people made great works of art and crafted buildings for the gods. i made it to modern times and led the world through scientific advance. then through 6 thousands years of advancment my people started to build a rocket to colonize new worlds. just as our great people set out to find the wonders of the universe and discover the untold secrets of life, i got nuked by ghandi and lost.",4

"if you already dont have a life, youve got nothing to lose. get it already.",1
"this is the best strategy game i have ever played. there are so many things going on at once, you really fell involved with the short clips and battles. its almost impossible to play the same game twice.",1
"great game. lots of content and endless replayability.",2
"might precipitate dvt, which later may lead to sudden pulmonary embolism and death. that one more turn might after all not worth it, so dont forget to take a 5 minute break every 1 or 2 hours. cheers.",2
"and it was there george washington led the americans from 2000 bc to 3000 ad. he met many characters such as the man, ghandi, know for his peaceful protests, yet somehow, even after keeping their borders open and friendship constant, betrayed washington and then lost because washington had rockets, and rockets are awesome. by the way you cant play a quick game of civilization. ever.",1
"obviously a classic series that continues to improve with every release, but be warned: the ai is inherently bad and does not play better on higher difficulty settings. instead, the game simply assigns better starting resources and disposition to the computer opponents, making the game incredibly unfair in the beginning, only to level out and eventually fall in your favour towards the end. when i discovered this fact, i was compelled to stopplaying, but i still dont regret the nearly 400 hours i spent on it.",4
"great game with endless replay possibilities. a nice step up from the previous version, but civ2 will always be my favorite as it introduced me to the series. a little too heavy on the dlc for comfort. although they do add some nice additions once you have grown accustomed to the vanilla version. like civ2, plan on setting aside many late nights saying to yourself just one more turn.",1
"well worth the price. ive already gotten my moneys worth from this game and am nowhere near done playing it, i forsee dropping over 1000 hours in this game.",2
"over the course of the last week i managed to play for one day. the rest of the time the game refused to start. i tried everything from driver updates to windows updates, from restarting steam to rebooting the whole machine... but no, the game doesnt work correctly anymore. there also seems to be alot of people who also have that problem, while others dont. i dunno why that is so and i dont care. if its an error with the program itself, they have to fix it. if its an issue with steam, they have to work wit valve to fix it. since its pretty much gambling wether you can start the game or not, if you dont have the game yet, i would say save your money. also the last civ ill buy for the next years, since i dont trust them to do better with the next one.",3
"civilzation v is one of if not the best turn based stratergies ever. not only does it include difficult choices that have a direct impact on empire but it also opens up a whole new world of imagination where you can create and mould the world as you see fit diplomaitcaly or forcefully. create your own alternate reality today and buy this game. 10/10",4
"this game is an awesome strategy game. for those chess players who like to build like in games like minecraft. pros- in depth gameplay. multilple difficulties, various game modes. always expanding and you can always find a mod to build whatever world or civ you want. con- lengthy for anyone who only wants to play for short periods. some civs are imba and others stink.",6
"very enjoyable strategic game. the expansions add a large amount of gameplay elements that increase the quality of an already amazing game. there are some issues with ai not being very smart, and high difficulties working through handicaps, but its an enjoyable game. 8.5/10",4
"the pinnacle of civilization games. it is so good.",7
"hours of fun and fustration waiting for your turn lol, great game",1
"addictive, even if you are playing alone this game refuses to let you get bored.",1
"i sat down to play this game once, twice at most. i had no idea i even played this game for 17 hours within that time frame. the game is addicting, and even though it was addicting i was still left wishing it was more complex. i think civilization 4 is more up my alley as it is more complex but i cant dedicate the hours to it.",1
"loved every minute of it. never trust gandhi. never.",2

"one of the best turn by turn strategy games i have ever played, and i am definetly not saying that just to finish the pillar of the community badge.",4
"its a good game even though it uses the usual firaxis strategy (make an ok game then sell the dlcs that make it much better for almost full price, for example the new xcom) the only expansion you want is brave new world",1
"i love it so much! it has so much stratergy and risk taking i love it!",3
"great game epic single player and great multiplayer suitible for all ages but may only be fun for 8+ you can play it over and over again and never get bored",2
"youll easily get a few dozen hours of playtime out of this, if you like strategy games. definitely recommend it.",1
"my god, this game is exetremely addicting and takes such a long time. but, it is such a amazing game that you dont care how much time it takes.",1
"this is one of the best strategy war games i have ever played. love the brave new world dlc adds lots of needed features to the game. boudica ftw.",2
"my favourate game. awsome tile graphics and great game interface whether you want war, peace, or something else. thiss game has it all!",5
"amazing game, i would say one of the easiest to control, and fun strategy game ever.",4
"wow. ive played this for, like, 50 hours, but only actually opened the game 7 times. wow.",1
"i love the new civs and the added faith. bnw completely changed the game, the trade routes especially. tourism made culture my new favorite victory. ive logged far too many hours in this game.",7
"ive played the franchise since the original civilization. civ v is a great next generation for the franchise. it brings a fresh approach to the game which some people dont like, but for sheer enjoyment, it is easily as good as any of its predecessors.",7
"nice tbs game, good for those that like really long matches.",1
"one more turn.... just one more... better than sex on drugs.",3
"strategy in its finest. this game is the flagship of the turn-based strategy genera. whether you are into strategy or not, the game offers many simple to complex options to lead your own civilization to endure the test of time. wage war, diplomacy, discoveries and many other tasks await those that want to build the most powerful civilization the world has ever known.",4

"amazing turn based strategy game. endless fun especially with a friend.",1
"sid meiers civilation v is a very addicting turn-based game. once you start it keeps you busy for the next two hours at least, the multiplayer feature makes you play for hours on end with your friends. what i really like about this game are the plenty amount of characters and countries you can choose from, not only do you get to play as gandhi or queen elizabeth, but everyone has got their own perks so choose wisely. your opponent also has thier own personalities which makes the game more fun to play. also, this game does not only provide fun, but you can learn from it too. its not a simpel game either, it requires tactics and a lot of thought. the visuals are simply amazing.",1
"be warned: playing this game will make all your friends hate you and you will never go outside again. dont try the multiplayer, you will become a genocidal maniac. also gandhi is really violent. 9/10",1
"i love strategy games, but this one is too long, add to that that is turn based and is really long to finish a game",1

"civilization v is an amazing real time strategy that i personally recomend for all levels of gaming but i agree that this game is a good choice to play.",1
"this game is almost a s addictiong as drugs. great game.",1
"probably the best game iv ever played. granted im a bit biased because im practicly in love with city/society building games. i rate this game 5 nipples/strawberry.",4
"one of my favorite games of all times, it can be equally realistic and ridiculous and is a definite must buy! i have become a little obsessed with the game and i have hundreds of hours of playtime and have still only scratched the surface of what i can do, and what civs i can play as. you can spend hours developing strategies and plans for the ultimate empire, or just dont give a care and nuke everybody. in my time in civ i have been able to: -take over the world as the might warlord ghandi -get my butt kicked by siam within 20 turns -watch the babylonians burn after they dared to defile me -say that ill only play for 2 more turns and end up playing another 200",8

"when gandhi or ethiopia comes to your doorstep with gifts of gold, dyes, and ivory, take my advice. ready all your tanks and nukes, arm them, and shoot them like your life depends on it. they are evil, traitorous demons. never trust them. however, genghis khan is my best friend. he came up to me and was all like, de full do bu la chi mendo. and i said, okay! lets be friends! i can never understand that guy, but something about our relationship just works. ghandi hating simulator 2014 11/10",1
"if i a had a nickel for everytime i said one more turn i would have more than enough money to pay for the college im failing out of because of this game. 10/10 would waste another 250 hours of my life.",3
"calling this game good would be a bit of a stretch. it has some nice new inovations likw the hex tiles........oh thats it. i personaly feel this game is in every single way inferior to civ 4 and the way that the modding has been almost imposible is shocking. the mod comunity for every previous version of the game added to the flavour. sid seems to have decided that they should be  blocked like they did with xcom which was another shocker.",1
"if you like strategy games, you would totally want to get this game! this boardgame-like strategy game is the best and your family and friends will shiver in fear as they see you play as the leader of a great empire, they will bow to your will and none shall stop your reign over all beings! literally, the best!",2
"specific historical accuracy aside, civ gives you a quick look at all of human history. a very addicting game, dont be suprised when you look at the clock and realize that a couple of hours have passed.",1
"hm wow what is there to say about civ five.... a whole lot. its a good game",1
"o ffs i had a life a few hours ago. i dont anymore...",1
"just bought gold edition upgrade, and no, 2.5 was not hard, and now i got all the good stuff 8)",5
"really good, if you have an addictive personality you will get addicted to this...",2
"its a great strategy game thats great by itself and even better with the brave new world dlc.one of my favorites",2
"very good rts. definitely my favorite one to date. would recommend 10/10",3
"you need to understand that when i recommend this game, i do it as one recommends heroin. dont let the hours logged fool you, i have another 150 offline at the bare minimum. this is one of those games where you dont stop playing once youve started, the turns are so deliberate, one miscalculation can cost you anything in this tense, albeit slow-paced game. this game can ruin your life if you let it, but it fills that gaping hole in your heart that the death of board games like risk has left.",3
"step 1. play as the english step 2. ally with the iroquois step 3. skype with iroquois leader step 4. scream manifest destiny mother er!!!!!!!! into the mic, and slam your troops into him. step 5. destroy everything except a group of settlers and workers, and send them northward into the lands of barbarians and enemy nations 10/10 would conquer again.",2

"easier to stop eating pringles than playing this game.",2

"strategy goodness, its civ... obviously its damn good. make sure you get the brave new world expansion it makes a humungous difference",1
"best. game. ever. games might take a while, but its amazing once you get into it.",1
"excellent game. gant wait for the next expansion.",2
"when your friend asks you why are all of your troops outside my capital? always respond with just passing through",1
"alone, civilization v is a great game, but with its two expansion packs and all of its add-on content, its one of the best strategy games one could ever come across on the market. so, if you want the full civ v experience youre going to need to cash out atleast on brave new world, which in many ways is the successor of civ v, the rest is really just great for the content it adds and increasing the variety in civilization choices as well as the pre-set scenarios. so overall, civilization v is great, but its outstanding with that second expansion.",6
"10 out of the last 48 hours went into this game. bye life",1
"so much fun to play constantly has you thinking of what you should do next. 1 hour quickly turns to 3 or 4 whenever i play this.",1

"i would reccomend this game purely because its a good brain thinking stratagy game that really gets you thinking.",1
"this game brings real time strategy to a whole new level. this game is a must buy for anyone who likes rts games.",7
"this could have been an excellent game, but bugs and poor ai make it boring after a couple of games.",6

"managed to develop nuclear technology by the 1700s realism/10",1
"last update ruined multiplayer (october). developers wont fix it.",1
"simply one of the best strategy games ive ever played. the best thing about civilization is that its so different every time you play it, it never gets boring. 12/10. would bang.",2
"very fun and addictive. it has a lot a replay value and the workshop extends it even further. the dlc is also fun and worth it.",1
"the beating of a million drums the fire of a million guns the mother of a million sons",1
"this game really is awesome. i love the historical edge to the game, as well as the mulitple ways and difficulties to play it. it is a new experience every game, win or lose. five out of five stars. well done",1
"its a very good game. time consumer yes. can take a whole weekend on a single game. not the best when playing only against ai opponents, religion is kind a dumb system if compared to civ iv, also why no technology trading? still i recommend this game.",2
"build your empire. then unbuild other peoples empire with guns.",1
"great game the game just keeps moving on and you got to try to be ahead",2
"a new clothing for the old fashoned civ. nice gameplay, maybe a little easier respecting to previous chapters; tons of fun with friends in mp; no evident bugs; you must get the version with all dlc, its kinda having a different game. recommended! ps i payed 25 and it definitely worth it!",1
"wickedly addicting. there is more content than you can imagine, and with a new expansion just around the corner expect to waste away hours and hours.",1
"choose a world leader. create a civilization. make cities, name them, improve them. conquer other lands. choose your government. immortal communist george washington. great merchant steve jobs, born in 1576 to japan. a+",1
"this is a great historical city builder that you half to get your hands on. the dlcs improve the game by so much, and the depth to this game is so great. this game is a must have!",1
"one of the best strategy, turn-based games ive ever played, but the thing about this game is that it becomes really interesting when you buy 2 dlcs, which are gods and kings and brave new world, without them game looks kinda unfinished. but overall: no dlcs - 7/10 with 2 dlcs - 10/10 would recommend!",2
"the best, most addicting turn based rts, city builder and mass empire controlling game ever! if you liked civ iv youll really love this. although you pretty much have to have dlc to play multiplayer matches because most people playing have all dlc, but playing with your friends is great if you all cant pay for dlc or whatever :) graphics: 7/10 gameplay: 9.5/10",1
"i must say, if there is any game that i own that i can say is also a time machine, this is it. ill sit down at 12pm so i can get a quick match in. i look at my phone what feels like a short time later and ive missed dinner. i wholeheartedly reccomend this game if youre on the fence about buying it.",3
"fun but a little frustrating. i grew up playing age of empires and this was much more technical (and fun).",1
"what a great game. what a shmuck ive been to wait so long to try it out.",1
"i played this game for close to 30 hours over a 2 week period when i made my new computer. its that good.",3
"i own almost every civ game. i not recomend this enough. i love this game to death.",2
"ther r building n persons they kill enemy. much fun and friends",2
"this is my favorite turn-based game. i have been looking for alternatives, but none seem to have the same feel, or are too complicated for my simple needs. if you like a nice easy flowing game, this is it.",3
"very positive feeling, playing this game. not only you have different fractions, which are worth to play through by themselves, but also randomised sets of rules, makes it worth playing for months! nice graphics, for every video card!",1
"do you enjoy crushing your enemies? overwhelming your friends with your intelligence? do you seek a strategy game that doesnt require any skill in hotkeys or keybindings? buy this master piece right now",3
"really do love this game, it plays for everyones personality and helps you make strategic choices to get ahead. 5 stars. deffinitly worth the buy!",1
"one of those games that you will look at the clock and realize its 3am, and youve been playing for 7 hours straight.",2
"love this game, but brave new world dlc is needed.",2
"i love this game with everything that can happen in it. there are unlimited possibilities to what your civilization can turn into. as you can see with my hour record that i am an enthusiast of civilization v. tip for people with slow computeres: use a mod called quick turns, it allows you to play in 3d mode rather than strategic game board mode because it speeds up all the processes. and with the hundreds of games ive played with it, i have come across no problems.",8
"if you have 1 day to live, dont play civ v. it will take those 24 hours and crush them, there is no game more addicting than this",2
"great game as long as you have paitence and dont quit like 20mins into the game. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- gods & kings is a great expansion adding religon, new units, new civs, espionage, new buildings, new tecs. five stars sid meier much better than the clustered insanity of alpha centari.",3
"9/10 - its okay i cant see myself playing this game for longer than 24 hours in one sitting",4
"i played this game, 10 minutes later approx. 27 hours had passed 10/10",2
"some of the personalities in this are annoying. like life. you can make friends with them and make enemies with others. like life. you can burn their villages and laugh while your troops roll over their young. .. i guess still kind of like life if you are a war lord.",1
"a sign of a good game is that you loose track of time while playing it and with civilization v it has happend multiple times were i think i have only been playing for around 45min but i have actually been plaing for 3 hours",1
"its civilization v. if you love civ games, youll end up loving this one too.",1
"this game can indirectly taught me world history. i got higher grades of history because of civ",2
"knowing i had to be in bed within 1 hour, i opened this game. 5 hours later i went to bed and still made it to work on time the next morning. success. would recommend if you dont have a life.",1
"as a single player game: magnificent and flawless but multiplayer experience is horrendous. disconnections start after 20-30 turns, especially youre playing with more than 4-5 people. sometimes nothing happens, then suddenly game goes boom, and when you try reloading your latest save, half of the players cant even join to the lobby. it was a real ordeal on my part. stay away from multiplayer tab unless all players have top-notch crystal-clean connections.",2
"a very fun, replayable game. i think that it is a good game to play when you have a significant amount of time to waste. i will say however, that i find it hard to play if it the sole thing i am doing as it can be very monotonous clicking the next turn button constantly, especially if you are playing single player. the multiplayer does make this game as great as it is though. playing with 2/3 friends is quite the experience when you have to work together to defeat a common enemy when ultimately you will have to go your own course in your pursuit of victory. a much recommended game, in my honest opinion and well worth the money.",4
"i like this game a lot. however, i wouldnt really recommend people to pay 30 dollars for it. its quite fun at first, but into the game you start to see it begin to be repetitive. you start out each new game the same way. also, if youre going for a conquest victory, dont. its insanely easy to pull off, as all you really have to do is get enough tech to outmatch your enemies, and then blow them out. in addition to being easy, its also very annoying to move individually your 30 units into position. i dont find it very satisfying to blow up an entire city in 3 hits anyway.",1
"this is game is meant to destroy your life from the inside out while you slowly take over a virtual world. nuff said.",1
"i love this game. a big group of friends getting together and playing a huge game of civ. overall a great game!",2
"civ is a nice breath of air form the normal stupid cod and fps that try to imitate war for this feels more warlike them them as its the closest we willl ever get to a war simulation",2
"the initial game? nothing special. the expansions are what makes this game civilization. if you want to pick it up, get the complete edition. theyre on sale often enough and definitely worth it.",5
"ive put about 120 something hours into this game so far and i havent finished a game yet, the extensive nature of this genre is one that starts off working on my lesser quality laptop and then, due to the low ram and processor speeds, made the game slow down to a crawl. after about twenty or thirty hours in a single game, you have to go kind of slow, things start to get a little slow at first, but then the more fun parts of the technology tree come to be a part of the game and you get interested in it again. get this game if you have a lot of time and not many games.",1
"awesome game with a lot of content and possibilities to enjoy",5
"the complete edition of civ 5 is really a must-have. with the addition of bnw, the game finally feels like a finished, fleshed-out product. the ai of your foes is fixed and the ideologies get the attention they deserve. often i felt i was repeating actual history when faced with in-game dilemmas. 5 out of 5",4
"an amazing turn-based strategy game, this is the icon of the genre.",2
"pretty good but expensive game though its actually worth it when you buy the game as the game itself is pretty epic with its features though i recommend buying all of its dlcs as they make the game more fun and it will literally take a whole day when starting from the primitive era to the future era. 8.5/10",4
"1.created the best civilization on earth 2. my korea best korea 3. meet denmark, best bros. 4. we meet rome 5.denmark leaves me for rome 6. i cry 7.make great wall of korea 8. ally with spain 9. all shall fall to korea/spains power 10. spain leaves me for denmark 11.sob in corner while denmark/rome/spain destroy my once-mighty empire 11/10 would cry again",4
"this game was everything you could ever want from a game like this.",1
"great game to play alone or with some friends, very easy to get caught up and play for an entire weekend on one game.",2
"best turn based strategy title there is, 2nd to chess perhaps. and when compared to the predecessors, the designers have definitely worked on making the alternative victory strategies more viable. however the ais negotiation capacity and reasoning still leaves much to be desired for a game that appeals to the machiavelli in us.",2
"i would say that this game does have some challenges, however it is really fun easy to pick up and overall really great multiplayer online. if you were contemplating buying it i would say buy it 10 of 10 times.",1
"i cant do any work anymore because i end up playing this 10/10",5
"extremely good game, i love the warfare and combat, giant death robot #yolo",1
"a really immersive and detailed game, that explores branches of strategy boldly. well worth my money, and i would urge everyone to try it.",1
"its very lengthy and well crafted but dont buy it until youre absolutely sure all dlc is included in the package. i thought i had the pack with all dlc in it, but i was wrong. the dlc alone costs 75% of the games price to complete it and i absolutely cannot stand incomplete games in my list so i really wish theyd just do content updates or real expansions, not all this dlc spam. the game itself is a solid 6.5/10 though. multiplayer games are usually thrown by your opponent who understandably doesnt want to sit around for 2 hours waiting for you to finish killing him. single player is fun for a game or two. on the higher difficulties youre usually either getting trashed hard or trashing hard. for a strategy game it doesnt really involve that much strategy, more or less what you choose to research and how many cities you build decides the game.",1
"you will spend hours of your life in this amazing game. if you are a strategy buff, this is the game for you.",1
"the only thing i would change about this game is the ai. when you set the difficulty higher, your enemies do not become smarter, they just get unfair advantages. if they got smarter when the game got harder, it would be much more interesting.",4
"for any new players to civ 5 here are some facts on gandhi 1. he is highly trustworthy 2. he will never betray you 3. in times of crisis, he will be there for you 4. he hate nukes, with a passion just some facts i thought you should know",2
"this game is probably one of the best games ive ever played! it is probably one of the best strategy ever made that is why it gets a 10/10 from me! :d",2
"the amount of content available in this game is ing insane, the addiction factor is up there with the best games out there and it never feels like a chore, best casual strategy game out there up to this date. 10/10",1
"some would argue that civ v dumbed things down from civ iv. i would argue the opposite - iv had overcomplicated the genre, and i think v has brought back the accessibility of the franchise, whilst stepping up the graphics and ai. one of my favourite games.",7
"i have been playing civilization ever since the first game came out. the latest version has some nice features. however, i would like to see civilization vi incorporate some of the features of civ iv and v together. the graphics and the cultural boarders expanding one area at a time is nice. also the hexagon layout is reminiscent of the old military strategy games. the features i would bring back would be the ability to stack units: even if the terrain would dictate how many could stack. otherwise you may spend more time shuffling units around than actually using the units. the second thing i would bring back is the ability to install and play the game offline. i dont know what kind of kickback steam gave the civilization designers, but i miss having a game that is free of this annoying and useless system.",1
"this great game has lots to offer for a small package, i love the gameplah and mechanics. this game is exeddingly good for its price not to mention its preformance. i recondmend this game to anyone who is new to the civilization sereis or is an expereanced player. i give it a 9.5 out of 10.",1
"this game has stolen many hours of my life. i surrender them happily. combat makes sense, except when you have a modern tank taking on barbarian warriors with axes and you still lose one hp for each one you defeat. everything else is fantastic.",3
"with way more than 200 hours of gameplay (steam is always about 40% of what i actually played), this is my most played game in my library. this is not the greatest game of all time, but it is probably in my top three, with portal 2 as the greatest game of all time. while this game does take long, it is worth it and very consuming! i love this game and i would most definitely recommend it! i love this game!",3
"i love this game. for a not-so-avid civilization player, this was a great start. some civ iv players will argue about the quality of this game, but if youre new to the franchise, its definitely worth a try.",2
"this is an amazing strategy for anyone that likes this genre of games. this game defines and sets the bar for all game like this. a masterpiece and delight the games features make you feel like you are creating that civilization. if you do not own this game than you are missing out on endless ways to rule the world. multiplayer can support up to 12 players (i think) which can make you turn on your friends or make new ones. this game has hours and hours of fun and i wont be able to stop playing for a while. 9.5/10 bad things are the cost and the dlc price $50 for bnw :(",1
"do you have a free weekend or no job? do you enjoy sitting in a chair beind a screen for extended periods of time? maybe you are 14? possibly 25 and no job and your mom doesnt bother you much? well, civ 5 is the game for you! watching small groups of people inhabit a hexigon and watching other people invade other hexigons is a blast. youll need to beat your wife and kids so they know not to bother you. order pizza turn off your phone and let the magic happen. you cant stop this. this game will end relationships.",1
"days of fun and a remarkable tool to teach history if you like to read help.",7
"what a surprise! ive never played civ until three days ago. i still wondering why didnt i install the game and played it right away after my purchase. this is a great great game. even if youre not a fan of strategy games or so you should play this civ v.",1
"if you like a very long, turn-based, strategy game this is a game for you, also its not that hard to learn if your new to strategy games.",1
"this game requires so much patience. but that is the entire problem with this game. i have zero. civ v is a really good game for what is... a strategy game. with that being said, this is the most uninteresting, most boring game i have ever played... ever. if i had more patience i might like it but until they make an update or something instead of always doing the same thing; making a city, make the pyramids and then continue. you dont have to take my word for it if you like strategy games then get it. you will realize that your wife left you for some  game that is the same  over and over again. anyway dont trust gandhi.",1
"this game is for those who like staretegy games but want to have some more time to think what to do.",2
"amazing game, but be warned... this game is highly addicting",3
"if this game were a potato, it would be a good potato.",3
"its the best. besides the fact that it takes a ing year to beat",1
"i think i may have just found a game to replace tf2...",1
"i love this game, it is fun to play by yourself, but the real fun comes when you have a group of friends to play with and you let your suspicions take the best of you. if you wont put time into the game i would not recommend this game, this game takes very long and is very time consuming. a game with friends could last days, depending on the match settings.",3
"buy this game so you can be pissed off at leaders that havent existed for thousands of years.",3
"amazing... must have for any people who enjoy rts games.",5
"takes a few steps back compared to civ iv, but still an excellent game. word of advice: get the goty edition and avoid paying for $45 worth of dlc.",3
"this game is great fun. if you like strategy games that are also fun to play with friends this is your game. however, vanilla civilization v is terrible, no strategy just war forget everything else. so if you do buy make sure you also get the brave new world dlc too. (it adds trade routes, world congress, spying, religion, other improvements and much needed additional civilizations to play as) otherwise vanilla will just get repetetive and boring really quick. hope this helps i love civ v so if you have questions just ask.",5
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",3
"a very fun game. i can spend hours and hours of enjoyment on a single game (set to the fastest settings)",2
"it think it helps if you have someone who can help you with this game in the early stages, as it takes a while to remember what each of the things on screen actually does, but id definitely reccomend it. lots of options as to what you can do once youve got past the early stages.",1
"probably the most addicting/fun game i have ever played. if you buy it get all the dlc it makes the game a lot more complete.",8
"its awesome but takes a loooong time and when i finaly got to a gun i crashed d: although i recommend it!",1
"sarcasm warning do you hate your friends? do you want to hate your friends, then buy civ v the greatest hate fuel of all. watch as you and your friends scramble to build the best cultural buildings in all of history only to be beaten out by the ai players. enjoy the rage between all of you as you try to move through borders and pledge war on eachother. witness the expanding nations slowly taking over the map as you are raided by raging barbarians. tl:dr 10/10 would ruin friendships",1
"it is a very very very great turn based sratagy games and the creators did a formidable job on it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",1
"a great game! dont listen to anybody else, it is a great game!!!!",4
"havent played the civilization-series before i tried the 5th game, and i must say i regret i didnt try it earlier. it takes a little while to get in the gameplay, but its that perfect casual, relaxing and fun difficulity level. as far as i can tell, if you like strategy-games, and want a bit more in-depth than, say, age of empires/wonders, but still not as advanced as europa universalis and such games, this is the perfect game to start when you want to relax and get in to something that takes 10-50 hours.",2
"ive been confined in my household on a sunny day for four hours, playing this game. thats not like me, i do go outside sometimes, but, just, one, more, turn.... seriously, it sounds kinda stupid that a low paced strategy game has addiction? ever wanna take control of a nations politics? trading? resources? warfare? nuclear warfare? randomly generated maps? religions, news, and hunting? what about making a city grow? like simcity? yeah, you know what i mean. dont forget tactics to warfare and strategies. dont forget the sandbox and modding experience for this game. my addiction to this game is settled, ill be playing this for a long time...",1
"awsome time waister not a quick game so be prepaired for the long hull and great for playing with friends",1
"buy it, its worth every cent, you will have endless hours of fun trying to conquer the world and being the best civilization ! :)",1
"a great strategy game for everybody. in this game you start a civilization thousands of years ago, and advance your civilization to where humans are today! establish a great economy, a great army, or make your empire culturally flourish. with many difficulty levels for any skill level of play, moddability, replay value, long-lasting games, theres no way you can go wrong with civilization v.",1
"oh ill just finish this turn 5 hours later youre still thinking the same thing.",2
"wasted an entire weekend going to war with germany. only to screw my self over when they had thier one city left, it had a defence of 14 and i just wanted to nuke it. so i did. however in the process i would have had to declare war on india they too had one city left. figured ok i can take them....what i didnt ing see was the french and spanish subs with in thier waters next thing i know i have the spanards up my  with the french hitting me with baguettes while the germans retook thier land and the indias raining down an atomic storm that block out the sun because i was ing dead. ing fix this game... 10/10 will play this game once i get over this and reinstal thegame after i rage deleted it",5
"found it very fun, and a great way to have a long campaign wih a friend that worked very well, unlike other games.",1
"an awesome strategic game with an endless number of things to do on it. yes, i said endless. it has nearly 300 achievements.",1
"this is a good game once you get the hang of it fun solo and multiplayer",3
"great game and i would highly recommend to any strategy lovers",1
"the gold standard when it comes to turn based strategy. this series has time and time again proven to be endlessly entertaining offering a great deal of complexity and depth. i would reccomend this to anyone who enjoys a game like risk.",3
"id highly recommend getting the complete edition with all the dlc for the best value and fun! defiantly a great choice if you want to get a strategy game",1
"beware: do not start a game of this unless youve got atleast 3 hours of free time, it is suer addicting. that being said, i absolutley love this game! i was apprehensive to buy this at first because i had never played a strategy game before and didnt know if i would enjoy it. well i did, its very easy to get started with with different difficulties, locations, leaders and other variable that affect your playing experience. it also has great controls that are simple enough for anyone to uderstand. the graphics are gorgeous and the ambient music that accompanies the gameplay is a nice little bonus. bottom line: buy this game! this is a great introduction to strategy-based games :)",1
"amazing turn base stategy game. with facts and wonders you probably did not know!! if you like a stategy game with historical info i reccomend it so get it yea",4
"this is the strategy game to own although the matches take a very long time to finish (up to 2-3 days) its well worth it every match is different. there is almost no glitches what so ever so its a very smooth game to play and a wide vareity of things to do",2
"fantastic game. offers hours of game play and makes time fly by.",1
"ive only played for a few hours. its pretty meh. probably wont replay too often.",2
"sarcasm warning do you hate your friends? do you want to hate your friends, then buy civ v the greatest hate fuel of all. watch as you and your friends scramble to build the best cultural buildings in all of history only to be beaten out by the ai players. enjoy the rage between all of you as you try to move through borders and pledge war on eachother. witness the expanding nations slowly taking over the map as you are raided by raging barbarians. tl:dr 10/10 would ruin friendships",1
"the best if its genre by a mile and a half. highly recommended if you like your strategy games with a friendly learning curve, but still with that intricacy that can take a long time to master. (has an in built user friendly modding system in the main menu)",1
"great game to suck some time overall. there are some bugs it seems as you build your empire, the larger it gets the more often there are lag issues in processing turns.",3
"game in singleplayer is great... if not awesome (excluding stupid ai). multiplay on the other hand is total garbage... while using simultaneous turns with units movement and attacking animations turned on game f... up the word simultaneous as camera runs to show you the movement of you allied friend. when those animations are turned off (totally kills the atmosphere of game) the game plays similiar to board game, which you could do yourself if you get a pen, scissors and some paper... theres also no animations for faction leaders in diplomacy window... x_x also annoying stuff... but most crappy multiplay option is auto-peace. if you almost destroy enemy units after a hard fight... nope ai says peace and runs away... if you want to enjoy it, then this game is only for single play really. if you want multiplay then go invite few friends over and play monopoly.",1
"this game when it came out back in 2010 i went out immediately to buy it from gamestop because i wanted a hard copy, since its release they have added great dlc and we can expect more in the future. one of my favorite turn based strategies. just like i would recommend before making any purchasing of a game watch a video on youtube and get an idea if you would like to play what youre seeing in the video. i would recommend this game to really anyone its just a great time wether youre just playing singleplayer or multiplayer.",6
"civ 5 is a great turn base strategy game, where you build an empire, and fight others or be peaceful and try to avoid war with others, or be a person that expands there country.",2
"grand-strategy game that consumes more of your hours than is healthy. just one more turn easily turns into 5 hours. not for people looking for a quick-and-dirty strategy game like starcraft.",2
"quite possibly the best strategy (in both rts and tbs) game i have ever played, and ive played a lot of those. this one takes the cake from under the noses of strategy game greats like age of empires, age of mythology, starcraft, the total war series, and of course, the previous games from the civ series. if you buy this game, be sure to get the gold edition for the best experience!",6
"loved civilization iv so i expected a lot from this game and it has not failed me yet!",1
"got trapped on an island and got nuked by ghandi 9/10",2
"one of the best games ive ever played. even better with dlc.",6
"great game.this game will have you say yeah ill play for a little bit and there you are 5 hours later and you keep saying one more turn.one more turn..............",1
"good game! never plaly this before going to bed. its way to addictive.",1
"great game, just dont play it if you have something to do in the next 4-8 hours",6
"great game, very addictive. the game was good but the dlcs make it worth while with both gods and kings and brave new world. so much to do and so many ways to win!",2
"(note: i played a lot more of this during the elongated time my internet was down) sid meiers civ v is an awesome turn based stratergy game rich in content and only deepened by the vast collection of online mods. gameplay is simple at first but surprisingly deep and addictive. you pick a leader, and you rule your country. you start with only a few units and anciet technology but soon amass yourself with large armies, and highly advanced mordern technology. forging alliances with leaders is fun but the ai is rather idiotic at times and that can be troublesome, but its only a small problem for such a well made game. just one... more... turn",1
"this turned based strategy game will suck away your life. would recommend.",2
"hands down on of the most effective turn-based games ive played in a long time. only downside is in large player matches...fighting against other people eats up a serious amount of time.",3
"this game is amazing ill be in a game look up realise that i have been play for 6 hours have lost any real friends, have been disowened by my parents and dumped by my imaginary girlfriend still worth it",2
"this is the utimate turn-based stategy around, it does have slight problems though,as sometimes the a.i can go on the fritz during a invasion of your country but worth every penny. p.s its dlcs are worth picking up as g&k and bnw improve the experience by vast amounts.",2
"awesome game, very addictive, best played with friends.",2
"dont trust that friend of yours? this game will prove to you that you were not only right to distrust him in the first place, but that he is a hell of a better strategist then you. hours and hours wasted to prove something that takes starcraft 2 lesser than 15 minutes to deliver. but hell, when you roll up with your nukes and giant killing robots... its ing worth three weeks, 30 kg and your parents respect. also, gandhiiiii!!!!!",1
"wow! even though it may say i have never played this game... i have... i play offline this game is a-quality and should not be over looked, i have played countless hours and highly enjoy it. if you are looking for a fun, expand-and-conquer like game. then this is for you. it is very intimate and i enjoy playing it greatly.",1
"make sure you have no plans for a while... especialy plans to sleep; because they will not happen. one. more. turn.",2
"the game where you set up a big group game with your friends one night, and then the friends who start falling behind get bored or need to go to sleep, conveniently before their capital gets nuked. 5/5",1
"(the multiplayer can be buggy and anoyng) funny game to play online,addicted and fun,alot of civilitations and playng styles like you can be diplomatic,go to war,grow your popolation,have fun build all the wonders,explore the seas and get the best economy,build huge armys,rein over barbarians and city-states and get incledbly rich. i love this game,are you ready to write 6000 years of history?",1
"spent nearly 600 hours playing this game, where did my life go? e_e",7
"fantastic game. its a perfect mix of medieval/stone age strategy and modern/futuristic strategy. its a very well made game. anyone that likes strategy will like this game. its easy to learn but hard to master.",1
"bought this in the sale as to, essentially, go back to my childhood of playing it with my uncle and dad for hours on end. bought back all my love for the series, sat and played it for nearly 4 hours instead of going to bed (aka between 2 in the morning and 6 in the morning) would recommend this game (any game in the series especially tot) to anyone whos an old hand at stratergy games and even those that are interested by the genre but never played any of this kind of game before :)",1
"this game is all i have ever wanted in a strategy game and more. it is ridiculously adicting and i cant stop playing it. the game is full of features and definatly worth the money, i would suggest getting the gods and kings expansion with civilization v to start off with.",4
"when i play i cant stop. it has ruined my life. my wife has left me and i cant see my children anymore. i havent been outside in 2 weeks. 4/5",1
"some aspects are a bit dumbed down from civ iv, but the exansions will fix that and even exand on them. also combat is extremely improved, youll no longer lose attack helicopters to cavemen.",1
"not much to say about civ v other than what everyone else says about it, its an awesome game!",1
"very fun game but i would buy the bundle with all the dlcs because its the best deal and you may not be able to play with everybody.",1
"extremely addicting.if you hate gandhi yet want a fun game then do a custom single player game with no gandhis and med diff. invaded belgrade,nuked venice thrice and adopted fascism. gotc,game of the century.our kids and aliens shall look down upen this game and not shun it because of its greatness",1
"really fun game with friends. gets really competitive and always fun to wreck your buddies. 10/10",1
"as a long time player of the civilization series i was impressed by this addition. this is a big step up from their last game and a truly great game to start the series on.",3
"this is possibly the best strategy game ive ever played i recommend this game to any and all!",4
"dont need to say much. if you dont know about civ 5 then i cant help you. buy it, and say goodbye to friends, facebook, your goldfish....",6
"amazing game, hits all the points that make an rts great!",1
"civilization 5 is a solid game. it looks and feels a lot like an expanded digital version of the board game called the settlers of catan. yet it must be said that there really isnt much depth to the gameplay. even though you have a lot of freedom to customize your experience to your liking. at the end of the day, civilization 5 really seems shallow and almost childish compared to the vast depth and immersion of different paradox games. games such as europa universalis 4 or crusader kings 2.",1
"if you like strategy, empire building, world revolutionizing fun, this is a great game for you. unfortunately the game is little lackluster in the base game, but dont get me wrong it is very fun. however, adding the two major dlcs (possibly some of the best dlcs to a game) make it incredibly fun. religion, politics, and so much more! as you can see, i have nearly 200 logged onto the game so that should hopefully give a bit of insight if youre planning to purchase it. i wholeheartedly recommend the two major dlcs. over all i love this game and the whole franchise.",3
">dont know jack about civ >buy steam sale >play 3 multiplayer games >mfw 14 hours >11/10 would buy again",1
"its a civ game, now with hexes. its also kinda pretty. why are we doing this, just get the game already.",2
"great micro-transactions. but rather poor cutscenes. 69/10 420",2
"excellent turn-based strategy game. i got into this from as a long time player of the total war series",1
"it was once said that man can be entertained for hours on end with the simple image of boobs. while this is true, man gains nothing from this other than an erection, dirty tissues and a hard to explain smell on his . purchasing this game is not only a visual pleasure for your brain. it helps you understand that 10 hours in a chair can really mean something. your wife or significant other may leave you due to the new smell that has appeared. but at least you can cleanse the land of all that oppose you without being called a racist or going to jail.",1
"one of the best, if not the best, strategy games. with g&k and bnw this has reached the current pinnacle of the civilization series. 1 unit per tile system, interesting culture/tourism game, religions, personal ai opponents and policy system with great random maps and game settings gives hundreds if not thousands of hours of replay value.",10
"ing gandhi nukes everyone. take him out first 9/11 would fly again",1
"your life will slowly wilt before your eyes, as you are subsumed by your desire to conquer.",8
"nuclear warheads, what more could i possibly say other than death robot. oh wait, it has those too.",2
"i loved civ 4 but the improvements to this one make it even better, i would recommend this to anyone who likes turn based strategy games.",1
"as the inca, i allied with kamehameha and conquered everyone. sadly, my warmongering spree was ended by gandhis nukes. 999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10 would get nuked again.",4
"still the best 4x series, v has the on-going refinements that makes it difficult to go back and play 1-4, though i prefer stacking units for combat. the end game is still a bit tedious, especially since the ai is still not very good at automating worker units. i still find limited thrill in non-conquest victory conditions but that may have more to do with my style of play than a deficiency in the design.",2
"although i do not play it as much as i did, i still think that this is one of my favourite games of all time. it is great to play against the a.i. and even better to play people online, (although some people take it a bit too seriously). pros: - easy controls - large variations in civilizations available - simple display (of data and map) - option for normal and strategic display - fair and balanced gameplay - fun to play, even after long games - very customizable options (in-game) - a.i. is balanced: in difficulty and in gameplay cons: - long games can sometimes grow tedious - some civilizations are better at everything than others [this may be unavoidable: to have weak civs and more powerful civs] - occasional texture glitches; but i think thats just me all and all, i think this is a brilliant game, and would most definately recommend it to people who enjoy strategy games.",3
"sid meiers civilization v is an excellent strategy game for gamers of all ages. it is well-made and entertaining. i would give this masterpiece five stars out of a maximum of five stars.",2
"this is probably the best strategy based game i have ever played , i have played civilization since civ 2 , and i can personaly tell you that this game is incredible . it requires skill , while still being a game for casual/ easy going players. the dlc are fantastic and are among the greatest i have ever played . over all it is a well crafted master piece that is a must buy for any gamer looking for a game to test his skills of leadership. over all 10/10 .",4
"only play if you intend to not do anything else for the next day or two. its addicting.",2
"i dont know much about the civilization series as a whole but i have played civilization revolution (i know some dont consider it apart of the series) on the xbox 360 and the game stays true to what it is all about, that one more turn addiction, and single matches that can go on for weeks to months. i highly recommend this game to fans of strategy with the new hexes instead of the usual average tiles and the elimination of stacking units. to fans of the series you probably already bought it and to those who arent particularly a fan of strategy still try the demo im sure youll find something good on it that will keep you hooked.",2
"this game is ing fabulous. highly recommended. the gods & kings and brave new world expansion packs are a must have.",4
"great strategy game for anyone who has a little too much time on their hands",4
"great game well built even if the sequel has come out this game has its perks",4
"i have no regrets buying this game and every single dlc. worth my time and every singe dollar. although it could use some bug fixes, a ranking system and more realism no doubt one of the best games ive ever played.",6
"super solid game. excellent for casual players as well as for those who like to go into more depth. on of the best value for money games i think you can buy and i have thoroughly enojoyed playing it.",2
"this game is something special, you control civilizations and make choices for their paths and strategies to fight and destory other civilizations. would advise anyone who loves to make their descisions, strategies and ways of playing a game to buy this right now.",1
"give at-least 6 hours of free time before attempting to play youve been warn. you will be glued to your screen.",2
"holy  this game is addictive. being persia and nuking berlin and wiping out entire civilizations. i couldnt get into it at first, but  me i cant stop.",1
"are you prepared to use ghandi as your instrument of war against the genghis khan and his ally, george washington, in a race for nuclear weapons? this is a game you play if you have a full month to kill. its a game where you start at 7pm and then stop playing at 8am because you have to go to work. this is the definition of video game crack.",1
"+1 brave new world and gods and kings make the game better.",1
"this is one of the most addicting games ive ever played. theres just no way of stopping unless you have an insane amount of self control. definitely one of the best games ive ever palyed.",3
"wow - start a game and then look at the time, its already 3am :o 10/10",1
"one of my favorite games ever great game would buy it again and would cry if i couldent play it!",4
"sit down after work and decide to play a bit. wife tells me to come to bed soon. only a few more turns and....its 3 am in the morning and im still playing. this is not a quick or casual game. in fact it took me almost 15 hours to play through on a small map. after acheiving a victory i kept playing because there were still goals i hadnt yet accomplished. long story short, its a great game, it has a lot of replay value, it is deep and challenging on many levels, i would recommend it to others but i dont want them to throw away their lives...just one more turn!",1
"this game is amazing. i started a round at default settings (on the largest sized map though, of course). its been 11 and a half hours, and im still not done. ive maybe conquered 15% of the world. the amount of gameplay in this game is rediculous (a round could maybe even get up to 50-75 hours single player) and the strategic possibilities are infinite. best strategy game ive ever bought, and well worth your money.",2
"this game is awesome!!! not as awesome as civilization 2 but still , will beat any tbs game any time of the day.",2
"this is one of the most addicting games i have played in a long time. the dlc really changes up gameplay and isnt just new character/map content.",2
"simply an incredibly engrossing game. compared to rival series such as total war, civ 5 is wonderfully accessible; the interface ensures that youll never miss available actions by queueing them, and the at-first complicated map is quickly made understandable thanks to a comprehensive encyclopedia and advisor system. while i cant comment on the accuracy of the language the world leaders speak, they are all visually well represented, having clear, fun animations when you decide to trade with or declare war on them. the soundtrack is suitably evocative of the various world cultures, and a gamut of settings for maps and variables ensures the even if you tire of the unique scenarios or the main game, there is always the option of creating custom matches. strongly recommended for anyone who enjoys historical and/or nation simulation games.",2
"i used an iroquois lumberjack tribe to conquer the british nation, then peaced out to space before india could nuke me to death. 1/1",4
"highy adictive, not for people who cant stay still for awhile.",3
"i barely even played before it quit working. tried 20 or more reinstalls, your steam server constantly loses communications, it i did get it loaded it would say unable to load something or another. constant issues. cant even play in offline mode anymore. a great game turned to crap.",1
"the is a great game, well worht the money even with the dlc, its the kind of game where you can just keep playing and vever get bored!",2
"a greatgame that makes real hours seem like minutes",1
"i started playing today and already 11 hours in thats how much i love this game. it took me some time to learn the basics since ive never played a game like this before, i havent really played any stratagy games so this is my first one and i really enjoy it.",1
"fun in depth game. if you dont like turned based games then this isnt for you. the dlcs expand the game alot and add alot more to it. you will learn to hate the world congress if you do not own it. and no matter what you do on the higher dificulties like imortal and diety, you will struggle. but you will go out with a bang. or you play lower level and are equal to everyone. or basic and destroy everyone",3
"one of the best strategy games ive ever played. its charming, witty, funny, and plays very smoothly, with very few bugs. the ai is intelligent, the maps excellent, and the game suceeds where so many others havefailed to captivate me.",2
"civ v is the best civilization game i have played yet.",1
"this is an awesome game...and i dont do strategy! i must have put in over 20 hours so far, and im only just scratching the surface. ill report back when i know what the heck im doing, but so far love it.",1
"amazing. so much time. pls i almost won, just one more turn...",1
"its a really fun game to play whit your friends. but that if ur not going cross platform. allways out of sync so you cant play as a pc user whit a mac user.",4
"play it once, shame on you play it twice, shame on the game play it trice, and youre addicted",3
"love, love, love!! after you get going you wont stop.... either play on deity and get conquered on exactly 30 seconds or play on settler, and itll last for 4 hours. either way, loads of fun!!",1
"i dont like turn based games much. feel very slow paced and combat is boring, especially if u are used to fast paced rtss.",1
"pros: i can play this game casually and competitively all the civs mean you can have alot of replayability i personally find this fun and can play it in long sessions mods are fun simple learning curve cons: if you plan to play multiplayer games then you have to buy dlcs which is expensive. bugs are rare but they can be game breaking and barely fixed overall a great game 9/10",6
"a moment comes which comes rarely in history but we step out from the old to the new when an age ends and a soul of a nation long suppressed, finds utterance. build courage when courage sees to fail, gain faith when there seems to be little cost for faith, create hope when hope becomes forlorn and remember....the future belongs to those who believe in their dreams....i have to say, this has been the most fantastic, most amazing game i have ever played. especially when you get the dlcs that can be be bought to go with it. a generally good game with regular civilization 5 but the excitement and intensity of it increases when you get bnw and g&k dlcs. definetly consider getting this game if you havent already and be sure to get the dlcs!!!!!!",4
"one more turn turns into 40 more turns. incredibly addicting",2
"wake up every morning at 10 oclock at night, half an hour before going to bed drink a cup of sulpheric acid play civ v 29 hours a day *insert city* wants whales *insert leader* denounces me *insert city* wants whales *insert leader* attacks me for no reason *insert city* wants whales gandhi nukes me leave the world on a spaceship/kill everyone/build a perfect society/wait until doomsday repeat 10/10",3
"obviously the staple of turn based games. i dont know how the strategy genre would be faring right now without this game out there. no faults at all. only ever crashed one time on startup otherwise no bad experiences. i was also surprised at the attention to the co-op aspect which was pleasing and unusual in games even in the same genre. hot seat mode which allows multiplayer on the same computer definitely allowed me to introduce the game to several friends as well.",1
"probably a better jumping-in point than civ iv, but something of a step backwards for the series. this game improves in some ways and fails in many more others, but a good game for those less interested in thinking and planning than civ iv.",3
"umm...yes. i like this game. note: the leader of japan is a jerk. :(",1
"this game is great. the expansions even better. best in the series by far. i could play 400 turns and still not be bored at all!",3
"on a scale of 1 to 10 on the nuke-happy scale, gandhi is literally a 12, literally",1
"the best 4x game of all time. also the best at empire building. nothing really come close. eu might have more depth and complexity, but this one is overall bette produced and more accessible and it does not feel like work.",2
"pretty boring. beginning eras are fun but only for a few miutes. before you know it its zipped into modern times. all late game units look the same. dull design. ai cheats. lazy programming. strange choices, such as you cant have a lumber mill in jungle or fish rivers. any difficulty level from normal ramps up incredibly quickly. ruins flow. it is strangely addictive though...like a scab you have to scratch. plus points are that it works perfectly and i have never had a crash, glitch or save game problem.",2
"i once went over to a freind of mines house at 9:00 am. i sat down at the desk next to him, grunted a hello, then loaded up civ v. his parents kicked me out around 11:00 at night. i proceeded to go home and play it for another few hours before passing out on my desk. woke up the next day with a migrane and an overheated laptop. all of my progress was gone. almost killed someone. game was pretty good btw.",2
"this is the best strategy game i have ever played. 10/10",1
"one of the best turn-based strategy games around sid meierss civilization is still going strong since 1990",1
"civilization v is a fantastic turn-based stratagy game!",4
"what can i say... its civ - of course its good! initially though i did find it a little more frustrating than civ iv in that every single ai opponent wants to go to war with you - even ghandi!, but they can be relatively easily kept at bay on all but the highest difficulty levels if you are leading the tech race and have a full kitty (and if you dont have either of those - youre not doing it right ;p). overall, an interesting and fairly replayable addition to an already great series.",1
"just like monopoly it takes a while to play, and ruins friendships. 10/10",1
"shaka zulu is sooper irrational, stay away from that man! also, mlg gamer pros always get the time victory, des the baes win!",1
"great fun, very addictive, make sure you have plenty of time when playing this game as you will keep telling yourself just one more turn which can go on for hours before you realise. great fun on multiplayer as you attempt to out-do your friends economically or technologically or aid them against their enemies, or, even become their enemies.",2
"this game is simply amazing. i nuke all the other countries. starting with ghandi.",3
"great game, good fun and brilliant multiplayer, best with all the dlc.",2
"became friends with gandhi and didnt get nuked. love it.",1
"have you ever wanted to knock in swedens  as japan? conquer the world as germany by the year 2013? buy this game and sink so many hours into it, you wont possibly have buyers remorse. so much fun, so much.",1
"maybe not as groundbreaking as civilization iii or maybe even iv? however, this one is much friendlier to those new to the series, and stil appeals to those longtime players. you will be wanting one...more...turn...",3
"amazing game....one of the best strategy games ever played. very addicting and even better when you have a friend(or 2) to play with....10/10",1
"complex, but still easy accessible. great fun and keeps you busy for a long time.",3
"my friend took newyork from me so i couldnt have the fountin of youth, decided he didnt want the fountin so he razed the city and demanded 2 gold and 1 horse for a peace between our nations. 10/10 would lose again.",3
"youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you, but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter. 20/10",1
"great game. it gets boring after a while so try some mods out. 7/10",2
"really nice strategy game where you have to think hard about your turns. i like the different ways of winning and the task to pay attention to all your opponents tactics and winning possibilities.",1
"one of the best games i have ever played. the learning curve is sort of high, but once you get the hang of what exactly you are supposed to be doing you will love it. this is the kind of game that just sucks you into it and hours pass by without you even knowing. simply amazing, hats off to the developers.",2
"well civ 5 and g&k worked great and are really fun but i have yet to get bnw to work since i got it and it seems to be a very common problem w/ the second expansion unfortunately.",1
"i was led to believe that ghandi was a peaceful person in this game.... he invaded me and then destroyed my citys. 10/10 ghandi is evil......",1
"best strategy game ever buy it now or die of being bored!",1

"holy  is all i can say. this is an amazing civ game. i wont say its the most complex but it feels very fulfilling to play. absolutely love it.",2
"amazing game... just amazing, but twice as amazing with brave new world",3
"this is how i have fun with this game step by step 1.conquer a city 2.raze the city 3.hear the people rumbling screaming crying 4.watch the city burn 5.feel it 6.double the feel 7.laugh 8.repeat",5
"i wholeheartedly endorse this product and/or medical device.",1
"best strategy game ive played to this day, its mostly strategy, if you dont have a mind for strategy i suggest you dont buy the game then...",2
"if you dont want me to nuke your , your going to have to offer more than 10 coins a turn",1
"excellent game! totally worth the money, intricate while simple 10/10",2
"its so easy to lose hours of time playing this game, and its easy to have fun advancing your civ and plotting against other civs. amazing game.",1
"greetings and blessing be upon you. will you build a kingdom that stands the test of time?",3
"buy at least gods and kings (preferably from gold edition), and you already have amazing time-sinking game. find some buddies for multiplayer => best game for long winter nights.",1
"oh great fellow gamer, who awaits the next great pc streategy game with misty eyes. young was the gaming community when the great and powerful sid meier unleashed the civilization series unto the world. renowned all over the world for its depth and addictiveness, the franchise grew in stature with each passing installment. while others attempted to recapture its majesty, its glory could not be recreated. yet, amidst all this, the grandeur of civilization endured. now, you look to civilization 5 to once again claim that position on top of the world of strategy gaming. will it once again ensnare the sense of helpless gamers, or die with a whimper. oh wise and respected gamer, this great series once again years to be played for days on end. the choice is yours.",3
"ok, even the base game by itself is to fun, now add dlc to mix this game is gold if your a strategic thinker!",1
"brilliant but multiplayer could do with some patching.",1
"be aware this game can be extremely addictive, also note the fact that this game can take up lots of playing time which is a dangerous mix. apart from the temporary beginners addiction this game is brilliant, there are a huge amount of things to experiment with. the developers find somewhat of a good balance between in game capabilities of you and your civ and managed to not overload new players with excessive amount of options and things to manage. the beauty of it is you can always set up your match the way it suits you and chose when you want to get involved in more complex mechanics. if you like any kind of strategy whether itd be subtle, casual and slow or fast and intense this game will provide. civ 5 will make you think, laugh and bask in the sheer power it can make you feel. 8/10",3
"hmm, only a 5/10 from me, im afraid ... id dearly like to recommend this but there are still (after 3 years) outstanding bugs, freezes, lock-ups & crashes that detract from overall gameplay & enjoyment, paricularly with larger maps that have more going on. buy it if you must (& then only when steam have a sale on) but be warned",2
"7.8/10 ~ lost my civ to water barbarians. too much water water is op remove it",1
"sometimes i start playing for a quick game and then i realize its december.",1
"one more turn cant hurt. (12 hours later) oh ! did i just play for 12 hours straight?!! -classy idiot",1
"amazing game. addictive and really fun. dont start playing right before finals week",1
"i have poured all most 200 hours into this game it is great for people that love turn based strategy and 4x games in general. buy it and so good by to your life. partners will leave you, children will cry of hunger but your empire will last forever.",2
"an amazing game with love hate and an awful lot of murder!",4
"i have been playing sid meiers civilization ever since it came out on dos. civ v follows the same formula that stood the test of time in any turn based 4x games. with the addition of steamworkshop, the modding community, expect hundreds of fun time playing,experimenting and wasting hours. just....one.....more......turn and its already morning.",1
"amazing game. highly worth the money to get the dlcs also.",10
"with the new gods and kings expac, this game is taken from a mediocre entry into the hallowed series to a game worthy of being a civ game.",3
"engrossing turn-based empire-builder with simultaneous-turn multiplayer, an excellent game.",2
"its addicting, fun, and has one of the highest replay values ever.",9
"great strategy game, looking forward to the next one in the series.",1
"this is a highly addicting game for strategy fans and a welcoming addition to the civilization series.",1
"awesome turn-based strategy with loads of dlc, definetely one worth playing!",3
"ing great but dont ever play it with friends because you will hate them by the end of the game",1
"i never was into turn based strategy games, however civilization games always caught my interest.",1
"it has a lot of replayability and is pretty good mini hitler simulator. seems pretty balanced, all in all. nukes dont feel nearly as devestating as they should be - late game on a warrior run i tend to toss them out like vowels in a sentence and i never feel like as big a monster as i should be. has the steam workshop too so you have even more crap to stuff in when you run out of love for the vanilla stuff. gods and kings is pretty balanced save for the initial pantheon powers (you have a choice between +10% population growth and other stuff like +1 production - so needless to say, there is no reason to take 90% of what is on the list because there are one or two things that offer bonuses that will actually mean anything late game). still, nothing shattering or bad.",3
"fun game tht can last for hours! great for when nothings going on and you want to have some fun either alone or with friends!",1
"cabre why did u ditch me we were friends also this is an awesome game",1
"i love this game, it can be really fun to play with friends when youre winning and fun when youre not :3. this game is really cool because you can do so much, and it is also a game that requires you to think, use skill and strategy rather than simply pointing and shooting, and it has so many details and interesting game mechanics while not being overly-complicated.",2
"i avoided the civ series for years, only recently picking up civ v as part of a humble bundle. wow. what can i say about this game that hasnt been said countless times before? tons of fun and crazily addictive. i was right to fear it and, if you value your free time, you should too.",4
"a massive time killer, well worth every hour given over. civ 5 is a solid advancement to the series. the expansions are fantastic, though it can take awhile to adjust to new features. overall a solid investment.",3
"a very good game with endless possibilities as loads of countries.",2
"great game although not advisable if you have any form of life at all though, such a good time waster.",1
"this game is magnificent. everytime i load it up i cant help but play all day. this game is one of the best strategy game so far ever created. civ vi anyone?",3
"takes a while to learn the game mechanics, but once you get into it, expect many sleepless nights.",2
"the popularity and longetivity of the civilization series kinda speaks for itself, but civ v once again raises the bar for the 4x strategy games genre. the level of customization, of choices given for different kind of experiences makes it the one game i replayed the most. there are many difficulty levels which, at higher levels, give you very challenging game where you need to be a master at geopolitical control and making the best out of all little advantages you got while compensating for your disadvantages. there are many concepts, old and new, that can help you build your civilizations. religion, cultural policies, tourism, happiness, diplomatic relations, trade, sciences, ideologies ... the combinations are almost endless. once again, a civ game i have played (too?) much of !",4
"this game is great for replayability since every game is different, plus, ghandi nuked me a++",2
"its a really fun game where you can decimate your enemies or take the one of many peaceful ways out. you can also make wonders and buildings and found a religion. all in all i give it a 10/10.",1
"this is an extrememly addictive game which will take hours of your time, the single player and dlc hosts hours of play time and plenty of replayability, whilst the game does cater towards a millitary victory and the randomers in multiplayer drop out before the end of the game, it still isnt enough to stop you from buying the game 9/10",3
"tons of fun, multiplayer is great for ruining friendships.",1
"a turn-based game, so you can micro-manage your empire as it slowly takes over the world. there are tons of victory/map/civilization combinations, which makes achievement-hunting a blast! :)",2
"this game blew my  off. i now have feelings of ambivalence of whether to sue, or to congratulate the devs on achieving such a feat.",2
"simply astounding! one of the best strategic games ever! will keep you hooked until you realize its like 3:30 am, then your like  i better sleep so i can wake up and play more of this amazing game! it is also a great way to take a bored day and turn it into a acomplished day full of choosing productions!",1
"some of the personalities in this are annoying. like life. you can make friends with them and make enemies with others. like life. you can burn their villages and laugh while your troops roll over their young. .. i guess still kind of like life if you are a war lord.",1
"played a game against russia. never got along with them. a new cold war dawned. i lost and was nuked. 10/10.",3
"my new favourite strategy game! civ 5 offers a new experience every time you play. a ton of playable civilizations and lots of historical and fictional scenarios to attempt, as well as one of the best modding communities ive ever seen. firaxis prove once again they are the masters of strategy games.",2
"i have played all the civilizations even the one at play station this civilization is the worst it they developed new characteristics that was less enjoyable it wasnt as enjoyable as the rest civs. 3/10",1
"how to people get bored with this game? i mean, seriously, aztec xcom soldiers, while atomic bombs are launched from montezuma. where in the world can you get that? waiiiiit.... just... one.... more.... turn....",2
"dont be turned off by the fact that this is a turn based game. that was a mistake i made allot of times but now ill never make that same mistake again. i havent played any of the predecessors so it might or not be the best in the series but as a newcomer to civilization this game blew my mind! most definitely a must have!",1
"yesh awesome game :d if youre into games like spore at the civilization stage buy this now",2
"if you wanted to dominate the world or live out your fantasies of becoming the ultimate scientocracy, this is the game for you.",1
"easily the best turn based strategy out there. quite different from its predecessors but thats not a bad thing as the older games still stand up well today so this just provides a solidly different game that is great on its own merits. top notch!",1
"what other game can have you end up in a quadruple allience with gahndi, attlilla the hun and george washington",1
"in the end, i got enough enjoyment out of this game to recommend it, though it still feels off and game-y - it really punishes you for doing things the wrong way, and i never really feel like i can attack anybody until civilizations have guns, when most of the appeal for me is playing as ancient empires like the romans. but anyway, its still worth playing.",1
"this is one of the best games ive ever played in my entire life, if youre a fan of strategy games, this is your nirvana right here! 9.5/10",2
"with intriguing, self-presented stories and endless possibilities in an infinite number of worlds, civilization v is quite simply one of the most fun, interesting and addictive games i have ever played.",1
"this is a game you can get lost in. there is always just one more turn and its so hard to resist the temptation to keep on going. its fun, stragetic and most of all very user friendly. its easy to get into if youve never played a turn based game. the tutorial is incredibly helpful and really goes through the fine lines of explaining everything properly.",1
"best world domination game yet! my max pay price: $15... with expansions: $20",1
"this game is great. its a fun addicting way to waste time. it, however, does have some flaws. the a.i.s dont exactly act the way people would and lots of the later game units are really gimicky and unbalanced. luckily, they created expansions to the game to amend their past mistakes. its kind of a puss-out to make the dlc include civilizations instead of just releasing all of them with the game, but it makes up for it with new play styles, scenarios, and feel for the game. on its own, the game is a 6.5/10. with the dlc (especially brave new world), i becomes a 9.3/10. for any fan of the strategy genre, i highly recommend this game. have fun!",2
"ghandi did nothing wrong. the nuclear devastation of my last civ game didnt happen.",3
"dont like strategy games, love this one. great game, even for newbies in the strategy genre. really good fun with friends, shame the loading screens take a little while, but it is all worth it to play a relaxing game of civ with mates.",1
"this game is actually really good and i reccomend it highly",1
"one does not simply play just 1 hour of this. itll ruin your life 11/10",1
"i have over 1000 hours playing this game. fully 50% of that is probably in the please wait between turns, waiting for the computer ais to act. the game isnt the best of its kind (thats sid meiers alpha centauri) but its a great game to relax with. what i often do is take my turn, and then, while the game is processing all the ai players and im waiting for my next turn, i do something productive. ive gotten a lot of work done while playing this game.",10
"in this game you can guide a civilzation through time. and not any normal crap- civiliation either, real powerful civilizations! yeah definitely better than some othercraptastic civilization building games.",2
"this is way too good killer of time! spend like 10 hours to win 1 large map",1
"the best of the saga. full-stop. only negative thing i have to say is the graphics: good overall, nothing jaw-dropping...but why its so heavy on a graphics card only sierra knows",2
"fun game learning curve but fun with lots of friends and baes",1
"just doing this for a badge. though is a good game",1
"this game is the best.i thought who the heck would want to play a game with turns but when i played i loved it so much it kept me hours on end with so much stuff to it you dont have to play civ 4,3,2,1 just play civ 5 and you will have fun and get brave new world dlc it would make it more fun",2
"id inject this game into myself if that was possible",3
"this game damn its good especially if you like strategy games warning highly addictive. but if this going to be the first game you ever play you are gonna have a bad time",2
"it was unclear if this one really beat out civ iv for me, but with brave new world, there isnt a doubt that this installment is the best so far! great for anyone who likes pure strategy!",4
"it is addictive and you will never want to stop playing!",3
"ive had the base game a long while now. and the expansions just make it better. this game will never grow old for me",5
"very good game :) , tutorial is boring, unintuitive and wordy though.",2
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",3
"this game is my time machine! enter and play for 10 minute, after exit the game, instead of 10 minutes, 10 hours already past~~~ with great mods community for this game, the replay value increased+ with lots of way to end the game, the replay value increased+ too bad, after play a while, i realised some civs are pre-set to win early, some civs are pre-set to auto win if u not harass them early but still, replay value, and magical time sink mechanic, every money u spent for this game -> worth it",1
"such a great time waster, i can get sucked in for hours without even realizing it.",1
"conquerd the known world with japanese mechs, felt like killing myself 10/10 would play again",4
"if you enjoy turn based startegy games, this is your game. i bought the complete pack with all the dlc except the new one, for about $13. its worth your money even at full price. just be careful to pay attention to the time unless you want to accidently pull an all nighter on this game. 9/10 - experienced graphics issues later game and when loading up a game, otherwise great.",5
"super fun game to play. time goes by fast when its you and friends playing with or against each other. a must have for anyone who likes this type of game!",1
"very good strategy game.exceeded my expectatons.solid gameplay and easy to learn.9/10",1
"this is one of my favorite games on pc, its for every gamer out there.",1
"amazing game. multiplayer is a bit glitchy, but otherwise its one of my favorite games",3
"this is a great game, you can just play this for hours and you wont even realise it. ive got the full addition and i have to say it is money well spent, ive played nearly 90 hours on this and i still havent explored every feature! i definetly recommend!!!!!!!",2
"one of the best stategy games ive ever played. its addictive to raise your civilization through the ages.",4
"its nice but you must play it in long durations of time in order to enjoy the game. playing in in a short period of time is like eating one potato chip",1
"a very long addictive gameplay! its really fun and worth the wait (turned based)",1
"i cant belive that i played it for 1000 hours! every game has needed various situation and tactics.",10
"civ 5 was my first taste of this genre and it qucikly became one of my favourite games of all time. this game has no weaknesses it has good graphics, easy to use interface, gameplay mechanics that are as complex and sohpisticated as you want and lots of replayability. i only wish that online multiplayer was easier to set up with strangers so i could play more civ 5. all in all, civilizations 5 is one of my favourite games and is well worth the buy.",2
"one of my favourite games, if not my favourite. 10/10 would nuke france whilst being ghandi the ruffless dictator.",3
"what can i say? its sid meier and its civilization. if you took the man hours spent playing this game on the space program, we probably could go to another planet by now.",5
"an utter piece of  unless you have every piece of dlc, especially gods and kings as well as brave new world. with these dlc, the game goes from being an abomination to an actually fun sequel to the brilliant civ iv. it has its issues even with all the dlc and patches, but there is definitely still a lot of fun and enjoyment to be had with it.",3
"civ has got to be one of the best strategy games ive ever tried. turn-based and played on a hexagonal field, a bit like a board game, but the special rules in civ make you think twice before doing anything. one part of the game that i love is how you get to control every little aspect of your civ; from research and military, to social policies (communism!) and construction. another great thing is that there is a big selection of different civs, each with their own unique units and/or buildings and traits, from across time to choose from; such as 18th century america, 1st century rome, 9th century denmark, and many more, with another chunk being added with the gods and kings expac, such as 17th century sweden. also has a f*cking great soundtrack. my conclusion: if you are into other turn-based strategy games, such as total war, but want en exciting twist, try civilization 5.",2
"fantastic addition to the civ series, cannot wait for the next one!",1
"one of the best games i have ever gotten my hands on. ive never played a civilization game or any game of the game type and ended up on a 22 hour spree of oh my god i cant stop, this is amazing. worth every penny.",2
"like 4x games? dont know what they are? probably wont enjoy this. i like them though!",1
"any game in which i can play as dr evil trying to conquer big boss so i enlist the help of equestrians and spartans, im most likely that i wont have a bad time.",5
">start game >become friends with everyone >attila declares war on me after years of friendship >destroy him down to his capitol >attila offers peace >denied >kill attila >get called warmonger 10/10 would warmong again",2
"definitely worth buying! especially during the steam sales! insane amount of replayability! good buy",8
"in cases where i feel like warmangering and cackling maniacally, civilizaion v is my go to game. worth every cent.",4
"turn-based strategy gaming at its very best. acquire the expansion packs to get the full experience. you wont regret it!",1
"a classic, cant go wrong with this. i just wish more people played it. sure, the graphics arent the greatest. it is however fun. very versatile in game play and style. build up armies, make treaties, beat people down, build em up,  em off and then be at war with the world. its great, fun, learn cultures, and history all at the same time while having fun. what more could ya ask for ?",3
"this game is amazing. just truly amazing, to the point of speechlessness. you take control of one of many civilizations, ranging from the americans to the egyptians, and try to make your civilization last the test of time. there are five unique ways to win, many amazing units and strategies, and thousands of unique ways to set up a game. the multiplayer is phenomenal, the modding community is the best this side of minecraft, and it runs amazingly smooth. this gives it many advantages over the previous games in this great series. if you want a quality strategy gaming experience with some history on the side, this is the place to go. and with the recent brave new world expansion (which i pre-ordered), it got way better.",7
"this game is a lot of fun especialy if you have freinds but even as a single player expirence it is very fun and i would recomend it however the peformance is not a amzing but not unplayable.",3
"do not play this game! to addictive, you will lose track off time, your friends, work and all youve got ;-)",1
"made the great wall of japan and controlled entire continents. 10/10",1
"worth the money xd. still one of the best strategy games and definately the best game of 2012 and 2013.",3
"a game you can play and literally lose days at a time, then after 20 or so hours of gameplay and lose so its all been for nothing! fantastic game, if i ever get bored or have spare time on my hands, throw it on and watch the day disappear. easy enough to pick up as well, cant wait for next expansion..",1
"if you havnt played it, you need to. its a great strategy game that takes time that is well worth the investment. to say the least about it, it is one of those games that will make you say at some point, oh, ill only play another hour before going to bed. two days later, just one more hour. 10/10",6
"this game is so addictive i have played it so much and is really replayable as every game is different",2
"what other game could i say i defeated julius caesar with giant death robots ? excellent game that allows thoughtful and even sometimes maniacal crushing of another civilisation. a possible downside would i felt mid-way through a campaign i was merely next turn ing until my society had advanced to a powerful state.",2
"by far the most time i have ever invested in a game. only buy if you have lots of free time.",2
"so much fun and can easily waste the whole day on this game. easy for anyone to pick up since the game does a good job of explaining things to you with the advisors and civilopedia. i didnt play the vanilla version but i heard gk & bnw helped make the game a lot better.",1
"if u like war our old stuff also counterys youll like this",1
"what is there to say about civilization. every game in the series is awesome and this one is just as epic. its so game is so good that it speeds up time. it will soak up your soul but in a good way.",2
"civilization is one of the few games that is really worth its price. you can keep playing it fo as long as you want and every time it will present you with chalenges and meaninful decisions. not that 8 hours disposable crap you are used to. buy it now.",1
"this is a very good game but it says that steam servers are too busy every time i atempt to start it up.",2
"utterly addictive. its always fun to ttake over the world.",3
"i have only played a couple of hours but i am having a blast.",1
"even though its for smart people, i like to play it.",3
"historical fiction: yes famous world leaders: yes interdependant trade: yes as many bugs as skyrim: no",1
"its a great game and i can spend tons of hours on it creating different scenarios for myself",1
"absolutly beautiful version of the civ instalments. hands down my fav !",1
"a fun timbased gamee about ruling empieres deffintly worth my money",1
"one of the best turn based strategy games ever created!",2

"put your hand on your heart and say youve never physically or mentally said to yourself: one more turn..... 11/10",1
"fun game as well very long gameplay only one thing its more fun to play with friends.",2
"very fun game to play, racked many hours on solo and on multiplayer. would definitely recommend this game to anyone :d",2
"if you like turned based strategy this is the game for you. countless hours fly by without even realizing it. multiplayer is there as well; its fun to get two other friends on the same team and watch your research skyrocket while you gang up on all the other cities. great game, well made, and all round fun to play.",1
"a great game for anyone that wants to burn a few hours. its a game of wits and brute strength, forging allies and waging war all to gain a foothold over your rivals. many or few, every game is different with a huge selection of map types and playable factions. i have played multiple runs of this game and still it is my favorite civ from sid so far. im sure ill have many more hours in this game as the acheivment list is 200+. multiplayer has a little to be desired as the matching can sometime take awhile and games tend to get overpowered one way or another rather early on. finding solid players that can last a match is uncommon. with all being said the game is definetly playing.",4
"this game has been my life for more than 9 years. and so it continues...",3
"civilization series were always the most addicting, difficult and rewarding games ever. civilization 5, alone or with gods and kings & brave new world is the most time consuming devil that posses your time and will never give it back. although your only way to resist is to click next turn and bring glory to your civilization. most complex game with many victory types, strategies, difficulty levels (from easiest for even strategy noobies to most experienced generales who were raised with rts by their sides), units, resources, everything... this game has everything that us - nerds love. and you can read a book in one time while playing on huge map around atomic era :d",2
"this game has its ups and downs: the ups can be from the statisfaction of winning a near loss victory or maybe completely wiping out some  in a war that you could only justify out of fustration with them. the downs can come from the complete failure early on in a game that has a some militarisitic  steam rolling your cultural civilization before it can get past turn 50 (im looking at you napolean!). but overall this game is an experience in itself to play with a friend or by yourself. it builds its character and charm from the antics you pull on friends during a cooperative play through, or from the complete hypocrisy of some a.i in corelation to the leader they are playing as (cough cough ghandi cough cough). all in all, civ 5 is a good game that is fun enough to validate multiple playthroughs, which i think is really important for games to be able to have nowadays.",2
"great game if you have 347032 hours to kill. i dont know how many weeks ive spent in real time playing this game but ive only finished 3 or 4 games and still ing love it.",10
"this game is amazing!!! if youre not playing it you need to!",4
"this game is fantastic, the wierdest thing about it is that time flies by when playing it. i unknowingly played 4 hours, and i was thinking of only playing for 30 minutes. this is a very immersive and fun strategy games, and i didnt even like stragety games before i played this! i can see how this game truly grasps the best parts of strategy games and makes a masterpiece.",2

"i brought this game when it was on sale, because my friends have it and it was my birthday. yey! since i have played several days straight until my entire life is now revolving around strategy and civ 5, also i havent seen daylight in a while... the game is great to get into and the graphics are amazing. my nuggles (that should be a word) are that the overall tutorial cannot be saved and exitied for me to have my tea, so i had to leave my computer overnights and during caffine fueled rests. also you should be able to zoom in more. other than all of that, this is a great game and i highly recommend you buy it and (all) of its glorious dlc! [9/10]",1

"this version of civilization is pale in comparison to its predecessor when it comes to depth an complexity, and i dislike it for that fact. however civilization 5 is one of my most played games. civ 5 is part of the new accessible breed of sequels, designed to bring a known franchise down to the knuckle-dragging level of complexity so xbox kids and fratboys dont feel like total dip when trying to master the intricacies of the lowest difficulty. it is simple, it is fun, you really only need to know one or two tricks to win on any map at any difficulty, and then thats it, you get to master civ 5 and brag to all your friends about it. its fun, simple, different, and more akin to a board game than previous civ iterations.",4
"as england my people starved and i distroyed every nation in the world! 10/10 i make a great leader.",1
"best damn time machine on the planet. you start playing this and then bam! 12 hours of your life just went away.",3
"highly recommend this game. if you love strategy this is for you! you find yourself saying just one more turn. the game really needs both expansion packs to complete the game, it is pretty bare without them. good points nice graphics great fun lots of possiblities decent turotials lots of great mods bad points the mulitplayer is fun but badly coded it is very hard to fing the right difficulty some civs are imbalanced the community isnt great overall a really great game 8/10",2
"this game is actually fantastic. very entertaining, keeps me engaged for hours. fun to play with friends too.",2
"one of the best games ever created! hours of fun, infinite replay value, and even more fun with friends! not only does this game provide hours of fun, but it can also provide a challenge to even the most advanced gamer. my advice to anyone who doesnt have this game, buy it!",3

"a game solely built around strategy. without it, youre not going anywhere besides maybe europe or japan.",1
"civ5 is the one of the best strategy games of all time , i havent played beyond earth but out if all the civ games this is definitly the best to me. its fun with freinds , random people , or just by yourself. civ5 just like all the other civs are very replayable due to the fact that there is so many diffrent routes you can take in the game. if your new to strategy games or just games in general you can still get this game , play it and have hours of fun , and when you get good make it harder by difficulty or playing in more skilled servers. 10/10 worth the buy , one of the must have steam games",2

"all i have to say about this game is you will lose many hours playing it. its a great game!",2
"civ v is the turn-based strategy game for the ages. soon after playing for the first time, youll be glued to this game for hours upon hours, and youll love it. great for anyone who loves them a good strategy game, or for anyone with a passing interest in them. the astounding variety in civilizations and game possibilities, as well as multiplayer make this game worth every penny and gold piece. hex grid master race.",2
"time for another review! im going to go over a few points in the game, and then average them out to give it an overall rating. i still recommend it no matter what the oar is! story: 0/10 there is no story. replayability: 10/10 ive played about 1 week of gameplay. thats a lot for me! content: 8/10 if you buy the dlcs, its got loads of content, if not, it would get 5/10, but i bought them :) multiplayer: 5/10 its got a lot of multiplayer glitches, but fun nonetheless. it cracks me up when it resyncs and my scout turns into a gdr. overall rating: 6/10 (rounded up and simplified)",3

"i didnt think id like it, until i played it for maybe 10 mins. then i loved it!",1

"this game is pure crack. there is nothing more addictive than this game. i want to gift this game only to my worst enemies and all the evil mad humans out there. get somebody in touch with kim jong-un, set him up a steam-account and get him this game: it kills lifetime without being able to be productive in any form(except playing this game). the world will be a better and peacefull place if we can get those kind of people playing civ v!",1

"it took me a long time from buying and downloading civilization v to actually playing it. theres a reason behind it, which is i never liked turn-based games. it took me a long time to actually give this game a try, and boy do i regret that it took me so long. without a shadow of doubt, civilization v is among the best games i have ever played. i absolutely love it.",8
"i grew up on civilization. this is a new twist on an old favorite.",1
"although turn based strategy games are not everyones cup of tea, this critically aclaimed edition to the civilization franchise is a detailed and intracite game that once learned is extremely addicting. although it is pricey, once a steam sale rolls around it can be as much as 75% off. it is a must have for anyone looking for a new game to sink hundreds of hours into.",6
"addictive, challenging, and ridiculously fun. wholeheartedly recommended.",6
"civ v is a fantastic strategy game. plenty of depth with nearly unlimited replayability. definitely worth a look if your into taking over the world.",2
"this is a very good entry-level strategy game for new players in the genre. it is not complicated, has simplistic yet fun combat, and provides enough depth to satisfy veterans. in other words: new players, veterans, and people of all ages will enjoy this game. this is supported by the hotseat feature, which makes it very easy to play with others who dont have a computer on hand, such as a young cousin or sibling. by default, when starting a new game you will start off in the ancient era and your nation will, over many hours, develop up into modern times and past that. you develop your nations economy, military, and expand its borders at home and overseas. so, in a nutshell: its a game where you run and expand an empire, nicely put into an easy to learn package.",2
"great game, its always fun to see your civilization evolve from sticks and stones up to the nukes! this game can be fun in solo but also with friends which makes it even better because you can trade tactics together and do research agreements to speed up your domination!",2
"ill give you v good reasons not to play this game. i. cant find whales. ii.ghandi is a . iii. my friends are . iv. no character customization. v. roman numerals are an outdated form of numbering things.",1
"sid meiers civilization is a series that has, deservedly, garnered many fans for its unique and enthralling strategic gameplay. all you ever want to do in civ v is press that end turn button one more time. brave new world makes everything so much better and adds a layer that was previously missing. but with civilization v, comes the knowledge that this world is one that we must share and with that come the responsibility of knowing that the decisions we make today will have a lasting impact on the generations of tomorrow.",2
"great turn-based strategy game. highly recommended.",2
"not good. civ iv superior. not bad, but still buy civ iv.",1
"i know a lot of people compared civ v unfavorably to civ iv when civ v first came out. as a long (and i do mean long) time player of sid meier civilization games, i never understood that as i had a completely different impression. to me this is one of the best civ games since civ ii and alpha centauri. it was a return to some of the basics that made the game great with a number of tweaks (hexogonal grid, no unit stacking) that i feel improve it. add in the additional options in the wonderful expansions and you have, in my opinion, an all-time classic. i recommend this for everyone.",4

"after 300hours of playing this i can say. dude. get the game. i managed to play this 300 hours without getting bored dude. its epic. its fun. its interesting. and guess what! you actually learn stuff too. so your parents will like if you play this aswell. go play. be happy! i am not asking. i am commanding. this game is too sweet to not be played",4
"fantastic strategy game! build your empire and play against the cpu or others online! its a highly complex, cerebral game that will challenge you every time!",8
"the game crahes when im in the middle of playing and i have to restart from the beginning, i forgave it the first time but after the 3 time it got a little ridiculus. i saved my game knowing it would randomly crash and every time a person from a different city state interacted with me, the game crashed.",1
"amazing game if you like turn-based strategic gameplay. gets way better with the expansions though, vanilla is fun but lacks a lot of gameplay elements that are added by g&k and bnw.",1

"this has series has been my favorite game since 2003! and it just keeps getting better with each new release.",9
"great game, its really easy to lose track of time when playing it. nothing like world domination to get through the day.",1
"i cant even describe how amazing this game is!!! if you like history, alt. history or just having power, this is the game for you!",8
"wasnt convinced at first but was soon dragged in. engrossing. time flies. 93 hours so far and into my longest game at about 1200 turns. five stars.",4
"get brave new world if you want to experience this game like it should be",2
"it is very fun but i was so angry as they made it 75% off the day after i bought it, they do this with about half my games so i have wasted money. it is almost like they do it to annoy me, stupid idiots",1
"fun game but it can be kinda laggy still very fun!",3
"bid farewell to the soon to become obselete phrase: im bored.",4
"i cannot recommend this game enough. incredibly deep and varied gameplay, great music and graphics, and a superb all around experience.",1
"one of my all time fav games, played the first civilization to the present, just keeps getting better.",2
"this game is amazing, the expansions made it one of the best turn based strategy games out there",1
"intensely fun if you like turn based race games of which this franchise began (as far as i remember from my youth). a little buggy, but not so bad that it detracts from the game once you get in. in game animations go away durring multiplayer mode, which annoyed my brother but didnt bug me.",1
"just one more turn...just one more turn...just one more turn...just one more turn...just one more turn...just one more turn...just one more turn...just one more turn...just one more turn...just one more turn...just one more turn...just one more turn...just one more turn...just one more turn...just one more turn...just one more turn...just one more turn...just one more turn...sh!t its 6 am",1
"anyone that is a fan of turn based strategy games will enjoy civ can you stand the test of time",6
"the best turn based strategy game ive ever played, normallly im a c&c fan myself but ever since i played civilization: revolution, ive been addicted to the civ franchise. its useful if you want to go ahead and test youre strategic planning skills or if you just have alot of time on ur hands with not enough stuff to do :p i give it a 4.5 out of 5 (4.5 / 5)",8
"this game wil suck you in and never let you leave.",1
"great game, doesnt get boring because of when you play it you get a different feeling everytime. great to play with others...you can be sucked into this game for hours!",1
"spectacular game, though it does have its fair share of flaws. single-player experience is second to none as far as turn-based strategy gaming is concerned. 4/5",1
"this game is the reason i got a steam account! it provides hours of fun, and no two games are the same. its replay value is through the roof.",4
"slow, strategic, gameplay about building a new civilization (not customizable) in a world. history is remade each time you start a new game. unfortunately, ai is bad, and a feature i found on civilization iv which i expected to have in this game is not here. wish when a player disconnects, we could vote again to either wait for the play, save and continue, or save and quit.",4
"a great way to spend a lot of time on a strategy game. first time playing a civ game and it was very easy for me to get into and understand after a few playthroughs. the achievements for this game definitely give me something to play for, as well. highly recommend!",2
"sid meiers civilization v brings you some of the best turn based strategy you can find. youll be addicted the moment you start getting into a game.",1
"game of the year. game of all years. this is the half-life 3 of strategy games.",4
"civilization v is the fifth installment in arguably the best stratgy series ever. though people argue that its prdecessor, civ 4, was much better. but is it really. so in civ 5 you essentially pick an emeror ie; napolean and build a civilization. people say that civ 4 was better, because there were much more elements. yes, in civ 5 they did take a lot of eleents that civ 4 had, but if you are willing to get the dlc brave new world, you may get that civ experience that you were wanting all along with better graphics. you should definnitely pick this game up if you havent, you can get it really cheap of amazon or in the steam sales, in my opinion this is one of the best strategies out there today.",1
"warning: may take up to an eternity to finish one match. 5 stars. would definitely reccomend.",1
"awesome game, very fun and in depth. also gives free trading cards. yay!",1
"this game is so good i stop myself from playing it to save my social life",1
"how can you not be overwhelmed by civilization v? its a perfect example of a series thats getting close to perfection, step by step. the new improvements are great and feel like theyve been there all along. a must-buy for the fans and a great way for newcomers to finally get familiar with the series.",4

"great game, i will invariably spend hours on this game in the future with my mates.",2
"very great game! too bad im too stupid to know how to play xd",1
"12 hours a game gr8 with friends but will get mad if they take forever to end their turn 6/9",1

"great turn based strategy, with some interesting new gameplay mechanics compared to the previous games.",3
"played as japan and built the statue of liberty, the great wall and the sydney, now tokyo, opera house. 6 turns later gets nuked by the mighty warlord gandhi. 11/10 would build statue of liberty, the great wall and the tokyo opera house and get nuked by gandhi again",2
"words can not express how much you can not trust ghandi when he gets his first nuke. this game is crazy addictive, i advise people to play at thier own risk. stuff will not get done around the house when played, it doesnt matter if its turn base youll wind up saying to yourself ....just one more turn then ill get off...",3
"5.pm alright, lets play civ 5!!! 9.am the next day just... one... more... flipping... turn...",1
"too bad im not completely fluent in any other languages yet, because english certainly doesnt have the words to describe how epic this game is. im currently playing my bazillionth game, and ive played nearly 750 hours, but every game still feels like a brand new experience. the ui is probably the most user-friendly in any game ever, and the music is just plain awesome, plus every game is randomly generated. theres a demo; download it and youll see what i mean. so when you do get hooked, and you do dish out 80 bucks for the gold edition plus brave new world (as you should!), dont get upset when you start failing your classes or missing work because you played all night and didnt even notice, because trust me, your time is better spent here.",10
"they did not give me the gold i desired. i nuked them. 10/10",2

"this is one of my favorite games of all time, if your looking for a game with great gameplay, awsome multiplayer, and hours upon hours of fun... buy this game!",1
"this game will make you hate your friends, and yourself. if you want to waste a whole 30 hours of your life in one game, this game is your man. (in all seriousness, this game is the . you wont want to take lunch breaks or potty breaks or even take a shower. there goes the kids, and the bills, and the wife, but at least you conquered all of ghandis territory. that indian ). 12/10",1
"multiplayer is a little slow, other than that it is a great game.",5
"the hexagonal layout and new city defense system refreshes the gameplay and fixes the absurd unit stacking of civ iv. though its not as deep and diverse as civ iv. online mode is bugged and nearly impossible to enjoy which is a major downside. many balance issues and some bugs are fixed via the civilization v unofficial patch (civup) and vanilla enhanced mod (vem). overall its worth giving it a try as there is a demo on steam. its not the successor everybody was waiting for but its a step into the right direction.",1
"a game that fails to justify its very existence through sheer lack of innovation; and that doesnt say when that started. one of the most overrated games of the past several years.",1
"without the dlcs, its a good game. with the dlcs, its the best turn based stratagy game out there.",6
"this game is really amazing if you play it with friends or add a few mods",3
"fun, but long-termed. plan a day to play the game.",1
"amazing game. very strategic until you get nukes. then its just a mad race to wipe ghandis  off the earth.",1

"this game has no relation to the sloth named sid in ice age.",1
"civilization v is the first game i played in the civilization series, recommended by my friends. the game slowly robs you of your time, absorbing you into its gameplay, until five hours have gone by and youve gone from trying to not be overrun by barbarians to blasting foreign cities with cannons while building the lourve. brave new world made the mid-game a lot more interesting and balanced, and its fun finding which nations suit your play style (burying your problems in gold, researching faster than everyone else, converting everyone to your religion, etc.). in my first playthrough, i was a militaristic japanese nation who nuked washington d.c. for some meta humor. 10/10",7
"outstanding game! its a one more turn game you cant stop playing!",2
"awesome game!!!! cant wait for the next one to relsease.",2
"dowloaded a mod for a dwafen empire i procided to take over the world with fighter jets and destroyers full.of.dwaves in millitary uniforms. 10/10",1
"this game is addictive. it uses the same tried and true formula of the other games and will keep you glued to the screen for hours as you just need one more turn... the game is more balanced than ever if you get the 2 additional dlcs. the first makes religion worthwhile and the 2nd adds more lategame options and a revamp of the cultural victory conditions.",2
"-starts off peacefull -tries to befriend china and siam -friendly with both -is nice to china -china becomes  -defends self after unprovoked attack -everyone claims that im  after defending self -everyone angry -obsessed with revenge -take over siam -manhatten project -try to be nice to china -china still  -build nukes -one last act of kindness towards china -china still  -nukes the  out of china -builds fishing boat",1
"this game is like the bridge for advanced strategy games. it has such a complex, yet easily accomplishable setup. this gives civ 5 an inumerable strength as a game. it provides you with over 30 civilizations to play as(dlc included). each of them with a diverse yet interesting skill to go along with them. you could play as spain with a double bonus to all exotic tiles in the game. or switch to carthage, giving you the ability to cross mountains. both long time strategists and newcomers will love this game. as well as its historical units will excited any history buffs out there. and any game you play in it will always challenge and amuse. if you have not already bought this game, you should right now.",4
"bonbon approves of this game 10/10 it is a really fun game once you get to know what you are doing and for those who are new, there is advisors that will give a helping hand. the victories available are fun and made for all kind of players, i do say however it is best getting this and the two main dlcs (brave new world and gods and kinds) as it adds so much more to the game. overall this game is just great and..where else would ghandi be a war mongering dictator who likes to nuke you xd",3
"surprisingly addictive... guaranteed to make you hate your friends when they attack your cities and force their religion upon you.",1
"this game... so addicting, you lose track of the time and its only after youve finished the great fun of it that you realise its been 6 hours. definitely recommended.",3
"if youre reading this, and have not yet purchased this, go do it now. thank me later.",2
"i love this ing game.its history but ing fun as hell!!!!!!!!!1",1
"one of the single most addictive games i think ive ever played. each single campaign takes hours to get through, even on the fast setting! tense multiplayer,countless approaches to winning and this only gets better with each dlc added to the game. cannot wait for the new civ announced at e3! short summary: epic.",1
"i suck so bad. seems like it has solid design though. if you like strategy games this is one to think about.",1
"best empire buiding game ever!!! genghis khan ftw!!!~~~",4
"i spent 11 hours playing the tutorial. i dont regret it.",1
"a fantastic game. i strongly recommend getting the brave new world dlc which adds a ton to the late game. the multiplayer for the game isnt great and it has its problems, but the single player contains hundreds of hours of fun if you have the time.",1
"136 hours in and still loving it. cant imagine it ever being boring.",4
"its great very good if u want to make an empire or just farm and study tech, its just great and make sure u get brave new world its even a better game with it!",2
"you start playing at 2pm...nexxt thing you know its 6am...10/10 would waste life again.",1
"this game is loads of fun. the multiplayer is a blast, and the gameplay can be challenging. many different playable factions, each with different quirks, strengths, and weaknesses, give the game a high replay value. even if you have a sure-fire strategy for one civ (and even that probably wont work every time), it isnt likely to work as another civ. even if the regular gameplay bores you, there are scenarios and mods than can freshen up the gameplay. however, as a turn-based grand strategy/4x game, graphics arent its strongest point. while theyre nothing as stunning as some of the games out today, theyre still good, and the game wont be hard on the eyes by a long shot.",2
"i like the smell of an enemy empire in ruins at 4 am.",2
"120.2 hrs on record oh look at that ...........................................................",2
"excellent game for anyone who enjoys complex startegy games. the learning curve is pretty steep but the game itself is incredibly fun to learn and play. a critique i would make of the game however is its balancing in terms of the civilosations that can be played, but this is pretty minor. overall a fun game.",2
"only complaint: the ai has no idea how to play this game. i have a feeling that because of that, neither do i. its definately faster than iv. and the visuals and audio is great. youll see the shuffling around hoplites in 1866, but if that bothers you, turn up the difficulty so it gets some unfair help.",3
"if! you like long, in depth games, this is for you! if! you dont like long, in depth games, this is not for you! simple as that... im pretty neutral on this game honestly. it is a fun game. but it takes a long time to figure out how to do everything. i still dont know how to do everything in the game, and i dont even know what everything means (or does). it is incredibly in depth, which i typically enjoy. however; it is quite enjoyable...to a point... i was playing a solo campaign with 6 nations total (me, and 5 ais)... 14 hours later i won... this game takes forever to play through.",1
"its a good game with all the expansions, be prepared to stay awake till 6 am, and one more move is a lie",2
"this game is amazing. if you like those 3rd person world control games, like halo wars or command & conquer, this game is for you.",1
"havent been playing it for long but for the time i did i couldnt stop playing. soooooo addicting",1
"civ iv was the height of the franchise. in addition to a very boring mid/end game (your only real win scenario is militariy conquest) every six months or so it seems that there are civ v enhancements released that should have been in the original game. only you now you get to pay again for what in the end is still a deeply flawed military conquest game.",6
"it you like turn based strategy...youll love this. it takes sometime to get use to the play, but it will keep you playing til the very end and then youll realize that you have been playing for 6-10 hours",2
"run the civilizations! its the best! especially if you like seeing ghandi beat george washington with a rock tied to a stick!",1
"awesome game take alot of hours out of your day easy to get hooked all round good game 9/10",1
"10/10 would bang again. seriously though this game is great to play with friends or without. dont like how the game is stock? this game is very mod friendly so if you wanna mod the  out of it, whats stopping you?",4
"not quite as addictive as some of the older iterations, but once you find all the workshop addons, you can really tailor the game to your own playstyle.",1
"with way more than 200 hours of gameplay (steam is always about 40% of what i actually played), this is my most played game in my library. this is not the greatest game of all time, but it is probably in my top three, with portal 2 as the greatest game of all time. while this game does take long, it is worth it and very consuming! i love this game and i would most definitely recommend it! i love this game!",3
"would cause the nuclear apocalypse again just because someone settled a city near me. 10/10",2
"fantastic, strategic gameplay. an immersive learning curve gets you into the game early, and you cant help but play until youre the last nation standing.",6
"stays true to the classic civ games and adds some great additions. i have been playing since civ i and this game feels like home. it has pleny of micromanagment, but it can still make for a quick game if you want. highly reccomend.",8
"tell all the other npcs to destroy friend. they dont listen. friend starts destroying me. they all attack friend. 11/10",1
"wonderful. i was wanting to play risk, but its so outdated. my friend told be about civ, and hot damn if he wasnt right. everything i was needing to scratch and more. 10/10",1
"i love this game. i got into civ through revolution but this is a very good game, anything it came short on compared to civ 4? mods can make up for. i think more people should play it. the gameplay itself is addicting. it gets boring at times but its always fun to make up the history of your people as you go. the modding ive never been able to do myself or implent mods into games manually but the game helps a lot and gives you a list of mods you have. and if you want more mods go to the workshop and search for the one you want",7
"if you like turn-based strategy as well as playing a historical figure in a unreasonable timeframe, this game is for you. but who am i to tell you this. you probably already have the game. its very good.",1
"its a fun game where you controle your empire through history and can go for different types of victories! its really fun alone, and even more with friends! try for yourself :d",2
"more addictive than the purest heroin, allows limited forward time travel, fulfils your darkest historical fantasies, incites hatred against gandhi and ruins chances of meeting all forseeable deadlines. truly a game for the ages.",3
"absolutely the best strategy game ive ever played.",3
"civ 5 is a comedy of sorts, in a way that you wouldnt realize. the game allows you to change history. new york city, naw, it is called taco town now. there is also humour in the world leaders, ghandi was a man of peace, until he dropped the a bomb on you. personally id give the game 7/10 because of its minor flaws (like game length) but other wise, it is a great game.",1
"yeah, lets just put all these empires on a map where they arent really. but dont worry, it doesnt need to make sense when you are winning.",1
"if youre a fan of turned based strategy games, this one will certainly not disappoint. i played and loved civ4 and i consider this to be an upgrade, countless hours of just one more turn await.",1
"great game, you have to understand the game is great!!!!!! but if you dont know how to play, dont give up instantly... actually try to learn it. if you dont know what youre doing youll love it.",4
"its the late game. only ghandi, you, and rome remain. ghandi declares war on rome, and you see opportunity. ghandi requests uranium to destroy rome. you give ghandi the uranium in hopes he will take out rome for you. next turn, ghandi declares war on you and nuclear missiles shower your cities. you now understand why ghandi is feared. for he is ghandi destroyer of worlds. 10/10 would get nuked by a peaceful ruler again",1
"i had heard of all the civilization games and how good they were, but had never gotten around to buying one. finally decided to buy this one and i dont regret it. perhaps one of the pinnacles of strategy games! to have the ability of creating a civilization and making it grow is priceless! this is a must have game! 5/5",1
"with all of the dlc and workshop items you will most surely lose your social life. 5 out of 5 stars",2
"one of the best games rts games out right now. consistent dlc and steam market make the game even better!",2
"uh huh, this is my  all the girls stomp your feet like this a few times ive been around that track so its not just gonna happen like that because i aint no hollaback girl i aint no hollaback girl -washington",2
"although less rich feature wise than previous civ games, civ 5 still stands as a great strategy game for new and old players alike. the game has a hell of a lot of replayability and is great to play with friends (providing youre willing to turn against them if needed, otherwise multiplayer games can get boring quickly). easy to pick up, difficult to master, as any good strategy game should be, highly recommend.",2
"absolutely perfect. lots of fun if you want to create your own civilization the way you like it. youre free to choose whether you wanna concentrate on military forces and conquest, creating a tiger economy or the leader in technology. each time you start a new game you have to adjust your strategy to starting conditions - the terrain and locations of other players will play a major part in the development of your civilization, and it makes the game interesting even after having finished dozens of games. there are lots of leaders to choose from and each of them has its own pros and cons, including certain bonuses and special units/buildings. civilization v is really engrossing, but dont forget to buy complete edition with all add-ones - the game is not that deep without them.",2
"i liked civ iv more, but v is also nice. and it has a better fighting-system.",1
"this is an addicting game, i definitely recommend it.",2
"10/10 would play a another turn! seriously though, its an above averge game without the dlcs, but with them... its a totally different game, its just insane! yuffo, out.",2
"amazing game, can get you fixed for hours just building your cities up and dominating all opponents. the multiplayer is really fun too, not knowing what your friends are up to just teases you as you create your civilization.",1
"great game. civ is one of the most addicting game with great replayablity potential. highly recommended",2
"amazing game. this is my favorite game all time and it is great, there is so much that you can do its almost endless",4
"i dont play this game often but when i do its for hours. the tile system does add an extra level to the tactics of war. however, on the easy settings you can just buldoze the ai. on the hard settings the ai can just buldoze you. i enjoy playing mods now that i have quite a bit of playtime in. being able to play with a new research tree(s) makes this a game you can replay over the years.",7
"this awesome game is extremely addictive and one of the most complex strategy games i have ever played. it has taken me over 60 hours of gameplay to fully grasp even the vanilla version of the game and a further 40 hours to even become good at it, lol. the dlcs added heaps of content, refining the whole game into something even more better and worth way more than 6 keys in total for g&k and bnw. played 120 hours and counting; maybe a further 100 hours will satisfy me of this game :l. most immersive ruler scenes and the fact the sejong-korea and also ethiopia is in the game truly amazes me about the range of diversity in the game. 10/10",3
"a great way to pass some time without resorting to mindless tv.",2
"sid meiers civilization v is a turn based strategy game. you build an empire starting in the ancient era, and continuing on to the information era. how you play is entirely up to you. there are many different paths to take. you may choose to be a war mongering nation and dominate the world through military strength; you may choose to study the sciences and build a rocket to take your civilisation to a new world; you may choose to influence all civilisations with your culture and create a utopia; or you may choose to win diplomatically by becoming the leader of the united nations. in the gods and kings expansion pack you may choose or create a religion for your empire, where you gain your specified bonuses from it and are able to spread it through missionaries and prophets. its hard at first, but gets better after some practice.",4
"nuked a guy proposing nuclear non-proliferation to the un then paid everyone to embargo him. russia voted against the embargo so i nuked them. 11/10 would play as ghandi again.",6
"mighty fun strategic game only if you have the dlc. 10/10 destroyed north korea",1
"one. expect this game to become a part of your everyday life two. do not trust the incas or ghandi three. be the roman empire do tradition steal all of the wonders four. profit",3
"got raided by barbarians, got to silence attilla the hun, removed england from this universe, nuked gandi back to the stone age, i recommend this game",1
"this is a great game in almost every aspect. the premise is that you are the king of a city (which you may choose). you build buildings, train armies, take over cities... but there are so many approaches. you can win the game with science. or by going from men on horses to nuking gandhi. 10/10",1
"if you for some odd reaseson hate a country ( we all have one ) this game is the place were you can wreck them with nukes in frickin 1750 ad, and all they have is sticks and stones to throw back.",2
"civilization v is a very unique stradegy game that managed to capture me even though i do not play many stradegy games. that says alot in itself. i would rate this entire series as the best of all time for its genre, and likely the best in our lifetime. i am excitied for the release of future civilization titles. 10/10",3
"its 22hd of december 2013. this is a brilliant game.",2
"took 10 mins to find out how to go to the next turn 11/10 would next turn again",1
"one of the most best games youll ever play with endless gameplay",2
"so.... here is the turth people. i have over 20 strategy games. and when i am tired of the latest and greatest... i always come back to civilizations 5. brilliant game... you will not be disappointed.",5
"it is one of my favorites that challenges more that just a conquoring battling but stationing religion and also city assitance besides just yours.",2
"most fun ive ever had playing a moved based strategy game. if you like history and good games, this games for you.",3
"start this game up, have fun for a bit, look at the clock and wonder where the last six hours went.",7
"get friends to play this with. skype with each other. try to cooperate or murder each other, and watch the hillarity that ensures.",2
"a big huge 4x turn based strategy game from fraxis and 2k games. worth every penny in your bank account or steam wallet. must buy!!!!!!!!!",1
"great game, but 2k offers absoultely no support. i bought bnw and it broke my game. i can no longer play without memory leaks (only program on my comp that does this). i feel ripped off because the only person who made any progress in helping me fix this ing game was my cousin.  you 2k, im not buying any more of your games because your support staff are . when i ask a question i dont need a copy and pasted response. then when i answer that  response, you have the ing nerve to copy and paste another response. treat me with respect. im a ing customer that used to support you.",3
"this game is great, i still dont know how to play this game and yet is not frustrating",1
"amazingly addictive strategy game. has a huge amount of replay value and is best played with a friend. if youve played the older versions youll like this one. features have changed for both the better and worse, but its a great game overall. my only ask is that pitboss be improved instead of requiring a dedicated machine to host turn by turn matches.",1
"civilization v is a well-crafted game of domestic, international, and military balancing of power. you create an empire from the sands using your decisions on which race to how large you will grow, and where you will grow. your empire is shape by yourself and by your neighbors. the tech tree and military units allow you time to become use to every changing battlefield conditions which happen naturally over the course of time (using knight then cannons) as a caveat i will say playing this game you will lose hours of your time and not know where they went, but end that time feeling satisfied.",2
"one of the best turned based games ive had the pleasure to play. it runs well though i have had more crashes than i hoped for. the game is fun with friends but can take a lot of time but you can always save it. the only problem i have with (apart from the crashes) is that to fully enjoy the game, you will have to get the dlc, gods and kings and brave new world. though its worth it.",2
"ive lost about 12 hours to this game in the first 2 days......its fantastic!",1
"a reveiw? its a sunday waster. sit at your computer for hours micro managing! youll enjoy the time you wasted. and feel acomplished when victory is achived.",1
"dont buy this game if you like to see the sun, it will suck you in and you will stay in front of the computer for 2 or 3 days before you notice.",4
"one of the most addicting games i have ever played!!! i highly recommend this to anybody to loves strategy games! 9.5/10",4
"this game will make you keep on playing, waiting to see what will happen to your troops or wait to finish the wonder you are building",2
"good game. warning may cause you to not stop. 10/10",1
"one of the most engaging turn-based strategy games on pc.",1
"step 1. play as the english step 2. ally with the iroquois step 3. skype with iroquois leader step 4. scream manifest destiny mother er!!!!!!!! into the mic, and slam your troops into him. step 5. destroy everything except a group of settlers and workers, and send them northward into the lands of barbarians and enemy nations 10/10 would conquer again.",2
"one of the best games ever played, is so fun with friends but is also fun on single player. the long hours put into one game makes it very rewarding once the game has finally finished what i love about this game.",1
"my favorite game to just relax with. even at higher difficulties i never really stress out with civ i just sit back and try to execute my strategies to the best of my ability and hope i dont spawn in a desert. dlc is well worth it since it adds so many new layers to an already complex game. multiplayer is a blast as well. always a good time to beat a friend to a wonder and listen to them rage over skype.",2
"i love this game. it uses indepth stragety with historical traits that are spot on and fun to learn about.",1
"one more turn. thats what you will keep saying even when you know you have to stop. be it total world domination or establishing diplomatic alliances, civilization is the foundation of empire dynasty building throughout the ages. the feeling of going from a group of settlers with only sticks and stones to reaching for the stars in their rockets is still not lost in this 5th outing. with new crisp and easy to distinguish detailed graphics this game is nothing but superb.",1
"build an empire and rule the world... or get destroyed by barbarians",1
"hundreds of hours of fun. one of my all time favorite games. good control of your civilization, and great game mechanics makes creates a strong replayabilty value. the music creates a good atmosphere and the fact that it is turn based allows you to play the game at your own pace and start and stop at any time. i can not recall the amount of times i have woken up early in the morning, brewed a pot of coffee, casually start a marathon game, and end up looking at a clock only to fine that it is eight at night. tl;dr: absolutely phenominal game, amd the sale that is currently going on is way too good to pass up.",2
"this game is the pinnacle of strategy, just the feel alone of controlling an entire empire rises above all else. i must say some areas of the game could be improved like the ai but if you get bored of many subjects in the game there is always mods to think about. dlc is also something to think about, even though its the price of the game i feel that it adds many more hours to the game and is worth the money. ive been playing this since it came out and im still enjoying it, with many civilisations and playstyles to choose from sid meiers civilisation 5 is the complete turn based strategy game. 9/10",4
"playing since launch. the hexagon titles and 1upt are great improvments",5
"great game! needs some work with online play, but other then that pretty good. best strategy game out there",3
"good game but not quite complete without dlc. overall an amicable continuation of an amazing pc game series.",1
"if youre a history lover you will enjoy this game. incredibly indepth and can be as challenging or as difficult as you want to make it. tons of dlc and tons of mindless marathon fun (seriously you can lose yourself in this game for a whole day). highly recommend.",5
"amazing game... just amazing, but twice as amazing with brave new world",3
"very enjoyable with friends. the base game is alright, but i think that despite the expense of the dlc, it dramatically adds to the fun.",2
"the only game where gandhi betrays everyone with war elephants and nukes. 10/10",2
"if you havnt become familiar with sid meiers civilization series you dont know what comr games are about. its deep, challenging and you can learn a little about our world. cod lovers need not apply.",3
"pretty fun game, but when you add brave new world, it becomes awesome. many hours spent playing this.",2
"this game is awesome and diverse. its very lengthy to complete a session.",3
"this is just one of the most awesome games, cant wait to the next one",1
"thoroughly love the game. i find myself always coming back to it.",5
"more than 800 hours.....my life guys....no i have shared it with my family. but as someone who has above 800 hours of this game on there account trust me when i say best pc game of the year. simple. cant wait for more.",8
"fun game but it can be kinda laggy still very fun!",3
"nuked america as japan. revenge tastes good. best history game on steam. 12/10- tons of dlcs",1
"hours of fun had with this game, been online playing with my buddies nearly every night for weeks now, the ai is abit warmongery if youre not careful though!",2
"while i still prefer some aspects of civilization iv (culture, religion), the game play and combat mechanics improvements (stacking, etc.) made in civilization v make it hard to go back.",2
"played for 5 minutes, stopped when i was starving, 12 hours had gone by.",1
"i dont get hooked onto many games but this is amazing!!!",1
"this is my go to game when i am not directly playing anything else. plotting the downfall of my enemies is enjoyable if slightly worrying. its a bit slow for me, however, i am still pretty new to rts games.",1
"i know a lot of long time civ fans are torn between loving and hating civ 5. personally, i think its the best civ game ever made, i think its amazing piece of art and ive enjoyed every turn. thats not to say i completely agree with every change theyve made since civ 4. for example; one of the big changes is that you can no longer stack military units on hexes. this works wonderful for small, tactical battles and definitely makes it more interesting than piles of doom clashing, but on a large scale it tends to be absolutely tedious to move your units to be in range to actually do something, and makes it hard to retreat because your own units are blocking the way out. so i would recommend to stick to small scale tactical battles and youll enjoy it so much.",3
"if your willing to stay up hours on end to defend your nation and ignore real worrld responsibility, buy this game:}",1
"-best 2 week vacation ive ever taken -helped me pass math history final -only reason im still in college *hits next turn* 9.7/10",6
"no such thing as a quick game. you have been warned",2
"the best strategy game around. great fun to spend an evening exploding paris and making berlin jewish.",1
"amazing game, if you love to plan and build up armys, this is your game",10
"friend got me this, and got me into this, and i like this! :) this is fun.",2
"awesome game, so glad it was finally ported to linux. can get very intricate.",1
"even if you dont have a life, civilization v will take it away from you. countless hours will be spent defending your empire, building it up, and dealing with the bi-polar leaders you are up against. ridiculously fun. buy it, but be warned: it will suck you in.",1
"always been a huge fan of civ. had to skip over 4 and go right to this one, but as always, this is an awesome game with awesome xpacs.",2
"awesome game. definitely a must have for strategy lovers",2
"just one more turn. 10/10, would hurt my grades again.",2
"this is, by far the best strategy game i own. on a whole, the range of victories, techniques, and the actual exploration/expansion abilities you are blessed with make it a brilliant turn based game. even on my failed victories, i still had tremendous fun, because i have to say, it is just enjoyable to build your own civilization. but, of course, it is even more enjoyable when your civiliazation has the power to crush all others! definately recommend, for hours of fun.",2
"one of the best games i have ever played in my life. anyone who likes board games, or managing should play this game!",3
"i love the time suck that is this game! ive only put in about 50 hours so far, but i cant wait to get all of the achievements!",1
"easy to navigte controls, and a definate repeat player.",2
"i played this game for 50 hours in the first three days of owning it. it is one of those games where once you get a basic grasp on gameplay you play a lot, then you start ignoring your friends and girlfriend, and in the end you stop eating until someone comes into your room two days later to find out if you are alive or not...so i highly recommend this game!",2
"civilization v is a solid game. not too much more to say. its fun to play vanilla, with many different ways of achieving victory (culture, science, and domination, for example) and no two games turn out quite the same. then when you include mods into the equation, and you get even more playtime and fun. i recently played a match as the kingdom of rohan on an 80x80 hex map of middle earth, and man was that fun. there are also mods that add enhanced functionality, unique units, gui tweaks, and a whole slew of other changes that serve to spice up the experience. definitely a solid pick up. however, id definitely advise getting gods and kings with it at the very least. the gods and kings expansion adds a lot of content to the game that was sorely needed, and they have added even more content to it with the newest expansion brave new world.",1
"this game is great! i can spend days playing this game without getting bored, it keeps you at the edge of your seat with each moves of the ai or other players if you play online. very strategic.",1
"probably my favorite game of all time. so addicting! just one more turn please!",2
"best game on steam, i could go into how amazing everything is but it is to much to type in my lifetime so just get it. also brave new world dlc is needed for the best play",10
">started first ever game >settlers and warriors appear two blocks from barbarian camp >send warriors to mess up barbarians as their camp is on very good ground to build city >warriors are mercilessly slaughted >settlers molested to death >game over 10/10 would get molested by big hairy men again",1
"nice idea, bad realization. if you click trading, youll see that computer can play well with huge debt and negative happiness. that makes all single gameplay useless. when im building second city im have (-) in gold and happiness, need to w8 a lot to build simple building, while he already has max number of units... and this happens even at simple difficulty level(",1
"dont play this game if you have a schedule tomorrow.",1
"perhaps the best strategy game ive ever played. great game and if you liked the other civ games then you will enjoy this one.",1
"yes yes yessssss! there is nothing like the satisfaction of dropping your first nuke in this game!",2
"one of the best games i have ever played. ultimate replay value.",10
"one of my favorite franchises, bar none. the game is amazingly replayable and it never feels repetitive. even though you know how the ai will generally act, theres just enough randomness thrown in to keep you guessing. the game can be a bit of a challenge at first but eventually you get the hang of it, and youll probably never stop playing.",9
"this has proven to be one of my absolute favourite games. its difficult to put my finger on exactly what is so wonderful about civ v, but i can say that it has the best replayablity value on anything ive ever played. single player is smooth and refined, and every playable civ is perfectly balanced. every map offers a reasonable challenge, and there are multiple ways to win a game. for me, civ v really gets fun in multiplayer with some friends. the multiplayer can be a little touch-and-go, but that was hugely improved in the last few patches. with pitboss multipalyer being run from a stable connection, most of the problems associated with civ vs multiplayer are circumvented. i cannot recommend this game highly enough. if youre waiting to be swayed, get this game. it offers hours upon hours of entertainment.",2
"i hope you dont like sleeping or being productive",1
"beautiful, simple, crisp, and an amazing time sink. lose 4 hours in a blink and not care!",1
"try not to consider realife logic, for example how would your jets be damaged while attacking stone age babarians other than that kiss good bye to your life",4
"god jesus this game is . buy it if you havent already, im serious. this is such an amazing strategy game. you wont be dissappointed.",1
"probably the best strategy game out there if you are looking for a good game to buy, this is your best choice!",1
"amazing game great gameplay and amazing graphics.the ai runs quickly and intelligently.",1
"excellent, huge improvement over the last version!",1
"jesus, what a game. in single player its awesome, in multiplayer its a really great way to spend the day",1
"bought this game, i dont have a life now -10/10 (sarcasm 10/10)",1
"this game provides many styles of play that is possible to make it more engaging and replayable. online (especially with friends) is one of the best times you will ever have. each game can take hours to finish and is a great way to pass long periods of time or multiple short periods. i definitly reccomend this game because of it varity and replay ability.",2
"this a great stragic game that is less stressful than most games",1
"you do a civilization thing. so thats pretty cool.",1
"civ 5 is the perfect game to play if youre going to be stuck on a desert island for 20+ years if you some how end up with a working computer.",3
"this is an amazing game... it trains your brain. ans also the graphics are stunning for this type of game. its a turn-on!!!",10
"if you like turn-based strategy thats eay to pick up and play, then pick up and play this.",4
"best turn based game ever and the only good one too.",1
"amazing game, easily the most addictive fts out there.... just one more round!",8
"this game will skull  your life away. if u have a family or a job dont play this game because you will never stop. get  by the several leaders of the world as you  away 3 hours just to get some catpults. if you dont like this game you deserve to get a razer  down your trachea. life is like a diplomatic victory though, its not worth it.",2
"absolutely addictive. easy to pick up and play even if you arent that into strategy games, its probably the best strategy game ive ever played. easily 9/10 for the base game, with the expansions its easily 10/10.",1
"its a realy fun turnbased strategy game, realy fun to play with 1-3 friends",1
"very nice game, it maybe is for ppl that are new to very difficult but after some time you grow to like this game and its not very hard.",3
"awesome addicting turn based strategy game that everyone should play at least one time in there lifetime. highly recommended.",4
"... masterpiece! just give me one more turn and ill finish this review...",1
"best game ever! (except for civ iv, iii, ii or the original civ.) ive lost days and days and days to this game series. more addictive than peanut butter covered crack cocaine. oh go on then... one more turn...",1
"excellent game. gant wait for the next expansion.",2
"good game but online play is awful. theres a glitch that allows people to steal ur whole empire. and it crashes all the time overall i feel ripped off.",5
"the kind of game you can play all day. i cant wait until 6 comes out in the next few years. one of the best games i have ever played.",2
"brilliant strategy game although by itself can feel empty after a while and g&k + bnw can fix this and everybody who feels like getting the best possible experience of this game should buy those main two expansion packs for the game. for anybody looking to get into the strategy genre, this can also be a good place to start. 8/10",1
"civilization is one of those games you can lose hours just playing it the amount of times i have looked at the clock and wondered where the last 8 hours have gone i would highly recommend this game",1
"ive spent way too many hours playing this game and i only see myself play 10x more 10/10",1
"this game along with all of the dlc (the complete edition) is an astounding game, the game looks beautiful and is very enjoyable to sit playing for a few hours at a time. the game is at its best with a few friends with you in a few sittings. if you like turn-based strategy games and are willing to play through a few games not understanding what the difference is between left and right, then this game really is worth the money put into it. i plan to release gameplay of civilization v on my youtube channel, but have not yet done so d:",1
"yes, in the vanilla version it is clicking the next turn button simulator 2k14, but if you click the next turn button enough you can nuke everyone (including that smarmy jerk whos been insulting you the whole game) back to the stone age, then win a diplomatic victory. 11/10.",1
"one of the best series of all times. this civilization v is not the best but does not disappoint either.",2
"if you love risk you will love this! games lasts for hours and hours and there is never a shortage on what to do :d a+++++++",1
"just one more turn! youll repeat this infamous phrase quite often as 10pm turns into a 9am phonecall from your boss as to why you didnt show up at work.",1
"after 315 hours of game play, i would stronly suggest this game to anyone that loves turn based strategy games. another strong point is the modding community in which they must get props for their outstanding mods. vanilla civ 5 is a very good game in and of itself. i have played sid meiers games since the beginning and will continue to buy their products at release. they need to release civ 6 sometime in late 2014 if they are even thinking about a civ 6.",4
"the game is magnificent any fault in the game you can probablly find a mod for. and tons of extra goodies added in from the other civs, no longer will you have to worry about that one guy who just builds millions of cities. and than spams cheap units. because now there is one unit per tile, and maintainence on armies. only problems i find with the game is that i cant get krakatoa in my games and gandhi keeps f****** nukeing me!!!",9
"seriously addictive, youll play for 1/2 an hour and end up stopping 3 hours later.",1
"this  ing sucks but you should play it anyways for the lulz",1
"most time consuming game ever. the best in its category.",7
"exellent game for those who like strategy, its a very creative game, i recomnd it... get it if you can",1
"dis gam ta bestt eva.. this game had me non-stop playing for a whole weekend. i recomend this to anybody really. unless you cant stand turn-based then this is the best game ever. 10/10 cities will destroy",1
"this game is amazing! 10/10 would sacrifice first born.",3
"this is the greatest civilization game to date. granted there is bugs and the multiplayer can be unstable at times but it is easily fixable with a reload. brave new world, the latest dlc as of this recommendation fixes all the above-mentioned issues quite well!",2
"this game is amazing esp when playing with friends. will be buying the next installment of the series.",2
"you start out totally uncivilized and in like 3000 b.c. this game is . i was expecting civilization.",1
"love the game but i have the complete edititon and didnt the brave new world",1
"prepare to lose hours - possibly even days - of your life to this game. although fans of the civ iii interface might struggle to find civ v as intuitive, its still the same scramble for power and influence we love.",1
"this game is amazing! there are so many possibilities in this game and i deffinatly reccomend you purchase this game",1
"not that good without the expansions but still a good way to spend time.",1
"great game to pass the time and play with friends. set up alliances between your friends or betray them and kick them while they are down.",2
"you die a hero or you live long enough to become a villain",3
"this is my favorite game i have 100+ hours played. you can not go wrong with this game the hex grid is a very good choice for this game. a thing people dont like is the one unit per tile, but peronoally i like it because it leads to more stratigic play. you at no point need to go to war but it works well. if i were to have one critisisam it would be that taking cities is very unprofitable as it reduces the cities streanth significantly. other than that this game seems very solid and good.",3
"in this game you are president of the world and must bring freedom to everyone, crushing the commie scum very fun",2
"i recommend this game beacuse it is very good and look pretty.",5
"in my opinion its one o the best in the series (ex aequo with civ 3). performace isnt too bad even on old (~4 years old pc) or my not so powerful school laptop. definitely its worth full price (now even better with 50% off). grab it and grab a friend or few to play and have fun!",4
"just a great game sort of like a dumbed down version of shogun and the total war series",2
"i really like this game! civilization v is a very great game: tactics, politics, economy... you will spend a lots of hours of your life with it!",8
"10/10, would bang. god, i love this game. i cant think of a single negative thing to say regarding it. if youve got the money go buy it right now. the expansions are also worth the price. adding thos game to your library will most likely be one of the best decisions youll ever make.",2
"depending on who you ask, the civilization games are either very complicated, or babbys first turn-based strategy game. as a person in the former camp, who doesnt really play a lot of games in the genre, the in-game help and highly customizable difficulty levels do a terrific job of flattening the learning curve for newcomers.",1
"one of the best games out in a long time. it takes up all of your time, so make sure you have a good 5-12 hours to play.",1
"playing rome in a multiplayer match and spawn next to two guys. one of them lose a settler to barbs and i take it for free worker both of them knew eachother so they decided i needed to die i completely destroy them until they spam the chat and rage quits 10/10 would defend against warriors and spearmen again",3
"sweet baby jesus do i love this game. if you into sinkin a couple of hours into plotting the downfall of other countries, this is the game for you!",7
"always a favorite series of mine. though each iteration takes some getting used to, the expansions really help to flesh out the game.",10
"good strategetic game wished for more action like age of empires or mythology so faster war and results.",1
"its got swag! oh, and its an amazing strategy game that involves a lot planning what you will do in the future of the game.",1
"the pricing structure for this dlc is so bad, i want to cut my eyes out. buying two expansions is more expensive than the game, and the $120 worth of dlc. i cant even....",1
"love this 10/10. the only bad thing though is that every once in a while, when it is processing a turn for another major civ and the leader wants to talk to me or a new civ meets me or i meet a new civ, the game glitches out and it opens up a small window saying sid meiers civilization v has stopped working. this also happens when i want to engage in diplomacy with a leader.",2
"firaxis latest installment to civilization series (although i recommend quite late..) civilization take the already glorifying series to upper heigh !, with some gameplay rehaul and enhancement, and introduction of some new nation even siam!!! (xd **) engage in all new diplomacy and technology rehaul. improved ai, graphic, newly introduced victory type (diplomatic victory) along with the older type such as good ol cultural, technological, and domination victory. the game also see a great modding community that allow you to load and enhance the game without a single dime ! also new dlc pack god and king, seen some new nation such as netherland and celtic, religion now also play role in your national strife to glory !!!",4
"youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you, but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter. 20/10",1
"as always, civilization continues to be the top 4x game out there.",3
"great game, can lose a whole day playing it though",1
"this game is great i have played over 100 hours and loved every second. you can settle, trade, fight, make alliances, make enemies, get ing owned by barbarians, and build nukes. 10/10 will build more cities again. map editor + mods + multiplayer + single player ++ ai (very mean ghandi declared war on me) +-",1
"wow, what a game. it is so easy to spend hours upon hours into this. im not much of a fighter, so im glad there are ways of winning without firing a single shot, but dominating other players in single player is so much fun.",1
"its a time-killer, for sure, but if you can spare the time, its worth it. multiple interlocking systems mean theres always something to do and always decisions to make, but no given ele.ment is too complicated to understand; everything is both intuitive and extensively documented. whether youre interested in simple growth and exploration or military strategy and tactics, theres a successful strategy that matches your tastes and style. especially with the brave new world dlc, civ v offers essentially endless variation in what you can do, multiple paths to victory, and numerous ways to fine-tune the feel during setup or play. i like 4x games in general, but this is the first time since alpha centauri that one has grabbed me, and held on, this way.",4
"the team at feraxis have really out done themselves with this amazingly designed time sink which will leave you telling yourself you must play for one more turn.",2
"civilization is, by far, the greatest strategy franchise of all time! and civ 5 just adds to the greatness of the franchise. i highly recommend this game, but be prepared to lose a big chunk of your life, because i know youll be hooked.",1
"you can kill em with kindness, culture or just kill em. its all good.",6
"i would recommend the game, cause it is hours and days of fun. as for steam... it sucks with the logging in to their system. also they make it hard to do any upgrades. so unless youve got about a day to screw around with them having you log into their system.",10
"reason why you should play? play as gandi and behead adolf hitler. thats why.",2
"this game along with all previous entries in the civilization franchise has a way of stealing large chunks of my life, and i dont really mind. :)",2
"a great strategy game that is easy to play singleplayer or with others, and very easy to pick up on.",1
"this is the kind of game where you can easily find yourself playing until two in the morning.",1
"i have owned civ v now for almost two years, and it has always been nothing but awesome. even more awesome now with the brave new world dlc, and the addition of religion, spies, congress, tourism, trade routes, etc. this has made the game even more interesting. i lose track of hours on this, building my economy, while trying to build my army and not breaking the bank in the process, watching other civilizations machinations with my spies, and increasing border expansion to an all-time high without pissing off my neighbors. it is indeed very complex and i am always learning new tips and tricks. besides skyrim, this is most definitely my favorite game on steam. i give it 10/10 cupcakes.",2
"this game is not the most enjoyable to play on your own, as the computer can quickly turn on you and end a game you have been playing for hours just to be a up hill struggle and not to enjoyable at all. with friends though this game is a giggle as you have a human reacting against you. i would recomend it though if you find it in a sale.",1
"tried so many times to enjoy this game, couldnt. back to playing civ iv",3
"sid meiers civilzation v is one of the best stratagy games i have ever seen. and i am not the only one who thinks that. mulitple players and ign said the same thing. civ v is a turned based game where you try to conquer your entire map. but if that seems too hard you can either; be the first to space, have 5 diplomacies, research everything or have the most points when 2050 comes around. you play one of many famous conquers in history and try to build a civilization that will stand the test of time. if you dont want to do this alone, you dont have to! you can make helpful city-state (random civilization) become your ally and they will reward you by sending you gifts of gold, resources or even army units. if that is not what you thought i meant by not alone dont worry, you can play with other people and take down or befriend their civilzation. -fiddlesticks 9/10 review",1
"never trust washington, i know hes cute and all but...he is evil himself",1
"endless fun. good stuff. ive been playing the civ series on and off since high school. its the game i always come back to. if you are patient and like building empires, then youll love this game.",2
"one of the best strategy games i have ever played. dlc makes it even better but still great without",2
"days of your life lost to frustration and boredom!",1
"i almost dislike this game because its the night before my last final of the semester and all i can think about is this game. that put aside, this game is absolutely amazing, also, go for gold edition, it will be worth it. okay back to chemistry bye.",4
"i picked up civ v because i have played the previous versions of civ. i love the new graphics. i find the new elements being added with the expansion/dlc very interesting. i do wish that there was a way to turn them off if you want to go back to the base game.",4
"this game took my life, its destroying my social life and i have lost all ability to sport. 10/10",1
"i absolutly (pretty sure im going to spell stuff wrong but whatever) love the gameplay and the history aspect of the game. people who like turn based stratagy games like xcom: enemy unkown would really like this game exept in civ you have more control of everything that is happening unlike xcom. i bet some of you guys watch youtube vids on this and look at it thinking it is a very complex and hard to understand game but it is a lot simpler than it looks. i have over 100 hours on this game and i have even gotten some dlcs. i even got some of my friends to get the game and play with me. in all i find it a really fun game and i give it a 10/10.",3
"civilization v is a great game that you can play for over 250+ hours and still not know every tactic or strategy and youll never beat it. its a strategic game where not building that one military unit could be your downfall. overall a solid game. 8/10",1
"recommended game! maybe boring at first because the long text at tutorial! but after you play its not!",1
"briiliant gameplay. a significant improvement from civilization iv.",4
"george washington built new jersy on top of my busiest road",1
"this game is great, hours of entertainment, beware giving uranium to gahndi destroyer of worlds",2
"very addicting and fun. complex but not enough for it to be hard to learn how to play. 10/10",2
"a huge improvement over civ iv, especially when you take the expansions into account, civ v offers a deep experience and addicting gameplay.",2
"a true classic for all strategy lovers. ive never seen a game so complex and amazing looking. the movements are smooth but later in game the game start to slowly get an fps drop due to the vast amount of units. i guess that is natural, as most games would fail to get that right as well. the ai is smart, difficulty is at the right level to what you choose... maybe a little too good.",3
"started playing civ 5. started war ealrly on while fighting in the war ghandi is watching my army fight i am scared and after seeing all these reviews ghandi is apparently a bunch of a$$ holes so im going to kill then instantly 10/10 woukd kill ghandi again...",1
"best 13 dollars ive ever spent buy the expansions though",1
"this is a really fun game, i have had no problems with it :)",1
"a fresh next gen take on the classic that shaped pc gaming on earth, this is a beast of a game, no single human born after the 90s can say it never heard of sid miers civ game... to review this i would need some 2 history books and a couple of pages....",1
"this game is one of the most amazing games i have played in my life. i recommend getting the game and at least one of the dlcs because it just makes the game 10 times better, and the more you get, the more fun you have. trust me if sid doesnt make another civ game i will flip out .... i recommend you get this masterpiece.",9
"this game is great. ive never played the previous civ games, so this game was quite intimidating. there is so much data presented, it is hard to figure out which is important and which isnt. it will take you some time to learn how to have fun with this game, as the pacing seems glacially slow when you dont know what you are doing. by the time youve beaten a few games, youll be having a great time playing. i love playing each new scenario and learning mechanics i didnt understand before. it makes me excited to play the next game to try out a new strategy! touch support on this game is really great too.",1
"best game i have played in a long time! one play through and i have played for over 13 hours!",2
"a real challenge for the strategy players among us ;)",2
"do not play this game if you dont want to waste hours at a time on a game. civ v is a fantastic and highly addictive game through and through. the gameplay is simple to understand but still challenging, and it is a lot of fun to play with a lot of friends. there is great mod content and plenty of dlc, all of which add on to the game really well. the only downside of this game is that it sucks away whole days of your life while you watch your empire be destroyed by ghandi. 10/10",2
"this game is great to relax and play after a long day. i really didnt think i would like it, but after giving it a try i am having a blast. this game is very easy to mod and customize to your liking. i definitely recommend this game.",1
"absolutely the most addictive, time consuming game ive ever played. i dont even know why.",5
"this is possibly the most awesome game ive ever bought. seriously. you can jump in without ever having played the other civilization games, as it has a full tutorial. there is masses of dlc you can download. though that being said, you can play the game a thousand times, and itd be different every time - so the dlc isnt necessary to enjoy the game.",2
"civ is love, civ is live, spread your cheeks for civ. once you start civ, one does not simply stop playing civ. civ will give you ebolaids. 420 / 10 dewritos",1
"if you like civilizations, and the roman numural v, then i strongly recomend this game!",1
"set a timer when you play civ v. too many nights ive gone in thinking, ill just play a couple of turns then go to bed. four hours later i nearly crap my pants because the sun is coming up and i havent slept.",4
"if montezumas in one of your games, you better bloody prepare for war, cause its coming about one turn after he meets you.",4
"best strategy game that is around now!!!! most definitely a keeper",4
"this game is very interesting. i have only won 2-3 games so far in 80+ hours of game play. i keep coming back to the game and doing more with it. i suggest this game for everyone!!.",1
"civilization v by sid meier is one of the top strategy games that i hve played. i must admit i am not really a strategy man; more of a terrorist gunning psychopath. but i deeply and suprising enjoyed civs multi-layered and diverse gameplay and is one of the best purchases i have made since joining the master-race. thank you for enlightening me on a genre of game i am unfamilliar with.",1
"i wish i could add more npc players to the game without it actually making it harder for me to win. whats the default for a normal-sized map? like, six players? well, on the right difficulty setting, thats a fun challenge; not too easy, and not to frustratingly difficult like it could be if there were more players to complete world wonders before me and things like that. having more civilizations in one game makes it seem deeper and more varied, though! it adds flavor. i wish i could add, like... secondary civilizations, (from the full list, not just city-states, because city-states are boringly two-dimensional), but just have them kind of suck, so that im only playing against like five or so empires that are actually challenging to overcome. is that a strange request?",4
"i have sunk a lot of time into this game, by my standards at least. completely reccommend to anybody who likes the genre.",1
"this is a great game. it is interactive, and has historic educational value. the multiplayer feature would be great, iif it didnt have so many server connectivity issues. this is a hard game to describe, you need to play it to believe it. this game is awesome.",2
"air bombed war elephants and nuked persia when they hadnt invented electricity 10/10",1
"i have no regrets buying this game. i am hooked. you will become addicted to this game so say goodbye to your friends family and life. looking forward to the next installment of beyond earth.",1
"very addictive, reminds of old school fun that age of empires brought me as a kid. if it was possible to play through an entire session with an army of friends it could possibly be the best game ever made. even the shortest play through will take you probably 5-15 hours.",2
"an amazing board game style video game with a bit of history. the graphics and gameplay are both high-quality by far! i love the ai interaction. no matter how you look at it, it is a great game! i highly reccomend playing it, and you can just do soooo much with it. you can never really predict the outcome until it arrives!",2
"this is a great game has some what oof a learning curve but other then that itys great",6
"its a sid meiers game! and its incredibily fun and nice to play. its flaws is that the multiplayer session is sort off weird and sometimes you will definitely get disconnected, but other than that the game has been nice and awesome. and bloody hell wtf is there a lot of dlc? i love the expansion but the amount of dlc for this game is ludacrisly much, please do not release a game where you tries to milk your fan base by getting them to get the dlc content.",1
"an awesome turned based strategy game starring some of the world historys great and late leaders*. fight foreign nations for control of resources and lead your nation to victory via military, cultural, scientific or diplomatic dominance. *leaders may not be portrayed with any historical accuracy.",5
"flat out good game, must get if into this sort of stuff",3
"just all around fun game to play when you are in the mood to be nuked by ghandi 10/10",1
"damn, frikin shtty city-states are all like: oh! you better give us money or well end this friendship! dude, wtf you started the friendship jeeze but good game, just kill city-states as soon as you see them",1
"the newest iteration of one of the greatest series in gaming. 250+ hours on my steam version, which is one of three versions that ive sunk a lot of time into.",3
"great strategy game that lets you sit back and think about the moves. very in-depth with lots of intricate processes such as faith, happiness and food. there is a wide variety of ways to win for each save game, withn random maps that will provide a collection of resources that will help you on the way. although every civ (ie. english) have different advantages and a couple of unique units, it isnt impossible to stray off their advantage on lower difficulties. this allows you to really explore and get a handle on any win type using any civ.",1
"both really easy to get into, and very deep. while it can take a lot of your time, its worth it.",2
"one more turn you will never sleep again. this game is incredibly fun, but very addicting. watch our for ghandi, hes a backstabber.",2
"one of my favrioute ever games absouloutley brilliant multiplayer and singleplayer reallly great worth buying",2
"if you are looking for a good strategy game this one is perfect, even if youre not pick it up or try it you wont regret it. sid meiers civilization v is game based on creating a civilization to rule them all, for example: fight other civilizations out the way or even win by a cultural victory. first time im giving a score but: 9.8/10",1
"my jewish friend made me angry so i destroyed jerusalem -10 outta ten",1
"this game is extremely fun, interesting and entertaining. i love being able to play as different nations, each with their own unqiue play style and perspective.",2
"this is without doubt the greatest turn-based strategy game ever made.",2
"probably the best strategy game to date, would recommend it to anyone.",5
"great game, a just one more turn feel to it. i have been playing it since the first version and i still completely love it. i have been recommending it to the people i work with.",1
"this game is as addictive as chocolate to a fat kid. you can play for hours on end without knowing time has even passed. it just feels good when you can completely destroy another civ after a hundred turn war. it is a long game with massive replayability. i cant play this enough. <3",1
"10:00 pm: okay, this is my last turn. 4:30 am: god damnit rinse and repeat. 10/10",4
"i have spent 239 hours on this game, and i regret nothing 100/100 coach points",3
"to like a startegy game is one thing but this, this takes it to another level of strategy especially when you say to yourself one game or ill just finish my research then your head to head with your biggest rival with greece or something like that and realise i think ive been playing for 6 hours",2
"time consumer deluxe. have too much spare time? no problem!",1
"one of the finest strategy games around! the replay value is huge and each game can suck many hours out of you life. theres this just one more turn virus which is unique to the series, this game has it too. there are many different civiliztions to choose from and the game is very flexible, by that it is both friendly to new players while still offering challenge to veterans. theres a huge modding community for this game which makes the game even better. if you bring a friend or two, you wont feel how time flies as you play, the multiplayer is also great and there are many people playing it. overall, if you are a strategy fan, this is a must buy!",5
"you can play as a communist dictatoral ghandi who kills all and rules with an iron fist.",1
"awesome game! choose your favorite civilization and build up your country in any way you want! a warning though, its really addictive!",5
"this game is amazing. i have not slept days and ghandi is always spying on you so go to war on him asap. plus the mods are great.",1
"why cant gandhi stop ing nuking me its the ing 1850s 10/10",3
"best way to sit around and waist time, but be carefull, you might get a little mssed up in the head if you play it to much.",2
"yknow that guy from siam? ramkhamhaeng? yeah.  that guy.",3
"kinda steep learning curve, but as soon as you grasp the basics you will lose yourself in this game, it has so many things going for it, from the nice clean layout to the different victories, civilisation v will keep you interested for a long, long time.",2
"i really enjoy the coop of this game. my brother and i play as often as we can.",3
"one of the most fun games i have ever play 10 out of 10 would buy again",1
"sid meiers civilization v is a superb game for the strategic gaming community of steam, involving multiple simmulations of the development of a human civilization through the passage of time with a multitude of victorys and ways to achieve them from influential leaders of humanities past to play as. from leaders such as catherine the russians to napoleon the french you embark on a conquest to subdue humanity through the means of a cultural, economical, technological or domination victory.",1
"fun strategy game, i would recommend it for anyone who likes tactics or strategy. very confusing to understand at first but you slowly adapt to the game the more you play, maybe reading or getting help about the game would help you. still trying to understand the game more and im so far enjoying the game. and playing together with your friends is probably the most fun part about the game in my opinion. 9/10",1
"one of the best strategy games ever made, especially with the upgrades",7
"fastastic game! i have not been disappointed by any game in this series.",1
"a really pleasing and exciting strategy game that i highly reccommend. 9/10",4
"this game is so addicting and fun. i recomend also getting the brave new world dlc to make it even more fun. 10/10.",1
"perhaps the most addictive game ive ever played. youll be telling yourself one last turn for about 7 hours. play this game.",1
"epic game, emotional and stratigic! quite relaxing. 8/3",1
"stockholm is now the capital of libya denmark is located on the ivory coast sydney is in iran gandhi has nuclear weapons the swedish king says gott mit uns yes. 16/10",1
"this is one of those games that i find myself coming back to again and again. i can always spend hours on it (whether i meant to or not) and its always entertaining",1
"awsome game and has hundreds of hours of replayability",5
"fantastic game, only gripe with it is the ammount of time you can lose in one setting to it",1
"this is a solid upgrade over earlier versions of civilization ive played. the cultural victory seems to be the easiest for most leaders to achieve. the game definitely makes you be active though. there is always one or two key resources that are in short supply around the world that you have to go out and find. some leaders play very different - kamehamaha for example who can embark on oceans right away. others, like ramses maybe not so much. there is more difference in how they act during the game than how they work when you play them, i think. but the differing skill levels and boards can keep changing the game dynamics - as can luck of the draw. there always seems to be some very crowded areas which force people to go to war and then one or two civilizations who are off sort of on their own with lots of room to grow. definitely worth playing around with and trying out different approaches.",3
"this is the type of game that you will start playing one afternoon and dont notice how long youve been playing until the sun rises the next morning.",1
"a worthy successor to the grand-daddy of the 4x genre. the brave new world expansion really changes the game, and makes you care about city-state diplomacy in ways you never had to before.",3
"awsome game looks so cool runs so good the game is a blast best sid game ever put 50 hours in the game got the dlc you need this game if you love turn base",1
"this is the best game i have ever played. this is a turn-based game with cities to control and keep happy, wars to plan and attack, and wars to defend. this game has so much action that it doesnt get boring.",2
"i have poured a lot of time into this game. it is a perfect game to play while doing something else, like homework, watching tv, or cooking. i imagine i will only stop playing this game when civ 6 comes out.",4
"wooow david is bad at this which makes it fun for easy wins? 11/10 its ok",3
"i cant recommend this game because im unable to play it. 70+ games in my library and this is the only one that doesnt work. the game crashes or freezes during the loading screen. ive tried all fixes/recommendations i could find online, and nothing has worked. ive reinstalled/rebooted/verified games files, etc multiple times. very annoyed.",1
"30 mins will turn into 30 hours with this time machine, i promise!",4
"this game made me think strategy games are  anymore, ghandi has nukes too. 11/10 would bang.",1
"i love this game, great for if you like rome total war and turn based game good fun to play with mates as well!",1
"very addicting game, great graphics and sound. each single player game lasts as long as you want it to. each multiplayer game can take hours if not longer. perfect game if you want to learn history and kill time.",3
"if you like stratgey games this is the game for you but keep in mind the games are very time consuming and can take days to complete",1
"love it. have so much fun with friends and destroying the world. 11/10 would buy again.",1
"it is a game that you will waste das on for no real reason. it is great",5
"possibly the best thing they could have possibly done with the civilization franchise. since i bought it i have played very few other games and the challenge aspect of it are amazing. could not ask for a better game, until you buy the expansion pack!",8
"awesome game if you dont have midterms to study for (time consuming and drags you in).",2
"in short amazing game i spent 6 hours playing first civ and im craving more.",1
"too many hours spent on this game. 10/10, would waste day on for one more turn again.",2
"great game but mainly only worth it if u buy all the dlc and it was deffinatly worth the $25 usd i paid. it is a great time stealer and keeps you entertained for hours",1
"even though game has imperialist themes, still good game.",1
"this game showed me my passive aggressive need to rule and conquer the world. ign - 10/10",2
"although this is one of my favorite games, if you dont currently own it, i would hold off. the one main reason is that the dlcs are moneygrabs (but dont get me wrong, they really change the gameplay of the game). if you love strategy games then this one would be perfect for you. in hindsight, i would have waited to but it (i bought the gold edition) simply because they continually release dlcs that arent the cheapest (for example: brave new world and gods and kings)",2
"sure, it could have used some work, and maybe the ai is still finnicky and some gameplay mechanics could be improved. this is however, no detraction from the legacy of civ iv and other civilization games past. this game still continues to improve the legacy of the genre defining series that is civilization. go buy the game and all of its expansion packs. seriously, go buy it all.",1

"became allies with venice then used them as guinea pigs once i started producing nukes. 10/10 would betray again",1
"an amazing game and one of ther best stratergy games ive playd in a long time. worth buying, so addictive and really fun",4
"there is a very good reason that this game has eaten 90 hours of my life.",2
"mediocre vanilla game, pretty good with gods & kings, fantastic with brave new world. not the deepest 4x out there, but probably one of the most charming.",1
"civ 5 is a complex and unbelivebly polished game with great expansions to boot. the mechanics are simple and the inteferce is generally well done. diplomacy, religion, science and combat are so well intertwined with each other and makes for countless strategies and hours of gameplay. i personally feel that there is not much that is lacking apart from perhaps a better way to give new players an idea of what each victory condition means and also give certain hints, e.g for cultural victory have a set amount of wonders that are required so new players can work towards them. 10/10",2
"great game, worth every penny ive spent on it. not good if you enjopy having a social life.",4
"im into to history and war and stuff like dat so this is perfect for me xd !!!!!!!!!!",1
"probably one of my favorite games, tied with diablo 3, minecraft, the halo games, :d",2
"ing mongolians took control all of my land and  my people",2
"a brilliantly addictive strategy game and an excellent introduction to the civilization series! great fun over multiplayer (if you have the bandwidth)!",3
"great game - more complex gameplay than previous versions and gorgeous graphics.",1
"i absolutely love this game. being in highshool makes it kinda rough to play long multi-hour game. i picked up this game in mid november and i have managed to rack up almost 40 hours so far. i wasnt sure if i would like it before i bought it; after all, i had never played any turn based strategy games. however, after playing it, i have fallen in love with it. i have but one gripe, and that is that it is most enjoyable with all of the dlc. the cheapest way to get all of the dlc is in the complete edition, so it would be wise for someone who doesnt want to drop $50 on a single to buy it when it is on sale. price complaints aside, this is probable one of my favorite games.",1
"worth the hype. this is my first civ game, so keep that in mind (although i have sid meiers alpha centauri). easy to get into, and incredibly addictive",1
"when you first play this game if you have alot of players can last hours. this is not a bad thoguh becuase those hours will be full of fun if you like manageing citys buildings and an army. this game has replay ability but can get boring in multiplayer becuase you can be deep into a game and people will leave and it just turns into and ai match.",1
"i may be slightly addicted. so much to do! love how in depth this game is. i am engrossed from the moment i load a game :)",1
"they should have sent a poet. all i can say is this is the easiest way to lose an entire day.",1
"this is a absoloutsly fantastic strategy game, the best of its kind. extremely, highly reccomended.",2
"i have always been a fan of civ, and this game has to be the finest one yet. it felt lacking in some places, so the gods and kings expansion is one that i feel is very important. overall, this is an essential game for anyone even casually interested in strategy gaming.",5
"this game is horrable and has caused aton of crapy lag for my comr and also the ftustration of my friends my windows 8.1 couldent take",2
"an amazing game, and a great inprovement from civ iv.",4
"i recommend this game, especially with the in-game editor (ige) mod installed. it makes for really crazy scenarios.",2
"one of the best strategy games, with amazing add ons and a great moding community",1
"i simply cannot get enough of this game. i play very often and for long periods at a time. in my opinion, it is the best thing i have ever played, and i have played a lot. i love the concept, the ideas, the execution, and all the many things that go into this game. i preach the gospel of civilization v to all of my friends. im not the best at explaining why i like it though, so you should really just try it out for yourself.",7
"this is one of the least-terrible games ive ever played.",3
"i clicked on stuff for 15 hours straight and me mum yelled at me and told to go to bed",1
"this series is always in my top 5 most loved games.",8
"this is the first game i got on steam and it is very fun and has many but also quite time consuming and can get repetitive after a few rounds",1
"time consuming and if you play with friends youre gonna have a good tiem.",1
"this game ate up so much of my time its not even funny. if youre looking for a strategic game to play solo or with friends get this. the civilizations are great and the technology unlocks are just awesome. the biggest feature that brings me back to this game is the fact that each time you start a new civilization you know the gameplay and the way you complete the game is going to be very different to the last game you played. extremely recommended!",3
"you will accidentally play this for 5 hours in a row if you arent careful!",1
"bit of a learning curve to play, but once you do, this game becomes a great time-consuming game to play with your friends.",1
"so deep so amazing. in my first game of brave new world, i guiled my way into the position of head of the world congress, renamed it the unholy satanic confrence of glorious byzantium, forced the world to accept satanism as the official world religion, watched as the various populations of the world adopted my cultures rock music and art against the wishes of their leaders, and eventually was asked by the whole of the earth to step up as leader of world!!! god ing damnit i love civilization v.",7
"as you can probably tell, from the number of hours put into this game (550 at time of writing this), i enjoy this game. but then, i do like a good strategy game, and sid meier titles usually deliver on that. civ 5 takes the formula of the first 4 in the series and refines it into a sleek, glossy, next gen-feeling game; civ 4 all grown up, if you will. new civilizations available to play, a plethora of new gameplay and map generation options, a quality soundtrack, revamped multiplayer, and delicious visuals are just the icing on the proverbial cake. however, i do feel that the user mods dont always integrate as well as they should, and the absence of an integrated sdk (like civ 4 had) is lamentable. but hey, nothings perfect.",6
"big fan of the game. very addictive, you spend most of your time going just one turn more.",2
"some good changes from 4 - no more doom stacks. some bad - happiness. overall more than adequate civ game.",1
"a very good game, but i must warn you. gandhis words are backed with nuclear weapons!",1
"another great addition to the civ library. not quite as polished as civ 4, but once you get the expansions it easily exceeds how great 4 was, even with beyond the sword.",3
"extremely addictive game, loving the dlc that comes with it and also the many mods that have been created to go with it. many hours have been lost playing this.",5
"this will not be a review but instead im using this as a way to get the word out to all new civilization players in general. the game changer for me was misterciv5s channel. watching his series of tutorials is the best set of intructional videos for all levels civ v. yt search:  misterciv5 over the many years, ive played all genres of video games but never a turn base game. let alone one of the most complicated or highest learning curve required to play a civilization game. theres a reason why i avoided civ game in the last 10+ years. but in the age of youtube tutorials, ive tried to give civ another go.",1
"sure, it starts out slow, but once you take out an entire nation you know, you just know, that this game was made for you.",1
"another civilization, another masterpiece. still the best game in terms of turn-based strategy.",1
"you wont realize it at first, but youll be spending hours without realizing it. this game gives you a variety of ways to play it, not just the the opposition must be crushed! sort of way. good graphics, good gameplay, easy to play - good game overall :d",1
"great game just make sure you have all day to play a match.",2
"they declared war on me because i tresspassed their borders once some millenias ago. good times. surely recommend. 10/10 would play again.",2
"an excellent addition to the civ series, streamlines a lot of micromanaging, uses hexes instead of squares, and has a totally overhauled (for civ) and awesome combat system. not quite up to alpha centauri levels of greatness, but superb nevertheless. on balance, better than civ iv (i say this as a former civ iv addict).",3
"unbelieveably addicting. easily one of the best civ games ever.",1
"this game, this game... the game itself is brilliant, with so many different ways of doing things and dlc only makes it better. the civilopedia is really accurate and non-biased, the same goes with gameplay and the ai. over all this game is brilliant and i wont stop playing for a long time.",2
"ive gone off the civilization games since civ 3 they just seem to have lost their magic ingredients for me. i loved the road building and the throne room, fighting the animals, the way it felt like you were really building a massive empire and the way the game felt quite realistic. but once they started settling on a new graphical direction for the game and water it down to simply a fighting game, it soon became apparent that this cartoony game was not really for me any longer. i do occasionally revisit it and my daughter likes it but in all the time i have had civ 3, 4 and 5 i have never once got any further than cavalry in the game - i get bored my then and give up.",1
"if the vast options for gameplay is not already enough to keep you coming back, the excellent and active modding community will keep you cemented to your chair.",10
"this game was one of the best strategy games i have ever played.",2
"really fun game and the addons add interesting new stuff, so i recommend playing it with the addons.",2
"hands down: best civ ever! and it gets better with every expansion pack. never played civilization? then you missed out on a lot. but dont worry, just start with civ v, its awesome.",7
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played, although it does have a couple of bugs and glitches it is still fantastic, definitley worth the money.",2
"i have been in love with civ since i played the timeless civ ii. whilst civ v will never capture the simplicity of civ ii it is certainly worth the investment especially if on sale. the add ons do add a lot so it is worth checking those out too.",1
"first turn based strategy game i actually gave a good go, ive always liked rts instead. i was expecting to not like it much as it has turn based military battles, however to my surprise i really loved it. i still dont really like the military side, but there is so much else to do and many different ways to win. ive clocked over 200 hours on this game and i feel ive only completed a fraction of what there is to do. would highly recommend this game.",3
"any one up for 12h+ game? maybe? that said, great game! your best bet is to wait till there is a summer / winter sale to buy the games and dlcs (cheaper 75%) . and as always, watchout for gandhi...",3
"endless fun. good stuff. ive been playing the civ series on and off since high school. its the game i always come back to. if you are patient and like building empires, then youll love this game.",2
"try this game for a few hours and you fall in love with it.",1
"one of the deepest yet most accessible strategy games, civ v is superb - i do recommend you get the gameplay-enhancing expansions to get the true experience, though.",2
"i am not a great lover of turn based games, you heard me not! you have heard brilliant reviews on this game from the turn based veterans of the gaming world. but you sir are not them! you are looking at this game that came out years ago and are wondering maybe i should give it a shot, to see what all the fuss is about. well take my review as this, this game is pure cocaine, it is so addictive it should be labelled as a drug by the fda. like a said before i am not a fan of turn base games, but this game turned me, it is worth the price and i will play for many more hours, and if you get bored 40 hours in. (if thats possible) add a mod or two to change the game up completely. it will never end for me. i have found the game that will more than likely die with. just... one... more... turn...",1
"if you want to play this game. dont plan on doing anything else. this game is a huge timesink, but you will enjoy your time.",2
"really great game. gotten all of my house mates to get it and we play it together almost every weekend.",1
"this game is fun and addicting i recommend setting the map type to massive to have a chaotic expirience",1
"this game is a ton of fun if you like strategy. the original game is awesome but if you want the complete package get the two dlc packs to get religion and trading. if you like carefully avoiding war by keeping trade lines running between other civilizations or just want to crush everyone else on the map with blitzkrieg or nuclear warfare then this is the game to you. when the base game gets old(which it wont for a while) there are scenarios like the fall of rome or the civial war, and then there are tons of mods! truly an epic game for multiplayer or singelplayer. the only con i have is that games can take forever to get good.",1
"clearly one of the best games ever created. to miss this game is to miss a masterpiece.",2
"a very addictive, fun game for players/strategists of any skill level!",3
"awesome game. it is definetly something you have to play as a gamer who loves strategy and economics.",2
"been playing civilization since the early 90s civ 5 is the best. i have logged close to 700 hrs on civ 5 and im still not bored!",9
"what a game. love it. only downfall for me that the fighting was a bit more like c&c but very good",1
"it is a fun and great game if you like stratigic games i would recommend it for all strategy players",1
"- community is pve and mod oriented - small matches (less then 6 ppl) are completely unbalanced - no matchmaking - random opponents are often cheaters, so you have to know the community - non ffa-matches have low variety (its always a race to 1 of 3-4 techs before military rush)",1
"civ 5 is so addicting! its hard for me to pull myself away from this game even after 5-6 hours of non-stop playing. i enjoy playing with my friend as well, we conquer as a team and even seperately. its very interesting to see how your civilization can progress. i havent gotten far down the tech tree yet, im actually hoping to do a more relaxed game, less war, so i can experience the progress of the eras. i do not really have anything bad to say about this game. i do wish one thing could be tweaked and thats a barbarian slider to say how often they appear or something. thats all. i love this game and highly, highly recommend playing it over beyond earth -.-",1
"all time classic and favorite. it gets better with every new version and now multiplayer works better than ever. highly recommend.",1
"really good for wasting days when i should be working. if i didnt have this game i might actually have to do something productive...",2
"probably the best strategy game ever made because it is very easy to comprehend for a novice and can be amazingly deep and rich for an expert player. every game is an entirely new experience! love it and you will too.",2
"civ v is a really good game for those strategic, thinking gamers out there. and you dont even need a knowledge of world history because you create it! yes, i know its not an indefinite amount of possibilities (though that is a drawback for some people) it has a bunch of other things. the original game only has a certain amount of civilizations, though, so if you have enough, buy it with an expansion (or two) and as many dlcs as you can afford, because i assure you it is worth it. i would give this a 9/10 because of my tastes. i mean, i love the game, but as a game you control without an indefinite amount of possibilities, i am one of the many people who find that a drawback. other than that, its an amazing game!",1
"such an amazing game, fun for people who have no clue how to play it (like me).",1
"i lost 14 hours to this game in one day alexander the great/osama bin laden",1
"its an excellent 4x game. its almost like a really comprehensive version of risk but on your computer. offers very large replay value has a high skill ceiling while still being accessible for new comers. easy to play hard to master. would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a quality strategy game.",1
"great game, perfect example of 4x gaming now buy it and explore, expand, exploit, exterminate!",3
"it is a good game. until it crashes!! this is inevitable. you literally cannot finish the game. do not waste a penny on this.",2
"say goodbye to your social life. you dont need one when gandhi is nuking your cities. 20/10 for the might warlord gandhi ai. 10/10 everything else.",4
"aztecs won the space race and landed on the moon, then they were nuked by gahndi. 10/10",2
"great game i greatly enjoy this game even though i have only started playing it. its very casual with minimal micro managing and an easy user interface. those of you that have played sots ii will enjoy this game. this game could have a little better graphics though with more effects(its all about the nvedia phisx particles).",1
"addicting, immersive and challenging. this is one of my favorite series of all time and the reason for many late nights. maybe a slight learning curve if your new, though experienced players will feel right at home. excellent addition to the series!",1
"i hate ers dont add me . i ing hate your black skin. you suck big black  you  ucker english my  go back to ing africa you ing noob.  you and your  profile pic.  you ing",4
"keeps me interested and taps into my inner dictator.",1
"my favorite strategy game series. i adore this game. :d just be careful, it will surprise you how much time youll put into this. haha.",1
"sid meiers timesink v - warning: dont buy if you enjoy your free time. 10/10.",1
"have poured so many hours of my life into this game, definatley reccomend getting this game",6
"forgot to feed dog. shes now dead... just like gandhi.",2
"this is one of the best games i have ever played! although, for the best of it, you do need all the big dlc. so if i was you i would wait for the gold edition to be on a good sale. it is not as complicated as some other grand strategy games, but still really fun. play the multiplayer with friends if you can, although it can be buggy and crash, so make sure your autosave is on!",5
"amazing game, hard to play with a lot of friends, but still a ton of fun and addicting! 10/10",1
"you should know whether or not you like civ games by now. if you liked civ 2, civ 3, and civ 4, civ 5 is more of the same. the series gradual flow towards simplification, polish, and tightening come to a new apex in civ 5. the new hex system has improved combat significantly, the city-states give diplomats something to do, and the whole ui is so much cleaner that - in my opinion - civ 5 is the first civ game that you can use to really introduce someone new to the series. while firaxis stubbornly refuses to release an alpha centauri 2, civ 5 is going to have to be my current large-scale strategy fix.",3
"with this game you can play as britain and retake what is truly ours.... the world! apart from that you can nuke whoever you want so enjoy!",1
"this is one of the most boring games i have ever played, i strongly recommend you do not buy this.",1
"at the very minimum sid meiers civilization v requires brave new world and gods & kings to be playable. if you want to join the multiplayer scene at all these expansion packs are absolutely needed.",6
"excellent game, first game of mine from civilization series and i have really enjoyed my time playing this game.",4
"this has become my favorite steam game since the day i got it. i truly recommend this game, but i do recommend that you buy the dlc for the game. the dlc really improves the game. 9/10",6
"great game to get friends together and have fun, wether winning or loseing, its still a fun game if you get some people into it. the customization also helps the game so that you can have as much fun as you need",1
"woah! what is this? a strategy game? hell yea, its a damn strategy game. and thats a strat-a-gey! in this game, you need to think up a plan right from the start, and stick with it! well, try to anyways, but the instant you find gandhi, elizabeth, or even george washinton, you may find yourself going from a peacemaker to a warmonger, or vice-versa, or maybe youll just stay as the guy who stays in the corner of the world doing nothing other than having one company endlessly make games for the rest of the world, but yknow, whatever. this game is definately worth the time wasted. #tenouttaten. well, more like 9.99999/10, but this isnt math class.",2
"to start i have all the dlc for the game and i feel it is almost a must to have all the dlc because i feel otherwise the game is not as in depth as the last game in the series. i love the ai it really feels fresh and alive and each civ has its own personality and that makes the game allot of fun. over all if you get this game with out the dlc i feel you are missing out on a very interesting experiance and with out the dlc the game does not feel like its complete. hope you enjoy the game as much as i do =)",2
"well, the 251 hours played on this game most likely explain how much i like it however it can get a little boring if you only play on your own so sadly, if you have no friends, your screwed...",4
"theres no such thing as a quick game in civilization v. and the thought of just one more turn, then ill... will creep up and gobble up your time. its immersive, looks good and theres so many options that youll be a bit overwhelmed if youve never played a civ before. playing the board game isnt a really good reference, i might add. luckily, i had help with learning the game and once you have, its just great fun. keep a clock nearby, though. it wont be long before you think its just past 11 and it really is 2 am.",1
"best turn based stratergy out there. if you have friends with skype tell them to get this game and play it with them, you will have countless hours of fun and then just be dominated by that guy!",1
">boot up civ 5 at 7pm >multiplayer >host game >invite friends >start game >???? >5am",5
"if you want to conquer the world, this is your game",1
"ive spent alot of time in this game and it is fantastic, 5 stars, i only wish you could stack units but i understand why they chenged it i really havent played any of the other ones but this one is great if me and my friends had the time i would bplay more but the singleplayer is still tons of fun. i would recomend this to a friend!",3
"amazing love it especially with friends such a treat to play",1
"this game is fun if you like doing the same thing over and over again (like me) but if you buy this game, be sure to buy the brand new world along with it, because its not as challenging as it feels it should. almost all the good workshop content only works with the brand new world addition. the ais never build huge forces, only small 3 unit sized ones. so take my advice, and buy the brand new world as well, because this game alone is not worth $30. get the brand new world in the complete edition, cause youll only have to pay $50, not $60, and you get all that crazy stuff.",1
"love the game! but as of recently, the game will not load previous saves really disappointed...",2
"fun to play with 2 other people. games can last quite a while but they are never dull and there is always deep strategy involved.",1
"honestly, the best way to make history into a action-packed awesome- game!",4
"no wonder the uk dislikes polish people. back stabbing s. 10/10",3
"my butt plug really enjoys this games, it makes fredrick (the butt plug) really happy.",2
"fantastic game, better with the expansions. so fun to play.",2
"this is civilization at its best. (with all addons) what else can be said? the geographic importance of landscape and non stockable units make this version a lot better than other episode in my opinon.",3
"just wow. great graphic addicting gameplay and makes you hate ghandi for betraying you",1
"no better way to stay up until 3am and then say, how the  did it get so late? well, ill play one more turn...",5
"sid meiers civilization v is a very fun game for people who are interested in strategy games, but you probably already heard it before if you are in to these kinds of games. i dont play strategy a lot, and each game requires a lot of time commitment, which i dont have.",1
"buy it before the summer, or else your life will be ruined.",4
"ever want to kick ghandis ? well now you can in this extreme game. what about making bismarck look like a sissy? hell what am i saying? you can make them all look like sissies!!! endorsed by the extreme reviews association. era",6
"how can you charge this amount for a game that isnt even stable after 5 years?",1
"played as the koreans and wiped out the americans,such fun.",1
"for someone who really loves strategy games its a must have. use your brain, use it a lot - to make your empire grow and grow, let the people stay happy, make money, expand and take over the world of civ5!",1
"civilization v is a fantastic entry in the series, which avoids the trap of getting stagnant thanks to some important novelties on combat system, interface and general design, designed to create a 4x of elegant and clean mechanics.",2
"a fantastic strategy game. i would recommend it to anybody that enjoys strategy games, and also a good game for people to start on if they have never tried strategy games before.",2
"there is many things wrong with the world. its your job to fix it. get this game",1
"i got the game and steam when i hit play i choice the version but then i dosent work help",1
"if you dont have this game, i feel bad for you son, i got 99 problems but ghandi aint one... however the zulus are at least 9 of them...",1
"all the usual reccomendations. old game by now but still solid, especcially with expansions and dlc.",6
"back in 1991, a little game called civilization was released. it was a pretty awesome game, everything was perfect. except for gandhi. gandhi was given the lowest possible rating for aggression, he wouldnt hurt a fly. however, when a civilization adopted democracy, it would set back all other civs aggression levels by 2. this meant gandhi was set to -1, which flung him all the way back to the highest rating - 255. its been a running joke ever since. since then gandhi has conquered many civs taken over many planets and made many nukes. #neverforget.",1
"do not buy this game. i bought the game, started it once and immediately it crashes. i open it again, select the right direx and nothing hapens. i have tryed all and i mean all!!!!",1
"civilization 5 is the best civ game yet i like the game play",2
"if you like your social life, but you want this game, you have to choose. you arent allowed both.",3
"one of the best games out there...especially with the mod of ice and fire....outstanding.",1
"really, the best part about brave new world is that its finally addressed every victory condition in the game and made each one not only more equally viable, but also just as busy. weaponizing culture works to bring it more in line with the other conditionsits something you have to work towards and not something you just happen to achieve. on top of that, the diplomacy changes make this system more interesting as well, and it all comes down to one thing: if you have civilization v and want to play more, you owe it to yourself to get this expansion.",2
"civ v now available on linux ! my favorite game, on my favorite os! i love it !",5
"runs horrid on a sony vaio flip. it is so bad with understanding screen orientation or resolution you can not do anything beyond watch the game intro. glad it was a free download and not something i paid for.",1
"this game made me believe in magic again. this game made my  grow three sizes in just three weeks! this game brought my granddad back to life. he played and had heart attack at the sheer thrill that he could manage citizens in the city. hes dead now, burried with a redeemable code to civ 5 in his grave. dem trade routes... dose quotes... dat alternate history? 10/10 would . and the mods! the mods actually make the game fundamentaly better. they are not just window dressing. they are a thing of beauty and the people who make them should be given the medal of honor. ive wasted so much time on this game that i could have been wasting on other things and i suggest you do the same.",4
"fantastic visuals! such an easy game to just dive right into and just hit play now! easy to be good at, difficult to master. online play is an absolute train wreck however.",2
"a very good game ,very well built. its very enjoyable and the multipalyer mode makes it one of the most addictive turn based stratergy games.....",1
"civilization v is a easy to approach turn table game. being my first ever turn table game i found that it has helped me enter an area of gaming i had never considered before. thanks civi :)",2
"one of, if not the, best civ games to come out. the updated combat system make the game more interesting. also the dlc is well worth it. just make sure you dont have anything that needs to be done in the near future once you make the plunge! ...one more turn...",1
"a thinking nyqqas game, be prepared for betrayal and normal history while you embark on a journey to nuclear warfare and congress-like diplomacy.",1
"amazing. multiple civs to play, multiple maps highly recommend that you try out some mods",4
"ah, the most addicting game ive got... guaranteed to either bore the hell out of you... or make you waste tons of hours of your social life... win win? well, give it a test-drive! only 30 bucks (quite cheap).",2
"the best game for those who want to take over the world. civ 5 is much more tactical and strategic than its predecessors, requiring players to have the mindset of a general rather than a mathemetician. a wide variety of civilizations and cultures to play, with highly customisable, randomly generated maps forces players to adapt strategies. mod support for civ 5 is extensive, with always something new to try. i highly recommend getting all of the expansions, because they add so much more to the game and make it a truly amazing experience.",3
"this is a very fun and intuitive piece of software 100/101 must buy.",2
"totally worth buying. i never played any turn-based strategy games prior to this and i always assumed they were boring. this game changed that view. i just started playing this game and so far im still playing with the bots so diplomacy is rather boring (the trades with bots is absolutely cut-throat). other than that, this is a very solid game. balancing your resource to attain victory certainly isnt easy. for whats it worth, this game is an absolute steal!",2
"civ is civ and will always hold a special place in my heart, i played civ 2 the year it came out while in the 8th grade. a few years later i got a free copy of civ 1 on a pc gamer cd and played them both for many years. i love this game as i am not very good at rts games these days because i can not keep up with all the clicking and multi-tasking. civ 5 is a lot of fun if you like to stratergise as there are always plenty of factors to consider with every move in the later game. the average time i spend on a skirmish is about 6 hours so dont plan to have a quick 30 minute game before bed as you will be chanting... one... more... turn... as the sun comes up. i used to play this game with my house mate when he had trouble sleeping... 30 turns in and hes out like a light. i hope you all enjoy this game as much as i do!",2
"best stratagy game ever! plays really well and great with friends",1
"awesome game ! true to the civilization series. a must buy!",3
"great multiplayer stratagey game. if youre more into stratagy apposed to zerg rushing you have a fair amount of fun with civilizations multiple paths to victory.",2
"i think civilization v is verygood apart from the fact that you can build wonders if someone alredy built them",1
"if only someone were to buy it for me... im currently using my friends family sharing to play it, and it is funnnnn!",1
"if youre planning on going outside ever again, you might want to skip this one.",2
"if i had a choice between having sex with a woman or playing civ v, id probably still choose sex with a woman. but afterwards id tell her to get out of my house so i can play civ v. 10/10 would give my crabs to george washington again.",1
"amazing game, looks great, very addictive and fun to play.",1
"the game is great to the experienced player in civilization franchise, but new player may find the game play confusing to play. the graphics on the game are visually stunning and the music is really immersive to the gameplay. the only drawback to the game is all the gameplay options. there are so many that i feel like im missing out on something. overall the game is a good pasttime when you are bored.",1
"ive invested alot of time into this game worth it yes it has alot of different play styles and other civs especially on harder difficultys one of my top 5 games only thing i could put down about this is some of the starts are awfull and the crash bug i experience after around 80-85 turns of playing overall good :)",2
"civilization v ranks in as my favorite pc game of all time, hands down. the depth, the strategy, and the amount of fun in this game while playing long matches that take several days just to complete is wonderful. there are so many countries to choose from and each have their own special stats and boosts. it takes a long time to be able to play at higher difficulties, but thats the beauty of it. the replayability is the highest of any game ive played. this is by far, a 10/10 game.",3
"fun to play for a while, but comparing to civilization iv this game is absolut crap.",1
"historical strategy does not get any better than civ 5. allowing people to play an alternate version of history is great, and sid and his peeps at firaxis hit the nail on the head. with hours of replayability the game allows for a different story each time.",5
"this is the first civilization game that i have ever played and i was pleasantly surprised. to put it short, it is amazing. a multitude of different play styles are supported and the variety of maps, game size, and online aspects make this game very replayable. the only gripe i have on the game is that units are not stackable, however that is very forgiveable when looking at everything this game does right. 9/10",1
"i love this game, i am updated to gods and kings. i dont like how many civs have far too situational uas and uus, but i have heard that has been mostly fixed with brave new world. that said, i wish the expansions did not cost your first born child. like seriously, upgrading to brave new world doesnt even build off gods and kings! you have to have both if you want certain things. also many mods on the steam workshop (side note: the mods offer a whole new range of experiences and thats great, it keeps me coming back) require both g&k **and** bnw. you can spend a lot of money on this franchise, but if you have the dough its worth it. many mods fix some balance issues and its addictive as all hell. id recommend to people with lots of free time. if you cant spend hours in one sitting, this probably isnt for you.",2
"this game is very fun. it has alot of ways to play the games and alot of ways to win. but the game is funnest when you have all of the dlc. you should definitly get this game if you like strategy.",10
"i enjoy this game a great deal. a little tricky to start with but well worth it.",1
"i started a war with france and now the world is in ashes. 11/10. no really, great turn based strategy game, several ways to win and a ton of leaders with their own strengths and weaknesses. i highley recommend.",1
"love it! this detailed turn by turn strategy game is hours upon hours of fun!",4
"i got this game as an early xmas present and i say it is the most addicting and fun game i have ever played. setting up all the units and conquering cities is just too much fun. i always had wanted to change history, and this game lets you do that. i got it yesterday and i have already played 7 hours of it. i have conquered the whole west hemisphere of the earth map. right now, i am planning to take over the french, as their army is nonexistent or little. all i can say is, bon voyage!",1
"after a rocky release in 2010, much of the problems with the original release have been addressed with the expansions god and kings and especially brave new world, with the addition of trade routes, religion, culture victory overhaul and policy overhaul, and the world congress amongst other things. if you did not like this game in its original form, its worth a second shot if you get the expansions.",5
"the game has awesome gameplay, but it recently started crashing all the time after running perfectly any advice?",1
"i love this game!! cant wait for civ: beyond earth!! i recommend this game to anyone looking to rule the world (not in real life of course). its great fun, and very exciting to strategize in order to get what you need.",2
"say good bye to your social life..... just saying.",8
"civilization v is an amazing game that has endless replay potential. i have never learned as much from a game as i have from the civilization game series. often i will be watching the history channel and realize how well the game implements the impacts of great world wonders on the growth of your civ. a must for all gamers with dreams of conquest.",4
"playing all the time, when i am feeling a strategist",1
"11/10, easily the best game i have played in.. so long it has everything a strategy game needs, all the ways to win, you dont have to go around and killing everyone, no, you can trade and just search for what you need, you can form alliances in order to get what you need.",1
"200 hours in and i still keep coming back. the base game is decent, but the real fun is with the gods and kings and brave new world expansion packs.",3
"an absolute must have for those new to the turn-based strategy genre. a game that is easy to pick up, but hard to master, civilization vs new hexagonal tile system allows for greater strategic depth in the field of combat. there are a plethora of civilizations to play as, from the ancient mayans to the modern americas, and a wide range in between. theres one to fit anyones play style and preference. by the way, if you want every civilization you will need the following dlc: gods and kings brave new world babylon civ & scenerio packs: -polynesia -denmark -korea have fun and good luck!",2
"ghandi nuked me for helping him 11/8 would gift him money again",4
"this game lets you nuke everyone 10/10 very realistic",3
"civilization v is in my opinion the best turn-based empire building game to date. with over 20 civ with their own unique units, buildings and perks you will not be running out of a new strategy to try anytime soon. although i do recommend picking up the two expansion packs gods and kings and brave new world.",1
"hell yes bad  strategy game. spent tons of hours on this game and im still just a noob, recommended for you and your friends.",1
"one of the best games on the market without question,even if you are new to turn based games civilization 5 is a simple and addictive experience that you will be playing for hours on end. 9/10",2
"just got the brave new world dlc and i didnt think they could make an already awesome game any better but, they sure found a way and i dont know how i ever liked the game without these new features. it added so much depth and more to do that it feels natural and that it just belongs there.",2
"if you are a fan of the civilization series, you will enjoy this game. great replay value.",3
"grand strategy at its finest without being too complicated. great fun alone or with friends and easy to pick up. just beware that its a time sapper. before ones knows whats happen 12 hours have past and the game still isnt finished.",1
"crashes so much after you start getting big in the game dont install unless you have a good computer my brand new laptop with only 2 games installed at this point cant handle it very dissapointed 4 g of memory too was an expencive lesson for what seemed to be a pretty basic looking game",1
"mom said dont ing play before you feed the dog. dogs dead now. buy this game.",2
"allow me to tell you a story. after approximately 8 victorys achieved by world domination, i decided to be peaceful. through various treaties, gifts, and negotiations i reached the status friends with everybody in the world. this made me happy. i was a respectable man in the world, with a low amount of troops and a high amount of manufactored goods. then greece came along. they, along with 3 allies, stabbed me in the back and send about 20 units of pikemen to take my capital, which they succeded in doing. after this loss, i proceeded to curl up in a ball and cry, vowing to never play again. 10/10 would play again.",2
"let me start by saying, i love this game. but multiplayer is broken with latest patch. it took them 6 years to fix an obvious bug (the trade exploit), and they are only fixing that because the new dlc for civ 5 isnt selling as well as hoped (beyond earth). so i fear how long it will take them to fix this. fix multiplayer. reconnects every 2(approx) turns.",2
"an improved hexagonal movement/combat system as well vastly improved graphics, a new interface, and a diverse technology tree makes this a worthy entry in the civilization series. its not terribly different from previous titles, but the improvements made are welcome, and its just as addictive as ever.",1
"the game makes you the beginning not easy, but when you once figured out how this  works you really get sucked in. its a must-buy title for everyone, not only for round-based strategy games-fans, but for everyone, cause this is the king of all strategy games. oh and take ones time, this will take some hours... trust me, it needs hundreds of thousands of hours to play the most of the game. clear buy recommendation. ps: buy the complete edition. come on its just 10$ or something more and its really worth it. now go and get it!!!!!",1
"this game is my favourite when it comes to the strategy genre. get this with the expansions, especially brave new world and you will quickly have 100+ hours of fun.",6
"i like this game so mutch because it is a strategy game where you go from ancient era to future era. i like that very mutch. there is nothing about the game that i dislikes.",2
"conquering countries? making allies? making armies? going to war? yes this game has it all and much more, being one of the most fun games i played. recommended.",1
"if you give somone 1000 gold they go to war against your country dont give strangers gold kids",1
"amazzing game and good as sid meiers game always 5/5 would play again",1
"best stragedy game out there and so many things to do!",4
"this game is the most stratigic game ever, i give it 10/10 the diplomacy, screens where you talk to other civilizations and you get to interact with theam is flawless and beautiful and dont get me started on the battles, the battles are a bit hard for starters you cant march to theam and win you need lots of troops to surround the city and shoot and bombard theam cause this game is like chess, almost you get to attack and move every 1 turn once u move all your armys, and farmers,. there are many factions to play but i recommen buying brave new world next after this for more factions where talking $60 dollors all togather. so i say if you love stratigic battles and bored games of non stop enjoyment then this game is 100% for you",1
"do not buy this game unless you want to get an addiction!",1
"i lost 4 hours in what seemed to be 15 minutes, what else can i say.",1
"ah civilisation 5, what a good game. been playing every now and then since release. this is the only game where gandi is a nuking warlord. would highly recomend this game to gamers of all ages. one tip when buying as well as buying the bace game also buy dlc as the dlc really makes the game what it is, without the dlc the game can get a bit repetitive. so stop reading this and go buy the god dam thing!",3
"a little time with a little thinking, and the worlds yours.",6
"fantastic update to the civ. franchise. i love the variety that the newly added civs bring to the table.",3
"eight playthroughs later and this game is still just as fun and thought povoking as the first. whether youre a warmongering tyrant, an inovative scientist, or a diplomatic politician, there is something for any style of leader in this game. what makes this game even more exciting is the mod system that was not only intigrated but encouraged. id recommend this game to anyone who enjoy games like stratego, risk, or chess.",1
"oh hell yes! this game will consume your life, but youll love every damn second of it",2
"took over the world as ghandi and nuked everyone. 8/8 m8",1
"great game, has its flaws but makes up for it with its great replayability. its even more fun if you play it with friends.",2
"i pretty sure 90% of the hours ive put in have been on one single game... unit stacking needs to come back but besides that highly recommend.",1
"ive been playing games in the civilization franchise for a long time (since civ 2). this is a great version!",3
"i said i would only play it for a couple of hours to try it, now look at me",1
"just one more turn.. one more.. one.. and then you lose about 5 days of your life. worth.",2
"i loved this game and could not stop playing it for 5 hours then the next day 5 more hours and so on",2
"probably one of the most addicting games i have ever played. i dont know about the new beyond earth coming out here but i guarentee this is the best buy i had in the last 2 years",3
"it is like the best game. you guys gotta get it :d",1
"playing as japan and conquering everything. nuked by gandi would play and get nuked again 11/10",1
"unfortunatly, the programmers of this game are not that good... the game crashes in every lan i have been to. (also done civ4, same thing) not impressed by the brave new world patch either. added lots of junk that doesnt lead to a victory condition and made 2 victory conditions impracticle at a lan party.",1
"perfect installment of a great series. also like the amount of options and classic features they tried to maintain in all the elements of the game.",3
"a truly fantastic game, rich in depth and replay value. if you get anywhere near finishing the steam achievements, your a better person than i!",3
"ive played civilization 3 for years, then about a year ago i got more into games and i got steam. a few months later i got this game, i love the community, the dlcs, and i love the game. civilization has been an amazing game series. i cant wait to see more games like this come out. so check this game out and have fun. (10/10)",1
"just buy it next time its on sale, you wont regret it. well i guess you will regret it when it becomes your second most played game (behind tf2 of course).",5
"i tried to review this game, but i got distracted for five days playing it instead. seriously, civilization should be considered an addictive substance.",1
"there hasnt been a civ game that i havent played. this is one of my most favorite strategy games of all time. countless hours have been played through the years on the series but civ v has promoted itself to a special place in my gaming library. i cannot recommend that game enough. in fact it would be a great game to begin learning on rather than going through each of the other games. there are a few issues with this game though. it is a huge resource hog and will tax your computers hardware. especially after long periods of gameplay. multiplayer sessions can become corrupt and it is recommended to save as often as possible. even with those issue you should get this game. and all the dlc.",3
"i made everyone wear my jeans and listen to my pop, 101/10",1
"really loved this game. the expansions gave it a more deep sense on how the world works. got into mastering the game in my little spare time i got and enjoying the close failures vs. the ai.",4
"from the first time my friend mentioned this game to me i thought it would be crap, so me and my friend did the steam sharing thingy and i tried it out and after half an our of gameplay i realized how fun the game was. some people might disaggre and think it is crap and i can accept that but for people who like strategy games (like me) i would highly recommend this game as it taked time to work out (as you see i have 26 hours of gametime). overall i have to reccomend this game because i think that it is definitely not a waste of 22.00.",1
"one of favorite games, a little crashy at times but still fun!",3
"one of the best strategy games ive played, challenging and fun, but be ready for very long games",2
"became friends with gandhi and didnt get nuked. love it.",1
"its sooo fun! try it out and you wont be disappointed.",8
"this is the game youve been waiting for, even if you didnt wait for it, your soul did. 666/69 illuminati af.",1
"with the gods and kings expansion this game will have a long lifetime. very addictive.",3
"the game is addictive and fun to play. you can easily spend 100 of hours into the game.",5
"this is an amazing strategy game thats fun and will always be challenging your skills",2
"amazing game, missed the civ games after years n this shows they are getting better. spend hours playing a single match n will gladly play more",1
"vanilla civ was a good game, but each additional layer has made meaningful improvements and added delightful depth leading to a full version that is a great game.",8
"the game is a time sink not because its fun, but because the game is slow and takes an hour for what would have been a minute in an rts. the game is polished and clean otherwise. but has no keybind and uses arrow key as screen scroll like a god dayum game from 1980s. use wasd like real people, fraxis. its 2014 and theres no excuse. also conceptually the game fails because its always weird to see washington from 5000bc all the way to 2000ad. they should have scrapped the leader idea altogether and gone with the race as identity instead.",1
"a really good grand strategy game. although one round takes a long time to finish, i found none of the time taken to be boring. the many civilizations you can choose from to play as makes this game feel new even after many many hours of gameplay. this is highly recommended for those who enjoy a good strategy game.",1
"my first game, i found 2 ais the names of these are gandhi and atila the hun. we traded and made strong friendships with each other. 20 turns later i saw gandhi had some giant death robots near my border all of a sudden i noticed atila had some submarines with nuclear missiles. in the blink of an eye my people in my capital were screaming and my empire was on fire and i lost my only friends. 10/10 when i see gandhi or atila in my games i now rethink my life, quit civ and start crying",3
"one of the best turn based strategy games ive ever played. it offers a variety of different options and a good challenge both in single and multiplayer.",5
"amazing game! definetly buy if you can, and every dlc they are all awesome. i think that civilization v + dlcs is better then the new civilization: beyond earth, and if the dlcs wont do it, try mods! als epic.",6
"its fun for a little bit.. but then it becomes boring. theres really no skill involved in playing. playing it on the hardest difficulty is a breeze and theres absolutely no challenge to it if you play single player.",1
"you must have enough time to play it but i love it. lol",3
"i typically dont like turned based strategies but there is something wrongfully addictive about this game! you will lose your soul!",1
"the temptation that is a steam sale is too much for one with a will as weak as mine. at first you remember the strategy games you used to play, cnc, starcraft, lotr b4me. you then run the game to get serenaded by its wonderfully, eloquent intro. you then play the tutorial, as this game is more in depth than justin biebers social life. never did i think this game would suck up so many hours of my time. a tutorial, which took me a good 12 hours as i went and read what things do, and think of what i should do depending on the situation. you will learn to hate barbarians, you will learn to hate them, and then you will destroy them. the satisfaction of getting the barbarians away from your capital, and saving your first workers is just too much. if you play this game you will forget what day of the week it is, and realize that you got fired from your job for playing civ 5 for 3 days.",1
"it is a great statergy game, i would recommed to anyone who like to just sit down and play a game as i have played for 6 hours in a row before, in his also good on multiplayer as you can compete with your friends to win the title of great startergy master and overall ruler, i really enjoyed and i hope anyone else who get it does enjoy it to.",1
"really nice game, could play for hours. graphics are nice, learn a bit of sketchy history while you play. has a multiplayer version which is great but after playing for a couple hours the games sometimes break and go out of sync and start crashing.",1
"its a very good strategy game that any one can play",1
"ive lost more hours than i can count playing this game. want to feel time melt away, start a game and tell youself, ill just play for a few minutes... then realize several hours later its time for bed!",5
"this game is so addicting... just a sec gotta finish my turn first.... its absolutely amazing, its the best game ive ever played :d (to my opinion then)",5
"i would greatly recomend this game for anyone who enjoys turn based strategy games. youll find yourself addicted to it in a matter of minutes, trying to become the worlds most cultural and military dominate empire. if you are not a patient person however you probably will not enjoy this game, because it takes alot of waiting and planning before you make your next move.",2
"once, it was about 11 oclock on a saturday. i had just finshed downloading civ v the night before, so i decided i would play it. i just kept on playing and playing until i got tired. i thought wow, it feels like ive been playing for 4 hours! i should take a break. so i turned off the game and checked the time. it said 5:34 am. i had just played for 18 hours sraight without eating. 9/10",1
"lost actual sleep over worrying about beating russia to the uranium and claiming world dominance. came up empty and was nuked to shreds. 10/10 would toss and turn again.",6
"after many hours of play i can say this game ruined my life.",2
"pretty good game. some games can take 5+ hours to complete if you really get into it, which is nicer than it sounds.",1
"this game is somewhat enjoyable, but with its frequent crashes (just about every 5 minutes) and multitude of bugs, i would call it a waste of money. also, the steam forum for this game is full of people saying that they are experiencing these crashes. it may have something to do with windows 8.1.",1
"great game. started playing at 12pm. when i stopped it was 11 pm. just dont play before anything important then you will be fine.",1
"if you have a life and buy this game, youre gonnna have a bad time.",6
"surprisingly addictive game, extremely diluted grand strategy fit for newcomers to the genre/idiots. if you play games like crusader kings avoid, but if your coming from games like call of duty or starcraft this might be for you. wait nvm ghandi just nuked my capital brb",1
"great turn-based strategy game with beautiful graphics and tons of neat dlcs. if your computer has the power to run this, i would highly recommend it.",1
"kill that scumbag ghandi before he nukes you, trust me, he will. 10/10",4
"brilliantly designed game with a great multiplayer feature and, while heavy, the game barely every crashes or stops responding. i highly recommend it, but only if you have some friends to play it with. theres no problem with the singleplayer, but it gets boring after a while and i rarely finish a single player game because they take forever and you lose interest around half-way through. still a great game, and sid meier is held very highly in appreciation for this series.",9
"this installment of the civilization franchise has the best gameplay you will find in any civilization game. guiding an empire from fledgling tribal city into world spanning empire is amazing, and does not get stale, even over many iterations of founding and building nations. excellent graphics help add to the game, and the fact that leonard nimoy does loads of voicework in the game is great. overall, highly recommend the game and the expansion packs for it, including gods & kings, and brave new world, which add new civilizations, scenarios, and units that keep the game interesting.",4
"a lot of fun and a big time sink. it needs a clock in game so i stop playing until 6am.",1
"oh my god, i cant recommend this game enough! whether you like strategies in general or not, civ 5 is extremely easy to learn and addictively fun as hell. you shall not regret the purchase!",2
"spent 6 hours playing one match with friends... then everyone got bored and went to sleep. 10/10 would kill my time again.",1
"the civilization series is on that i always come back to when i get bored with the latest and greatest game. its one of the few remaining series that knows what it does best. i am really enjoy playing this game.",1
"this game is just like the movie lincoln...really boring and goes on for ing ever.",1
"brilliant gameplay, challenging when you could face off huge armies against many countires countless armies. strategic tree-advancement depending on how you like winning the game. love the aspects like creating a religion that would ensure a diplomatic win and such.",3
"very fun game to play on both singleplayer and multiplayer. great strategy game that allows you to test different scenarios that you choose to craft. highly recommended to you guys!",5
"warning!: this game will break all of your friendships",2
"an excellent game that you will revisit time and time again. great to play with friends playing with them or against them. the expansions make a good amount of difference to the gamelplay, so much that i find myself unable to enjoy playing the standard version of civilization v! i would recommend getting the gold edition whilst the game is on sale, and then purchasing brave new world on top. there are some issues with bugs, including; the game reloading in online games, sometimes when you save a multiplayer game and rejoin there was an issue with not getting the right civ and other small anoiances. overall this is a great game, especially those new to the 4x genre, like i was. the ui is easy great, the mechanics are enjoyable and the game feels very polished. i woulkd recommend this game to anyone!",3
"if you plan on playing this game on a mac, save yourself the trouble and find something else. there is a serious bug on mac which presents itself with all the symptoms of memory mismanagement (both the leak kind and attempting to access deallocated memory). do your due diligence and perform a few web searches to see for yourself the responsiveness of the game developers to the aforementioned issue. this is really unfortunate as ive played this game on a windows machine and it was a beautiful game.",1
"ive put more time into this game than most so id say im qualified to write this. i really enjoy the gun attachments and the killstreaks. however, the nudity is very excessive and overblown. id rather jerk off my grandfather sometimes.",1
"reallly fun if you like turn based stragedy games this is for you pick it up or get the complete edition comes with both expansions and all dlc",2
"sic game blud. terrible to play with friends as it takes forever to finish as people always leave. like joe. yeah thanks a bunch joe.",2
"such a fun addicting turn-based strategy game. its very indepth with all the different civilization leaders and their different playstyles.",2
"you can nuke george washington as augustus caesar. :)",1
"fun strategic game but takes too dang long to complete a single civlization/game.",1
"this is the best action, comedy on steam!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"it is a very detailed game and even if you think you are a pro player you will still learn tons of new things that will improve your skils. btw never play it before going to sleep or you will end playing it by the time when you should wake up (when your lucky)!!",1
"what a fantastic standout from this newist addition to the best strategy franchise in history. so many things to do. it is also the most replayable game i have played.",6
"as a big fan of the civ series, i like all the improvements civ v brings to the game. the expansions add some of the features from civ iv that i missed in the original release like religion and spying and i enjoy the rebalancing in brave new world. still, even the vanilla version is fun.",5
"great game, but it has taken over my life! i just cant put it down.",1
"i cant spend just an hour playing this - every time i play, its always a large chunk of time, and its always worth it. 10/10.",1
"its a good game, aka good setup,good gameplay and.....yeah,just play it already will ya",1
"a great game for stratgey fans, civ 5 on its own is much simpler than civ 4 so fans of the series will not like it however all the issues are addressed in both dlcs and they and a tone of content!!",2
"this is my gateway 4x game. ever since i started playing this, ive been delving deeper into the genre that previously i didnt even know existed. this may be simplified compared to others, but its perfect for people who are new and curious about what all this civilizations and turn based 4x games are about.",3
"best strategy simulator out there. the dlc makes brilliant changes to gameplay. highly recommended",2
"great game to play with friends. couldnt ask for a smarter time wasting game.",1
"10/10 would buy again (if for some strange reason steam doesnt exist in the future)",2
"very fun game to play, if you are into a turn-based strategy game that can take up to hours to complete. then civilization v is the game for you. you can choose different paths to win the game, if its increasing your culture or researching new technologys you will always be watching your back for other civilizations who might attack you out of jealousy or hate. very addictive game that can keep you entertained for hours, a must buy strategy game.",2
"this is one of the best games ever made of its kind, you can it play for hours without getting bored. i recommend this game to everyone who is interested in a well made strategic game. it offers enough to keep you interested wether you play it alone or with friends.",1
"fun, quite easy to learn strategy game. the game is fun in singleplayer, but becomes so much better in multiplayer where you can destroy all of you friends wonderful cities :d, also the dlc are must have because they bring so much more to the base game!",2
"great game to play with others or even solo just watch out for just one more turn syndrome. that one more turn can cost you hours! go buy it and play it!",2
"i only just got this game, honestly did not think i would like it, 6 hours past and realised i was addicted. just look at other peoples reviews and see how long they have played it, that should pretty much sum up how good it is.",1
"i played this game for hours!!! one of the best 4k games i have ever played + it is one of the best strategy games! i recommend it to everyone",2
"this game is probably the most in-depth ive gotten to playing a real civilization. some of the ai is weird, but its sucked me in and takes a long time afterward to process how my civilization grew and fell.",4
"its really fun. i dont think its fun without the gods and kings dlc. (havent gotten it yet but looking forward to it). there are many achievements as well.",5
"firaxis and 2k are becoming my new favourite game studios, very much thanks to civ v and xcom... this is one of the most complete games ive ever played.",1
"fun strategy game. played as america, started my town st. penisberg, and built up a massive civ. after being buttraped by barbarians, i used my buttrape tactics and surrounded their camps with ships. 10 intestine punishing barbarbian buttrapes out of 10",1
"backstabbing political simulator a must buy. 10/10 would play again",2
"warning: playing this game may cause loss of time, unnatural hatred towards gandhi, and the general distrust of every one around you. enjoy!",1
"the biggest time drain since taking a dump. youll pop in for a quick match then be playing the same match for the next 32 hours. during the time you will love and cry and finally achieve victory. you will stand victorious above all the nations you crushed on your way here and you will stop and think i could do this. then your political carreer begins. vote drtuv 2020",1
"this game was expensive, time consuming, and destroyed friendships bc my friends and i suck big weens (especially andrew bagel beard) 8/40 would double blaze squad wulf gang",1
"really great game guys. look into buying it if your into strategy games!",2
"its horrible, it ruined my life, it sucks. 10/10 would definetly recommend.",1
"this game is way too addicting. one... more... turn...",1
"i was playing a simple game. my ma came and asked: how long have you been here? 5min. and now is ing 2 am, you started playing it at 8 pm, so you call this 5min?! time killer.10/10.",1
"really good turn based stragety game, live europia in terms of potential difficulty, but ith a faster pace. you can change to game to the point where the settings are enjoyable for example cranking up the game pace, or if you like to play europia style slow it down.",2
"an absolutely amazing game to play, and its great to just get lost in for hours at a time.",5
"amazing game with tons of content , literally thousands of hours. only problem with the game is the erradic ai. diplomacy in the game is essentially useless and a buggy multiplayer. 9.8/10",3
"awesome game! not as much micromanagement as civ iv but for me that is a good thing.",2
"likes and dislikes are the same: this game is like crack. you start playing and bam! 10 hours have gone by. now youre starving and have to pee, but you just cant leave the game long enough to do either. its always just one more turn.",1
"this game has stolen hundreds of hours of my life from me- and i dont regret a single minute. :)",8
"look all i want to do is play the games i purchased not deal with steam bull",3
"you too, montezuma! does our friendship mean nothing?!",1
"this game is extremly fun, but each game can take hours to complete. its worth every second. it is a fun and dynamic single or multiplayer strategy game!",1
"awesome sequel to the civ series. youll find yourself up till all hours of the night just one more turn!!!",2
"its awesome, by far ive logged more hours n this game than any other. no matter what i can always sit down and play a game of civ.",8
"fun. time wasting fun. havent slept for days. gandhi is a mutherwarmonger. destroy him asap or face anger in the most horrific ways. highly recommend, but only when gandhi is defeated. 10/10, but only when gandhi is dead. fuc him and napoleon.",1
"an excellent strategy and conquest game, completely worth the 20$.",2
"very engaging and deep. perpare to spend a lot of time immursed in its world when you first pick it up!",3
"love this game. a mix of strategy, politics, bullying and trade. what more could you ask for?",4
"if this game was a potato, it would be a good potato. 8/8",2
"engrossing turn-based empire-builder with simultaneous-turn multiplayer, an excellent game.",2
"this game is very time consuming but you meet tons of new people, and develop skills like strategies, and diplomatic abilities, this game is like life, risk, chess, and facebook all thrown in a blender to get this game.",2
"this game gave me trust issues. f*ck you, egypt and arabia! 10/10 would play again",1
"this game is amazing! its kind of like total rome and has a feel of settlers catan! such a fun game; everytime i play i always lose track of time hahaha!",1
"play as gandhi, nuke washington back to the stone-age on the penultimate turn. (that smug er.)",4
"classic game, the fifth iteration is by far the best! after a bit shaky 4, the fifth take on the immortal classic by sid meier hits the sweet spot. not only is it gorgeous, smooth, and well-designed graphically, but it offers a great variety of features and complexity which does not feel forced. recommend to play with both addons available to date. gods and kings was not particularly good when it came out, felt a bit early and not ready. the second addon though fixed all of the problems, while expanding those that felt a bit lacking. if you got that turn-based-itch, look no further than this game =)",1
"great game and already addicted. i would recommend the full package for the full experience.",2
"civilization v has given me a new hope for strategy games. as a person who has had little experience with previous civ games, i can say that it was still easy to pick up and roll with. all-in-all, the game isnt complex, but has many complexities working within it. from happiness of your citizens, to the amount of gold your making, everything you do is an important decision. i liked the idea of spying on other civs while protecting yourself from other civs spies. this game will give you a new patience for movement and decision making when trying to make your civilization dominant.",1
"excellent turn based strategy game, i have been playing this series since civ 3 and it is one of the most addictive games ever!",3
"in these reviews: clever epic maymays. abandon all hope ye who dont like to jerk each other off endlessly want to recreate the sacking of rome as... pachacuti?? well now you can! thanks to (yet another) fantastic game from sid meier and firaxis, the vanilla game has just about all you could want to do and yet each dlc expansion pack (gods and kings and brave new world) add enough for basically a whole new game. after all expansions have been purchased you get such luminaries as george washington of america, mahatma gandhi of india, theodora of byzantium... you know the wife of emperor justinian i, and gustavus ing adolphus of switzerland say whaa? and if those arent enough, there are a seemingly endless amount of mods in the steam workshop",3
"civ v is a fun game, but be sure not to take anything the wrong way. this game tends to ruin friendships. xd",1
"my advice is to just go for the full game with all of the add ons. adds pretty nifty features to the game and makes it more complete. although to me, i think that they purposely gave us half the game and left the rest as add ons for us to pay more money. meh.",1
"hardcore strategy freeks this is a must buy but i cant recomand this for anyone else youll be irritated by its pacing and how nearly every match becomes a battle for who can aquire the most uranium.",4
"one more turn well that turns into 4 more turns which turns into im really getting tired of you eyeballing me like that england.....the world descends into war, and if youve done it right, you rule the world. you never quite know what youre gonna get and early on you just might get quick attacked and well game over these dudes with junky swords and no armor just wrecked your only city and thats it, all that is left of you is what will be in the archaeological records. im a firm believer of spreading like the plague in this game, then once everyones mad about you grabbing up all the land, build an army and enact your own manifest destiny, the others will either fall in line or theyll talk smack about you and spy on you giving you an excuse to go after them....this game....just buy it!",3
"very addicting game, albeit historically inaccurate. the engaging gameplay makes up for ghandis rampant expansionalism",2
"great game. just when you think youre doing good the three leaders youve been trading with declare war on you and pillage you.",1
"this game is brilliant. the problem with turn based games is that they can get a bit dull if done poorly. civ 5 does a great job, really only with bnw (brave new world), which is not a point in its favor. however even without bnw this game has enough tension in combat to keep me hooked.",5
"lost hours of my life to this game in a matter of 2 weeks.",3
"just stick with civ 4 this game has had all the fun and magic sucked out by ghandi who whoever. but seriously something in this just doesnt work you dont feel like your civ is in any way special the removed some of the best elements of civ 4 and while progess is always great this is going in the wrong direction. simplied and terrible felt like the xbox revolutions game",1
"this game is fun exiting as i am a fan of strategy gammes civ is my favorate",4
"a brilliant strategy game for loooong and many nights ;-).",1
"easly one of the most time consuming games out there but so fun with friends!",1

"life cannot exist without death, and possible world war iii scenarios could not exist without civ v.",1
"so mnay hundreds of hours, greatest game in all history up to its own time",4
"nice game, you gotta put down a lot of time to be pro, end game for pro player isnt that fun :(",4
"this game sure eats a lot of time but the satisfaction it gives is remarkable! since gods and kings the complexity and challenge is greatly improved. a must if you enjoy this sort of thing!",4
"ive been playing the civ franchise from the start, and this is another fine addition to the line.",2
"one of the best strategic games i have played ever",2
"definetly finer graphics then 4 and alot more interesting options plays slightyl differently but gods and kings is a fine addition",1
"civilization v is a fantastic game for the turn-based gamer inside everyone. filled with content to the brim and great dlc expansions, this game is a must own.",1
"everytime an expansion/content/mod come out, i have to consider divorce from my wife ( or better saying, she consider it :p ) this game is the only game that can be add to addicting drugs list. really cant stop play, a turn after another. problaby the only game (after civ iv) that i will play forever and ever.",2
"a very simplistic sequel to the civilization series, but thats not a bad thing. the game is gorgeous and although a lot of the micromanagement between your cities has been removed, combat is a much more enjoyable experience with a hex-based grid and the inability to stack units. ive yet to play brave new world, but gods and kings is a very worthwhile addition to the game, as well.",2
"not good game do not buy its nothing like real world cant even play as the obama wtf? if riot made this game u could play as the obama but not this game! i think that civ5 really missed the ball on this one better luck next time in civ 6 gl also dont buy dont forget.",1
"civ v, as it is called, is definitely one of the best strategy games out there. it is perfect for both newcomers to the genres of strategy and turned-based games, and experienced players as well. there is not an intimidating learning curve, and there are plenty of mods and dlc adding new nations, and other little goodies. the dlcs also bring a unique bit with the addition of tourism and religion. the game can be a bit of a challenge, especially on higher difficulties or on certain missions, or scenarios as the game refers to them as. the game is also barely taxing on a computer system and runs fine with nice graphics and a friendly interface, with very minimal bugs and mistakes. from tribals hiding in a tiny village, to building a mega empire spanning the world, this game is sure to be fun for anyone who is a fan of, or looking to get in to, strategy games. 10/10",3
"ive had it ever since it came out and it is still one of my favorite games of all time. bnw is awesome and g&k is also awesome.",3
"-bad game engine optimization -bad a.i. -tech tree is not as good as civ 4 -spock has a better voice -lazy patch work -2k -bad civ personalities -trend of removing game content for dlc for a extra overpriced amount. like we dont know. -denouced by all for being peaceful -not alpha centauri 2 +good graphics +good hud display +raging barbies should always be checked +fun multiplayer options +good background music +moddable if you can get the complete edition for cheap i recommend it at 5 or 10 $$$",3

"great game as long as you have paitence and dont quit like 20mins into the game. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- gods & kings is a great expansion adding religon, new units, new civs, espionage, new buildings, new tecs. five stars sid meier much better than the clustered insanity of alpha centari.",3
"170+ hours on record and at least an extra 100 off record from before, so yea; this game is a lot of fun if youre into strategy games, but be prepared to spend countless nights awake at your pc taking just one more turn",2
"an amazing board game style video game with a bit of history. the graphics and gameplay are both high-quality by far! i love the ai interaction. no matter how you look at it, it is a great game! i highly reccomend playing it, and you can just do soooo much with it. you can never really predict the outcome until it arrives!",2

"not a leaping improvement on civ iv, how can you even do that? what civ v does is take another look at it. beautiful gameplay and style. would recommend it not only to any civ fan, but to any strategy game fan. a must buy.",1
"do you know that feeling when you lead your civilization and become the greatest in the world? its awesome.",3
"finally up to snuff after the brave new world dlc. worth another look if you havent played since the original launch.",1
"one of the best game i ever played! you sure need to buy this game.",1
"love this game, you say to yourself, one more turn but then it becomes 20 then 100, the only advice i have is to not trust gandhi",1
"great for those who like a game where the key to winning is either brute strength or working with other civilizations and you get to see some special things that history may not teach you",1
"highly addicting game.. keep telling myself just one more turn o_o very fun and highly recommended",2
"i have enjoyed playing civilization. if you get this game multiplayer is a lot better than singleplayer. it is a must get game",1
"this game is addicting, the only thing i wish they would fix is increased movement and range as you advance through the ages",3
"why cant i stop playing civ v? someone, please, make me stop playing civ v.",5
"seemed boring at first, but then i actually started to play it it slowly became more intense as i built my first death robot, i was like wtf.11,,1. on a serious note really good game, recomend getting gold version, (i thought i bought it but apparently not)",1

"good game with clear graphics, it works on my comr even though its fairly old.",1
"i barely even played before it quit working. tried 20 or more reinstalls, your steam server constantly loses communications, it i did get it loaded it would say unable to load something or another. constant issues. cant even play in offline mode anymore. a great game turned to crap.",1
"i cant stand this game. i have no idea how to play it. it is hard. do not recommend because it confuses me alot.",1
"every single time when i want to play this game lhasa is near me... 11/10 would play again to war against lhasa",1
"an awesome game well worth buying if you have the time to play and are wanting of a challenge.",3
"actually one of the best games on steam there is worth your money",2
"addicting strategic gameplay that we keep you involved through all ages of civilization.",2
"this game is absolutely amazing. incredible amount of replayability and extremely engaging. only down side is you can easily lose track of time while playing it.",9
"one of the best games ever, and its better than ever...",2
"while not a grand strategy game on a par with paradoxs stuff, it will still scratch any itch you have for turn-based strategy. you will also sink more hours into it than youre proud of (you will be a little proud).",1
"addictively fun with streamlined options for faster gameplay with the civ feel.",5
"this game is worth the buy, i have never played such a game like it. it is just amazing",1
"my civilization established the internet before learning to throw  at grass to make it grow faster. 10/10",1
"one of the greatest games of all time, a true masterpiece. it manages to harness the wonder and awe or human history whilst presenting it in a ridculously fun game. 10/10",7
"exactly as intense/relaxing as you want it to be; and the modding community is great. would be much better if one could utilize the mods online.",5

"awesome game ! true to the civilization series. a must buy!",3
"running out of holidays as i have to book days off for one game perfect game for people who are immortal or possess several lifetimes to play 10/10 recommended!",1
"an absolutely addictive game that will keep you entertained for many hours. build up your civilisation as you expand into new territories, making friends and foes alike. using its simple turn-by-turn basis, your actions will shape the future of your empire. there are many ways to win, and that is the beauty of this game - there is no set path you have to take. if youre the type of person that likes to wage war on others then you can win by military strength. if you prefer more peaceful ways, you can win by achieving a cultural victory. or if youre keen on winning via scientific means, be the first to have the parts needed for space exploration.",2
"great game with many strategy elements. its a ton of fun, and totally worth the price.",4
"the only advice i will give you is never trust gandhi. the man is a .",2
"good game that you can spend hours on, especially if you have the add ons, and the mods",2
"failed couple of courses at college, but at least restored mongolia to its former glory",2
"i could easily lose my entire life to civ. makes for strange conversations trying to explain to people whats happening, so worth it.",1
"an amazing strategy game for newcomers and civ veterans alike! theres so much customization available in this game. if thats not enough for you, theres some great stuff in the workshop that the communitys made. really great, addicting game!",1
"very fun, it is an interesting game. you should get it if you like strategy games. to the average player, it might get a little boring though",1
"ill make it quick. before you start a game, make sure you have done everything that needed to be done during the day before you begin. 12 hours of play time will feel like an hour and next thing you know its 6 in the morning and you need to leave for work in 15 minutes.",2
"one of the best turn-based strategy game ever made. truely 10/10",1
"this game is very interesting and addicting. many aspects of this game are from history and you are the one making it. it is also educational and fun to mess around on.",1
"a great turn base game with many different civilizations to choose from. you will spend hours and hours on just one game. its endless fun that will never end. make sure to have a good strategy though.",1
"solid game with approachable curve, but needs dlc to achieve same levels of depth as previous games",3
"amazing game! spent a ton of time on it. one of my most played game as well. :p the expansions are very worth it adds a lot of extra depth to a game that is already extremely deep.",8
"civ 5 is a brilliant game. it provides hours of fun and entertainment, takes some time getting used to but when you do you wont stop playing for a while.",1
"great game with the expansions. very gamey, not simulationist. needs more mods.",3
"the dull technology is anti-historical .every nation has similar tech .you are mongols of steppes -no problem . you can still build lighthouse of alexandria or collosus of rhodes -both monuments strictly made by very prosperous sea-faring nations. it is ridiculous . further more you can not set era when you want to halt the advancement. i dont feel playing modern era ,but i can not do nothing about it . even more the scenarios are awful . some of them as short as only 70 turns long. they simple threw some uncooked pseudo historic technology into the pot because it would take few dollars !!! to give every nation the tech it really could have access before the modern era. there are lot of people whoo does not care about anything for them this game is perfect . if you feel like doubtful about central american civilisations having cavalry or other nonsense then this game is not for you.",1
"i can easily play this game for hours. it is beautiful.",1
"great game for multiplayer and single player. love this so much, so many options to play and difficulty settings. wide variety of ways to set up the game too.",1
"i love this game. i cant really get enough of it. i never really got into the earlier civ games for a multitude of reasons, but i love this one. i dont necessarily think its better than the earlier ones, but i hit a tipping point somewhere in there. its incredibly accessible, and has hundreds of hours of gameplay locked away inside it. its challenging and deeply engaging, with tiers upon tiers of difficulty and an insane amount of replayable content. this game is deep and complex, and there is a lot to do and learn, and it will reward you every step of the way.",5
"very nice game i highly recommend this game!!!!!!!",1
"civilisation v is a quite complex (and lengthy) strategy game. if you are into strategy games and have several hours to kill, then civ v is my prefered game of choice. despite what you may hear, even the worst of computers can run civ. however the problem with civ v is that for it to be a decent game you need to get dlc. i personally suggest saving up about 30-40 and buying all the dlc in the summer sale, where it is much cheaper.",2
"this game is great for people who are looking for a long strategy game to play. very indept and very enjoyable.",2
"has to be the best civ game of ll time, well done sid",1
"the previous games of the civilization franchise are some of the better games available on pcs, and this latest iteration is no different. in concept, its no different from the previous four games but some new additions - including a significant revamping of the combat model - and excellent graphics make civ5 worth a look. but beware; it is as addictive as ever and every time i play i end up going for just one more turn into the wee hours of the morning.",1
"this game can be summed up in one phrase: one more turn! so addictive that this one quote will be repeated so many times you wont even notice. awesome graphics, animations and soundtrack and one of the few games that not only welcomes but encourages the use of mods, adding massive amounts of gameplay to a game that already can give hundreds of hours of entertainment on its own.",3
"this is the best slow paced strategy game i have ever played.",2
"buy this game and all of the dlc! a ton of fun and totally worth every cent! the more to play this with, the better it gets!",2
"if i can not have the original microsoft age this is all i am left with",1
"excellent, although without g&k and bnw, civ 5 feels more like a demo.",1
"the best turn-based strategy game of all time. period.",1
"make sure you do not buy the original game on its own. buy the game bundle with all the dlc. far more worth it and you save a lot of money in doing so. buy the original game and the dlc separately is a major rip off.",1
"this is great game that will suck you in and make you spend hours at a time. brave new world heavily recommend for full experience.",3
"streamlined for fast fun, the most approachable civilization yet.",3
"very good game that gives you the chance to establish a nation to stand the test of time. conquer the world or dominate it culturaly. wich ever way you go a fantastic ride to glory",1
"great way to lose an afternoon. its always just one more turn",5
"my most played game on steam. im playing this til some good beyond earth dlcs get released",2

"very awesome game , the gameplay is fantastic , must buy this! its very fun",1
"dominated the world as ethiopia with banana exports through the roof 10/10",1
"this game is highly addicting and insanely fun. 1000/10. advised to buy on sale as its pricey as fudge.",1
"i know people have some gripes with this game, but with the new expansion packs this game could be one of the funnest turn based strategies out there. its very unique and a very fun game to play at a lan party. i recommend this game.",2
"sid meiers civiliation? the hell is that. its a bunch of contrys you can choose from. and you progress by makeing treedies with other (mpcs) (or real players) contrys to fight in war to win. to win you either have to take over every contry, get to the moon. im sure theres other ways but im not positive on everyone. i recomend this game for these reasons",1
"great game if you have many hours to play. everything about it is what you can expect from a sid meier game and more.",1
"so i playin fullscreen, and i cant see my clock. in other words, i planed on playing for another 5 minutes one night, ended up playing for another 4 1/2 hours",1
"sunk most of my playtime in one sitting. addictive, fun game that i had to uninstall so i could do something productive for the day.",1
"lots of fun, highly recommended to anyone with a bit of patience and a willingness to figure stuff out :)",1
"me and civilization go way back and to be honest, this installation didnt speak to me at once. it is far less advance then the fourth and that can be a disappointment for some old timers like me. but if u give it time you will see that the new battle-system makes this a much more enjoyable combative experience than any in the series. a must buy for everyone, experience players will awe, after some time. new players will find this much more enjoyable then the fourth.",2
"brilliant! this game is one of the best games i have ever played, and certainly the best strategy game! if you can, i reccomend getting the brave new world dlc, as it helps create the true spirit of civ, and should not be ignored!",1
"took one look at the artwork/graphics and said nah. and that was that for a long time. i eventually gave in to all the hype when it was on sale and omfg, its only like the best grand strategy ive ever played! entire days have been happily lost since.",1
"i would greatly recomend this game for anyone who enjoys turn based strategy games. youll find yourself addicted to it in a matter of minutes, trying to become the worlds most cultural and military dominate empire. if you are not a patient person however you probably will not enjoy this game, because it takes alot of waiting and planning before you make your next move.",2
"i have seen some negative reviews on this game. ignore them! this game is awesome! get it and all the expansions and dlc and you will not regret it. have a great day!",2
"its the best turn-based strategy game ive played so far. 20 years of gaming. anything better than this is going to blow my mind. $30 is a fair price. youll find yourself coming to this game for years. for me, this is a game ill play with friends until were all dead (in rl).",1
"the game that makes you king of the world (if you so deisre) just watch out for gandhi and his nukes.",7
"great rts that has different ways to win. deffinatily would see myself investing many hours into this game.",2
"as a loooong time civ player i was a little underwhelmed by the inital civ v offering, though it was a good base. but with the first expansion it achieves a lof the potential i had hoped for. awesome game, theres a reason so many people are always playing it.",3
"this installment keeps you playing turn after turn till midnight. ;) seriously, once i start, i cant stop...its that good.",1
"this game is probably the best strategy game i have ever played. its extremely fun with friends, and its not too difficult to understand while still being somewhat complex. i think it deserves its metascore rating of 90. however, it crashes on me frequently. so frequently that i may have to reload 20-30 times in order to play a single game. after researching this problem, its apparently common in the steam version.",1
"it seems like every time i play a game of civ v or watch someone else play a game, it comes up with its own interesting, emergent storyline. whats going to happen this time? does gandhi beat queen elizabeth in a naval battle off her coast? does president washington, after eras of wresting control of north america from the other natives finally go east in search of the fabled new lands known as europe? who would win if genghis khan were to fight shaka of the zulu? these are some of the amazing stories you will get to see and be a part of in this game.",2
"can lose yourself in gameplay for hours with many interesting scenarios to play out or create for yourself. very nice graphics and soundtrack. go for it.",2
"got nuked by ghandi, ending my 5-hour peaceful victory attempt. would recommend.",1
"great game but has a steep learning curve. dont turn on the tips; theyre the most annoying ing things ever.",1
"games like this dont really need reviews do they? everyone who likes this kind of game already owns it and has 100+ hours on it.",4
"handsdown my favorite game on steam... im always up for a game of civ v. do you like history? youll love civ v... you hate history? you can change it in civ v. its like the best game ever... its the best game... its the best... trust me... youll love it.",8
"civ 5 is a excellent contuination of an amazing rts game. although some games can feel like they go on forever, it is still an amazing game to sink your time into",2
"super addictive game! im glad i finally decided to purchase!",1
"civ 5 is a great game if you have tons of time to pour in or very little, one of the few games i love recomending.",3
"the game is fantastic. i do wish that it were possible for steam workshop to work for people who have civ 5 on the mac. other than that, one of my all time favorite games.",3
"i played the original civilization. this one is a great improvement. the additional choices for victory allow the player to tailor the victory conditions to his or her playing style. this means if you enjoy management over combat you can play a game that suits your style. the ability to switch leaders also helps. so the game can work for either style",8
"every want to take over half a continent, or name all your cities tick? in this game you can, as you strategise on the plan for your civilization, wether it is building the notre dame or conquering every civilization in sight. it is rather hard to finish a game, one game can last for hours. i rate this 8 curries out of 10 curries",1
"i cannot recommend this game enough. unless youre planning to get civilization beyond earth, you must own this game.",4
"great game! immersive content, and very fulfilling. games last long sometimes, and are really fun if its a rainy day and you have nothing to do!",1
"must-buy strategy game this game, when it has all the dlcs is way too addicting, and is a blast to play through your own alternate history. its way too easy to spent 8+ hours simply building up your own empire, and then several more in a devestating war for more land. only buy this game if it is with all the dlcs, particularly brave new world, because the dlcs add some great features that the base game missed. just buy the complete edition really. right now.",3
"i just finished my first game after playing another turn. great game!",4
"this game really makes you lose track of time. fun and very addicting!",1
"once you start it up, say goodbye to your free time. you feel like quitting it, and youre like, one... more... turn... and that goes on forever. 10/10 would play for 24 hours straight again.",1
"when civ5 first came out a lot of civ fans cried foul and stayed with 4. with the first expansion though, theres no reason to. the interface is better, its visually appealing, got pretty much all the same features 4 had and its easier to jump into while still being just as complex if you want it to be. if youve been holding out on civ5 because you liked the older ones too much, hold out no more. a great game whether youre a fan of the series of just love strategy games in general. even if you dont, this is a great place to start.",1
"if you want a time machine; this game is perfect. you can launch the game at the start of the day and being called for dinner not long after.",1
"i thought i wouldnt like this game because it was turned based but i loved it in the end , and i think it the best turn base game out there! if your a stragety gamer i definetely recommend this game!",1
"ghandi nuked the  out of me. 10/10 would get nuked again.",3
"with the bnw expansion the game is now very deep and enjoyable. there are many different and well-balanced paths to victory. as someone who started playing civ 2, it has taken me awhile to adjust to civ 5. they may have the same names but they are fundmentally different games. in one the key to win was near constant expansion and the creation of doom stacks. civ 5 is pleasantly different. pros: culture system is finally come into its own ai is no longer horrible at war all systems well balanced and thoughtful stratagy is rewarded cons: the non-cheating ai (prince) is still not nearly as good at the gam e as any human",2
"i would really like to point out three main features of this game: 1. destroys your gpa 2. reconfigured mods every time you go back to main menu 3. crashes when good things are about to happen overall 6.9/10, would play again.",8
"the only game that, through the workshop, i can play as stalin and go up against the likes of an archdemon and adolf hitler. 10/10",1
"the ultimate strategy with a huge modding community in steam workshop, if thats your thing. although military victories are ht major type of its kind, the customisation of scenarios and world types are very impressive. leaders are also a great part of it, both historical and comical at the same time. one could describe it as a a chess game(due to hexagonal movements) with more then 2 players and 1000x the amount of complexity. yet the game is still extremely accessible and , well for me, easy to understand. despite this, i recommend to have some experience in strategy games, such as xcom or total war. but if not, there is no better time nor place to start then right here ,right now",2
"there are a lot of systems to learn, but once you start to understand them the game is a lot of fun to play.",1
"sid meiers civilization v is an excellent game with endless replayability. if you enjoy turn-based strategy games or enjoy the concept of the civilization series, this game is for you.",3
"all the perks of running a tyrannical dictatorship without the inevitable assasinations and civil wars!",2
"addictive, replayable, fun and great to play with friends... easily becoming one of my fast favorites",1
"if you plan on getting this game, be warned, you will spend hours and hours of your time playing civilization v. it is so addictive, and has huge replayability, with 5 different victory types, and over 20 different civilizations to play as. definatly of my favorite games ever, 11 out of 10.",2
"i think i liked 4 more but this game does a lot of things differently enough to make it interesting and stand on its own. i can say that its something you could play in parralel with theior previous sequel.",1
"its a great game and if you dont like it like my friend belini, then i dont respect your opinion and you can  off!",1
"this game is fantastic. it is very time consuming, but thats not always a bad thing. i strongly recommend it, 9.5/10.",1
"very good game, no real draw backs, only thing i would like to see is the abuility to push other civs boarders back with culture",6
"civ v is not civ iv. but that does not mean that civ v isnt worth playing. the loss of civics, religions, and multiple civ choices is offset by the hex grid, ranged units, and unique civilization traits. i highly reccomend this title, even if sid meier is bleeding us dry with dlc!",5
"this is truly a great game if you are looking for a nice turn based strategy.",3
"great game for those people that are really into strategy and tactics.",1
"very disapointed steamwork shop is not supported with the mac.",2
"this was once a really good game, but due to recent updates the multiplayer now sucks and it cant even go 5 minutes without having to reload (which itself takes 1-2 minutes). to summarize; its a good game... for single player... only!! (as of 11/15/14)",3
"this game is great really recomend it but it is a game where its alot more fun to play with friends rather than by yourself.",3
"ive only started playing the civilization series with iv. that being said this game is by far the best in the series for me at least. no more stacks of doom where you drag around 30 units on a single tile. real strategy during combat takes place and using the terrain is essential to victory. my fav strategy game by far.",5
"i have put 100 hrs into this game and still find new and interesting things. the workshop really adds awesome stuff and makes it even more intricate. i highly recommend giving it a try.",2
"an excellent game that will leave you thoroughly addicted. the amount of times ive said to myself just one more turn is too high to count. if you are a fan of 4x strategy games, civ 5 is a must buy.",6
"i love this game!! cant wait for civ: beyond earth!! i recommend this game to anyone looking to rule the world (not in real life of course). its great fun, and very exciting to strategize in order to get what you need.",2
"incredibly fun and rich of legitimate histortical information.",1
"it is a fun game . . . but only with both expansions.",4
"6 out of 10 great graphics. i am still learning how to play this game i havent figured it all out. it is a lot different than the old civilization games.",1
"great game, good fun and brilliant multiplayer, best with all the dlc.",2
"can play this a thousand times and ways. awesome game.",3
"ripoff of civ:beyond earth 10/collapsed civilization",1
"excellent game, many hours of play time. brilliant turn based strategy, most fun when played with friends. like risk? of course you do, this is longer, more complex and more fun. for more and longer reviews go to",2
"with the brave new world expansion civ5 is probably the best turn based strategy game i have ever played.",1
"100 hours played and made it to the end only 2 times...",1
"civilization is just one of those games where you waste your intire life.if you ever wanna pass the time you should play it!it is a strategy game where you choose a civilization and try to beat the game via science,domination,culture,diplomatic or time (no-one likes time cause its cheap) victory.enough talk if you wanna learn the game,play the game!!!",3
"ive put 433 hours into this game at this moment, and plan to put many more. 11/10, would waste a half of a month of my life again.",5
"the game itself is great, but its a big longer pasted than other strat games ive played. and you run through things very quickly without the dlc. if you pick it up. do yourself a favor and pick up the gold version.",1
"legendary. worth every cents, specially since i got it from humble bundle :)",1
"this game is another brilliant edition of the civ franchise. plenty of dlc, plenty of different countries and victory types. this game will suck you in and spit you out after playing it for 13 hours straight.",7
"because of this game i have had many sleepless nights, many aggressive verbal onslaughts with virtual people, and made me feel like i could conquer the world. this game has taken up literal days of my life and occupied my time more in class than actually learning, it is more addicting than morphine. highly recommend 15/10",3
"one of the best games i have played. it is addictive and will have you playing for hours straight. as someone interested in history civilization v is great.",3
"i really enjoyed this game. cant wait for beyond earth.",1
"very good and interesting game in which you lead one of the selected states (civilizations). starting from bc and ending the future, you can win in several ways. there is also a team game in which you can play with your friends and find out who the best ruler of you!",1
"good game if you want to destroy nation and take over the world",1
"for those who like strategy games. offers singleplayer and multiplayer. turn based but can be simultaneous actions for each turn. highly recommended.",6
"great strategy game, but it can get repetitive, so the made expasions, but those are over priced. go with the mods.",3
"this isnt game dosnt have the highest played hours in my library for nothing... well maybe its that the game takes days and sometimes weeks to complete... but with infinite play through possibilities its a game one could play constantly... :)",6
"there are no stacks of units, every unit has its place and therefore meaning on the map. and i like that the most in this game. except this civ5 is very user friendly, and by this i dont mean simplicity of the ui only, but also general friendly design of the game. its beautiful. although the original game is all-sufficient, the 2 major dlcs introduced quite a lot of interesting content which organically fits the game mechanics and add a lot to the gamplay while still keeping the simplicity of how things are handled. the only thing i can complain about is a bit strange way of using mods, though the devs fixed it mostly. recommend.",2
"amazing game. very in-depth and great game style. 10/10",1
"i started facism in america while germany was practicing democracy. 97% will approve.",1
"one of the best 4x series and the 5th installment does not disappoint.",1
"great game, keeps you busy for hours and you forget all about your worries. 16 hours in to a game i started friday morning, it is now 1:06am saturday... okay its getting late, just one more tu....oh crap, forgot to pick the kids up from school!",2
"best game to play while doing other things. i have enjoyed this game since the first one came out (used floppy discs to install). play this while miniature painting. love turn based games.",2
"started the cold war with me playing as the us and my friend playing as russia. the only difference was, russia didnt have nukes, and the us had no qualms about using theirs. 9/10 would nuke again.",1
"i think the civilization series is great. overall i give it a 8/10 concept: same as other civilzations, 7/10 gameplay: outstanding at how many options there are! 8/10 graphics: incredable: 10/10 price: waaaaaaaay too pricy,but thats what happens to big company games. wait a couple of years it will go down though.",1
"the first second i got into this game i thought i turned into a racist.",1
"to be honest, i prefered civilization iv until the release of brave new world : this add-on makes the game much better than the original one (or even gods and kings) ! still, the game without any add-on is good, but at least take the gold edition, not so more costly than the basic one. :-)",2
"get this game, lose yo life, hide yo wife, and lol at venice now!",2
"<------ what ive been saying to rival city states.",2
"if you want to play civ 5, suck it up and buy brave new world. it adds the religion system from g&k(you dont the few extra civs) and fixes cultural victories. bnw is what civ 5 should have been on release.",3
"if you like being part of a country that is inadequate in becoming a world superpower, i would recommend this. if you feel adequate and are able to win this game in online multiplayer, then you sir, are a .",1
"amazing game. if you like turn based strategy games this will be for you. games can take hours of your time but when you win them, you feel good ;d",3
"what an excellent game! so happy that this was brought to linux! sid meier is a genius...",6
"got this game when it was 75% off for like 12.74$ and it was totally worth it. spent the last 2 days on 1 game. def worth a lot of replay value with all the dlc that was included.",1
"rather honestly, this is my favorite game to play. both with and without online players, i love to play. the freedom to do what you wish and the repurcussions of those actions just make the game that much better. plus its not like the third game where you could practically pump out anything you needed, but the computers could always pump out more troops to you no matter what.",2
"civilization v is horrifically addictive in the best way possible. its the kind of game where you can spend countless hours playing and not even notice the time passing, which can potentially be very dangerous. it may not be the best game in terms of graphics and gameplay but if you have the patience to master it, it can be very rewarding.",1
"this game is amazing, just buy it if you havent already. even if you dont like turnbased strategy games, you wont regret picking this up!",2
"this is the best strategic game that i ever played :) . and be carefull u can forget how is outside youre house .",1
"i like the game but they make it so hard to multiplay with someone sitting right next to you.",2
"this game is one of the most fun games i have ever played in my entire life and its even more fun with friends. i absolutly recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a fun game. also it gets even better when you get the dlc.",1
"very good and interesting game! played out-of-the-box for about three hours before i bought the gold upgrade in the steam sale. although once your civilization gets huge it can get slightly boring it has amazing graphics, especially when you talk to other rulers.",1
"so addidictive, so many hours of sleep lost for one more turn",3
"i love this game. the whole concept of growing an empire and competing for resources is something im into and crave, and this game satisifies that craving. i would definitely recommend this game. there are a few bugs though. my rating: 8.5/10",5
"for years i ran a hobby club in my sons school focusing on civ iii. civ v is the extension of that franchise, and they have wisely adopted the hex format for their maps. a livelong strategic game enthusiast who has designed my own games based upon the us civil war, i find that the civ v developers are making the effort -- and succeeding -- at delivering a peerless strategic gaming experience. onward! vinceremos!",5
"great game you can be friendy with your friends or kill them with your navy",3
"so last night i went and tried the game out because ive had it for a bit. i started it at 2am ish and the next time i looked at the clock it was 4:30am! that hasnt happened in a while for me and a game. stratagey is gread! the tile and turn based systems work flawlessly. its overall a really great and addicting game",1
"this game is flipping amazing. nuff said. its awesome, its addicting, the graphics are amazing, ive played it for 39 hours, its really good, awesomest turn-based strategy ive ever played. go buy it now.",1
"if you are a fan of the civilization games, dont let this game fool you. no you cannot stack units like previous versions, but there is such a layer of depth involving unit placement and strategic attacks that makes this game much more than any civ game that ive ever played. the dlc packs add a new level to this with religion and tourism, but the multiplayer aspect does need some work. mostly the connections can be quite bad. so save often if you are hosting.",2
"blew my mind, loved it right away when i learned i could create chaos.",1
"if you are new to civ like i was at first this game can seem a little overwhelming due to the vast amount of content offered. however after a few hours of gameplay you can expect to be navigating the overlays and maps like a pro. this game is non-stop fun and super addictive, i often find myself playing for hours and hours even after i say to myself that im going to play only one more turn and save. highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in turn based strategy games. game also has steam workshop which adds to replay value.",2
"i highly reccomend buying this game because i have only played for a few hours but i am practically addicted to it and im looking forward to buying beyond earth",1
"couldnt get use to the hex grid instead of squares but seemd like a good game overall. i may give it another try.",1
"good game, steep learning curve but addictive when you get into it",2
"civ v is the turn-based strategy game for the ages. soon after playing for the first time, youll be glued to this game for hours upon hours, and youll love it. great for anyone who loves them a good strategy game, or for anyone with a passing interest in them. the astounding variety in civilizations and game possibilities, as well as multiplayer make this game worth every penny and gold piece. hex grid master race.",2
"this game causes time loss. you start the game and the next thing you know, its 8 hours later and dark outside and you missed your shift at work. it is amazing though.",3
"civilization v is an amazing game that you can play for hours.",3
"awesome game, very addicting. great for sinking lots of hours into. the only problem is the multiplayer, it can be fairly glitchy and frustrating.",3
"really great game with loads of replay value and customization, especiallly with steam workshop.",2
"so addicting! heck, i could spend hours just reading the civilopedia.",2
"the best turn-based empire buildingfranchise on the market. period. if you havent tried yet, you are missing out on many a sleepless night. although not as polished as its predecessor, it still leads the way in the gameplay department.",6
"its great very good if u want to make an empire or just farm and study tech, its just great and make sure u get brave new world its even a better game with it!",2
"very well done, especially with the expansions. many different ways of winning, leaving the option for warmongering, teching, etc.",2
"in the words of the late great taylor swift: after playing civ 5, civ 4 and i are never, ever, ever getting back together. civ 5 > all things",2
"good, fun, thoughtful, intense. all words i would use to describe this great game.",1
"apart from skyrim, this game is one of the top 3 reasons i got into pc gaming. i love everything about it and feel like it could never get old. as much time as i have put into it, i feel like i have only skimmed the surface of what i believe is one of the best games ever made. one more turn will be a though that crosses your mind constantly and on into the hours of the morning. if youre into strategy, get this game immediately. my only complaint is the loading times, but that is my only complaint.",2
"ive played every civilization game and every expansion; with civ 5 brave new world, theyve finally achieved a balance of victory conditions that transforms this game into the only strategy game equally suitable for single or multiplayer that genuinely offers opportunity for victory with whatever strategy you choose, provided your choice is clever and adaptable.",5
"addictive and fun but... some annoying bugs here and there prevents this from being the turn based game anyone wanted 9/10",1
"go to market and buy this game!!! thats one of strategy games i like the most, you need to conquer rome in 100 moves can you do it? can your brain and eyes do that for you?! if yes go and buy this game, i rate 10/10",1
"addictive. lock-your-children-in-a-closet addictive.",1
"have you ever dreamed of ruling your own civilization? do you spend sleepless nights thinking, man, i wonder what it would be like to start a land war in russia? or i wish i understood agriculture so i can plow queen elizabeth. wait no longer my friends! mad the south last the war? want to start a neck beard religion? now you can! buy civ 5! nuke ghandi! be nuked by ghandi! build stonehenge! destroy the french! build the statue of liberty! develop freedom! deliver freedom to the unwashed masses in exchange for their precious, precious oil! impress the french with your boy bands and blue jeans! destroy the french! what more could you want in a game? buy it! add to cart. destroy the french! tell your friends how awesome it is! gather them together in bars and discuss eugenics! actually, thats a terrible idea! dont do that! buy the game! play it with friends! realize your dreams! rule the world!",3
"civ v isnt better than civ iv, but it isnt worse; its just different. i miss mao zedong though.",3
"too many problems to list running this game. i7, p8 z78 pro gen 3 mobo, 16g corsair ram, 256g ssd and gt 560 ti. game wont launch at all ever since i bought the dlc. updated all drivers, verified game cache, uninstalled, re-installed, and did a rain dance for good measure. game is broken. has been uninstalled and im not going to bother trying to  with it again.",1
"i try to be friendly but then i end up conquring the world. 10/10",1
"ill write this review any second now, just one more turn... and another... and another...",2
"a fantastic version of civilisation with everything that you could want. not played for many years, so the introductions of policies was a real treat and really helped make a difference to how you progressed your nation. not sure i am a big fan of the religion option, dont seem to have a way to control its influence without starting a war - although that might be the designers being realistic! not sure of the point of city-states either, but as you can pretty much custom the gameplay, not a biggie. all in all, great fun.",1
"very good a lot of fun and the mods are super 10/10",4
"this was my first real civ game, and i love it. the brave new world expansion adds a lot of complexity and a lot of interesting elements to keep the game interesting. ive definitely sunk way too many hours into this game, but its one of my favorite games to binge on. the game takes a lot of time to play, but because it is turn based, you can (supposedly) save at any time and play more later. i enjoy this game for more than just the style of game. i appreciate the historical information woven into the game, and i like that i can play this game while listening to or watching something else. if you like slow, tactical games, i would recommend giving civilization v a try.",4
"warning!!! this game is ridiculously addictive! i bought this game a while back and never really had a chance to sit down and give it my full attention but when i did decide to do so i was glued to my seat. a playthrough that i originally thought would last a half hour quickly become a 13 hour marathon and after many defeats ( being a noob) i still felt like going back for more, each time being rewarded for my persistence by learning or discovering something new about this wonderful game. if you havent bought this already, what are you waiting for?",1
"i think 70 hrs in the space of a week and a half talks for itself",2
"was neighbours with gandhi -- didnt get nuked! 10/10",2
"fantastic turn based based strategy game, the political aspect of the gameplay adds a lot of immersion to the experience, as your cunning and persuasiveness can lead to your victory. varied gamestyles and multiplayer makes these attributes stick out even more when having to interact with real players, wielding a higher level of understanding and reasoning. 8/10 might not appeal to many gamers genre interests.",1
"what makes this game is the expansions, they add lots of content and make the game more enjoyable. with this game you can play as caeser in 2024 sending a nuke to the warmongering ghandi. if you like historical accuracy/plausability you may be shocked by this, if you like absurdity and grandness but want a challenge youll like this. if your new to grand strategy game this is a good starter as the ui is laid out well and very easy to access. a good game can last for 12 hours from start to finish. i have to force myself not to click the one more turn button",4
"as a huge civ 4 fan, i recommend sid meiers civilization v if you want to take this franchise to the next level. the graphics are far more beautiful, the soundtrack more inspiring and certain game elements, such as hex-based grid, let you strategize in new fulfilling ways. i also like that the leaders are voiced in their native languages, what i dont like is how time-consuming this game can be. seriously, civ 5 has the power to keep you enthralled for hours on end. it really is that good. one other thing, low-end machines can run the game in direct x 9, which is great if you dont have a powerful monster at your side :)",1
"i reallly enjoy this game because its complicated many ways to win, and you always have fun even when your new so i think you should play it",1
"oh my god this game is so addiciting if you love rts, if you dont you will still freaking love it!",1
"civilization v pares down a lot of the unnecessary elements and game mechanics that have been creeping into the series, bringing it down to a very polished set of basic mechanics.",1
"great game. have been playing civ since the first one and this is certainly the best in the series. highly recommended!!",8
"although ive never been one for rts, civiliztion v is just such a fun experience that i just could not put it down. its the kind of game you get lost in and find yourself playing long after youd think it would be time to stop. its a game that a person of any taste, whether it be someone whom enjoys awesome rts or maybe someone who just likes the experience of being a leader on the world stage, the experience is the same either way, truely amazing. with gameplay like this, its no wonder that the franchise civilization has been around so long yet stayed so relevant. i cant wait to try future installments.",1
"sid meiers civilization v is a very fun and strategic game. the mechanics in the game are amazing, and i would recommend this game to anyone - those who want to go to war, those who want to build a civilization, those who want to dominate the economy, or those who want to do scientific advancements.",1
"amazing. needs the expansions to really shine in the endgame.",1
"if youre going to play civ v be sure to have gods and kings and brave new world expansion. it added alot of variety in the game and it mesh well with each other. also, be sure to have an alarm clock near you and set it with your desired play time or else you will spend your whole day playing this game!",2
"good game is all i can say; scratch that: awesome game!!",1
"it was very fun and it imbrases that its amazing stragie game and i look forward to evry turn.",1
"well worth the price, much easier to get into than the other civs",1
"it is fun, especially with my last man standing scenario mod.",7
"great turn based game. always end up spending more time playing than i wanted to.",2
"the best game, the only game. you have not lived until you alpha centauri your way to victory.",6
"multiplayer networking is buggy as fk. map sizes do not scale well at all with system resources.",4
"i have 77 hours played on this game and ive probably played no more than 10 games",1
"brilliant game, wish i had brave new world though, my only complaint is that the palace view that was in civ 3 is gone:(, but i gtg and play more civ 5",2
"this game is perfect if you have hours to kill because it is easy to get lost in it. a very rewarding game. and the mods for it are amazing!",5
"this game is one of my favourites of all time. having racked up plenty of game time, its clear, from my point of view, that the game is addicting and will chew through hours and hours of your free time once you start playing. 10/10, would buy.",5
"its hard to describe what is civilization to someone who never played it. well, its a simulator of building your own empire in a way that ou prefer - wars, economics, diplomacy, religion. if you are a big fan of strategy genre, you should definetely play this game, its great. its also turn-based. dont rush into multiplayer, try some single player scenarios first to feel game pace and choices that you must do in order to conquer the world. good luck!",1
"this game is awesome if you like strategy games... wish i had someone to play it with...",1
"this game look very good, indeed, i like the complex of each turn, unique and interesting. i can not get out of this just....one...more...turn",1
"this game is so fun! i recommend all of the dlc. they completely change the game by adding a ton of new stuff that will make your experience even better. there are many civilizations to choose from and they all have their unique perks. you can spend hours on this game without realizing it. 10/10 would play forever and ever.",2
"this game is quite a damn classic and it is one of my favorite games whether you like playing against ai or human players the modding community is really great as well huge variety of mods",1
"thanks to this game now i just want to see the world on fire",1
"how can i not recommend this with almost 200 hours logged? especially with the gods and kings expansion...you will see your life wither away as you play for just...one...more...turn!",3
"civ 5 is a game which there is much fun to be had. you can easily get 70+ hours with this game. 10/10 must buy",2
"i highly recommend this game as a very relaxed strategy game. personally, i dont fare well with strategy games, but with 9 different ai levels, there is something for every type of player.",1
"this is a great turn by turn strategy game. build your empire, by brute strength or push for diplomacy. with all the add ons and mods, there are hours upon hours that could be spent enjoying this game. my only issue, is with the constant crashing on apples os. otherwise, i would highly recoomend it.",1
"let me put it this way i played for 15 hours straight 10/10",2
"this game is one of my favourite games ever, it is really fun to play with friends and solo, if you want a game you can play for a few hours or even an hour, this game is for you, civ 5 described in one word, #fantabulous",1
"ive been playing civ v for quite some time with friends, and while it has a few glaring problems like  ai that runs units to their death in your citys with no chance of taking it and gandhi and his opness. its otherwise a great time vampire more so with all the xpacks adding sorely needed features like religions in gods and kings and actual trade networks in brave new world. if you have tens of hours to drop into a game per setting this is the game for you as hours just disappear before you know it, you start playing at 3pm and in the blink of an eye its 1am.",2
"words cannot describe this.. just play it and youll see for yourself!",1
"this is probably the most addictive game i have played in a long time. i love it. this will definitly keep you up at night!",2
"i no longer have life all that is left is civilazation",2
"i love this game -ghandi conquered the whole roman empire -ghandi nuked the life out of me -ghandi defeated a whole load of my samouri i also love that russia gets double the uranium and that there are so many ways to win",3
"i would love to write more but ive got to go and destroy another city. all i will say is that it is a super addicting and well designed game.",1
"is a good game, get the dlc though. and dont play from 8 pm to 5 am. ps",4
"as a vivid turn-based strategy gamer, i would highly recommend civ v. it has a variety of gameplay and a considerable amount of ai difficulties. if anything, check the vods on youtube before you purchase it so that it suits your preferences well. enjoy ;)",1
"possably the best turn-based-strategy series out there, and civilization v doesnt stray from the mark. whether you are returning to the series, or new to it #5 bring a lot to the table. there are a lot of leaders to choose to rule the land with, and even more if you use the steam workshop. many technologies, too many wonders to count, and above all, millions of ways that you can crush the opposition and conquer your map. this game also features a multiplayer and scenarios to test your skill. in all, great game a definate must buy.",1
"one of the best strategy games ever, really fun especially with friends get ready to give all your free time to this game because its really addicting",2
"i wont lie, after playing civ iv, i miss stacking an army of units and sending them all on one space to crush my opponents. and i miss not being buddhist, because spain would always get buddhism, and then they would hate everyone who wasnt buddhist, but they wouldnt let them become buddhist, so i had a really great excuse to convince everyone to destroy spain. i kind of miss tech trading, but i remember thinking that was a cheap way to become all-powerful. other than that, this is an amazing game.",1
"i have put hundreds of damned hours into this game and there is still more stuff i can do in the game. ive played plenty of games in my life but this is the best one out of all of them.",2
"in civilization v the game play is simply amazing. its short, sweet, and simple graphics allows the player to focus on the strategy aspect of the game and not so much the exploring aspect; yet it still allows the player to see beautiful scenery. 5/5",1
"does not start on my linux system, just a frozen window no content. no solution found so far.",1
"its civilization! either youre going to love it, or youve never heard of it.",1
"entertainment value through the roof. value of life rock bottom. do not buy, unless willing to risk life. sorry review was short, needed to warn *cough* *cough* *blarrrrghhh* ... transcript ended.",4
"just wait until sid makes civilization beyond earth expansion pack.",3
"hundred of hours of awesome world conquering game play lies before you.",2
"there is a reason this game is my most played steam game. just sayin. gods + kings and brave new world are totally recommended, but if you play base civv first you will appreciate their additions to the game all the more. no game is ever the same, and this is the most accessible civ i have played.",3
"i first played civilization on my zx spectrum in 1983. as soon as i got my first pc the first game i purchased was civilization. i now have i now have civilization 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (along with expansion packs) and civilizatio iv: colinization. i have enjoyed playing all versions and now civilization v (with gods and kings and brave new world)is brilliant. now looking forward to having the newest civilization - beyond space.",1

"just started playing but i really dig it already. little slow paced at first but it picks up steam fast!",2
"this game is brilliant. my pc isnt the best, so i decided id give the demo a go. it gives just enough to make you really want to see more. i picked up the gold version of the game and had a lot of fun with that, but i would really advise getting the brave new wolrd expansion too. it adds great new systems to the game. there isnt really anything else i can say that a go at the demo wouldnt say other than if you get this game, get brave new world too.",7
"this is the main reason way i got a steam account to play civ 5 an amazing game",2
"this game is amazing the soundtrack is beautiful its surprisingly easy to learn how to play (i jumped right in with a friend with absolutely no tutorial) 10/10 would recommend",1

"i come with warnings. this game is addicting. if you have a job, a family, or anything that requires any type of attention, i recommend you dont play this game. its amazinga and i think ive wasted entire summers just sitting here with the, just one more turn virus. i bought this game years ago and still cant stop playing it....and i dont want to stop.",2
"do you enjoy not bathing, having cancer, or fighting over the city of buttfart for hours with your friends? if you answered yes to any of these questions or if you really enjoy crying yourself to sleep in a hot sweat of frustration and disapointment, then this game is for you! this game is great, it has caused me to permanently damage my mouse and my self esteem during the countless temper tantrums that this game promoted! i was meant to be the supreme leader of a great nation but instead i sat and watched the glorious cities of buttfart, fatnut, and dickblood get defiled by the japanese. sid meier is a sick man and so was ghandi.",1
"works flawless under arch linux. civ 5 is per se a very good game. the only thing i dislike about it is the sound track. but theres an easy fix for that.",1
"civ 5 is... amazing. one of the best strategy games i have ever played, and i recommend it to all. just be prepared to spend a lot of time per game; this is like the board game risk except 100x more complicated and it takes as much skill as luck.",3
"this game is good. i mean if i, reggie fils-aime says it, it must be true.",1
"this game teaches that the worlds leaders are . also, its nearly impossible to stop playing just...one...more...turn..!!",1
"for strategy! this is a really plus game! form the league of superfriends with your favourite civilizations! declare war on poland! outpopulate india and china! form nato with russia! get backstabbed by france and greece! france:  y u haff to be mad, it only game . yeah france, well screw you. ( no seriously get this game its good )",6
"aside from getting nuked by gandhi and getting indoctrinated by the rambo enemy missionaries, this game is more than worth its money.if you dig strategy games and have plenty of time on your hands to build your own empire from scratch on a world stage, then this is for you. only real complaint are the prices on the dlc-s, but thats just my opinion. 9.5/10",3
"by far my favorite civ game. this is a great addition to the franchise and i highly reccomend it to any fans of this series or any other strategy type games, turn based or not. best game purchase i have made in the last couple of years.",2

"this game is very addictive and very fun. grab it when it goes on sale and say goodbye to your free time :d",1
"undoubtedly my favorite game of all time, so i guess its fitting i write a review. civilization v is the perfect game for you if you take pride in accomplishing long term goals, want action and suspense without the need to be constantly at the computer like in a fps or rts, or else want to blow a third world country to the ground with nuclear weapons before coming in with giant death robots to finish the job. or you could make paintings. you decide. thats really the beauty of the game, you can choose your path and every game is different from the last.",5
"this game has the best replay value of any game ive ever played.",8
"one of the best strategy games of all time. a beautiful work of art where you muct make hard decisions and actually feel like you are a leader. will you be a good king? an evil empoerer? or a neutral dictator who chooses to be blind to he outside world? will you raise an army to roll over all nations? or will you choose to work in harmony for a peaceful world? its all up to you!",1
"ive started from civilization 1, then 2,3,4 and now 5. alone civ5 has lack of religion and more trade/politics options but still good game, with brand new world dlc, fantastic game.",2
"i think im napoleon. ghengis khan never stood a chance against an emperor.",1
"excellent depth ... plenty of replay value, although i wish there were alternative progressions in the tech tree, rather than its linear nature.",2
"the best way to get rid of few days, a week or even a winter. be careful though.",1
"such a fun game! there are days when i can play this for 12+ hours.",1
"please buy the complete edition of this game. the dlcs are what makes this game so addicting and fun",1
"most addictive and satisfying strategy game available on pc.",2
"become involved in foreign relations as your relationships grow distant explore the subtle nuances of large scale warfare as the ones who love you lose hope of your recovery conquer your enemies as you yourself grow worse and worse from neglect finally, acheive eternal dominance over the pixeled land as the real world fades from your grasp did i mention that there are super cool robots that are like a hundred feet tall and make stuff go boom? super cool!",2

"its very hard to stop playing! feels like playing monopoly or risk when played with a couple friends.",1
"if youre in to turn based strategy games that are quite complicated and require you to be really efficient and smart with how you spend each turn.. this is the game for you!",3
"absolutely great for lovers of war strategy games. also doesnt require constant attention because of turn by turn gameplay, which is great for a more casual gamer.",2
"i dont know why i like this game. i shouldnt like this game. it seems like it is just so boring. but before i know it, its three in the morning and i am suppose to be up for work at five.",1
"forget sleep. sid meiers civilization v is what you need.",1
"a must own for every pc gamer out there. genius strategey, entertaining game play, accurate historical info, just a almost perfect game. no cons, just things that could have been a little bit better.",1
"last time i decided to play a quick game, by the time i quit playing i realized my wife already left me 3 weeks before that!",3
"this is a game that stands the test of time, it does not matter how long since i last played it, i can just drop in for a few hours and be totally immersed. i warn you though, prepare for late night telling yourself, just one more turn",7
"a good game~and it spent many time to play i can play one game up to 12 hour",1
"this is one of my favorite games ever. by getting rid of the stack of doom from the previous iterations of the game, it really brought in a new level of strategy, and by making cultural a viable path, it has really added to the series in ways that previoius iterations didnt.",7
"the latest in the civilization series, this game takes the experience to a whole new level. hexs replace squares, allowing cities to expand and grow even bigger then before. while features have been removed from civilization 4, others have been added that give the game a new sense of balance, and more planning than ever is required to create a civilization to stand the test of time! a true must for the budding world leader.",6
"good game nice replayabilty and nice military dictatorships =d",3
"the spectacular series returns with beautiful graphics and continues the standard of perfection that is the civilization series. i have probably spent 10000 hours playing this entire series. love it.",1

"this is on eof the most fun games i have ever played!",1
"proof that putting more  into a game makes it better. call of grand theft creed fortress legends of war vs capcom emblem xviii will be the best game in the world.",2
"if your a fan of strategy games give this game a spin. civ 5 offers a ton of fun content available to each player with multiple ways to pave the path to victory. the core game itself is a good game. add gods and kings or brave new world and your playtime basically doubles and triples. even with all my hours in civ i still dont tire of playing it. 9/10 would play again.",2
"when you play lan battles with friends, do not go to the bathroom. somehow, like magic, almost all of my cities and gold and almost everything somehow came under his control. he claims it was the ai that took my stuff. still hate gandhi. 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 would reccomend",1

"its alright. it dont help that i forget to do something awhile playing this game start at 11am and finished at 5am 10/10 its worth the money and the time because you will lost time what you are doing i would say get the dlc as will",5
"great visuals and fun game. not as difficult to understand as predecessors but still lots of fun.",3
"over 300 hours playing this game and i still have only seen a portion of the content available. the best turn based, 4x strategy game i have ever played. the expansions are a must as they are literally game changers.",4

"experience the great events like: the great wall of mongolia, germany the holy country of judaism, the warmonger ghandi nuking the celts, the great pyramids in the us and of course the great aztecs who found mathematics, philosophy and writing! learn history in no time :d",1
"a great game that combines strategy, warmongering and building! the ai needs a huge improvement though... i got washington down to his last city and he demanded that i give him all my money and luxury resources for peace!?",1
"do you like to play fps or *cough* callofduty *cough* games rather than rts and tbs games? (i am still a fan of battlefield.. and the majority of other fps games xd) well... let me just stop you there! this is more than your average call of duty affair right here. you see, within this game is hours and hours (222 hours judging by the amount of my life ive already wasted) of brilliant gameplay! limited only to your logical ability as you play the game over and over again whilst testing your strategy and determination all while being able to play with ai or friends! you will play this game... and have fun! [10/10] better yet, you will leave smarter than the average man!",3
"simply a perfect game. buy the game, play it and be happy!",5
"an amazing game, people who want a challenge have to buy this.",4
"deep strategy, awesome community mods, awesome game overall 10/10",3
"my friend gifted me this game and now its telling me to purchase it ?! help",1
"i enjoy playing civ, and even though i enjoy it, matches can take a good while, even on quickpace turns. new tech would go down well along with a new range of different civs, and maps...even a sandbox map maker would do me too.",2
"this is definitely one of the best strategy games that i ever played. its dlcs expand the contents of the game dramatically and make the game worthy playing again and again to try different strategies. one thing still need to be improved is ai takes too much time every turn in late game, especially when aircraft comes out.",3
"its fun fun fun and more fun. you will play the whole day and you will still want more siv.",2
"playing since civ iii, the series just gets better and better",1
"i heard its an ok game, need to play it a bit to know for sure.",8
"+when i cant conquer a city, i can build a city elsewhere and change the name of the city to the name of the city i initially wanted. who needs your stoopid city anyway. -no mods for multiplayer 9/10",2
"proceed with extreme caution; if you get suckered into buying/downloading this, there is a serious chance you will spend an embarrasing amount of time playing it.",1
"one of the best strategy games ive ever played.if you like strategy games , you should definetely check this one out. unless you like turn based , i suggest you to reconsider your thoughts about turn base and check it anyway.",1
"this is a turn-based settling/fighting game in which you are a random world leader from a random time period and you build an empire and then you kill each other. what more could you want from a game? computerboardgamewoohoo mine mine mine mine mine mine ~seagulls (finding nemo)",1
"100s of hours, if not 1000s of hours worth of gameplay",1

"two pieces of advice kill ghandi and dont  people off",3
"my civ was full of illiterate  so i left them for dead to go live the pirate life on the sea. 10/10 would let egypt starve to death again",1
"youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you, but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter. 20/10",1
"i highly recommend this game to any indepth strategy game geek, like as myself. lots to learn soooo many different possiblities with endless games, which never play the same twice.",2
"fun, with a lot of gameplay, but you need patience.",3
"if you have 10 hours or so free id take the opportunity to have a quick game of civ.",2
"really great game to play with a group of mates. better over lan however as it can take a while to do all the turns.",1
"i started playing civilization v when it first came out over 3 years ago. i still love it. this is my favorite game of all time.",7
"a fantastic game! probably one of the best games since....... sliced bread!",2
"best game ive ever played has hooked endless and replayable",1
"ahhh... civ 5. sid meier never seems to disapoint me. in this latest installment of the civ. series there is so much more than the past games. non stackable military units makes combat and warfare much more interesting. both dlcs are great too. the graphics are great and the ai is always willing to tear you a new one in anyway possible. if you are looking for a great in-depth rts, chess on roids then look no further.",2
"keeps to its classic heritage but with some fantastic improvements with the add-ons ive lost many hours on this great strategy",1
"amazing game. i can play for hours and still have fun. looks lovely and has lots of content. 10/10 recommend to everyone!",1
"if i had the hours back that i sank into this game, i would have accomplished something... not sure what, but it would have been something. though i doubt it would have ever compared to ruling the world.",3
"great game, still needs community support in the form of multi player mods.",3
"this game is an absolutely blast! requires some patience though because games tend to last a while. luckily, there is a save feature. you could be playing the same game for weeks!",1
"very addicting, bnw expansion is great. dont trust ghandi.",2
"great gameplay, decent graphics, cool system, fun for the brain, simply awsome!",5
"its goood if u like to kill everyone in the worldddddz!",2
"who knew being a warmongering world superpower could be so fun?",5
"one of the last, yet still great of a dying genre the rts. if you can afford it definitely pick this up, and dont forget to check out the expansions, which may not seem all that important until youve tried playing without them. they work as though they were always in the game and only further immerse your experience.",3
"one of the best strategy, turn-based games ive played in a long time. conqour the world or win the hearts or awe of millions, you choose how you want to win this thing. the entire set-up works great because sometimes you have to rely on your enemies to get the job done, whatever it is that your doing. this is just for the base game alone; when you take into account gods and kings expansion, holy crap, this thing is the best ever. espionage and religion (only in gods and kings) add such an addictive game mechanic, youll never stop playing this. every single turn is a please...just one more turn then im done... crawl to the finish line, even if youve already gotten there.",1
"lost 2 girlfriends from playing this game 10/10 would ave true to caesar again",2
"this game is addicting. would be the 4 words that i would say if somebody asked me about this game. civilization v is probably the most fun ive had in a game. every turn, you move your units, manage your cities, interact with other civilizations, not knowing what awaits you next turn. you can become friends with the warmongering genghis khan, or piss off the peace loving gandhi. this game offers a ton of civs to play as, so youll be spending alot of time in it. also, if youre worried about getting demolished, dont worry, civ v offers a really good indepth tutorial made for getting beginners into the game. if you can get a good deal on this game or the ultimate edition, i really would recommend buying it, and prepare for getting your soul sucked in. 9/10.",4
"this game is absolutely amazing. buy it. buy the full version. now",1
"although most games (within this game), start out slow, the late game is fun, and too fast. use nukes to destroy armies, and pollute your enemies lands. use killer robots to walk through people. maybe start early and use knights to destroy warriors. the game is very fast for the skilled, and very slow to the beginners. dont let that scare you though, slow beginnings only strengthen you for the quick ending, youd rather fight off.",2
"my review for this game is that i love it. it is a great game i would recomend it if you wan to try it out use the demo for anyone that is not sure if they like it or not",1
"nice game. even though your new to series its still enjoyable and easy to get basics down.",2
"wonderful 4x strategy game that allows for many different approaches and play styles. fun to play, difficult to master.",8
"you dont think youll play for very long when you start, but then youve got six cities and the ottoman empire is threatening your allies and trying to get on your good side, and you stop playing civ and actually become a world leader with a cry of  what the hell am i gonna do?! as you hover over the declare war button. also its now 4am and you cant remember the last time you ate.",1
"this is one of the best strategy games out there. definitely pick up the expansions, as well!!!",3
"good game but a little hard for beginners but if you know how to play and stuff it w ill turn out to be 1010 recommend this game.",1
"civilization 5 is highly addicting and is a very good choice if you want to make a lot of time disappear before you even realize it was gone. if youve tried the previous civilization titles and didnt find them fun give civlization 5 a try, it plays more like a strategy board game then previous titles.",5
"very deep strategy game with complex systems to master. civ v has done a great job expanding on its concept and reimagining key features from past entries that have really brought this current rendition into the best the series has to offer to date.",1
"i have long been a fan of the civilization style of games, though ill be honest, alpha centauri is my favorite sid meiers title of all time. all time. with that said, civ 5 is by far the most polished game, and with all of the addons coming in at the original cost of the game, im more than content to pay the price. hours and hours of gameplay and replayablilty. modability adds in even more replay value. steam workshop compatible! definitely a game for someone looking to do more than point a gun at something...",2
"this game is one of my favourites in my library. its a game for anyone that loves or likes geography, it teaches you about history and lets you mold history in your way. i recommend you play this game with friends, you can play online and solo, but its a little more fun with someone you know and like to play games with. i recommend this game! 9/10",1
"soooooooooooooooooooooooo adicting. best game ever.",4
"so much about this game is beautiful and well done, but it is missing something. also, the little bits of stuff added here and there, they do actually not much at all, its mainly just for show. pretty game, ultimately boring gameplay - after a while.",2
"civilization v is great for those who are not great at strategy games, particularly ones focusing on military might. i have never been very good at keeping an organized military force, whether it be in the turn based or real time genres, but this game does a great job of giving you alternate paths to victory. though i am aware previous iterations of civ have always had multiple paths to victory, this version has made achieving those victories viable.",1
"i buy game. i like game. i love game. you do anything to my game i hate you. i hate you i invade you. you ghandi. you nuke me. i invade you. you nuke me. im sad. 10/5 best game",3
"love civ v and the hex grid. no more unit stacking, horray!",7
"oh god please help me! ive clocked up over 600 hours and im still playing.",7
"one of my favourite games, 200% better with dlc. civ v is totally a game to get",2
"incredible. i find it hard to stop playing once ive begun, playing for hours trying to destroy my enemies. the espionage, the diplomacy, etc. are all things that add into the amazing difficulty of the game. even on easy settings there are so many things that keep you on your toes. great game.",3
"on the one hand, this game is incredible. on the other, its near-impossible to stop. so.. maybe... dont buy it? it will eat your life.",2
"really fun if you can actually find people that want to play with you for hours on end.",2
"its like a giant game of super chess where you play as a historical leader. you must trade control social policies and fend off the advances of the evil warmongering nuclear fueled ghandi,the epitome of terror. 10/10",1
"originally i was very sceptical - for me version v had come way too fast after civ iv which i liked very. i changed my mind with the gods & kings expansion and now it is by far the most played game in my list. the gameplay is superb and i very much enjoy the co-op mode. there is no excuse not to own and play this game, as it is eternally replayable.",4
"i really cant stop playing this game. definatley one of the best games that i have in my library. its fun, addicting, and action packed so you can sit there for hours. i highly recomend this game.",1
"great game, very addictive. the game was good but the dlcs make it worth while with both gods and kings and brave new world. so much to do and so many ways to win!",2
"thats how you make a game! epic game playing and soundtracks!",1
"warning, exercise caution. if you are considering picking up civ 5 then you must beaware of its incredibly addictive nature. this is the game series that spawned the phrase just one more turn. *8 hours later* just. one. more. turn",3
"siv v is avery fun game with long drawn out exiteing battle and amazing multiplayer support",1
"- revived montezuma - 3 turns later he declares war on me 10/9",3
"never spent so much time on a game in my life. lost my girlfreind and my gpa dropped 2.5 points. stayed up too late and slept in, then missed my flight to participate in the olympics. ruined my life and future. 10/10",4
"i have complete edition and im disappointed. its good but defnetly not worth 40 euros. sometimes i even think that civ iv was more intresting.",1
"loses a lot of the intelligence from civ iv, but a great civilization game nonetheless. much more approachable and easy to understand. perfect for listening to podcasts or killing time.",3
"easily one of the best multiplayer games ive ever played. single player not rly my thing cuz it gets boring fast but the multiplay with friends is just pure awesomeness would recommend any time 10/10",1
"i really like that part of oldest sitcom in history of game development... ). so, guys, just try and enjoy that stuff. if u will play with friends, u will find great timekiller and funny moments in that game. ). civilization v back us to classic hexagons rather than civ iv. its first good sign. 2. great multiplayer mode. 3. great scenarios for lone wolves. 4. extended settings for your own game. 5. recommended by time. ). 6. of course, i love that soundtrack. great work by composers. 7. i think that game have balance. all nations have own bonuses. choice what u like and beat your opponents. 8. for newbies  easy to learn. omg... its just civilization, what i can say more?! and... only one bad sign i can say about civ v  cropped release version... because, if you want religion  you will need to buy dlc gods & kings... nobody like that marketing politic. cheers, mazy.",4
"this is a definite should-buy game for anyone. even though this is a strategy game, i feel like anyone can get into this game and find enjoyment out of it. i highly recommend this game to anyone, even to first-time gamers and to people new to the strategy genre.",1
"this is honestly one of the best games i have ever played. definatley the best strategy game i have ever experianced. the graphics are apropriate for the game and the gripping strategy gameplay is top-notch. i would give it a 9/10.",2
"my only experience with civilization before civ5 was freeciv, and this game is a big improvement! note, though, that it may not actually run on your linux install. i have to boot into windows to actually play it, which of course means i only play it very rarely. this is sad, because its a good game. if you run linux, only buy this if its on a serious sale; that way, if it doesnt work, you arent out the full price.",1
"a great updated version of a classic game. in depth, great graphics, an amazing game.",2
"one of my favorit games well worth the price, the dlcs will increase the enjoyment multiple times over",4
"if you know how to play civ then this should be an easy game for you new mechanics if you played the older civs but this is a great game if you understand what your doing",2
"this is a fun but very basic version of world history it has entertained me for a lot of time though, pick it up. 9.5/10",2
"amazingly fun game. play with family and friends on an epic long game or a quick paced game and build your civ the way you want it. hundreds of hours of replayability, play it dozens upon dozens of different ways. find your favorite civ rulers, exploit their major strengths and back up those weakness. build ancient, medieval and even modern wonders to boost your empires glory! destroy your enemies or be diplomatic and take another route to victory, so many ways to win, but just playing this game is a win. 10/10",3
"i find it hard to believe anyone is really reading reviews for this, as this is one of those games that i feel you either are already intimately familiar with, or want nothing to do with. that being said, if you are into strategy games and have never played this, i would advise you to get this the next time steam throws it on sale. if strategy is not your thing...dont.",2
"this is one of the best rts games available right now!",1
"best strategy game there is and bbrave new world makes it even better",1
"if you like turned based strategy this is the game for you. countless hours fly by without even realizing it. multiplayer is there as well; its fun to get two other friends on the same team and watch your research skyrocket while you gang up on all the other cities. great game, well made, and all round fun to play.",1
"i would write a total in-depth review, but i need to take 1 more turn. at least its only 8pm...",1
"if you want a game to kill a few hours once or twice a week, then this game is a must avoid for you. once you start this game up you get completely consumed in it and there is no going back. it completely ruins your life. 10/10.",1
"one more turn dunno how many times ive said that and ended up playing thru the night... and morning...",2
"would recommend to people who like being randomly attacked by france and montezuma.  those s",2
"civ v gods and kings is a good game to play although it an older virsion than brave new world dlc its a great virsion",1
"i can already tell im going to lose weeks of my life to this game. a must buy.",1
"fun to play with 2 other people. games can last quite a while but they are never dull and there is always deep strategy involved.",1
"this game is a fantastic strategy game, i enjoyed playing this with my friends. the only drawback to the game if you can call it one, is that this game gets you carried away as in when you sit down to play you dont realize that six hours have passed. of course that could be labeled as a success, regardless i enjoy this game no matter how much sleep i have lost playing it.",1
"bloody brilliant. the mods make this game even better, theres nothing quite like playing as the soviet union and crushing the us after a 3000 year cold war.",2
"how too get a civilization build an do not let any other plantason take it away from you.",1
"another great game. though i stopped bying the addons. samey samey..",1
"great game - must have with brave new world dlc (pretty cheap now). turn based, like a game of chess - with politics and war.",8
"easily one of the best games to sink time into, this is an amazing strategy game full of history. the little but noticable details make this a breathtaking experience that you can play for hours on end.",1
"civilization v is one of the best strategy games i know. you can play it over and over again, and its fun every time. i strongly recommend this game and all of its dlc to anyone who wants a good challenge and also, if anyone has the chance, burn that traitorous  ghandi for me.",1
"the only game where invading a virtual version of mecca would get malaysian religious officials panties in a bunch. 5/5 stars from me. play it my friends and people who read this.",1
"havent played since the first civ... man i am old. i give it a thumbs up! lots of fun! plus i love a game where you can say  man i cant wait till ghandi is dead! ...",1
"wonderful! the first hour you will just not understand nothing, but take your time and get comfertable with the game! just wonderful game!",1
"a truly amazing deal. the game with all of the expansions for 10 euros, amazing. the game itself is brilliant. i enjoy it a lot. just prepare to invest a lot of time into it. its not a short game, it can be played an infinite amount of times.",1
"forget about greeks bearing gifts, gandhi is the one you have to watch out for...",3
"i need to go outside at some point. destroyed my social life and my view of gandhi. 10/10.",2
"civ 5 is a radical change from the previous civs in many ways, but is equally radically a step up in terms of gameplay. the switch from squares to hexes might seem small, but it makes a huge difference on how easy it is to gather resources and move around the map. the introduction of full screen shots where civ leaders move, gesture, react, and talk in their appropriately native language gives an amazing sense of connection with the past. it is, hands down, my favorite civ yet.",1
"i could write out an intricate review for civ v or the excellent brave new world expansion but im too busy playing civ v.",2
"after more than 20 years, civilization is still one of the best games out there. the expansion pack (gods & kings) is highly recommended.",4
"having watched the evolution of this series, ive been able to see the improvements that have been made with each iteration. the turn based strategy format is a classic, and provides for some deep stategic thinking. the game is very in-depth for the progression of the civilizations involved, and with so many variables, civilization gives endless replayability. three thumbs up!",4
"this has everything you need to conquer all of civilization and just have the best time being stabbed in the back then nuking your once allies. good memories...",5
"absolutely amazing strongly recommend with all dlcs",1
"a really fun turn based strategy game, some issues with multiplayer, and optimization, but its well worth it!",2
"i have to admit that i never thought i would like this game. i was a die hard civ iii fan (and i still love it). but this game is gorgeous and has some great things about it. i found the hex grid hard to get used to, but after getting used to it, its much more intuitive than civ iiis grid. i actually like the fact that i cant stack a hundred things on top of one another (though ive heard people complain about that) because i keep track of my units better that way. one thing i really dont like is the extra restrictions on movement. you cant even go through an enemys space at all, even to pass through and you ship cant risk dangerous deep water (a gambit i am very fond of in civ iii). other than that, i love this game. it may even be my favorite out of the civilization games.",2
"this one time barbarians took my settler the very first round so i lost instantly........its very fun.",2
"i have played civilization since the original version and love it to this day. this version has some drastic changes that are unique in the series but is still very much civilization. highly recommended.",8
"good game but the online is major broke and is very annoying to play",1
"good strategetic game wished for more action like age of empires or mythology so faster war and results.",1
"highly addictive combination of simulation and turn based strategy. if youre a fan of civ, this wont let you down. if youve never played any of the civ series, i definitely think this game wont let you down. its an interesting mix between age of empires and sim city, for lack of a better comparison.",10
"every new game is a whole new story. new strategies are needed for each new game and the game always has you planning out your next moves in advance. you can spend endless hours without knowing it and without getting bored.",3
"the greatest time vortex ever. start playing and when you next look at the clock many hours have gone....",2
"i started playing this when i was 19 and didnt leave my computer for anything. ive only just finished my first game and it appears the human race has been whiped from the face of the planet and the seamonkeys now control the planet. great game.",2
"amazingly addictive and intense strategy combat situations strongly recommend trying this game.",1
"the father of turn based strategy games. best installment yet.",1
"fantastic game. like you should buy it just because i say so.",1
"civ v and the civ games in general are really great strategy games!",1
"this is one of the most fun games i have ever played, but i can not reccomend it until 2k and the mac os porting team fix multiplayer and sudden crashing.",1
"amazing game if you want to do a world domination game with friends or a.i.",1
"excellent, addictive game...so many scenarios, and situations to build or conquer, may pull some all nighters for some games.. my only complaints are the multiplayer(its like running the game on the lowest settings) and sometimes the ai is just plain stupid. i highly reccomend this to anyone who likes strategy games!",5
"this game is simply amazing. its like playing a board game on your computer and its incredibly interactive with a great amount of detail. and the dlc only make it better and each one is well worth its price. 10/10 would play again.",3
"started from the bottom now im here.. get the  away from me you mothering queer. actually the game is quite fun and its a lot of fun to start from nothing and then take over other civilizations only to be denounced and called a liar and a betrayer, but all is worth when you win the game.",7
"good game, spent hours playing it to death. no regrets. the ai is somewhat stupid but the difficulty settings make it quite the challenge. lots of replayability and great multiplayer to go along with it.",9
"10/10 i love the gameplay and strategy. i would buy it if it was on moblie",1
"being a mainly fps or fps/rpg type games fan, i thought id try a different genre so i bought the complete edition on the last steam sale to just see what all the fuss is about. now i know its the most addictive, where did the time go, just one more turn game i have ever played, highly recommended",3
"the best series of all time as always in good shape. its my favorite and the worst game ever... why ? because iv lost so much time playing this game ^_^",1
"very addicting, fun, makes you think, worth every penny.",1
"its a very in-depth strategy, and tactics game with a lot of different possible outcomes, the most common one being world wars and nukes and sieges. it takes a little while to get used to, but when you do, its amazing. overall id rate it a 9.5 out of 10. the only thing keeping it out of a perfect 10 is for me it takes forever to join multiplayer lobbies. otherwise its a superb investment.",4
"i have spend 200+ hours playing sid meiers civilization 5. it has got to be one of my most favorite games i have ever played. it has wonderful ways to play how you want to play and still have a fun time doing it.",3
"exellent strategy game, solo and multiplayer offer great diversity.",5
"this is an amazing game, i would recommend buying it. if you do buy it, make sure you have friends to play it with as it is much more fun with friends.",1
"got nuked by ghandi ..... realism 10/10 would get nuked again ;d",1
"this game will take hold of your soul and force you to play it for hours.",1
"its fun if you whana do a long game.you whill be angry and happy time to time on the game.but at thy end you whill be happy that you buyd this game because this is the civ you created!!!",4
"this game would be much better had i bought the expansions. the lack of city state involvment and the no religion facter in to make it a tiresome experiance after a nice 3 hour+ game. although a masterpiece in the turn based strategy genre, civ5 can become an assortment of tedious commands that dont quite live up to what your want out of them. i love playing shorter games and its worth the 7.50. would never ever buy it for 30. but civ fans most certainly should.",1
"best buy you could make on steam. will give you hours and hours of fun and entertainment.",7
"i play this game for very long hours however they are place for several improvment for example you have very limited option to do with the other empire or when you demand stuff you cant change the 30 turn policy ?! so i am hoping to see the next generation of the game much better than this one",1
"this game is pretty fun with friends, and the single player if pretty based.",1
"an excellent strategy and conquest game, completely worth the 20$.",2
"great game for anyone who likes strategy. pretty addicting too. overall, great game.",4
"such a fun game. i enjoyed every hour i played its really in depth and theres alot of strategy that goes into it. overall 10/10",3
"this game will leave you geeked out for dayssss. overall fun as hell!!!",3
"a very enjoyable turn-based strategy game. a quick game of civ has ruined many lan parties by taking up all our time.",1
"started playing these when civ iii was given to me as a birthday present. continued playing these and definitely wont stop with this one. yet another great work in the sid meiers series.",1
"this game made me 2 feet taller and handsomer. id say buy it.",3
"definitely one of the best strategy games of the year, awesome gameplay and graphics!",1
"the byzantines denounced me so i destroyed their whole 4000 year old civilization. 10/10",1
"fun when you play with friends. takes a while to learn the game. 8/10",1
"game is great as content, but runs very slow while advancing through game on older machines who only meet minimum requirements",1
"if you liked civ 1 or 2 or 3. you likely wont like this game. its like civ 4, but slower and simplfied, and civ 4 is slow enough compared to 123.",1
"the only reason i stopped playing, and the reason why i will not install this game again is because im afarid ill just wont stop playing. ever.",1
"good game with plenty of gameplay options and replayability. only downside for me is the expansions are a bit pricy at this point. i mean the game itself is the same price as both major expansions. its a bit much. but over-all it is definately worth a play if you are fan of the series or if you enjoy turn-based strategy.",1
"ive played it for a while and sometimes i have to start over because i like the beginning better than the end. its a really good turn based strategy, and i really dont like turn based games.",2
"kill gandhi, live another day. seriously,  gandhi.",2
"this installment brings what feels like a rebalancing of the battle and advancement systems allowing a skilled leader to upgrade their techs before their real world equivellent, before decimating their opponents on the battlefield. as someone who has been playing civilization since the beginning, i really enjoy what theyve done here. my only complaint is that some civs that have been around since the beginning (babylonians and zulus for example) are now dlc if you didnt start out with gold edition.",3
"should i explain more on how great this game is? pros: -random map, different people, full replayability -tactical battle is always a plus -running a country has never been this accurate cons: -unrealism in the game, such as a city producing one thing and gandhi nukes me -i missed school for a few days after buying this game worth: i bought it for $49.99 so its $299.99 out of $49.99",1
"amazing game , id recommend it to anybody. one of the rts games around. a must buy",1
"if you are a fan of 4x games this one is a must. like: every map gives a new experiance, combinded with each unique civ everygame feels like a new experiance. everything is really fluent and plenty of ways to win (conquest,space, etc...) great ui good muliplayer game to play. dislike: the ai can be a pain when trying to make deals, as they will either wont trade or screw you. multiplayer servers are a pain as they will randomly disconect or refuse to connect to friends you are playing with. to get the whole experiance you need all the expac",2
"best game ive ever played. just one..more..turn..",1
"some people want to see the world burn id just rather nuke it",1
"i have been playing the civilization series of games since the third installment, and it feels like each iteration gets better and better. new/altered victory conditions and the inclusion of city-states as minor civilizations make for interesting changes from civ iv, as do the changes to unit behaviour and the use of a hex grid map. the removal of unit stacks makes it feel like builidng up a significant army can be done without costing a lot of time in infrastructure development, something that always bothered me in previous games, though the associated pathing issues can sometimes be annoying if youre not careful. overall i feel that civilization v is a step in the right direction moving on from civilization iv, and i recommend it for both casual and serious play.",2
"good game for people who like to build their own.....*wait for it* *wait for it* *wait for it* civilization. who woulda knew?",2
"ive played 19 hours in 3 days with a full time job, if thats not glowing reccomendation i dont know what is!",2
"this game just gets better and better. the spies can steal technologies, each ruler has specific unique qualities that reflect their place in history as well as offering opportunities to gain advantages over friends and the ai. the variance in map creation is also a blessing...it allows me to work on my weaknesses (naval battles) or cultivate creativity in new ways. the tech trees also help forge paths to specific victory conditions as well. just really fantastic gaming experience.",2
"awesome game for co-op or multiplayer, in depth and detailed.",1
"this is how tony abbot got his primeminister training. 10/10",3
"if you like games that keep you up until sunrise, then this is the game for you",3
"great game. it will ruin your life. seriously, buy this.",4
"if you like plotting revenge, or pre-venge, then this game is for you.",2
"intensely fun if you like turn based race games of which this franchise began (as far as i remember from my youth). a little buggy, but not so bad that it detracts from the game once you get in. in game animations go away durring multiplayer mode, which annoyed my brother but didnt bug me.",1
"this is a great game, however with the expansion packs it is soo much better. i highly reccomend god and kings expansion, the brave new world expansion is fun but not as good as the gnk expansion. many reviews stated this game was not as good as previous version, and indeed the early versions of this game were not, however with expansions and update it certainly is a good game.",2
"its a war strategy game that has a lot of customability. the game hardly decides anything for you and you control every factor. you dont even have to win by war you can win by culture, science, and even be elected world leader. watch a couple videos atleast. :)",5
"civilization v is one of the best strategy games i have ever played. its awesome! :d",1
"this game is recomended it is very fun but if you have a bad computer steer clear of multiplayer and if really bad dont buy the game till you get a better computer (trust me ik) over all pretty fun gme i believe it is worth time into it",1
"ghandi shoved an atomic bomb up my butt ghandiwillwreckyou/10",2
"way easy to learn and even easier to find yourself wasting hours playing",1
"a good improvement on civ iv (in my opinion a lowpoint of the series). still suffers from the typical civ end-game where every turn takes a very long time. the religion and trading systems are expanded upon in the dlc (brave new world), which add a new dimension to the game - trade is essential to stay afloat in the early game. a wide choice of countries and leaders and the hex tile system also add to the game. i wouldnt pay $50 for the dlc packs - they arent a whole new game.",1
"this is the very nice game fun with friends since new patch.",1
"one of the best 4x games on the market. only if you are willing to by the gods and kings and brave new world expansions as the base game is rather weak",1
"this game is so much better than beyond earth! beyond earth isnt that great of a game like this one, my favourite thing about this game is that you go up in ages from a round wheel to space age, but beyond earth its all in the same age with only technological upgrades and the units you get.. well lets just say theres not a lot. prefer this game 10 out of 10 than beyond earth! well lets just wait, the game was only recently released hoefully they will put in a lot more dlc into the game to make it more fun, at least put in more units than just the basic ones. still have no idea how to use the jets yet so complicated or maybe its just glitched out because i cant make them move any where around the map or to hover/guard a tile",1

"my absolute favorite game that i have ever played. i never get sick of it. everyone should get the experience of getting nuked by gandhi, attilas loud voice, and ruling the world.",3
"if you want a time machine; this game is perfect. you can launch the game at the start of the day and being called for dinner not long after.",1
"this is no mere game, it is a method for travelling forward in time ... while destroying spearmen with your tanks. time travel: 10/10 time wasting:10/10 historical accuracy 112/10",1
"just an amazing game. it really gives me something to do when i both want to learn about some history and play video games.",1
"i played for hundreds of hours just to quit or lose: 10 out of 10",3
"the only game where you can become germany and beat england in ww2. 10/10 would hitler again.",3
"quite frankly, few attributes of games ellicit such anger and discontent as those found rampantly within the broken and consistently inconsistent formula that constitutes this game, civilization v. other games offer more refined methods, with more visually and mechanically sophisticated gameplay options than can ever be conceived of within this joke of a strategy game.",1
"one of the most time consuming games i have ever played. spent hours playing through the tutorial.",1
"ghandi and napoleon conquer the world in the greatest conquest in the big  universe. no man, tank or nuke can stand a chance against ghandis elephants. 10/10 will fear ghandi",1
"lost hours of my life to this game in a matter of 2 weeks.",3
"10/10 by far one of the best and most fun strategy games ive played.",1
"a really great game. this is one of those games when you say, just another turn...3 hours later its 04:00 in the morning and ghandi nukes all your capital.",3
"the civilization series is not a game, it is a lifestyle, so much to the extent that your involvement in it will socially segregate you from those who are not familiar with it. 10/10 would lose any sense of normality again.",6
"are you a megalomaniac? do you enjoy thinking of the best way to achieve your global domination goals? do you revel in your insomnia? if so, youve found your game.",1
"playing a turn based game online that requires 250 turns to near complete any match makes me want to remove my eyes and wait for a brail moniter to see if this is any more pleasurable.",1
"wow. ive played this for, like, 50 hours, but only actually opened the game 7 times. wow.",1
"one of my favorite games of all time, ai pathing is a bit wierd but not all the time, a great amount of dlc and alot of fun if your willing to put in alot of hours",1
"so let me walk you threw this game. you start as a leader of some  and you try to nuke everyone on the map. that sums it up nice",1
"a very good game that lives up to its nickname, just on more turn the game. you can realy loose track of time while playing it. and if your the military type like me, then you will realy enjoy the giant death robots. also caesar is a jerk, kill him first.",1
"really. crate your own civilization and play ai or friends in multiple ways to victory!",5
"amazing strat game i reccomend for player who like strat and are patient",1
"i can lose entire weekends in this game. its a must have.",4
"bismarck backstabbed me and egypt stole my wonders 10/10",2
"i give this game a solid 10/10. i am a huge fan of the civilization series. in my opinion it helps me get over stress yet gets intense when your freind for example all of a sudden declares war and attacks you. it is one of the best games on the p.c in my opinion and with the current 50% off deal its a great game to go for.",2
"ive played the game quite a bit. id say its is pretty damn rad. and you should definitely get it.",2
"the game franchise speaks for itself. so, there is not much to add. for me, the best thing in civ is that i am never tired of it. i mean. sometimes i want to play something else, but after a few days or weeks i can play it again, as it was yesterday that i bought it. it fun for a long long time and so, buying it was well spent money.",4
"having played over 1000 hours on the game since i got it in june 2013, i have decided to write a review. this game is great game. it is slow paced but fun. this game will not be a game that you play for a hours because a game can be over 2 hours+ long because this game is adicting. when you play a game for over 26 hours straight you should know what an adicting game is. and this games theme is great and it is a key feature in the game, its nice and calm in peace tome but in war, it is loud and....epic! the theme alone will keep you playing this game. this game has one flaw... its way to fun and going away from it is hard. this game is such an improvment over civ 4 and is one that i play with respect and pride. if you get this game...good luck going away from it for times more than a month.",10
"really this is a yes and no recomendation i like the new map setup and no unit stacking but its too simplified and sure dlcs fix that but that is $60 usd for both",1
"bought this game about 2 weeks ago, can barely put it down. this game is really fun and has alot of playtime to offer. overall immortal is pretty insane. scouts turn into archers and maria theresa is overpowered. 10/10",1
"this is by far one of the best strategy games out there. i believe it is a huge improvement over civ 4. the dlc has touched most of what people had wrong with the game, however the best parts are some of those improvements over civ 4, such as no unit stacking.",1
"overall vastly superior to civ 4 but still lacks nuance with road building and other common actions. well worth the dlc investment too.",1
"simple, yet addicting turn-based strategy game that got me into the world of historical strategy games.",3
"sid meirs civilization v is a easy get to know if your a starter at strategy games. the dlcs add mroe complex things which allows the starter to enchance their experience and become a intermedient. civ v is basically a building block from where you can decide which strategy games you choose in the future that offer more challenging experiences. overall civ is a great game and is highly reccommend if your just getting insterested in stategy. if your a right on pro at strategy games get civ still because why not? greece pwns 10/10",7
"this game is so much fun, i couldnt think of any other way id rather waste an entire day lol",2
"fantastic game, doesnt take a bunch of skill to have fun",1
"built a massive technologically advanced army, and did nothing with it all game, later i watched ghandi nuke russia into submission 11/10 would watch gandhi destroy the world again.",2
"addicting as ever, i cant get enough of this game. love it!",3
"ive started a game at night and played until the sun came up. i had to go to school the next day.",5
"you can be george washington 11/3 ps: f*** you ghandi, f*** you!",3
"love playing rts games. its not a surprise when i lose full days in this game.",1
"this is by far my favourite pc game, with over 500 hours played. it captures historical events whilst creating a new world. an interesting and fun time waster :) idk 5 stars or some  :)",6
"i know for the moment that i only have around thirteen hours logged, but that was one game where i needed just one more turn. im too scared to go back... 10/10",1
"the game, without expansions, is fairly bare-bones, but it is well-designed and highly replayable for what it is.",1
"i enjoy this game very much. very fun turn based strategy game but can be drawn out at times",1
"5 minutes in: how the **** do i play this game 5 hours in: how the **** do i stop playing this game? 10/10",1
"best game ever. i can play this all over with excitement which is rare, and also problematic. 9.7/10",6
"i dont recommend this game at all. the ai is terrible in intelligence, and the difficulty levels are either incredibly too easy, or incredibly too difficult. there is no middle ground to really build your knowledge of the game easily. the diplomacy in the game is terrible, and their are not enough civs without shelling out more cash for dlc which unless you play the mods alot is total garbage. the only plus this game has to offer is the combat.",2
"i have two things to say about this. 1. nuking your friends is fun. 2. dont trust gandhi",1
"what can i say? this game is perfect example of strategies! begining with civ ii i walked this way along with civ, and i completely glad with this game! civ 5 has began a new age of strategies! and i recommend it to everyone!",1
"amazing game for anyone who has patience and wants to learn strategic planning in a (almost) pressure-free environment. games are quite long, but time sure goes by in the blink of an eye.",4
"great fun with friends (even if they do nuke you when your not looking) just dont expect to get through a game in 20 minutes!",1
"please disregard my play time as it has not saved. let me just say civ5 is a must have game for anyone, this is my favourite strategy game as of now and you should not miss out on a game this great!!!",1
"just one more turn. no, its never just one more turn. very addictive and fun. good for when you got a lot of time to spend.",1
"ive played them all (civ i through this one) and i like civ v the best *now* with the additional expansions. the hex-based map is much better for realistic environments and movement. single unit stacking is also much better - no more soak-off attacks (where you have a stack of spearmen with one modern armor and the enemy kills off your spearmen one at a time while your armor remains unharmed.) it also makes upgrading your military units important because now it matters if you are holding a mountain pass with a single legion versus using a rifleman unit. beyond combat there are a lot of nice additions with diplomacy, religion, and civics that give you more ways to play and win (replayability is very important to me.)",1
"this game is an exceptional experience; and for the record, this was my first civilization game! youll find yourself playing this for hours. hours will then turn into days, then days into weeks. its really that addicting.",2
"does your child stay up to strange hours of the night? does your child talk about improving faith or culture bombing? these may be signs of civilization v addiction civ is a very serious drug, it captivates the user for long hours, forcing them to want just one more turn together, we can stop it. talk to your kids about civ before someone else does",1
"good for hours of fun with yourself or friends dawg",1
"a really immersive and detailed game, that explores branches of strategy boldly. well worth my money, and i would urge everyone to try it.",1
"i have no idea what im doing. alexander is a . pharoh is too friendly. 11/10",1
"great game. i was intimidated by it to start but once i jumped in and just played it was awesome. lots to learn and a good time sinker.",2
"love this game. infinite replayability! the mod engine is superb as well, allowing some impressive customizations.",5
"this game is so fun! i always win by nukes, wait no its domination.",5
"great game, just get the whole package with dlcs, which isnt really hard because every now and then its on sale. did i mention that poland can into space ?! seriously this game is really addictive. i love it!",3
"i really enjoy this game it is good fun. one downside is that it is long, but in the same it is good for me anyway because i love games that take a while to complete. i recommend it to anyone that enjoys building, war, or just playing with friends",5
"got civilization v as a gift from a friend, took me awhile to install and test it out however since doing so i havent been able to stop playing. not a huge fan of turn based strategy games however civilization is slowly starting to become one of my favorite games. i know i am late to the party but i would recommend it to anyone who likes simulation or strategy based games.",1
"its the utimate game you start and a moment later its 15 hours later and if youre bored you can buy a new addon. i have now the main game, gods&kings and brave new world and you can see my playhours",5
"honestly this game is just awesome. buy it and waste your life away on it. there are like a million different ways to play and customize the game. tons of mods. youll have fun. buy it.",2
"this game is awesome doe, wonder why i didnt buy it until now.",1
"you can easily find yourself investing way too much time into this one, great game!",1
"this game is worth every penny. its easy to lose 12 hours in this game without even noticing",2
"while civ 5 seems very advanced in many ways, anyone could easily hop on and start learning how to play: easy to learn, hard to master. civ 5 is kind of like a gateway into strategy games... the strategy game for dummies. honestly, most of the game seems to be based on numbers. in a real strategic situation, things are a little more advanced. like even if a division of ww2 infantry were to face a division of musketmen, the musketmen could outstrategize them and win. but technological advancements are well implemented. effects of nukes dont seem as catastrophic or remorseful after you use them. lots of wonderful touches added, all dlc heavily reccomended. being able to win other than by world domination is very cool. but all in all about... 8.25/10",2
"why does this game take so long to do things, it is just a map",1
"had a 2,000 year war with germany just cause they wanted my second city, and when they finally allowed me to negotiate peace everyone else started hating them. skip ahead 2,000 more years the second war with germany has begun, hopefully it will end it all - 10/10 would fight wars again",2
"adikted morfius be. haz played mor than a liftym. killd many people.",2
"almost as good as civ iii with better graphics and some of the worthy features from iv. unfortunately no map editor to make your own boards .",4
"phenomenal game. have over 100 hours and it still gets better everytime i play.",5
"just one more turn... is all you going to say after you found out that youve played a map for all the night.",3
"another improvement on the classic civilaztion series. this version is better looking and more playable that the last few. the changes deemphasize massive stacking of armies making the conquest game much more strategic. im even looking forward to trying out a cultural victory.",1
"endless fun when playing against muslim, communist america!",5
"a fantastic strategy game that youll spend hours playing! youll only spend more and more time as you pick up on how the mechanics of the game work!",1
"one of the best incarnations of the civ series. i know a lot of the hardcore players mourn the loss of the unit stack, but i prefer the one unit per tile style, even if the implementation has a few issues. with so many difficulty options, i recommend this to just about anyone. start on the easy difficulty and work your way up. im still missing a win on the absolute top difficulty, but ill get it eventually!",2
"not as good as civ 4 but still great in its on right",1
"hours and hours of fun... just make sure you have hours and hours to play it. you can save at any time, but its one of those games youll intend on playing for 30 minutes, and instead staying up for 3 hours with it.",1
"watch before your very eyes as entire day vanishes whilst you give gandhis swarm of knights a nuclear suppository.",2
"would reccomend for new strategy game players, it has great tutorials and explenations. also, looks pretty and is very addictive.",1
"11/10, a realistic experience ~ would love to get nuked by ghandi again",1
">long time player >played a game with ethipoia and india >turns out ethipoia doesnt care about food when both ethipoia and gundi both nuke you on the same turn >good game would get nuked by peace leader and a starving country again 420/10",2
"i have always loved civ and have played them all since original and i love this iteration. my favourite change is making each hex only able to be occupied by one military unit. no more single stacks of doom, your units will need flank and rear protection to be successful.",5
"games can take days depending on your settings and yet i have never been bored of the game. each game is different on its own or you can proceed to victory in different ways. at this point i have spent more then 200 hours playing the game and it is the first game i install when i format my pc. if you like turn based strategies you will love this game.",3
"i dont know if its my computer or the game,but its not letting me play.",1
"ghandi was being a smartass and then the game froze. i re-loaded it and ghandi was still a smartass.",1
"i though this was the worst strategy game ever... i was wrong! with the brave new world this game is one of the bests. it is hard to learn and boring to wait turns but diplomacy, war, trades, civilization... every single this is great. buy it.. no no wait... buy both civi 5 and the next game: beyond earth...",1
"awesome game. i wish there was a more efficient way to play with friends.",2
"trust ghandi. as in trust that he will stab you in the back if you dont kill him first. warlord ghandi simulator v.",1
"this is an exceptionally great turn based strategy game. i havent played many other games like this but it has encouraged me to. i actually hadnt played the other 4 games in the civilization series and i found getting into the game a bit tricky but with the help of some mates and the wiki i managed to love the game. i ended up creating a relatively awesome empire only to be crushed by a backstabbing friend. so if youre wondering wether to buy this game or not i would recommend you do and buy the dlc brave new world, it adds so much and makes it so much better. buy it, get into the game and start up with your friends.",1
"its a great game if you like the genre. brave new world is very well balanced imo.",8
"make an empire and take over the world! *evil diabolical laughter* also, make nukes, giant robots and go to space i mean whats not to like?",1
"when superstorm told me to get civ v, i didnt think it was an invitaion to become and all-powerful god. this strategy game provides the experience of becoming an influential, powerful leader from history. you can declare war, trade, conquer, and make powerful allies. one con is that its really upsetting to lose a game after youve worked really hard, so if youre new to civ v prepare for the worst. overall, this game was exciting, interesting, thrilling, and has amazing graphics. 9/10.",1
"this has been one of my favorite games ive played and has been incredibly addiciting. the amount of detail and work that went into this game is extraordinary. while i did play civilization iv before, this game seemed entirely new and revamped. it is somewhat dificult to learn because of its complexity but once learned is a very entrenching and enjoyable game. my one complaint would be some issues with the ai in that there are many times in which units forget what they were automated to do. very fun game, nontheless.",2
"very fun if you like strategy games (cpus can be a pain because they refuse to make fair trades). it can be a little confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it you cant stop playing. you can have a lot more fun if you have a friend to play it with.",1
"after many hours of play i can say this game ruined my life.",2
"excellent game.i started playing on civ 2 and have played each one (2,3 &4) to death, i expect that civ 5 will be the same. :)",1
"its a perfect example of a series thats getting close to perfection, step by step. the new improvements are great and feel like theyve been there all along. a must-buy for the fans and a great way for newcomers to finally get familiar with the series.",1
"can lose myself for hours in this game, well worth trying out.",2
"this is a fun / calming game it takes forever and is turnbased",3
"very good game runs well and would highly recommend dlcs as well",2
"the ultimate turnbased game made better! its not uncommon to find yourself playing civ5 for hours on end... just one more turn.",3
"for the first game you will hate it but after u play civ u cant stop",1
"i launched a cruise missle at polands missionaries... they denounced me 10/10",1
"amazing game that forces you to balance between being nice with others and destroying your enemies to expand your empire.",4
"very fun game with dlc. the randomization helps make every round different.",1
"this game is fantastic. i love the new hex tiles, it makes if feel like the settlers of katan board game.also the fact there can only be one military and one civilian unit per tile is great. i play coop with my friends all the time.",2
"stunning and beautifull graphics, immence gameplay x",1
"absolutely fantastic game. this version is slightly complex for a casual gamer, but still great nonetheless.",1
"civilization 5 is the primary reason of my having a steam account 10/10",4
"great fun game which runs smoothly and doesnt crash",2
"i love this game and others like it. i can sit down to play and before i know it the sun has set. its a great game!",3
"simply one of the best strategy games of all times! its just too addictive! and to the newcomers, buy it! you wont regret!",1
"ruined my life? well, thats pretty big talk from someone who isnt the empress of greece.",3
"this game is amazing. definitely have to dedicate a good chunk of time if you want to play online, but it is well worth it.",2
"a massive time killer, well worth every hour given over. civ 5 is a solid advancement to the series. the expansions are fantastic, though it can take awhile to adjust to new features. overall a solid investment.",3
"if you value your life, job, family or ever having free time again, do not play this game! just one more turn...",3
"an amazing grand statagy game, i could go on forever about how fun this game is. i feel that this is the most accesable of its genre and has the most content. the game allows you to choose what you want to do as the leader of your own empire. you can dominate the world as a warlord or create peaceful treties with foriegn nations. this game has so many vastly different civilizations and map variations to chose from. moding capabilities also add much aditional content. if your someone like history such as myself you will love the scenarios mode which allows you to live out famous battles or events in history. i feel that once you have knoweldge of the games victories, and civilizations the game is best ejoyed with firends, this is bery easy because of local games wich allow one of you to host and game and play togather. this game has so many amzing features and is accesable to everyone 9/10.",2
"really awesome turn-based strategy. better than the original, with awesome strategic and tactical options, and great graphics. it has less replay value than civ 4 though, as after a dozen games you will fully understand all the nuances, and the additional downloads offer little of interest for spicing things up.",5
"i love strategy based games, and this is by far the most fun.",1
"10/10 - i have to stay away from the game unless im willing to give up a week marathoning game after game because i cant bring myself to stop. just one more turn... *seven hours later* oh look, sunlight.",1
"i really recommend this game, its always fun to play a couple of hours, and rule the world",1
"this game is unique in so many levels. they make all the leaders act the same as if in real life and every difficulty has a diffrent strategy that only trial and error can solve. will you be warlike? or cultural? or even a gleaming beam of hope of technological wonders can your civilization hold as you conquer barbarian nations. can your empire stand the test of time?",3
"vanilla civ v is good; civ v with the expansions is great. whenever i start to get bored with this game, i just install new mods, and its fun again.",5
"i have been playing civilization games since i was about 8 and have always been impressed. it has only gotten better over the years. if you like turned-based strategy games with multiple ways and fun interactiveness, then this is the game for you.",2
"the game is good with brave new world. complete edition is recommended.",4
"truely the epitome of addiction. if you have a lot of time to kill, or any time at all, play this game. not recommended to be played before you have to go to school, work, etc. though, because the one more turn philosophy is all too real, and soon turns into the four hours later philosophy.",4
"just one more turn should be the motto for this game",1
"beautiful graphics, and a great strategy game. if you have some time on your hands, pick up civ v. rating:",1
"one of the best strategy games out there. the dlcs are pricey, but 35 for the base game + all dlc is a good deal in my opinion. would definitley recommend this to anyone looking for a fun strategy game! :)",1
"afer all the updates, this game is finally equall and better than civ iv. it has taken some time but here it is!anyway, i hope that sid lets the civ franchise at rest for a while and remakes the glorious alpha centauri.",1
"what can i say? its a fun game with lots of time to be put into it. even as much as ive played it, theres a lot i have yet to do. civilization may be stategy lite, but its by no means shallow, and this game is no exception. if you have the oppurtunity to check it out and you enjoy strategy game of any type, its well worth the money and time.",1
"vanilla - 9/10 with g&k and bnw - 10/10 moddable beyond all reason - 11/10 love the  out of this game, now im gonna go back to playing it.",2
"a bit slow, but fun and rewarding when you get something accomplished or look back at all the progress youve made. but i speak as someone with no multiplayer experience in this game. so... yeah.",2
"this game will keep you up to all hours of the morning becuase of just one more turn",2
"awesome to play with few people, but only if you can afford to buy all expantions. if not then simply buy one of previous parts.",3
"i have been a civ fanatic since the dawn of civilization (pun intended). i held off on getting civ v due to all the negative reviews and comments about it. im really sorry that i did. civ v has to be the greatest of all civ games to date! games go much faster than in previous versions, are more challenging, and present so many more variables to allow for greater replay value. if you havent gotten civ v yet do yourself a favor and do so (goty is the best bang for your buck!)...and be sure to pick up the newest expansion too!",2
"civ v is another great game from the long line of sid meier. utilizing past titles and some newfound ideas, the game comes together to make an even more realistic civ building game. the variety of difficulty settings keep the game interesting and challenging for people of all levels of experience. i look forward to the next civ game.",2
"a soon as you start and get to know the game you just cant stop!! you always want more!  thats why we dont have peace in the world! this game show incredibly well why!",1
"cant get enougth of this game after my first 300 hours ofgameplay i still found new ways of having fun in it,good and huge amounts of content and very easy to learn but hard to win sometimes. the ai is not that bad as in tradicional strategy games and it actual makes the experience better when u have 5 civs going for a win all in diferents ways i love this game to much can get enought of it and i recomendet to everyone newcomer to the franchise or hardcore gamer srry for any english related error",9
"civ 5 is just an amazing game if you have both expansions, brave new world and gods+kings. if not, then the game will suck. so it is basically a dlc-driven game which is not that recommendable, but the game is just so great and soooo addictive. man. never support a dlc . except for this one. go get it.",2
"i want to play as hitler not bismark.  would go down so differently",1
"it is soooooooooooo awesome!!! no, but seriously, you got to play this. psssst. play it!!!",2
"overy adicting at first, will destroy(or improve) your weekends. after you beat it though, it stops being adicting and becomes repetative.",1
"great strategy, although some glitches if you are running an extremely long game. my friends and i hotseat alot on his computer and i finally bought it for solo play. great game",1
"buy it. you will not regret it. i have over 450 hours and i still play this game like the day i first got it",5
"really fun game in my opinion its better with brave new world but even the base game but for 30 extra dollars its tottaly worth your money",2
"with both expansions this game rivals all other civilizations. a solid 10/10.",1
"have only played in local co-op and have enjoyed that, will probably make further comments as i play in sp. have satellite for internet so that does limit my games that i can play.",1
"while not as good as civilization 4, still a worthy title for the civ franchise and the expansions make is much more deep.",2
"a series of games that fills a niche market but, does it so well that i feel compelled to buy every new release. civ v is no different and despite having some early woes from incompatability issues (since have been fixed) you have game that is one of the most time consuming, all encompassing, and cognative to be released. at least until civ vi that is.",1
"a masterpiece in turn based strategy. if on sale, i highly recommend buying the complete edition as the dlcs completely change and improve the gameplay. ai players can be annoying in single player by refusing to work with you but if you have 3 or 4 friends to play with it is a much better experience.",2
"great game! a pain in the  at times, but definitely worth playing! a good challenge.",2
"its the best i bet its better with dlc i havnt bought them yet but they must be good!!!!",1
"an interesting read for children of all ages, sid meiers fantastic four v is a twist on the fps genre with its inclusion of a fully interactional book store. i gotta say though, i thought the lack of avengers in this game was disappointing. i still have hope for a crossover event come the next game, though. choice/10",2
"this game is absolutely amazing. egypt and i(mongolian empire) have made it into the 20th century. didnt see that one coming now did you history?",1
"it took me 104 hours, but i finally won my first civ 5 game. as george washington, world leader, i wiped ghandi off the map before he could screw me over like usual. using my christian nuclear arsenal, i erased him from history. when his epitaph played and america immediately immediately began a golden age despite everyone in the world denouncing me, i popped a raging boner making all 104 hours worthwhile.",1
"it took three years, but civ v has finally gone from the unplayable, bug-ridden horrifically balanced turdfest that it was when first released to something almost as good as civ iv bts in some aspects, and better than the previous game in many others.",3
"im queen elizabeth ii and i cant invade malaysia, oh wow... anyway, good game, even though im not a fan of this type of game...",1
"most fun ive had on a terribly optimized game since alan quake.",1
"best mmo i think ive ever played, check out my channel @ hornetgame on youtube for some playthrough stuff!",2
"awesome game, great polish and presentation, very easy to get started, and can really eat up your time into the wee hours of the night, in a fun way. with the newer patches, the game has become very strong in all modes. playing with friends is a blast. it gets better with time, and the new scenarios help mix up single player and add value to the dlc. all the civ dlc is pretty good, nebuchadnezzar is not quite worth it however. the map packs are a bit weak, as maps are random normally, and you can get map mods for free if you want specific maps. the developers are really showing this game love and support, so give it a chance.",2
"its no 3 but its still better than 4. ghandi is a , btw. 10/10 would nuke him again.",1
"love this game. 14/15 as the multiplayer is a little shabby.",2
"i cant start the game... i press play on the steam menu i choose the recommended directx 11 and what happens is a black screen pops up and then closes instantly... when i choose directx 9 the same thing happens, no errors pop up and i belive all my system requirement are met for the game. any help??",1
"one...more...turn...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. problem: several of the steam achievements appear to be broken. the game itself is fantastic (definitely go for gods and kings - the extra features are certainly worth it).",1
"another times with civilization. i have been play a lot of civ iv now its come to another level, new block model from squre to hexagon. its make tiles and river look really better, the zoom in-moving animals and troops. and the expansion with relogion and all other stuff. for me its another great game, and worth for 22.49 usd",1
"a very addicting game. youll find yourself thinking just one more turn indeed... ...to the point of forgetting how much time passed. i found myself thinking this would have a very high learning curve, after hearing all the strategy needed to play a civilization game (this is the first in the civ series that ive played), but soon found out that its not so bad once you get the hang of the gameplay.",1
"i used to think this would be to hard for me to play, but when i started its was easy and fun. i recommend this game.",1
"one of the greatest strategy games i have ever played.",3
"want a nice casual game to play? well then buy another game. civ5 is an addicting game to where it has you saying just one more turn and boom 20 turns later you have conquered a nation, built numerous armies, and researched new tech. get this game if you love strategy and you want to waste your life away playing this for days. #onemoreturn",1
"civilization v is the best game in the series yet. the gods and kings and brave new world expansions are crucial to the experience, although the base game is decent on its own. these expansions make the culture victory possible and interesting, which adds a nice counter to military and technology.",3
"if you liked all the other civ games, then you will not be disapointed. the depth is insane, however, single player is not where this game shines, got a friend who likes historical turn based strategy? then go for it, if not....",1
"probably myfavorite fps. has a lot of the core elements in any good shooter.",1
"the game is great if it does not crash you system everytime you play. i am playing on a razer edge pro with touch screen. if you look at the adds for this rig the screen shows this game. soooo disapointed. these guys should not get another penny till they work out the bugs. just uninstalled :( cant take it anymore. will never buy a k2 game again",1
"the intro animation was breathtakingly beautiful. so much so, that i still let it run completely before i start to play the video game itself. not just the animation, but the music and voices! astounding! okay, now about the game. i love it!!!!! needless to say, ive spent hours playing it. i havent done this in ages. its just...mesmerizing, gripping and just plain fun! this isnt the first sid meier game ive played. the first one was for the atari st platform, way back in the late 80s, a wwii submarine sim. i highly recommend this game. i hope there is a part vi.",3
"such a great game. really deep system that makes you really get attached to your civ with so many different ways to play it.",1
"my friends think im the biggest warmongering son of a gun out there. some people call me a terrorist. i like to think of myself as a techer. they cower behind their embaroing and diplomacy i prefer the title as an opportunnist. 10/10",4
"this game makies the hours you are playing it seem like minutes",10
"brilliant, hours of fun, a natuarl evolution of the series",1
"this game has very fun single player that i have spent hours on my only complaint is the fact the multiplayer is very weak",1
"sid meiers once again astonishes me. this game is more than genius. 10/10",1
"the origional game, gods and kings, and brave new world are $15 through the humble bundle for 10 more days, so get it.",4
"this is a game that focuses mainly on combat and not much else. you wont find as much depth in here as you will in the previous civ titles.",1
"this game is pretty rad, but only comparable to civ4bts with all the expansions. best wait for a sale on the whole package beore picking up, kek",1
"this game wont let you sleep. it keeps you awake all night like a cursed monolith. the song of the universe plays in your ears as you occupy yourself with the trivial natures of this planet alone.",1
"i recommend this game alot. if you play it multiplayer it might be a bit laggy, but it still works. its a really good game where you can challenge the ai in a stragetic game with no possible way of nothing how theyll react.",2
"this game was reccomended to me by a few friends, and when i bought it, i was sceptical. but now, with nearly one thousand hours on record, that scepticism is gone. the game of civilization is great both on the surface levels with basic gameplay, and in the more strategic and complex features. anybody can play this game, the turn based aspect is great for people like me who like to think about every move before they make it. the only thing that i will caution you about is the fact that the ai hold grudges bigtime, as in you will declare a war and take one small city (not even the capital) and another player will hold it against you for four thousand years... i know this from experience. 10/10",10
"fantastic game, highly recommend for all who like strategy games. drops you in a vast world with total freedom to build your empire. you settle cities, build militaries, and try to make your civilization the best one. worth every penny i paid. 10/10",2
"very fun game where you can command one of many civilizations from around time. go to war with montezuma as george washington with genghis khan at your side, or generate tourism for your civ. fly into space, or be elected world leader. infinite replay value. the expansion packs and civilization dlcs (korea, polynesia, babylon, denmark) add a lot to the game, and made my playthroughs a lot more fun. brave new world, the second expansion, really fleshed out cultural victories. mods add a lot of content to the game, including maps, civilizations, and scenarios. anyways, this is a great game, and i personally cannot wait for civilization: beyond earth next fall. 9.5/10",1
"great strategic gameplay. unfortunately the games seem to go on and on and on. still a good game. 7/10",1
"any multiplayer game lets you stab your friends in the back, but only civ lets you keep pushing the same knife in deeper for weeks at a time!",1
"great game i love it!! nice graphics also and i love the gameplay",1
"love it, have over 300 hrs. not the game. would definitely recommend to people.",3
"one of the best civ games out there, i wont debate with you why i think its one of the best, but i will concede that its has to be at least in the top 3 sid meier games. i dont think i have to explain why i love civilization games, i mean civ 1 came out in 1991 and sid meier has been making games since 1982 (thanks wikipedia for having a sid meier page) overall civilization games have been one of my favorite strategy games out there and i hope that the upcoming civilization: beyond earth (can anyone say alpha centauri?) is also a smashing success!",1
"yup, lost many hours with this game! will be losing many more, too.",2
"better then ever with the gods and kings expansion.",2
"such an addictive game def. a must buy if you can snach it up during the sale.",1
"played the tutorial for 1 hour 40, realised i couldnt save, had to start over, cba.",1
"loved this game! a little bit of a steep learning curve for a civ noobie such as myself but the game teaches you well. very deep gameplay!",1
"the best civ game ever made :d if you get civ 5 make sure to get brave new world because it makes the game 1000x better.",1
"a game youll probably keep coming back to. replayability over years in my experience.",2
"took a while to get used to as this game is quite different from its predecessor; however, i felt that this is one of the best ever in the series.",5
"one of the best game i goten off steam so far. totaly worth it",1
"the civ we all know and love. better than ever. and just as addicting. looks beautiful too.",1
"i never learned how to tune a harp, or play upon a lute, but i know how to raise a small and obscure city into glory and greatness. the great questions of the day will not be settled with means of speaches and majority descisions, but by iron and blood.",3
"i love the sid meiers civs games i play it a lot and recommend it to any one whos thinking of get it",2
"this game is somewhat enjoyable, but with its frequent crashes (just about every 5 minutes) and multitude of bugs, i would call it a waste of money. also, the steam forum for this game is full of people saying that they are experiencing these crashes. it may have something to do with windows 8.1.",1
"you can destroy gandhi and everything he stands for. 10/10",1
"great game if you like strategy and wars games. you dont need to like turn-based games to like this one.",1
"lots of fun. great game to dump a couple hours into after work.",2
"i set up a game to reinact ww2. it was an 8 player game with the chinese, japanese, germans, russians, polish, americans, british and i played the french. i minded my own business until just before the modern era, the germans unloaded a full scale assault on paris. i wasnt surprised. everything was going according to plan until the americans backstabbed me at orleans. it was completely uncalled for. the historical inaccuracies really bring this game down from a 10/10 to a 5/10. would not recommend ever playing the french. much betrayal, such conspiracy, so war.",2
"one of the best games of all time, ive played hours online with my friends and the game is definately worth every penny. even if ghandi is a war mongering nuke master.",2
"this is a phenomenal game for any ability. when i first started i wasnt the greatest and now i have progressed and am alright. it is an incredible single playe game and is equally as good multiplayer seriously recommend this but its nowhere near as good without bnw.",3
"i love the game ive playedb 140 hours of it in 1 month",6
"just buy it if you havent, worth the money. get the expansions aswell, theyre amazing. as in the game itself, you spend countless hours with different civilzations that you can play as on different kinds of maps that you choose. theres a lot of types of victory; being science, culture, diplomatic, dominance, etc. theres different eras you progress through and with science you get new buildings, units, etc. i have spent a lot of hours into this game and im still not bored of it.",2
"i really love this game. i highly recommend it. each new civ game just gets better and better.",6
"buy. this. game. i have over 400 hours invested into this game and it has not gotten boring yet. make sure you get the downloadable content with it. it makes a huge difference and brings all new and exciting ways to play to the table. you have to be careful when playing this game because you will start playing and bam next thing you know you have been playing for 6 hours straight. one of the best games i have ever bought. there is one con to this game. when playing online make sure you try and play with all human players so there are few or no ais playing with you. this is because for some reason the ais wont declare war on anyone while it is in online mode. they will in single player, just not online. honestly that is the only negative thing i have found about this game. word of advice, the zulus are s and mahatma gandhi is an even bigger . 9.5/10",4
"greatest strategy game ive ever played, so detailed and submerssive.",7
"one of the best games ever! :d recommended for everyone who wants a strategy game. i mean, everyone!",1
"you came to  es and buy civ 5. have you bought civ yet?",2
"ghandi is a warmonger. russia never has oil. france always starts wars. america seems to stay out of trouble. horses are useless. 10/10 most historically accurate game",2
"so much fun, be prepared to spend countless hours.",1
"this turned based strategy game will suck away your life. would recommend.",2
"has to be the best so far, esp with dx11 - cant beat some nukes and bombers!!",2
"as someone who is no fan of the other civ games, i went into this with no expectations for enjoyment. i was so wrong! great game and with gods and brave new world it is fully featured to make even the critics enjoy it. just one warning. do not start a game at night, you will not be going to bed if you do!",1
"this game is amazing. if you like those 3rd person world control games, like halo wars or command & conquer, this game is for you.",1
"wow this game and the depth you can control your civ and your relationships with other civs is really mmmrglmmm. get it 10/10 would buy again.",1
"youll decide to play for an hour and youll realize four days later that your wife left you, but youre so close to killing that scumbag gandhi that it doesnt even matter. 20/10",1
"cant start it up most of the time one of the glitchiest games for me and i no longer own it and must re-purchase it because it hates me.",1
"if you are looking for a game to spend hours upon hours playing and not even realize it, this is the game for you. visually its stunning and its a ton of fun to play. war is tactical, no longer stack attack until you win and city/empire management is wonderful. 5star in my opinion :)",3
"i have played almost 180+hrs and would recondmend to almost anyone. if you get it you should pick up the gods and kings expansion (assuming it doesnt come with you verson) it just makes it a better game. i played without g/k once and nearly cried.",3
"15.6 hours and i havent even finished the first game i played. an incredibly addicting game, if you dont own it, buy it. it should be a staple of every steam library.",1
"i have only played civ v for about 2 hours now, having never played a single game of sid meiers, let alone really and turned based strat games in general. so far i can tell and understand why the hype for this game is so big. yes at first it seems like it has a decently big learning curve, i was kind of overwhelmed at first with what i was supposed to be doing etc. but the nice thing about it is that instead of having to go through a huge tutorial for an explanation, it tells you what you should be doing while you are starting off your country. i like it a lot!",1
"if you have never played a turn-based strategy game before make this the first one that you get. it plays beautifully and its extremely easy to learn the basics and from there you can do pretty much anything and trust me when i say the fun never ends i hope that if you get this game please play with your friends first because the online can be a scary place with unpredictable people. may your civs forever prosper (unless they are nuked) :)",1
"its a civilization game; growth, resource management, expansion and exploration, trading, diplomacy, conquest... the list goes on. after over 500+ hours playing (mostly single player) i can say i more than got the money i spent out of this game--and i still havent touched any of the scenarios, community mods or even organized multiplayer beyond just me and a couple friends.",6
"great game if you are looking for a way to make make a world the way you think it should be run. if this is not enough for you than civ 5 a brave new world will improve the game to make it better than it already is.",4
"a good update to a good series. with the brave new world expansion, i think this beats out civ iv, which is no small feat. civ v is a very addicting game and easy to lose track of time in. the game can go many different directions. in addition, the modding community is very strong with a lot of really cool mods.",2
"this game is extremely addictive. the interface is easy to use and the game has an excellent tutorial system, which doesnt get in ones face too much. if youre a fan of strategy videogames or settlers of catan, i highly recommend this.",2
"this game is amazing. i was really hesitant to it as i have not been a huge fan of these rts type games. however, civ 5 is still an extremely fun game that everyone should play.",1
"this game is highly addictive and will claim hours of your free time. the mods that are created for this game are also well worth the time to try out.",2
"i find this game to be extremely captivating. i cant seem to stop playing it in my free time. it can be as easy or as challenging as you would like it to be. wrap it up with the sdk tool, and you can create a scenario with nearly endless possibilities. its definitely worth the investment.",1
"great game for turn based strategy (tbs) fans. some of the modifications made the game concepts change from previous version, but the changes were for the better.",7
"fantastic turn-based rpg. this game gets a ton of flak from traditional civ fans, but the new interface creates a fresh new experience that you are just as likely to unwittingly spend hours playing. modding community is terrific, and adds hundreds if not thousands of hours to this already immense game. though i have 200+ hours logged, i have barely scratched the surface of content in this game.",3
"civ v gods and kings is a good game to play although it an older virsion than brave new world dlc its a great virsion",1
"please dont buy this game. it will corrupt you. you seen frodo with that ring - its like that but much worse. my friend has been driven to constant paranoia for fear of nuclear strikes. if you choose to buy this game, run away, hide, kiss your children goodbye, cos nothing will be able to save you.",8
"yes. this game is very strategic. the base game is as completely awesome as it seems. the trailer tells all. however, if you like getting emerged in to games, this game is just okay for it. its an awesome multiplayer experience and probably the best of all the civilization games in the series. altogether, the game is about a 7/10. the game supports workshop as well, which is always nice. i just wish you could get more emerged and feel like youre really in the game. the music is very nice as well. nothing is better than dominating the world and nuking and obliterating anyone who stands in your way!",4
"i love this game, one of the best strategy games i have ever played.",1

"this game drains my soul and makes my dinner always late t_t",4
"what can i say about civ 5? it is the greatest strategy game ever made thus far, and i doubt that will change until civ 6. sid meir is single handedly dragging the stratagy genre through a time when strategy games are about as popular g.w bush. there is no reason to have steam and not own this game. it is the greatest concept ever conseived by a games designer. now put down your tools workers and worship at the feet of or lord, sid meir. 10/10",1
"this game is one of my favorite strategy game! like c&c!",3
"if you have a few years to spare this game is perfect :d",2
"bismarck is worse than gandhi, dont trust him or he will redefine your friendship.",4
"hi i havent got chance to play it as i have been crashing out on the loading screen going into a game or once i get into a game the screen flashes black but the mouse key still has the theme. can you please help ive tried all that i know",1
"phenominal game. theres no point in which i get tired playing civ 5. its so much strategy and history slammed together to make one amazing game. my favorite thing about this game is it breaks down the elements of society. are you freedom based? do you want extra happiness from wars? are you an autocrat? in a word, excellent.",4
"the first civ game ive ever played and it makes me wonder what i missed out on before! its an extremely addicting game that is relatively easy to pick up. at the same time, im always learning something new too. the dlcs add a lot of interesting concepts to the game and i would recommend them if you can get them at a good price. for the amount of time ive put in, this game and additional content is well worth the prices (especially since i got it during the steam summer sale!). just remember to look out the window, stand up and get back to the real world every now and then!",3
"civ 5 is one of those games that you can just never get away from.",1
"truly amazing! the first time i played this game i did not stop playing for 6 hours straight and by then it was 2 a.m. i recommend this game to casual and veteran stratagists alike.",1
"civilization is the leader in turn based strategy games and civ 5 represents the series well, go play it right now.",1
"addicting!!! watch the clock when you are playing this game because time will get away very easy! the games very good though there are some little things like getting a boat traped when another player buys slots around it and if you move it war breaks out.....but other than that its a very good game if you like board games like settlers of katan this is the game for you! (dont know if katan is the name but it sounds right)",1
"in all honesty, a game that is fun for the first few days but got boring really fast. there was no editor and really nothing else to do but the campaign. the mods were fun and entertaining for a long period but also got boring. not game worth 60$ but if they added some extra stuff i would definately buy it for 60$ again.",4
"awesome gameplay features, truly a game for the strategic mind. a easy game to play, yet difficult to master. the wide array of features and multiplayer possibilities can make one wish they could play all day. all day or for an hour every once in a while the singleplayer mode can be just as challenging and equally as entertaining. a 10 out 10 game!",2
"i wake up and look outside to see a great day.  i think i might go outside today. i say. but steam pops up on my desktop.  but look jake, my pc teases.  i have civ 5 up for you and only one more turn wouldnt hurt. i sit down and look at my screen and think  whats the worst thing that can happen? days later my finger sting from the blisters covering them. my steam feed says 420 hrs. in last week. i crawl to my bed and fall back asleep only to repeat the cycle again tommorow.",2
"a fun game with many different ways to play it, enough dlc to keep you busy, and enough mods to let you pit darth vader against tiber septim would buy again",1
"this game is probably the best strategy game i have played in quite some time. best advice is to not let time get the best of you cause it will slip away quickly. civilization v requires lots of patience and to think on every early and late game move you make . i strongly recommend this if you are veteran strategist or new to the genre.",2
"epic game, emotional and stratigic! quite relaxing. 8/3",1
"the classic turn-based strategy is back with new features and little things here and there to improve gameplay. improved graphics, diplomacy, and just overall strategic options. its still the civilization we know and love.",5
"im currently caesar destroying ethiopia in battle. i also push my religion of three-legged man and my beautiful, massive, market onto every neighboring nation. its a good way to spend a week.",1
"great game, but what else would you expect from a sid meier. though dont play expecting iv, and dont be surprised when your ai friends go full  and stab you in the back as soon as they get a chance. still an amazing game, hence all those hours ive put in. aslo, buy all the expansions before judgeing. civilization v isnt very good on its own to be honest. but if you like turn based games and building a civilization of beauty and science or just wanna watch the world burn before your very eyes then buy this game. warning:good 4x games will take your life away and time will dissapear. rating: 10/10",4
"been a fan of civilization and other sid meiers games since i started playing pc games. this one will not let you down and the vastness of cheap dlc that enhance the base game and throw new challenges make for an easy thumbs-up on this game. buy at whatever price and rack up on the dlc when it goes on sale.",10
"this game is one of the best strategy games ive ever played i recommend it to anyone who is a war buff or history fan or rts player",5
"im sorry to say that a did not like this game at all. compared to the empire games it is very childish and slow. building armies and cities and improving an economy takes hours. it is difficult to get into.",1
"too many hours in this game. just one more turn ;)",4
"have poured so many hours of my life into this game, definatley reccomend getting this game",6
"be prepared to have a 12 hour gaming session, set the game down for 4-6 months, and then pick it up again for another half-day session. this game is a good way to sink a ton of time, but gets repetitive fairly fast.",2
"very good strategy game.exceeded my expectatons.solid gameplay and easy to learn.9/10",1
"everybody go and throw money at it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",3
"this game is amazing, i can spend hours playing and not even realize",1
"glad i finally listened to my friends and gave this one a try. two thumbs up, love it!",1
"so there i was minding my own business building structures in the name of montezuma when my next door neighbor arabia(historically accurate btw) invades with thirteen units. so i hold up in a city with my three units and they give me money. then i look south and decide to invade america with sweden. me and swedeland are now best buds. but that dont matter because on another continent xerxes is building a spaceship and theyre arent any trojan condoms around. so as a last ditch effort i send two cruisers a carrier and the enola gay to nuke there capital. 10/10",2
"great game, one of my favourite strategy games of all time. i highly suggest playing this game with the dlcs as the vanilla civ 5 is not as fun as compared to it with all/most of the dlcs. perfect for all lengths of play. you can win through various ways such as complete domination over everyone. i wouldnt suggest buying it at its full price, although the game does go on sale often so just wait for it go on sale and snag the dlcs along with it. youll soon see yourself spending hours on this game.",3
"excellent strategy game. matches can last for hours. playing with friends online or via lan is loads of fun. highly recommend.",2
"although i miss a few things from civ 4, its an amazing game from an amazing series. since no-ones ever made a remake of alpha centauri, this is the best 5x game.",4
"great strategy game, takes a little getting used to but definitely worth the time to play.",1
"my friends were taking washington, and i decided to intervene and do the last bit of damage. i lost two friends, but i now own washington. 9/11",1
"love it. just love it. so in depth. i played this game in a free trial when beyond earth came out, and i couldnt stop playing it. i now have to wait until christmas before the next big sale until i will get the game, and i am dying. i might not survive... if you have the money, get it.",1
"spent an hour just on tutorials because it was so addicting.",1
"omg the clicking! love this game, love the dlc, but i do not love that i never seem to have enough time for one more turn. ive played for more than 400 hours, and there are things in this game i have yet to experience. worth. every. penny.",5
"a great game that you can spend hours just playing through one match and end up getting rocked by another civilization. watch out for ghandi especially because he is a sneaky one. i would suggest at some point in time in trying out the game difficulty diety because it is quite the challenge. i never played a civ game until recently and have enjoyed everything about the game and expansions of the game. a casual strategy game that can get intense at any moment.",10
"accidently nuked my own city when i thought i was transporting it 10/10",1
"yes yes yessssss! there is nothing like the satisfaction of dropping your first nuke in this game!",2
"incredibly fun even with out dlc single player multiplayer what ever you play it an incredible game defenitly worth every penny you put into it",1
"best game ever. but dont trust ghandi!!! also you should get g&k and bnw",2
"this has been eating my brain for days. got it through humble bundle and am loving it.",4
"this game is a very fun stratagy game that never plays out the same twice. with so many different leaders and paths to take, it is truly an unpredictable and exciting game. the two expansion packs in the game add even more, with more civs, wonders, the introduction of religion and new trade systems the game ends up being even more exciting than before. every step you take could mean an entirly defferent result in the game. rated at six out of five, this game is by far my favorite game out of any other i have played.",4
"if you are looking for a good civ game, look no further. i may catch some flak for this but beyond earth really seemed to tank in ratings and reviews are not very positive and rather mixed but leaning towards negative.",1
"a great game for fans of sid, while the vanilia (no dlc) is fun even without the mods i highly suggest you get everything it has to offer if not for the base game then for the cool,fun,funny, and awe insiring mods that many fantastic steam members have made base: 9.5/10 with mods: 10/10",2
"best strategy game ive played. tons of replayability trying to get different victories with different leaders with different strats. multiplayer is really intense when there is multiple superpowers and not just yourself in a singleplayer game. if you have a bunch of friends to play with you will have a blast in mp. it will kill friendships though if you beat them to a wonder or have total tourism influence over them with opposing ideologies.",7
"pretty fun with all the expansions. vanilla civ is meh",4
"a serious upgrade from civ 4. so much depth, but at the same time a lot more streamlined than previous editions. almost obcenely addictive. youll be promising yourself one more turn all night.",1
"conquered one city state, everyone denounces me. war mongering gandhi killed everyone in africa 10/10",1
"great game, played for years. as soon as i tried to utilize the steam cloud functions though, the entire thing crashed. now, every time i try to load or save a game the program crashes to desktop. ive been in communication with steam support for 9 days now and they keep giving me the runaround with solutions that are not affecting my problem at all. 2k support didnt even bother responding to my request. whats more, right before all this happened i encouraged two friends to buy this game, now i cant play with them at all. im terribly vexed.",3
"should be called slave v. its ok. you didnt need to do anything else today anyways.",1
"i remember playing civilization ii when i was younger and enjoyed back then. having since learned a great deal more about civics, history and cultures i know enjoy this game much more.",3
"never thought i could spend a full 24 playing a game straight, i got that and at least another 4 to 5 hours straight with this game, it never stops interesting me, the only issue would be the multiplayer but you definitely do not need it to play this game and have a load of fun",2
"i think my hours played say enough about what i think of this great game.",9
"the concept of one more turn has no meaning here. fantastically addictive game. 10/10 would play again.",4
"i would recomend this game to anyone who just wants to play a game without much of a learning curve. it is a turn based strategy game where you take control of a lead from a great nation in history and as though tried to do, take over the world. it could be world domination by military, economic, technologicly, or by making a utopia. the choices are endless with who you want to team up with, who to destroy, who to backstab, and who to just completely ignore. even without all the dlc this game is very fun and has a lot of replay value in it.",1
"all and all a good game for anyone with time to play it of course it has a save option but it is time consuming regardless",1
"the best game outta my collection atm, i recommand it to evryone ^-^",1
"the grand daddy of 4x games. simple and easy to understand yet deep enough if you so desire. be ready to find yourself with missing blocks of time after beginning a session of this game. oh and start from the ancient era, dont be a wuss.",2
"declared war on ghandi because he wouldnt give me any free horses. 11/10.",2
"its a nice turn based strategy game, although honestly the game takes way too much of your time. besides that, the game is full of strategy and a lot to learn, get its easy to jump in and play the game. if you want to be great, youll have to study a bit and play a lot, if you want to have some fun, just play. online game kind of sucks though, sadly.",1
"this game is really great. i was new to the civ series, but its easy to pick up and get into. everything is straightforward, but still challenging enough that you have to plan and strategize. even just against npcs its fun. in the brief time i played with a friend, we had a good bit of fun despite their poor connection.",1
"playing civilization v is basically selling your soul to the devil himself.",1
"this is one of the best games i have ever played. creating a civilization from scratch and building up an empire so overwhelming that every other seems inferior. if you are the type of person to dominate the world with your own empire, in every political way possible (cultural, domination, etc) then you should get this game! personally i prefer to take over the world with the brute force of my army.",2
"very cool strategy. i advise everyone who likes to reflect and build your own empire",1
"cant get enough of this game. any strategy fan out there really needs to give this game a chance. it goes on sale all the time, so pick it up!!",1
"as usual, an excellent installment in the sid meiers civilization series. the vanilla version of this game is a bit stale, but the expansion packs (especially bnw) really show this games full potential.",2
"excellent game. the best of the civilization games yet.",2
"go for gold and/or faith. for gold and faith are the two great movers of man!",5
"i have sunk so much time into this game since i bought it in the humble bundle. i would recommend it to anyone!",4
"civilization 5 is the ultimate strategy game. it not only combines strategic warfare and combat sytems in times of war but also the complexity of ruling a sprawling empire in times of peace. as you navigate through diplomacy, maintaining happiness, science, city output, wealth, and a slew of other concepts in this game that make it one of the hardest games to achieve mastery on. spending countless hours on your regular game grinding and laboring to get to some precipice of achievement is nothing short of an average game. civilization brings strategy gaming into a whole new light making each and every game a challenging exercise of the mind to outhink and outsmart your opponents whether it be ai or friends. all in all, this game deserves every recognition as it is truly a fantastic and intriguing game.",5
"man, this game was one of the first games i got on steam, and i love it to bits. the best part about it is the historical inaccuracies of it, like discovering the nuke with the maya and bringing about the actual end of the world. when you get bored of playing the game conventionally, mods can completely change the feel of the game. for me however, i was playing the vanilla version of civ 5 for 100 hours+ (i have no life), so when i got gods and kings/brave new world, it was like a whole new game to explore! i am still enjoying the game to this day, and i most definately will buy the next sid meiers game on the line-up. 69/10 - swaggy as  !! :p",5
"i bought this game just because i liked the thought of politically molesting my friends who were playing it online at the time. i have now logged coming up to 600 hours in game. the variety of tactics using different civilizations in their most effective ways is a surefire way to keep the game fresh, especially when installing the mods from the workshop. whether its a complete reskin or a civ that holds meaning to you you always find time just leaves.",6
"great game if you have 90000000000000000000000+ hours to spare.",1
"i rarely enjoy strategical games in the long run. usually stop playin them after 1-2 hour of gameplay. but this game got me hooked, specially the online part of it. playin against or teamin up with friends is so much fun. this is not a game you wanna play 20 min before going to bed, you will sit all night long then xd quotin another reviewer: just one more turn..... ",1
"i saw that the full version of the game was on sale for $12 and i was excited because i havent played it before im only about 6 hours in and i already love this master piece. love the game :) plan to play it alot. 10/10",1
"deep down, its really not a different game from the pixelly dos one i used to play late into the night, very badly, way back when. still simple enough for a kid with plenty of depth, a decent learning curve and enough variety to keep you entertained for years. the multiplayer definitely needs some work, still buggy and cant be modded, but single player still has plenty of depth to go around.",3
"ghandi is a , atilla is cheap, and washington is a  douche",2
"this is a fantastic turn-based strategy game that will chew through your time like godzilla through tokyo. the screenshots may look like its a complex game, but its actually a very simple game with a lot of depth. the interface has been polished to such a degree that it keeps pulling you in. anyone willing to give this game 10 minutes of their time will find themselves looking at the clock at 4 am, blinking in disbelief and wondering where the time went (just... one... more... turn!) and the random world generator means that no two games will ever be alike. im not exaggerating when i say that this is one of the greatest games of all time.",5
"the game is very engaging. others can probably give you a much more thourough review, but i will say that, if you are going to pick this up, get the expansions. brave new world really adds a lot to the game.",2
"this is a good game other than the fact that it overcharges for feautres that should have been introduced in the first edition.",1
"warning: this game is addictive. you will find yourself spending hours to defeat your opponents. and you will enjoy every minute of it.",1
"this is the best stratagy game there is! its a bit expensive but its well worth it.",1
"dont buy this should you desire to live a productive life.",1
"very nice strategic game. i like the historic part.",1
"dont you just love it when you spend 2 hours on a game then it crashes for an unkown reason if so this is the game for you.",1
"i really like civilization 5, it has some features that is better than previous civilizations, but there is some of the old features that would have been nice to have in this version, like the animated advisors to name one. but i would recommend this game to anyone who loves to play strategy games.",1
"i dont know why everyone thinks im some sort of warmonger, its kill or be killed! all your base are belong to us 10/10",1
"this is a highly enjoyable game for the people who enjoy turn-based-stratagy games. it is better for people that would go indepth into the games mechanics and the scenarios.",8
"awesome game, totally different feel than four(which i consider the pinnacle of the classic civ style of play). introduces city states love them or hate them. the dlc is way too expensive though. i bought the game pre-release which was a huge mistake and resulted in me paying twice as much for the games content where as people who waited for the complete edition(about two years), get a way better deal still to this day. its cheaper for me to buy the complete edition now which duplicates half the content i already own than to buy the content piece meal which is total bs. good game though.",2
"this just may be the greatest game ever made. i think im in love.",5
"a lovely game about growing your own civilisation then reking everything in site",1
"this game is a masterpiece. civilization v is just a great game which includes many great historical civilizations and their armies. this game is really strategic. anyone playing with friends will have a really good time.",1
"what can possibly said about this game? you wanted to play for an hour or two after work to destress before bed? tough luck, your entire night is gone! i could never play for less than 3 hours at a stretch and it took a lot of self control to exit the game.",1
"get it, its really fun. however, do not ever make gandhi angry once he has completed the manhattan project. his words are backed by atomic bombs.",1
"awesome i love the series and this is an excellent addition a must buy",3
"with the brave new world expansion this becomes literally the best point in the series. no stacks of doom, trading, religion, tourism...only thing missing is that espionage could be a bit more fleshed out, with spy units that could poison water and sabotage and whatnot.",2
"this game is amazing. its one of those games that never gets old. wacth out though as youll think that 1 hour has gone by, but really have :)",2
"amazing game! first civ game ive played, and i think its incredible. well balanced, higher difficulties are actually challenging, definitely the kidn fo thing i can sink 200+ hours into and still going.",4
"i cant find it in myself to delete this game. however, thats not an endorsement. basically its civilization. the fixes and updates have added some new goals which are worth trying. i dont have any complaints in the new mechanics particularly, or the progression scheme..or graphics. but basically its still just civilization with a couple add ons...not a major new evolution of the franchise. been there done that.",1
"great game with friends i would recommend though if you are going to playing multiplayer to get all the dlc it is really important a lot of small fixes that make multiplayer actually tons of fun just play one game of no dlc and play one with and you will see the difference is huge.",3
"this game is the game that will make you late to work if you play it. right now im still getting used to it, will update review later, but right now, 100% worth getting it!",1
"a game intricate enough to make me not desperate to win it. the game play is fun enough on its own, without the added joy of beating someone.",1
"get your kids to play it once 7+ (ish). great tool for education as well as bringing me years of fun!",1
"this fifth installment really brings my previous civ gaming experiences to the next level. :) as a history and a book lover, civilization 5 brings me to the days of old when nations are still small, wars are constant, where seeds technological development are still being planted and watered for growth, wonders are being constructed, etc. this game gives users the best perspective of seeing how the nations of the world evolve and continues to evolve until now. nice gameplay, superb detail and graphics, plus the accuracy of ai leader personalities (based on history) really gives you that great feeling leading your chosen civilization to glory. the different systems in the game, the religion and espionage (in gods and kings) adds depth to gameplay. it gives the player multiple ways to achieve victory for a civ. i just love this game so much.",5
"great game, in my opinion. ive spent quite a few hours playing it, and i can say one thing for sure: you need the dlc to get the full experience. great game though.",2
"simply the best in long-term strategy, and highly addictive. it provides for endless replay value (currently approaching 600 hours). this game is less about quick multi-tasking and unit micro-management, and more about thinking, planning, patience, diplomacy, analysis, and focus. a steep learning curve to start with, it takes about 50 hours or over a dozen full games or so to fully apperciate the many layers to this game. a regular game can take any where from 4 to 8 hours, depending on the difficulty level, number of other players, the size of your army, and the amount of time spent thinking in between turns. theres also options for even longer games. it is an immensly engaging and rewarding game.",6
"gandhi wants to kill me and genghis khan wants to be friends 1010",1
"i reccomand this game so much its so good and with the dlcs it is awesomeeeeeee",1
"this is probably a good game. ill know for sure after a few months, after which i will hopefully have finished my first game",1
"hours of fun packed in a gorgeous setting. this requires dee strategy, and long hours.",3
"one of the most satisfying games i have played this and and a grate game to play with friends!",1
"best turn based strategy since civiii. who needs money anyways?",1
"i enjoyed the game its got a decent amount of content dont buy any dlc untill you have maybe 20 hours on it to make sure you like it. i wont be buying the two major dlc in the forseable future because 30 dollars each isnt enough motivation for me. i anjoy the game but time passes far too quickly. i havent encountered many mods that actually work, if any. a good game but i only recomend it to already older strategy game fans.",1
"i absolutely love this game. its hard to stop playing it. if you are looking for an addictive strategy game, this is the game to buy. with so many different types of scenarios and mods you can incorporate, theres literally no end to this game. strategy games were never my cup of tea until this game came along. its hard to point out anything that is being done wrong in this game and the expansions make this game even better.",6
"do not purchase this game if you want to do anything else. prepare to wonder where the time went, wonder why you havent eaten all day, and wonder what that stain on your chair is. civ 5 is the ultimate time sink, even more so than any illegitimate children you might have. barbies op.",3
"do not buy this game. if you do... there is no going back. just one turn and your life is gone. you keep thinking to yourself: just... one... more... turn...... but it is no use. you cant stop. you have been addicted. 1000/10 best and most addictive game in the history of man.",3
"really good game, love it, maybe it would be cool with religious victory, but super aweseome one of my favourite games ever!",2
"this is the best game steam ever introduced and succeeded magnificent",2
"whilst this is simpler than civ 4 (especially with all the beyonf the sword expansion) it is more enjoyable to play and retains the depth",4
"brilliant. altough i wouldnt recomend it unless you get the two big dlcs",2
"fantastic game! can spend hours and hours playing!!!",3
"this game lets you choose how you want to progress as a civilization. whether you choose to relay on scientific research to develop more efficient mechanisms or you want to build a huge powerful army to eliminate the competition. civilization 5 seems like itd be boring and a waste, but i found it engaging. the freedom of how you progress and solve problems is definately a plus. i like it.",2
"one more turn then ill go to sleep. 750 hours later....",9
"you will play 10-20 hours and never pick up this game again, but you sill sure as hell love every moment of it. world domination does that to you.",1
"this game is a looooooooooooooooooooot of fun. defs recommend.",1
"so far, for me, civ v is the most complex strategy game ive ever played.",3
"say youll play it for an hour 8 hours later well, i think thats enough for one night 10/10",1
"near perfect 4x game - you can and will easily spend hundreds of hours with this game.",4
"just one more turn... this game is near perfection for the rts genre.",1
"great game, i only wish their were more option when interacting with other leaders.",1
"this game is for people who seek world domination. this game is for people who are scientific. this game is for people who love culture and stuff. this game is a strategy game. this game, my friends, is for everyone. 101/100",1
"one more turn... okay, after i defend from these barbarians, ill take a break... okay, after i research this tech, ill take a break... okay, after i defeat this civ, ill take a break... lol, whats a break? yeah, its one of those games... and boy does it feel good. :)",1
"one more turn... one more turn... one more turn... just. one. more.",1
"one of the best turn base strategy games ever created. if youre into stategy games than this is a must!",5
"im not one for long reviews, so heres the simple review: vanilla civ 5: 6.5/10 has the potential, but doesnt perform. ai makes questionable moves is the primary thing, as well as no religion. civ 5 with either the gods and kings dlc, brave new world dlc or both: 9.8/10 with either one of the expansions, one of the greatest turn based strategy games ever made. adds new buildings, wonders, civs, religion, balancing, tweaking and ai putting up a challenge. just superb.",1
"so i dont have very many hours on this but let me tell you something this game is a game that you buy if you want to do nothing except this in your free time. this game is even better when you have a friend and you can just screw him over for the fun of it. 20/10 would buy again except i have no monies.",1
"civ 5 is a smooth, turn-based strategy game about building your empire from the ground up. along the way youll face invading barbarians and other nations, some will help you, some will harm you. i highly reccomend this game, but get all the main dlc, without them the game is pretty trash. 10/10",3
"by far one of the greatest strategy games of all time, the addictive nature of civ is in its unique ability to completely invest you into the civilization you create and grow. through violent conquest or peaceful cunning, the games near infinite number of ways to be played adds a replayability unrivaled by any game before it save some modern fpss. as one of my top 5 games of all time, i cannot recommend this game enough.",3
"highly addicting and lots of fun. you really need to put your planning skills to work in this crown jewel of the series.",2
"this is the best turn-based game that ive played. it has lots of civs with unique bonuses, good ais, multiple different ways to win, and good graphics. overall, its just about as good as it gets.",2
"passes vasts amounts of time in what feels like minutes",2
"this is the best game i have ever played omg yes plz get it its hot as heck yaaas listen to me im telling you.",2
"its literally one of the best games on steam, and is by far probably the game that ive logged the most steam hours on.",5
"oh hai!!!! i love this game. probably one of the best games ive played. theres a few things from civ 4 that i would put back in... and the expansion is fantastic as well. pick this up if you enjoy strategy, but keep in mind that 1 game can last up to 8 hours if you survive the early to mid game :) i give it 4.5 meows out of 5. wtf does that mean? who knows.....",4
"a great game to play when you have a few hours of spare time. the fantastic gameplay, as well as firaxis games amazing attention to both detail and historical accuracy, make this edition of civ its best yet.",2
"one of the best strategy games ive ever played 8.5/10",3
"compared to other civ titles #5 leaves you wanting, that maps never set up like you tell them to (eg. earth, terra) and the flow is sluggish..... 1/5 stars 1-gfx no playability - repetative no story..... controles are not user friendly, and the help tips dont provide much info ai cheats, still cant beat me, but it cheats, sure they can propse unbalanced deals and expect me to take them but then when i make the same offer they always refuse sayng its not a fair deal and thats garbage if i clearly overpower them they should be fear me and take anydeal that downst involed me killing them.........",1
"best game ever made!!! got it a week ago and have already put 40+ hours into it",2
"i love this game. i ve put over a hundered hours into it and could ( nand will) put hundereds of more. very good game if you like stratagy games, and the expansions add a ton more content and replayability.",1
"complex, addictive, fun. dont trust anybody, especially gandhi",2
"an amazing stratgeic game. can become tideous but once you get going it becomes very addicting.",2
"highly addictive! amazing mod community if you have the dlc.",1
"got in this love/hate relationship with poland. i planned to spread islam to all four corners of the world, and yet he kept converting my cities. i was about to denounce him, but he kept coming up to me with lucrative offers and helped me fight attila. i wanted to hate attila for taking my goldmine with his great general, but my culture dominated his and i felt that hes like a brother to me. plus his army is huge. i ended up losing because of my indecisiveness. 10/10 would get into an abusive relationship again",1
"just one more turn. that is what is going to happen if you play this - actually, no, dont even try it. this game is great, everytime there are sales i feel temptated to go around giving it to people and watching them get sucked into being addicted to it. game had its downsides when it was vanilla, but hole cow batman, its great now - if you have free time and think what a log knows is worth to heed, youll play the hell out of this!",4
"probably my favorite game to play at the moment. i love it even though i hardly ever decide to finish old games. way more fun to start new ones!",1
"i very much enjoy this turn based strategy game with the variation of civilizations and game play! higly recomended",3
"you know what? if youre bored and want to hold your  and balls for a while as you just click around and take over cities? then this is the game for you. i value the game at 19.99$",3
"not just a strategy game but it is an experience. you will lose yourself in the intrigue and strategy of this as you try and build your civilzation into the greatest on the planet. be you a warlord, diplomat, or economic savant, you can play your way and build a nation in your own image. do you have what it takes to build the greatest civilzation known to mankind? can you build a civilzation that withstands the tests of time?!",1
"steam wants my opinion. ive seen empires rise and fall (mostly mine). i tried to stop. one more turn i will say for 80 more turns. then bam its 4 a.m. the world has forgotten about you. you have a final in an hour. you know? the final you said you needed a break in studying? but you know what? one more turn? 10/10 would conquer germany with poland again highly recommended",2
"amazing... must have for any people who enjoy rts games.",5
"it was going great until gandhi started nuking me.",2
"civilization 5 and its expansions are the best game for strategist to date. there is tons of gameplay with the different ai levels. its easy to get into as a newbie and also alot of difficulty for the experinced. i played obver 800 hours of this game because its the perfect strategy game of 2013 (brave new world)",9
"one of the best incarnations of the civ series. i know a lot of the hardcore players mourn the loss of the unit stack, but i prefer the one unit per tile style, even if the implementation has a few issues. with so many difficulty options, i recommend this to just about anyone. start on the easy difficulty and work your way up. im still missing a win on the absolute top difficulty, but ill get it eventually!",2
"ahh civ. time vampire extraordinaire... not much to say about the fifth installment if you already know the series other than: a) get both expansions, they add largely essential systems into the game (religion, tourism etc) you can usually pick them up in a sale somewhere for pretty cheap now. and b) picture the scene...its 4am, the curtains are still open...it must be getting light soon. the birds are chirping in the trees. you havent moved in the last 8 hours, those chores you were going to do, yeah, umm maybe tomorrow...you should probably think about going to bed, but.... eat my nukes ghandi!!. yep. that still happens, so 10/10. daylight, exercise, proper diet, sleep patterns, theyre so overrated anyway.",1
"my friend always builds the great library before me. but sometimes i build it first and he asks for a restart. everytime he gets it i just try to kill him. i team up with the other friend that plays to kill him. we fail. our empires get nuked. we rage quit. he always wins and keeps playing by himself just to try to capture all our empires. 200 hours go by. 10/10 would try to build the great library again.",3
"i.. just.. keep pouring hours into this game for some reason :d",4
"a great strategy game that involves your thinking skills to achieve world domination! incredible looking game that had me interested the moment i looked at it! great job!",2
"a very fun and statetrick wargame, were you also can play different",1
"so much could be said for civ 5. including the expansion packs - gods & kings and brave new world - it is easily the best civ game ever made. every game is different and customizable to a great degree. multiplayer can be a joyous role-playing experience. the game allows for enough variation in decision-making that single player is just as fascinating. ive played all of the civ games going back to the first, and i cant imagine how amazing it would be to have civ 5 be the first one played. a proper review of this game would require 5,000 words. in short, it is a massive, and now polished, simulator combining the conventional history of humanitys story on planet earth with a solid gaming experience. anyone who is interested in strategy games has to play this.",4
"its the comprehensive startegy game, if you havent already played it, slap yourself in the face then buy it. you wont regret it (the game that is, you may regret the slap in the face)",2
"friends with nutella the hun. backstabbed from ghandi. gets  by spanish inquisidors. 10/10 would bang again.",4
"i will admit this game tested all of my skills as an effective leader and the experience will be daunting for most new players but with some practice (maybe solo games at most) the basic concept and structre of the game will become apparent and easy to master creating an unmatched rts experience. this game recieves the generals recommendation",1
"bought this through humble bundle and enjoyed it so much i added the extra ~5$ to get the full tier. this is my first experience with a civ game and i have passed on them before because i thought it was to complex. but starting from the lowest difficulty and work your way up seems to have worked this far. the only negative i can think about, except the ais evil trading, is that it magically turns one more turn to 3am in the morning.",1
"if you like turn based strategy games then you will most likely enjoy this. although if you enjoy turn based strategy games you will already have it. so hope youre enjoying playing it.",2
"great game with the exception of a few minor annoying features such as no unit stacking.",9
"if you like strategy or board games, i would highly recommend this to anyone.",2
"800h +... the trouble is, we think we have time b. (_)",8
"just one more turn - dont like to put down any of the civilization games.",1
"meh flash games are better atleast i got some laughs at how buggy it is",1
"very entertaining turn based strategy game. good multiplayer and community mods just make the whole thing perfect.",4
"do you like playing the same game for 200 hours? well youll find yourself at home right here. this game is super addicting. i litarally have no idea where my life went after playing this.",2
"press button make city, make buildings, create units, attack city, destroy city, capture city. repeat and win.",1
"a great strategy game! every dlc is extremely worth it! only problem is moving units one by one is slow",1
"what are you doing reading this review, you should be buying civilization 5 and all of its game changing expansions! if you dont know what civilization is then you are sad on such a deep level. but, let me show you the light to lead you out of your ignorant ways. this game is the most beautiful piece of strategy than man kind has created so far. you take your group of loyal but hopelessly stupid and simple cavemen throughout the ages and eventually into the future were you drop nuclear warheads, barter for the fate of the world, and host the most splenderous wonders the world has seen in your civilization. see what i did there, i put the name of the game in the description. go ahead, buy it. if you feel that all this seems overly complicated or grandeous, then you are correct and if you turn away from the game because of that, then you are as simple as the cavemen described above.",4
"best sid meiers game by far it is a very fun game and u dont finish games to fast but it dosent take to long",1
"this is the ultimate civilization game in the best turn based game series!",5
"a huge timesink! yes, enjoyable. wish i had the time for it; it usually takes about 8h to finish a short game. i generally find myself playing rush nations to make up for it~ probably wouldnt enjoy it as much if it werent for my addict brother.",1
"that moment you realize that you are next to ghandi.",2
"awesome game for multiplayer and singleplayer though its really long its addicting.",1
"if you like strategy and changing the past, then youll love this game. go for complete package so you dont have to spend 50 more dollars.",1
"very nice 4x game. a must own for every strategy fan. 8/10",1
"completely addictive once you get into it. expansions and additions contribute even more hours worth of gameplay.",1
"time just disappears when you play it. i started off thinking itd be ok, just a few hours here and there. yeah...no, it doesnt work like that. you have to have a reason to look away from it or else you wont. your social life, your friends, and even your family are non-existent when you play it. i started on oct. 10, 2014 and at the time of writing this i have 31.2 hours. and ~25 hours of that was one game that ended at 500 turns due to a time victory. so many hours gone but i couldnt be this happy about it with any other game, this is just the best ever. also, try to limit yourself on how many turns you go through in each play session. youll be thankful you did when it saves you from falling into complete addiction.",1
"great game, but you really need both expansions to get the real deal",1
"i spend hours playing a game to lose...and then i play again...",1
"its civ. if you like to conquer and rule countries, maybe even the world, youll enjoy the game. if you like to shoot things, try something else.",2
"play this game if you dont mind losing hours of your life without realizing it. it is highly addictive!",1
"civivilization 5 continues to improve upon this amazing franchise in small and wonderful ways. the addition of the policy trees is one of my favorite because it allows more control over the way your empire grows and gives your civ more personality than it could have in previous games. diplomacy, combat and the tech trees have all seen improvements as well as a significant upgrade in graphics quality. the two large expansions for this game, gods & kings and brave new world also add a huge amounts of complexity and depth to the game that was lacking in the former titles.",4
"i think the civilization series is great. overall i give it a 8/10 concept: same as other civilzations, 7/10 gameplay: outstanding at how many options there are! 8/10 graphics: incredable: 10/10 price: waaaaaaaay too pricy,but thats what happens to big company games. wait a couple of years it will go down though.",1
"amazing game, the pinical of all civ games! i have played hundreds of hours on this glorious masterpeice, and there are no glitches. the combat is balanced, and the hyper realism ,makes the game",2
"great game but i feel it requires some of the dlc to have great fun",1
"this is a fun game and a great game that ive wasted many hours of my life life on. i definitly reccomend you to be friends with england though cause she whill #### you up if you dont.",1
"a nice game for hours of fun and challeging campaigns. you can play as a bunch of civilizations/leader. each leader/civilizations has a special abillity, buildings, units. the game has a lot of maptypes so never know how its going to look. if you think the game is to hard/easy try changing the difficulty to a lower/higher level. the game also has a couple of scenarios you can play, a lot of mods to try out, great multiplayer to play with your friends or strangers. if you think the game is to long/quik you can change the gamepace to very short games or very long games if you want a game that you can play for hours dont look futher you found it!!!",5
"pretty good game. i cant say im a huge fan of it as i was of civ iv, but its still a pretty solid game. i dont like the huge amount of bugs and graphical issues which caused me and so many others not to be able to play it for months (6+ for me). if you see it on sale, id say go for it.",3
"i have owned this game for about a month, maybe a little more and it is one of my favorites until recently (not saying it isnt good but this is really annoying, still love the game) when whenever i try to load up a save or start a new game, it crashes. besides that annoying aspect, the game is amazing and if you dont own it (one of my friends), buy it.",4
"nuke other great powers as the aztecs and have the same workers for the past 10 thousand years.",1
"great game normally when i want to get off i cant because its just so addicting. the game can last forever there is hardly a chance that you will finish a game in one day even if you do a quick match.",2
"this game is possibly my favorite pc game to play. ive spent literally days on this game. it may seem a bit complicated at first, but its really easy after you play it for a bit. even after youve played it for a long time, there are enough civilizations and maps to choose from that this game can always seem fresh and new. i especially enjoy the multiplayer aspects. essentially, you play through each game as a civilization of your choosing and try to make your civilization last for the entire game. you can set rules such as how long the game lasts, what ways you can win, and what specials each player is allowed to have. my friend and i have played countless matches against each other. i highly recommend this game to anyone interested in strategy games.",2
"for people who like the feel of strategy board games, and the technological advancments of computer games, this is the game for you! sid meiers civilization v, along with its dlcs, runs and feels like a game like risk, making it very easy to follow and understand. i would highly recommend this game to anyone whos a fan of strategy games.",7
"civilization is a amazing turn-based strategy game. you don need fps reflex or precision you only need your brain! you can choice between many famous civilazations to rewite their history, you can shape their culture, military and economic how ever you want what ever your playstyle is diplomatic, science or just destroy them with force. civ is the game for you! 10/10 - it wil consume your time, like a blackhole",2
"as someone who was attacked by civ 3, manage to survive civ 4, and now is fighting civ 5... i can say: buy this game!!! if you played civ before than you know how addictive this game is. if you havent played it than you should get it now, and give your free time to this game... thats a lie.... you will give it all of your time, because its a civ game.",3
"great game! if you havent gotten to this one and enjoy the style of game or havent played one like it, give it a go! its really fun!",1
"this is good game but it should more of phone, tablet, or ipod and you shouldnt have to pay $30 for it.",1
"fastastic game! i have not been disappointed by any game in this series.",1
"people want money and power. in the game, you can have both.",1
"civ 4 is a lot better..... they noobed it good for the casual gamers.....",1
"ive logged over 300 hours. i think that says enough.",6
"this game could be one of the the reasons crime rates have gone down while obesity rates go up.",4
"the best of the series! really an amazing game and worthy of just one moreturn!",2
"easier to get into than civ 4. ive caught myself saying one more turn plenty of times while playing this.",1
"civilization v is an absolute delight. this game is so addicting, you keep telling yourself just one more turn and that though keeps you playing for hours on end. this game has deprived me of more sleep than any other game that i have ever played.",2
"super addicting game so glad i got the expansions on sale =d",1
"this game is really fun if youre into strategy games. there is a lot to learn and i have a lot to go through before i can call myself savvy in civilization v. all in all, as a beginner, it is pretty user friendly and the help menu has all the info you need, and more.",1
"one of the best turn based strategy games i have ever played, each game will be different and unique to its map and a.i. personalities.",1
"buy this now. why havent you bought it yet? its one of the top 3 games ever.",5
"ive never played civilization before, but after playing for (almost constantly) my first 18 hours all what i must say is just: wow. i get it on sale and its really worth it. need to go to work, but just one more turn.. lose your job but its gonna be alright, just one more turn.. your house is burning, but... one more turn?",3
"10/10. this game is a wonderful way to make time go by. mod support only makes it better. cannot wait for beyong earth after playing this game for so long.",9
"can feel a little boring/slow at times, but over all a great game. 4/5",3
"i love this game best civ yet, great graphics and still as addictive as ever jean",1
"i thought i wasnt going to like this game very much, i totally fell in love with the strategy and game style.",2
"its asewome im defenly gone buy beyond earth :)))))",1
"good game. there is a lot of dlc that i havent tried out yet. much more fun to play with freinds than randoms or computer ai.",1
"its a great game to change history. wish rome was still around? play as augustus caesar and rule the world. wish carthage hadnt fallen to rome? re-fight the punic wars. just like nuking everyone into radioactive particles? go ahead, but dont expect to be popular...",5
"i never thought i would say the words gandhi is a  until i played this game.",1
"starting with civilization on ms-dos this game has accompanied me more than half of my life. with this one they managed to make the game interesting and enjoyable despite it still being a successor in a long row of civilizations.",1
"buy and play if you want to lose hours of your life to its wonderful playableness.",1
"love this game! you will need both expansions to truly appreciate it. the gods and kings expansion added quite a bit to game play but with the latest expansion brave new world, more elements have been included such as trade routes, tourism, etc. that enhance the game even more. all that being said, diplomacy is still poorly executed in the game so beware of this negative aspect and enjoy what is a very good, if not excellent (4x) tbs game.",9
"great game if you are looking for a way to make make a world the way you think it should be run. if this is not enough for you than civ 5 a brave new world will improve the game to make it better than it already is.",4
"spent 13 hours playing a game. got atomic death robots. was repeatedly nuked by the peaceful mahatma gandhi, then beaten in the race to alpha centauri by genghis khan. 12/10 for realism+general awesomeness",1
"this game has wrecked my sleeping pattern on many occasions historically accurate to build stonehenge in babylon and a great wall around mongolia 10/10, would spend days dennouncing ghandi again",1
"it was fun for a while. its a bit tedious now. if you like strategy games, then get it, but otherwise... nah.",2
"this is one of the better simulator games out there, accurately representing the hundreds of years it takes to build a dirt road ten kilometres long",1
"well, running it now on ubuntu 14.04 everything works phenomenal and its truly fast on my xmg a704. the vanilla game ist extremely replayable as any good civilization and its got this, one more turn, effect which will keep you playing for hours to no end, completely recommendable, i have not play any of the expansions/ dlc yet but they expand the game a lot it seems, and the price right now gives no place for error.",1
"cant recommend this over civ 4 - its dumbed down and pretty mediocre. the add-ons bring back the complexity of civ 4, but why should you have to pay another 60 bucks to restore functionality youve already got (assuming you own civ 4)?",1
"holy shnaps!!! a masterpiece 11/10. babylon is a true badass",1
"highly recommended, hours of fun gameplay and extremely flexible graphics, an absolute love, definitely worth the cost. in my opinion it is the best with the dlc brave new world but, even without it, it is still a very fun game!",2
"fun as any civ game, and graphically beautiful, and as with any civ game, you can walk away without worry of explosions.",2
"despite being a little crashy, this game is the best civ ive played. as george washington, i kicked genghis khans  with sun tzu leading my tanks. which gave me enough time to complete my cultural victory. :)",3
"i think this games is what it is and isnt what it isnt. this game is a strategy game that you can get lost in for hours. the charators are very well do and the game just feels complete. you really cant go wrong buying this game. however, if you want a game that will put you on the edge of you seat this is not the game for you. this game moves slow and nothing really happens quickly. for example it takes at lease 7 turns to take a city. but this game does what it does so well i think its worth ever cent.",1
"i love tbs games, and this is a great one. theres so much replayability with a variety of victory conditions, loads of civs and scenarios, and mod support to fill in the gaps. hundreds of hours clocked on this, and i still come back to it. its easy to lose track of time with the just one more turn syndrome this game instills. id recommed getting with the brave new world and gods & kings dlc, they improve the core game immensely.",6
"absolutely amazing game especially with brave new world as well i recommend this to any turn-based strategy fan or just a strategy fan.",2
"this is an epic strategy game allowing to build empires, and get more technologically advanced than your opponents so that your battleships, jets, and tanks can mop the floor with your enemies musketmen, warriors and dingy little pirate ships. 100% recommend!",4
"endless fun when playing against muslim, communist america!",5
"brilliant addition to the franchise, extremely addictive and a great game.",1
"one of the best stategy games i have ever played :d",1
"civ v is a fantastic game. it is such an enthralling world, that i forget to eat, forget to sleep. one more turn...",4
"so, so fun! great single player game. if you love stratergy, and you love games with a layed back casual, fun play stile. you will love it. i mainly play online games, but this swayed me away from online gaming for a long time! must buy... awsome.",1
"awesome game! i play it all the time and it is an amazing pass-time for college. i cant afford all of the dlc, but im saving up for it, ive heard that its a complete game changer!",3
"this is the greatest strategy game out there, as far as im concerned.",2
"finally available for linux, and works even better than on windows! :)",1
"great game! it is kind of a slow game for multiplayer but the single player gameplay is great. i would reccomend this to anyone.",4
"this honestly has to be one of the best games ever written... middle aged mba educated widely read guy here, and i derive intense intellectual stimulation and learning from this game. sid meir is a genius. he just maps out how civilisations really work so well.",3
"amazing game. need all the dlcs to appreciate the complexity of this game. with all the added things it makes you feel like you are actually in control. worth getting if you have patience and are willing to use a better part of a day! i would give it a 8.5 out of 10.",1
"i havent plaed it dlc free but with gode and kings or brave new world it is amazing",2
"the game is great but steam will not open after a year, be careful. it requires an internet connection to keep verification, but steam does not have a phone number for service. when you ask it a question it gives you only a faq response. not helpful.",3
"hell of a game -- one of the only games ive breaches 200 hours with. every new game is an entirely different challenge.",3
"the game mechanics of sid meiers civilization may be a lot to take in for people new to the franchise, but its definitely worth buying and learning to play. it takes time, but once you figure out how the game works, it is extremely fun and addicting. ive played civ 3 and 4 as well and also recommend those previous versions too.",3
"civilization v, a great improvement over civ iv, easily the best civilization to date. newbie freindly, great game mechanics, great graphics. one of the best improvements over the last few civs is the implementasions of the tiles, it makes the game much more tactical and interesting. no more can we make the stacks of death, or just steam roll our enemies without any problems. even though i havent played the civs prior to civ iv, i still think its the best civ to date.",1
"my advisor told me to make friendly status with atilla. so naturaly atilla attacked and beated up living soul out of me... history learned us one thing: history is written by victor and those who has bigger stick. but this civ made it quite bit far from original civ game so you are able to win here in other way, not only war. make science, trade, do politics, raise your culture and make other countries jellous. what you get for any price with this game is what will last to you for many years. just enjoy the complexity and make your nation proud!",2
"keeps crashing and wont even let me start a new game. worst purchase ever.",1
"thanks ghandi should be the thanks obama of civilizations.",5
"with the two expansions, civ v is a brilliant 4x game, perhaps one of the best out there (although i couldnt say; i dont have a lot of experience with the genre). an epic strategy game with an accessible learning curve but a very high skill (and knowledge) ceiling, with hundreds of different techs to research, distinct units for different eras, a functional diplomacy system, stellar religion and covert ops mechanics and big- nukes made better with friends. just make sure you pick up brave new world and gods and kings with it, because without it the game feels bare-bones.",2
"pros: great game, and it is lots of fun, has tons of hours of play time. cons: a few small things that are annoying in certain situations.",1
"got nuked by ghandi, ending my 5-hour peaceful victory attempt. would recommend.",1
"this is basically the greatest strategy game ever.",4
"sure its fun...when youre able to learn how to play... itd be pretty helpful if the in-game system gave you more tips on how to navigate and place things around. this game will take hours away from your life...whether it could be bad or good.",1
"look, if u dont think being able to wage war on bismark as alexander the great using stealth bombers is literally the raddest thing then get out of my face + i h8 u",3
"as the dlc has moved on, the game has improved. still think civ ii was the best, though...",2
"a great turn-based strategy game with a huge replayability value. while most of the victory conditions are not perfect, the combat is excellent and makes going to war an interesting and fun experience where strategy is more important than force.",6
"so much fun to play with friends. however, be forwarned...this game can ruin lives and friendships.",1
"this is a great game that i would recommend to evryone and anyone who likes anything to do with strategy, war and utter domination. i guess thats most people. well done firaxis, this game truly deserves all of the recognition it has received. it is an absolute masterpiece if you dont mind losing a bit of historical accuracy and is great for casual and hardcore gamers that dont mind sitting at their pc for 10 hours straight. hats off to firaxis once again.",1
"i start the game through steam and it brings up the box to choose the dierctx 9 or 10&11. then it does nothing. no game, no screen, no error message, nothing at all. i could have not bought the game and still got the same result.",1
"i love this game have tons of hours on it and it is endless fun great game to play with friends on.",2
"japanese capability of civ5 is carried out as standard.",6
"an amazing game. the expansions make this game greater but the base game works just fine. when getting this game realise games take a long time to complete. overall great way to waste time, 10/10",1
"great stuff if you like spending a lot of time on turn based strategy. a lot of good things can be said about the game and im sure everyone said it already. as a bad thing ill say: if you like loading and saving a lot, you might get bored easily as loading screens take ages to go by.",4
"great strategy game which will make you come back again and again saying just one more turn. the game is immence blast and you will have so much fun in single player or multiplayer and even with a hundred hours in a doubt you will have been able to play everything. this is a great game and would suggest to all who want a long strategy game with great depth and is relatily easy to get into.",2
"one of the best strategy games i have ever played.",4
"good enough game, but gameplay seems weaker than civ iv. graphics are a major move forward though",6
"sid meiers civilization v is a beautiful masterpiece of a game. the vanilla game alone is good, but when you see the number of things that you can download on the workshop or make yourself, it transforms it into an immense, content-packed game. there are mods to fix things, to add whole civilizations, to add maps, to completely overhaul the game itself, and many many more, and if those dont appeal to you, then with a few hours of using the sdk available, you can make your own scenarios, mods, and more. tl;dr:a brilliant game made so much better by the huge amount of content available.",5
"strategic and entertaining. most people are aware of this hexagonal obsessed series but after 77 hours, i can say this is the most addicting addition of the series. noteable strengths: runs well on low end computers. well done economy system each tile has significance and is strategically unique fast pace late game custom maps excelent unit ballance. weaknesses: slow early game long initial loading time ai faction reputations need work. overall a good game well worth buying. if you are looking for an entry to turn based strategy, this would be it. the main thrill peronally was managing my economy and military over a massive spread out faction on a global custom map.",1
"this game will suck you and have you saying just one more turn.",1
"great game, civilization is always getting better with age :)",3
"let out your inner leader and nuke the world to send your rivals back to the stone age!",1
"this game sucks so bad i never even bothered to download it -14/10",3
"just one more turn and ill call it quits next turn just one more turn and ill call it quits next turn just one more turn and ill call it quits, i mean it this time",1
"amazing 1st playing 1 of these games and its easy enough to start off :)",1
"thsi is easily one of the best strategy games ive ever played",5
"very fun game. it mixes the fun of building a civilization and conquering the world together. it has different things you can do like go for the science victory. there are quite a few victorys and characters making the game interesting. it generates new maps so you will have a new experience every time. i would give this game a 9 out of 10. i highly recommend you buy this game.",3
"its like crack. you keep telling yourself just one more turn. but then you realize youve been sitting in your underwear for for 36 hours and youve forgotten to check on your wife who gave birth to your baby last night.",3
"ive literally never spent as much time on a game in my life as i have with civ 5. massively addictive.",9
"been playing this since civ i and this reiteration is just as fun as the first time i stayed up for two days straight playing i. great game for hardcore gamers and noobs alike. great gf/wifey game too!",3
"beautiful game i normaly dont like this kind of games but civilization realy is a very nice made game which has so many tools to play with. a absolute 9/10 a exelent game",2
"first of all i am a huge fun of the game since the very first cilivization ... now about ver v : graphics look good - but the game is so complicated and the controls are so hidden that if i didt already know the shortcuts i would have missed on half the option!!! panthen->religion->paths.. so many govermnet types with so so many different options ... already tired explaining ..bye",2
"dont trust gandhi, hell nuke you. i give this game 35/dog",6
"this game is a must have. its awesome, and hard. i have played for 30 hours, and are still a noob.",1
"excellent graphics and smoothly transitions between turns. definitely stays tue to the civilization brand!",1
"best game ever..................if youve got all day with nothing to do... :p",5
"i bought some games so far from the steam summer sale, but i cant stop playing this.",1
"one a scale of 1-10 id give it a 9; it is a great game overall, but it doesnt account for the little things that make history dynamic, such as internal revolutions creating brand new nations, and it could use a bit more in the diplomacy, no removal, just addition.",2
"civ5 has a good range of dlcs and the same is turnbased. the game is very good for a long time if you are bored. the game is best with friends and very easy to connect to each other. i havent had any problems with this game. it is a very easy game to play you will learn quickly and sometimes it gives you a challenge. the game itself is around 20 but there is a gold edition which is 20. the gold edition gives you bnw (brave new world bundle) and other things. i love this game but you need to commit to the game you are playing or you will lose the game. rating 8/10 or 4/5 stars! rated by mrouldy",2
"this game is surprisingly adictive. the first time i played it with some friends of mine we started at about 8pm my time. we played for a while and before i knew it, it was 3am! great game!",2
"a very good game that lives up to its nickname, just on more turn the game. you can realy loose track of time while playing it. and if your the military type like me, then you will realy enjoy the giant death robots. also caesar is a jerk, kill him first.",1
"i had to stop myself at 19 hours but this game will make you lose sleep if you start playing before you go to sleep.",1
"a fun game!! but it is a black hole for your time... ()",1
"spent 50 hours playing this game in hot-seat nearly killed my best friend i give it 10/10! also steam didnt record time properly so yea ( since i was offline)",1
"this game is pretty fun. the interface takes a bit to get used to. the game is incredibly addictive though. the perpetual cycles make it hard to walk away from and therefore i ended up playing through an entire civ often, much to the detriment of my work :)",1
"amazing game almost no critique except the fact that it is quite boring to play alone, make sure to have some friends to play with. runs smoothly on my ok laptop.",1
"great game, worth every penny ive spent on it. not good if you enjopy having a social life.",4
"built the pyramids, stonehenge, eiffel tower, and statue of liberty in the middle of the pacific ocean. 10/10",8
"there are few games that make you feel as in control or powerful as civilization 5 does. it certainly does a fantastic job at what its meant to do and i would recommend this game to you if youre into strategy games and using your wits to best your opposition.",4
"great game to play alone or with friends. steam workshop is always adding new things to the mix as well and the dlcs mix up the gameplay",1
"the game heavily relies on strategy, and is not for the truly devoted. a game can take hours at a time, and it is absolutely fantastic!",1
"i have been a long time fan of civ games and this one is just the natural progression of what has been a very good line of games. anyone a fan of strategy and 4x games would do well to play this. combined with the workshop, there is endless replay value to an already great game. i even recommend all the dlc, and that is something i rarely do. get it, play it, its good. 85% greatness. (where 50% is average)",7
"online is awful. love the game but im giving a bad review until you fix the multiplayer. seriously ruins the game",2
"yes it is a very fun game and with the dlcs it makes it even more fun than before",1
"i love this game! i am a huge history nut and being able to relieve great parts from history as great leaders was real good fun. i have the base civ 5 game & looking into getting the complete edition which incl. all dlcs and scenarios. this is the best game out of the civ. franchise by far! great fun & i cannot wait to play it with friends.",1
"one of my favorite games of all time. i definitely recommend the complete edition as the game is not nearly as good without the gods and kings and brave new world expansions",7
"top game. a great sinkhole for all of my time and i havent even ventured into brave new worlds yet...",2
"addictive tb thats fun and challenging! tons of maps, different cultures and great music! so many great things to try on the workshop as well to keep the game fresh! if you enjoy tb games this one is worth the buy!",4
"best game ever but i think more civilizations are needed",4
"if you like history and ghandi acting like an a*hole, sid meiers civilization v was made for you!",2
"this game is really good. it puts you in place of a ruler and lets you build a civilisation from scratch. its a great experiece and can even be educational. 9/10 ps very addictive approach with caution",1
"absolutely timeless, if you havent played this and youre a fan of in-depth strategy with the ability to pick your game back up at any point, why haveny you played this? replayability, mods, random maps and play how you choose to. dont pass up this game!",1
"theres something deeply wrong with ghandis ai, the fact that he nukes everyone when he gets the chance makes this the most accurate representation of historical events on steam.",1
"i remember being captivated by civ1 back in high school while at a friends house. when civ2 was released, it dropped my college gpa possibly a whole point - it was that good. civ5 has taken the franchise to new heights. most of the annoyances are gone and there are many new facets of gameplay to explore like the faith system. im a little late to this game - its been out for a while but i really regret not purchasing this game earlier.",1
"a really fun strategy game, good for when you have spare time to kill",2
"do you enjoy rubbing elbows with snooty leaders? do you enjoy building cities, researching technology and advancing through the ages to become a superpower and slowly take control of the planet? also dont be put off by this games apparent depth. games can last weeks and months, its true, but they can be played at any pace and picked up or put down at any time. that is one of the best things about this game, you can play for an hour or 16, and save your game and come back to it a week later and pick up right where you left off. overall: 7/10",1
"this is a fantastic game for losing large amounts of your time too. time you may or may not have. also is great fun",1
"no better turn-based game out there for beginners. 137 hours and only just scratched the surface. wonders are op. 10/10 (forgetting the glitches)",3
"what can i say... its civ - of course its good! initially though i did find it a little more frustrating than civ iv in that every single ai opponent wants to go to war with you - even ghandi!, but they can be relatively easily kept at bay on all but the highest difficulty levels if you are leading the tech race and have a full kitty (and if you dont have either of those - youre not doing it right ;p). overall, an interesting and fairly replayable addition to an already great series.",1
"amazing addition to an amazing series. but seriously, ghandi, stop being such a warmongering -hat.",1
"this is civilisation! intitally i couldnt get into the hex grid which was a departure from the earlier games. however after a while i barely noticed it. the expansions have only added to this. if you havent played this by now and it is your type of game then you need to own this. (and what is wrong with you?) get it at any price.",4
"new to the civ world, and also the realm of real time strategy games but, i have thoroughly enjoyed the past few sleepless nights dedicated to building empires and watching others fall. one of the best games ive played in a while. looking forward to countless more hours of gameplay, the possibilities are endless with this game.",2
"great strategy game. one can easily spent several hours by playing this game and got a feeling of spending just few minutes:-). it made my 5 hours waiting at an airport very pleasible;-).",1
"want to get nuked by ghandi? then this is the game for you!",1
"civ 5 is very addicting because you all ways think one more turn then ill save and quit, but like 100 turn later your still thinking that. overall very fun. one problem is you dont get the brave new world dlc in the golden addition which disappointed me.",1
"attack one city, become hated by the world. kill everyone to change their minds. 8/10 great genocide simulator.",1
"reviews are unecessary. just buy it, youll like it, whether if you like it or not.",3
"its not too addicting i suppose. sure gandhi likes to nuke me, causing me to devote a bit of time to revenge, sure genghis wll be your best friend even if you are a  to him, but i mean , it isnt my whole life... anyway, i got a present to deliver to a certain robed man.",10
"yes this game does infact kickass and is very fun and addicting 10/10 would bang again",2
"spend hours doing nothing but it is one of the best games ive ever played. 10/10 would waste life on",7
"just... one... more... turn... actually turns into one... hundred... more... turns...",4
"this is not so much a game as it is a kind of time machine. ill start playing a game in the morning and look from my screen to the window only to realize that the sun has gone down. i then tell myself, ill just finish up a few neighboring nations and by the time i am done with that the sun is up again.",1
"awesome game. and i normally hate turn-based stradegies. civilizations is one of the exceptions",2
"if you need a high quality time sink, this is a good game. the game isnt boring and is fairly easy to get the hang of. some turns require more thinking and some turns require less. when i first started playing, my ocd to be far more prevelent than in most game. some turns require more thinking and others require no thinking. this is something that is rough on simplier methods of managing ocd. i did manage in the long run. the linux port is top notch. full screen behaves way better than most games. graphics are nice but dont really matter much for this type of game.",2
"this is one of the most polished video games ive ever played. its the best of a great series.",4
"awesome game, great turnbased combat. love the different victories and variety of civs and leaders you can play. great time sink, which is to say that this game will take hours to get through one playthrough. but you can save and whatnot so why not? yall just gotta go rambo style and play mongolia ya dig?",2
"extremely addicting. i find myself saying one more turn and before i know it ive played 50 more turns. its better when you have brave new world, gods and kings, and all the dlcs. if you see a sale, jump on it quick. paying full price is worth it, but not recommended. just....one.....more...turn.",1
"for someone who really loves strategy games its a must have. use your brain, use it a lot - to make your empire grow and grow, let the people stay happy, make money, expand and take over the world of civ5!",1
"like why? why would u not play this game? its an epic fantasy for gods sake. u can do whatever the hell u want!",9
"it took me a while to get used to the whole turn based thing, but now i realize that its addicting as hell and therefore great for the developers, so thumbs up for that. unlike other strategy games ive tried its not that much to organize and gather, which makes it easier to focus on the strategy/occupying land/backstabbing/building armies part  and i guess that deserves a thumbs up as well. and as others already pointed out: beware of gandhi.",1
"ghandi is just so kind... just look at him with all his nukes.",7
"i just finished my first game after playing another turn. great game!",4
"to me? this game is fun. i can go for hours on end sometimes playin this game. not the best at it but there are so many options and goals. there are like 5 ways you can win for s sake. you can spread religion, gain culture science and a bunch of other . its ing awesome! especially with the workshop it has huuuuge potential. only beat 1 game in 20 hours but its definitly a great time consumer were u to play on your plane flight. i will never do online as that  would take days but still. good game if you like long matches with tons of options. probably the most changable game with workshop on steam!",1
"this game is full of opportunities to win in 5 different ways, its unlike any strategy game ive ever played. this is by far the best turn based strategy game i have ever played, plus it is a ton of fun to play with friends when you cant go over each others houses you can just play civ v from home with each other :d.",2
"10/10 would definitely bang. only in this game can america build the pyramids and nuke the  out of everyone. this game has consumed my life, would recommend.",6
"very fun strategy game that had me hooked for quite awhile. simpler than some in its category, but it is really fun.",3
"if you want to rule the world,and raise your empire this game is for you",2
"only worth buying if you can get the entire thing + all dlcs massively discounted. its good fun dont get me wrong, but theyve basically made a decent game, then broken it into parts to milk all the money they can from the franchise. civ5 base + g&k + bnw = a decent game and worth buying in a bundle at 11.",4
"i bought this game without any idea of what to expect. took some time to understand, but now i think its a really great game! its different than other strategy games, but i think its nice not having to be quick, since i never been to good at that. i recommend it strongly, especially if you like strategy with more thinking time.",1
"they did it again, i strongly believe that the civilization series is one of the greatest works to teach about human history, achievements, our soul, our sins, our philosophy, our politics, our chances and decisions. it should be put on a working machine and send into space to show aliens that we are horrible, but at least we know how to heave fun. and where there is civilization, there is hope.",1
"very fun, immensley fun alone and with friends. at the same time i have no friends.",6
"hey, ive got a couple hours, why dont i play a bit of civ.... oh god its already saterday",2
"i try to be friendly but then i end up conquring the world. 10/10",1
"ghandi is the root of all evil. i took his city just because he pissed me off.",1
"not as deep as civ4 but civ5 is still a great strategy game. it is also very pleasing to look at",2
"i love this game it is all about human history featuring real charcters throughout history. be careful though dont get mixed up between what happends in the game and what happend in real life :) i reccomend this game because it gets complicated when you start but in the end its great fun and its all worth it.",4
"one of the best games i have ever played, hours of fun with this. a must buy!!!",3
"civilization is one of the best video game franchises ever, and this is arguably the best version of the game.",2
"ive had this game for over a year and i still spend hours playing it. great buy.",7
"have been playing for years and have never got bored of it, it is a must buy!!",3
"an absolutely fantastic game for anyone who enjoys strategy games!",1
"this is the most addictive game know to humanity and i cant stop playing. its like turn based grand strategy for dummies. its really easy to learn, theres an infinite amount of replayability, it has brilliant multiplayer so as this game is easy to learn and the interface makes the gameplay and management fast you can just tell any one of your friends to buy this game and play it with you. id also like to point out that as i said this is turn based but theres a magnificent option which allows you to have hybrid turns which means that you play your turns simultaineously unless youre at war with an another player, in that case the other players still take turns at the same time. 10/10 buy immediately.",2
"10/10... one of my all time favorite stategy games. it comes absolutely unrivaled against any of the other strategy games i have played. picking any civilization of your choice and using them from the dawn of time to the bronze age, agricultural era, the industrial era, through to the future era economically and socially evolving through means of diplomacy, trade and war... this game is pure godlike.",2
"wow contol states such graphic so bnw such g&k wow",3
"this game is more addictive than crack. i will not stop until every hex in the world is mine! paint the world!!! just one more turn...",3
"i played civ 2 as a kid going into this but obviously its been a while. i hate the learning curve on these games since its only really any fun when you have a decent understanding of how it all works. luckily the in game tutorials that pop up when things happen are really good and give enough info to get by at first. the tooltips when you hover over almost anything gives more detailed info that deepens understanding once you get the basics worked out. the deeper you go into the depth of the game, the more enjoyable it becomes. sorta like virtual drugs i guess cept you only gotta pay $30 for this and it wont get you locked up in jail. good purchase imo",2
"i reccomend this to people who like turn based strategy games. it is very fun, a little challenging at times, and is fun to play as all the civilazations to see what their unique units are",2
"this game is fun with expansions and well made but very poorly programmed, the multiplayer online barely works for anyone yet they do nothing to fix it, the game crashes often for everyone i know and has not improved that since its launch, and for many i know it will take anywhere from a minute and a half to even ten minute to even launch, often for many it will not launch at all yet the game still costs a good deal of money and does nothing to fix these problems. please go find another game, even the previous civ ran far better than this, this game is not worth your money, there are plenty of better options.",1
"i dont know what i had up my  the first time i played this, but after giving it another shot i fell in love with it it seriously kicks",1
"just... cant... stop... playing... one... more... turn... then im going to bed/work/eat",2
"the grandest strategy title ever made. from the production values to the strategy, every aspect has been gone over til it fits and is fun. however, the ai isnt perfect, and other things can annoy you, but only after youve eagerly put in 100 hours. if you like strategy, you should own this game.",4
"this game is brilliant, but i cannt forgive the fact that making the mistake of not paying $10 more for complete edition costs you $172.85 later on for the dlc.",3
"from what ive heard, many people didnt like this entry into the civiliation franchise, but as a first time civ player i think its a wonderful game and is one of my favorites of all time.",3
"this is my most played game on my steam account to date. this game has sucked 100+ hours away from me and i enjoyed every one of them. i highly recommend you pick up this game. final verdict: one of the best games i have ever had the pleasure to play",2
"great turn-based strategy with elements coming from the most important pieces of history, this game shows the ways civilizations interact in many ways. be an expanding colonial state, a traditional isolationist, a religious nation devoted to the spread of the faith, or many things both different and in-between. replay important wars of history making your own decisions, or blaze your own trail from the dawn of civilization to the modern era.",2
"highly, fun turn base easy to understand and hours and hours of play.",2
"ever wondered what the world would be like if the shoshone tribes had tanks and machine guns to battle some samurais? or if ghandi was held prisoner by genghis khan and after many centuries of captivity, india was saved by the irish? civ v is a very well furnished strategy game where the smallest quarell over some truffles can cause heinous wars. building, trading, invading/evading, civ v is all about those stuffs. some drawbacks though, it is a real time consummer. also, the game is less meaningfull (not complete) without gods & kings and a brave new world: two extensions that make this game a killer. so prepare your settlers and equip yourself with some fine diplomacy and strategy! (with numerous and technically more advanced troups on the side just in case).",2
"mutliplayer? no. what a great game, if only i could play it. between horrible coding and complete lack of support, this wonderful game is turned into a frustrating pile of . do not buy.",2
"a really fun game to play, used to play this on the xbox (the xbox version) which i used to play all the time when i could or had time, i highly recommend this game to you all if you like long endurance games, where you start of with a group of settlers and grow your empire to be the strongest and rule the world.",1
"a very good game, i really like the turn base system that they use and i enjoyed the way different nations special troops and passive bonuss work, i would recommend this game to everyone",1
"civ 5 has gotten to the point where it can now be crowned as king of tbs. be very careful with this game, ive sat in the same place playing it for hours...",2
"probably one of the most addictive nation-managing strategy games i have ever played. would definately recommand to people who enjoy building empires with vast varieties.",3
"addiction. too much addiction. must click. must click once more. it is 3 am in the morning, one more click, one more turn. yup, that sums it up. this game is addiction.",1
"i can spend hours just playing this awesome turn based strategy game. its a great multiplayer game as well but can just just as entertaining playing alone.",1
"this is truly a great game if you are looking for a nice turn based strategy.",3
"just one more turn... i can miss an hour of sleep... or three hours...",1
"if youre a fan of the civilization series... youll love this one. theres many new civilizations, city states, and other challenges.",1
"with the expansions, civilization v is one of the best strategy games ever made. i cant recommend it highly enough!",2
"this game will challenge your perception of yourself. starting as gandhi does not stop me from unleashing nuclear armageddon upon the rest of the world. whats wrong with me? 10/10",2
"i get a bsod every time i try to play it. its been working fine for about 6 months. ive logged over 120 hrs in the game. ran memory diagnostics, no issue. check disc was fine. uninstalled and reinstalled game 3 times, same issue. bsod. tried both direct x 9 and dx 10/11, same issue in both. tried running in windowed mode, same issue. the game is completely unplayable now.",2
"youll start playing and next thing you know its five hours later.",2
"if you area fan of any time of stratgey game weather it be real-time or turn by turn, civ 5 and it expansions are a game to certianly pick up. dont fall for the new reskin that they are putting out (beyond earth). civ 5 will be around for a long time",2
"you will not regret buying this game. i highly suggest it. please buy.",1
"today i come with you to tell you about the very dangrous very evil ghandi. ghandi is a evil mastermind with a very aggressave nature. he will minipulate races to war he will nuke the world and not care if he dies in the prosess because he just wants you to die. if you see one of these nasty animal im sorry but you are to far gone. do not try and make peace with this thing right when you think your safe he will do everything in his power to kill you and he will. good luck with your citys young children and remember stay clear from ghandi and do not interact with it or face the power of his mightyness. 11/10 would nuke again. goodbye,with much love to you and your people wildcat.",1
"its a fun strategy game that makes you feel like youre a god and tactical genius, so yeah; at the end of the day, you had a good time.",1
"a really good game! the single player is very good and the multiplayer is even better. but its the dlc that really makes the game come alive. the mods dont always work.",2
"this game was awesome i had fun playing it for a day for the free weekend, i wish i could get enough money to get back this game permenetly",1
"love the game, but really dissapointed with the price of the dlcs.",1
"great fun game which runs smoothly and doesnt crash",2
"never trust japan. this game is amazing and i had trouble leaving the computer for so long only because of this game. the expansions completely changes up the game and so when you think youre done, you try g&ks or bnw and instantly the game feels fresh. truly and amazing games that is worth the 1000s of hours youll end up having put itno it.",2
"game is not for the impatient. if you like statergy it is the game for you.",1
"had the original civ v and iv on disc; decided to get the full version on steam in preparation for beyond earth. amazing game, would definately recommend.",1
"stay away, run away and dont look it in the eyes or itll suck your day away",1
"best civilization game by far. good chill and wind down game.",3
"hands down, this is the best civilization yet. the graphics, trades, and politics of the game are perfect ways to pass countless hours of time without you even knowing it.",1
"after a lot of patch and fixes, this game is finally incredible ! browse the workshop for useful and fun mods (such as doge as a nation) this game is as tasteful as fried potatoes with pop corn and bacon !",3
"very fun game. highly recommend to anybody interested in strategy games.",1
"this game is its own genre. as of such, it cannot be compared to anything else. but, comparing it to every other game ever, it still holds it own quite well. 10/10",1
"the latest installment in a series that defined a genre, need i say more?",6
"i love this game so much that i want to have sex with it!!!",1
"i love this game, and reccomend it to anyone who is a fan of strategy, 9.5/10",1
"one thing is for sure, if youre going to get this game, get the complete version. the base game is meh, and the complete version has all the dlc for a reasonable price. anything else positive and negative has already been said by other reviews. so yes, get this game if you have the patience for it and 37 dollaz to blow off.",2
"the game is so rewarding if you put the effort into it. great game totaly worth the cost.",2
"a good small start-up strategy game. good for those who want city management, nation management, military management, and even diplomacy. dlc adds features found previously in older titles, but still the core game is quite good.",1
"so many hours of my life wasted in the game... incredibly addicting, but not once could i last long enough to the end of a game. its a lot more fun starting out than it is late game imo.",3
"you can be that chilling dude, or you tear apart everyone. your call.",1
"civilization is like a stressball whenever you had a bad day just squeeze and release, squeeze and release. plunder and pillage, chaos and destruction, rule with an iron fist enslave their nation and their people. sigh now i can breath easy for another day.",1
"good gameplay and not too harsh on the eyes either! 8/10",1
"on multipayer you get rage inducing crashes, eternal loading times, corrupted saves and a lot of infuriating little problems, but if you have the patience to sit throug that, this is an awesome game that will suck a lot of time out of yor life",3
"good base game although it is worth purchasing brave new world expansion pack as it adds very well on to the gameplay or as part of the complete edition which at 39.99 is the same as buying the base game and brave new world although it is a much better deal.",1
"very good game. becomes even better with the dlc expansions.",3
"this game is a total riot with friends, and when you start learning what youre doing it goes up another notch",2
"a very fun game! reccommended for people with patience and is willing to wait a few minutes to get started. multiplayer is fun because you are up against real people! enjoyable for the whole family! going up agaist friends is fun and i reccommend it to everyone! ---what happened to me-------- i was a small civilization and then a war started and i claimed around the enemy and they fired a nuke at one of my cities! so i fired 3 nukes at each of their citys and invaded!",2
"overall i enjoy civ series and this brings a new twist as no longer able to stack units. definitely adds some new challenges to the series.",4
"honestly my all time favorite game. i cant stop playing it.",2
"its civ... if youve played it before you know youll like it. if not... do it :)",9
"this game is beyond amazing. im not really into strategy games myself, but this game changed that completely. i would totally recommend this to anyone, regardless of if theyre into strategy games.",1
"if youre looking for a game that will make you think, strategize, and adapt, youve found it. civilization 5 is easily one of the best strategy games ive ever played, and it never seems to get old. no two sessions are alike, especially if you choose to play multiplayer. the game is already fun and immersive, but when playing with a friend or two, whether youre progressing together, or fighting for superiority, the entertainment value doubles. if you enjoy turn based strategy games, give this a try; it has unlimited replayability, and i guarantee youll enjoy it. also you can nuke stuff. buy it.",1
"a very fun and strategic game where you lead your armies and into battle or have allies to boost your economy, the way you play effects the entire game, not the civilizations bonus.",9
"0/10 would create a time paradox and change history again",1
"iest ai in the world. instead of making them smart, harder difficulties just give the ai stupid amounts of resources and eliminate penalties they might otherwise get for doing stupid . really, really bad",2
"best turn based strategy game out there, a definite 10/10. just never let gandhi play with nukes...",4
"why havent you bought the game yet its fricking amazeballs",1
"once you get used to the new way things work compared to civ 4 its a lot of fun!",1
"amazing game! highly recommend it if you like games where you actually have to think! 10/10",1
"fak everyone in this game. especially washington, ghengis khan and montezuma that .",1
"best turn based strategy game series ever. go buy it and then experience one more turn syndrome for yourself",2
"this game has the most replayability i have ever seen. not just map changes, or nations, but how they all interact to produce a whole game. playing this game for over 300 hours and it has never been the same game twice. keeps you on your feet and worth the price.",4
"got nuked by scumbag ghandi whilst creating giant death robots...... 10/10!",1
">le me playing civ 5 at 5am >have madoka magica mod on >im god madoka >start the church of madoka >gets rid of catholicism and buddhism for madoka >everybodys friendly no fights >on turn 500 or something >homura asks for uranium >i give it to her >she pairs up with devil homura >they nuke everyone together >we all die 10/10 homura did nothing wrong",1
"outstanding game, nice strategy game and the game requires an actaul thought process. dont be put off by the turn based system its what makes the game awesome, the system allows you to make decisons and take your time or you can speed up via pressing the turn finsihed button quickly.",1
"really cool game, worth the money. get it if you like intense strategy.",1
"i absolutely love this game. it is without a doubt one of the most enjoyable turn-based strategy games i have played in a long while with very indepth strategy behind it. however i cannot recommend this game. why is that? i have had a game breaking bug for the past 3 months that has made it impossible for me to get past the opening cinematics. i cannot enter the loading screen and there has been no attempts to fix this glaring issue and i know i am not alone on this. i have even went as far as to try and fix the problem myself, but to no avail. without this and some other completely terribly game breaking glitches i would highly recommend this, but for now i feel somewhat cheated.",2
"once youve played this version youll be converted to hexagons forever. just a fuller, more varied version in every way.",2
"yes... please buy this game... conquer the world!!! it seriously is a ton of fun to paly if you enjoy strategizing and planning out your attack. and also being able to see your army grow and crush everything.",1
"this game is great to not only play alone but to also have a marathon with a couple of mates. worth every dollar and never gets old.",3
"i love the civ games and have been playing them since civ 2. the only thing i think the games have lost is the espionage element. i miss having my spies in civ 2 that i could move about the board and create strife in neighboring cities then take them over. i know a lot of people disliked that about the spies and i have found that most people either love or hated the spies no in between. either way this is still a good addition to the civ world. looking forward to the next installment. oh... and bring back spy units!",1
"this game is really amazing if you play it with friends or add a few mods",3
"this long standing thinking mans game about building up your very own civilization from the b.c. era to modern times plays like an advance form of risk.",1
"a good game if you get it on sale. civilization 5 introduced many new mechanics that i found very welcome, hex based tiles, one unit per square, but unfortunately took away multiplayer modding. you cannot play mods in multiplayer, i cannot stress this enough. what made civilization iv so great were the mods and this game just does not have them. a very unacceptable oversight. crappy launch but the game holds up ok now. especially with the two expansions. however, even after the expansions civilization 5 continues to have graphic issues with texture popping and still has a poorly optimized engine that will be a burden even on some higher end systems.",4
"good game. but dont plan on finishing the game in one hour or so.",1
"i am new to the series, wtf did i wait so long for? i have never played this type of game ever, but i was hooked after about 30min in my first game, literally once i started to figure out what i was doing i considered calling into work at about 3am in the morning..lol..theres a pretty good learning curve if youve never played one of these but i highly recommend it..side note: i bought the complete edition off of greenmangaming for $25 and activated it on here...",1
"got the game last night and have played 5 hours so far. lots of fun. the siam is a stuck up  though....",1
"fun turn-based strategy game that allows you to make friend or foe with the other leaders that are on the campaign with you. strike a trade, open your borders, or make war and steal their cities. watch out for barbarians.",1
"laid back, slow-pased strategy game. its a bit of a combination between the board games: risk, and colonists of catan. for me its the ideal game to pass a weekend where you just dont feel like getting away from your computer. even if its still 30 euros. very much worth it.",1
"the best overlooking, creation, strategy game ive ever played. a timeless masterpiece of perfection.",2
"the ultimate turn-based strategy youll ever play, with a amazing single player and a fantastic multiplayer, even more fun with friends!!!",1
"blow up horsemen and archers with giant death robots and nukes! do it now!",1
"beware: this game is seriously addictive. you have been warned...",4
"a fantastic game for passing the time, and an even better game to join up with your friends, and kick some .",5
"this game is so good, the damn greeks... too friendly with everyone. i cant invade anywhere without starting a war with them. 10/10 would play again.",1
"this game is great, but it can get addicting, so beware. the vannila game is good but not as good as the dlc game, its worth giving the dlc a try. one bad thing is with the vanilla game it lacks a lot of things i was used to in civ four, like stacking units, but this isnt really a huge problem, its adds to the game in a way. the replayabilty is huge, kinda like spore, and it is increased with the dlc. please get this game, it is epic! build an emipire to stand the test of time!",1
"this game is simply a amazing time sink in my current life. ive spent over 100 years creating empires and destroying others, just buy it please",2
"the only negative i can think of is how quickly you can get sucked in.",1
"dont worry baby is only smells. 9/10 would buy again",6
"a deep, wonderfully complex (but not everly so) tbs. many different ways to play, many variations of civs. the dlcs add so much more to the game play, they are well worth it to get. if you have the time to get into this, i would recommend it.",1
"are you serious ? you need a review for civilization v and/or expansions ? you had to spend all your life living under a rock, just go, buy and play it if you didn`t already. yes ! it is awesome. just never ever play it for a while before you will go to sleep, it will not going to happen until your wife/fiance will come and slap you. just one more turn syndrome is strong in it, i double dare you !",1
"better than beyond earth.and i recommend::::::buy dlcs",5
"one of the best turn base strategy games ever created. if youre into stategy games than this is a must!",5
"very good a lot of fun and the mods are super 10/10",4
"i have to admit-i was a little offput at first by this game. i was familiar with the concept and a very basic idea of how to play, but some things about the game seemed downright strange the first time i played. the hex tiles, the belligerent ai (yes, you montezuma), all of it kept me somewhat uninterested in this game for a while. but after a while of thinking, i started to understand the game more, and the more i understood it, the more i liked it. it is a complex game, and i certainly dont understand all or even most of it. but nontheless, it is a highly replayable game of great value that i enjoy greatly.",3
"this game is amazing, highly recommend buying it, one of the best games ive bought :d",2
"at this time, this game is priced as an aaa game title, when it is more of a deluxe mod of civ 5. it is also in more of a beta state than a finished state, with some glaring and a few shocking features not available. i would highly suggest waiting till several patches, and also several price drops happen before purchasing. after that, it may be worth the purchase and somewhat enjoyable.",6
"play this game if you like lengthy and in depth strategy style game play. although the game has various speed settings, often times the longer the setting the easier the gameplay becomes when versed with aggressive computer ai.",2
"if you have the time to invest, this game has the entertainment returns to give. build an empire, build an army, make friends and destroy your enemies. what feels like minutes with be hours building your world and make sure someone else doesnt rip it from you.",1
"just one more turn... and before you know its well past time to sleep... so you may as wll keep playing and wory about sleep later. youve been warned.",7
"10/10 would play until 6 in the morning everyday again",1
"fantastic game that you can easily sink hundreds of hours into. large and skilled modding community that provide a large amoung of extra content.",4
"i like civilization series but this one the graphics on my computer are just *******",1
"pretty good - i managed one complete playthrough during the free weekend. i always do the same thing with civ games... play it once, discover the entire tech tree, take over the world by force, and then never touch it again... until the next civ game",1
"hours upon hours of fun! i love this game and cant wait for the next franchise!",1
"what can i really say about this game but... wow. one of my favorites. 119 hours in as of the time of this review",2
"this version of civilization is pale in comparison to its predecessor when it comes to depth an complexity, and i dislike it for that fact. however civilization 5 is one of my most played games. civ 5 is part of the new accessible breed of sequels, designed to bring a known franchise down to the knuckle-dragging level of complexity so xbox kids and fratboys dont feel like total dip when trying to master the intricacies of the lowest difficulty. it is simple, it is fun, you really only need to know one or two tricks to win on any map at any difficulty, and then thats it, you get to master civ 5 and brag to all your friends about it. its fun, simple, different, and more akin to a board game than previous civ iterations.",4
"thoroughly engrossing, be sure you have a spare week before you start up a game. youll enjoy every second of it. catheter installation is reccomended.",3
"i played this game for a little while and i loved it. there is a lot of strategic gameplay and several different ways to win and many foes to face on your adventures.",1
"awesome game, wide varity of game styles with all the different civs. been playing for 6 months now at least and i can still happily spend an entire weekend playing a single game.",2
"this game combines the beautiful playstyle of the other civ games with outstanding dlc and an amazing aray of diversity in a game which at first glance can be repetative, no matter how many campaigns (or whatever you want to call them) this game never gets boring. 8/10",1
"i love this game first civilization and love it cant wait for beyond earth!",1
"7/10 civ 5 is a fun game but there are some bugs that needed to be fixed for a while which hurt this game so much.",4
"great game, great to play with friends and the single player is fun aswell.",1
"if you love strategy games then this one is good for you. it offers a very custom experience, everything from landmass to how man empires you face down can be altered. and one of my favorites is to turn off the varied options such as culture, science, and social victories to focus on domination, squaring off against eleven other great nations in a race to rule the world is an entertaining experience, especially if you throw everything into science. steamrolling horse mounted archers with tanks is oddly cathartic. and with so many options and choices you can play through the game dozens of times and still discover new play options. the game and its expansion packs are worth every dollar.",1
"this game is great, unless you are playing with someone who is unable to take less than 4 hours on each turn.",1
"the best turn-based strategy game ever+ a lot of modes",3
"get the game if you like this type of game because it is fantastic",1
"your empire is prospering. you just spent your last 100 turns killing the barbarian scum. you have been friendly with the other nations, but that is over now, the arabs have the lowest points, so you attack them thinking that you are oh so clever. as soon as you step on their soil an army the size of your entire population comes over the ocean. you quickly try to make peace, but alas, it is all too late. you go straight into military production, pumping out as many units as you can, but suddenly you see on your screen greece has declared war on you. your friend who spawned halfway across the globe can only watch as you nation is ransacked, tears stream down your eyes, for you have just wasted 14 hours of you life. 10/10 would do it again",1
"named city dong, got a message saying dong has expanded 10/10",1
"very great rts play. great to play online. a lot better than age of empires and i grew up on that.",1
"this game lets you nuke everyone 10/10 very realistic",3
"one of my favorite games, never get bored of it! 10/10",2
"i have never spent so much time on a game only to work towards being more angry. still angry. still playing.",2
"what can i say, it is civilization one of its kind, legendary since 1991. i am really glad it has finally got linux support. it needs the latest video drivers, but you should update them regulary anyway.",1
"new expansion pack adds many new elements to the game keeping it fresh. love this game, highly recommend!",3
"the perfect balance between complicated and playable, the dlc is a must though.",2
"5 minutes in: how the **** do i play this game 5 hours in: how the **** do i stop playing this game? 10/10",1
"it really doesnt get better than this for a civilization management game. with the two expansions you have unlimited options for play style. ive easily sunk more than 600 hours into this game and i keep coming back. tons of mods in workshop also help keep things fresh as well and the community support is unlike any other game out there. i cant recommend this enough. look out for fredrich the great. he lies.",7
"truely amazing game, at its base it can be a little dule but with all of the expansions its a lovely game.",1
"incredible depth and tactical gameplay, with its numerous difficulty levels this game will keep you coming back for more. just... one... more... turn...",2
"you will need all the dlcs to realy enjoy this (not the maps silly, the game mechanic changeing ones) or it will only be 4/10. i am no fan of the new combat system so for me its an overall 8/10. no must havebut a lot of fun, 3 and 4 are still better imo.",3
"very well made and deep. easy to learn but hard to master. also very expandable. 10/10",1
"civilization v is a perfect strategy game. if youre new to strategy games you will still love it and it offers you hundreds and hundreds of hours for gameplay. multiplyer is amazing too espically with friends. also try to buy the brave new world expansion pack. that will enhance the game and youll play it even more. even the angry army supports this game. (angry joe).",5
"one of the best turn-based strategy games around sid meierss civilization is still going strong since 1990",1
"strategy games are sometimes hit and miss with me, but i thoroughly enjoyed this game, and even got my sister in on it! multiplayer is a must, and with there being a modding community, the games life is expanded further. also, hexes! i love hexes.",2
"very good game love it to bits, dlcs a bit pricy though",4
"excellent strategy game that is almost impossible to stop playing",2
"always invites you to play just one more turn.. and another..",1
"this game has been awesome i playd 20 hours in a row you can win diplomatic war and much more ways !",1
"i cannot even begin to describe how good this game is. download the demo and see for yourself. i played the demo many times through before i bought the game.",1
"the game feels finished, and plays well. its an improvement over civ 4 in every way, save mutliplayer, which is awful, lacking mod support, animated leader heads, etc. fleshed out multiplayer would be much appreciated.",5
"hell yea  dis go hard as hell flocka i will suck big  team  all day and week month year and century i love big naps d i c k s q u a d",3
"good game, lots of replay value, and lots of mods in the workshop.",2
"this game is just pure fun. i just picked it up during the steam summer sale and i think it was a great decision. fun to play, easy to learn, and unique as well. all you gotta do is add to cart and begin having a ton of fun!",1
"its pretty fun and the start of the game is fun and a little nail biting but once you get really late into the game, say 250 turns, it becomes fairly obvious who is going to win and becomes pretty boring. other than that, awesome game",1
"if youre not into strategy like i was then this is your game because it taught me things, it made me understand politics more. sid meiers civilation v is a great game and i am looking forward to saving my money just to throw it at gaben because steam is love, steam is life. #justonemoreturn",1
"solid strategy game, but make sure you have time on your hands if you want to jump into this game. although it is quite time consuming, the size of this game is just unbelievable. a whole variety of civilizations, maps, victory types and military units cause you to mix different strategies to best conform with the current world, which is pretty swell.",2
"although it may fail at simulating history, civilization v makes it up for being a deep and highly addictive turn based strategy game. if you only have the base game, the game will have some rough edges and frustrating features, but both gods & kings and brave new world improved the game so much that it made itself one of my favourite games of all time. the many options and resources this game has may overwhelm anyone who is new to the game or the genre, but all these options give an immense amount of fun and unique strategies that makes every game unique. together with an always randomly generated map and ai opponents with all different strategies, causes this game to never bore and wish you could play this game till deep in the night.",4
"a game about growing cities and giant people and animals that protect them. gandhi nukes/10",2
"gandhi brought about the nuclear apocolypse- 10/10 would play again",1
"fun game. massive skill ceiling. gameplay gets old after a while, but fun while it lasts. great multiplayer with friends.",2
"ive put over 100 hours into this game and all i can say is that it is just awesome!",2
"awesome game very addictive and easy to lose track of time for hours",2
"civilization 5 is one of those amazing games that makes you stay up till 6 in the morning, downing red bull, screaming when you finally eliminate that  who took your tiny town over 200 turns ago, however you just tok his capital. the game runs smoothly on basically any machine, and mines a brick. if it doesnt run smoothly in normal mode, theres a tactical mode that basically can run on a toaster. that is, if that toaster has directx 9. you will play hundreds on hundreds of turns. you will stay up till the break of dawn. and you will love every second of it. 11/10 would buy again",1
"it is really fun, although it may look pretty boring, it is actually much more fun than you think. dont judge a book by its cover c:",4
"superb strategy game. plenty of interseting mods to make the game even more unique.",3
"a welcome addition to the civ family. has some definite imporvements from four, including a new hex grid system. downgrades include the loss of troop stacking.",1
"its a very good game for playing singleplayer but it is more fun to play it whit freinds.",1
"this game is rather boring, not in my tastes at all. im more of an action gamer rather than turned based gamer.",1
"the multiplayer option is loads of fun.. a little buggy and laggy sometimes. use skype to laugh at each others civilisations. stab backs. single player is addicting.",2
"though i do recommend buying this game, that doesnt change the fact the firaxis is full of greedy jews (please pardon my bigotry). wanting $30 each for thier dlc. however, after ive typed this out, ill probably cave-in and buy g&k. but guess what? thats exactly what they (firaxis) knew would happen!",2
"> spent 6 hours in tutorial > game never ended after controlling the entire map > alt+f4 > 10/10",1
"this is my favorite civilization yet. its beautiful, fluid, and still retains the just one more turn addictiveness the series is known for. the music is outstanding as well, with themes written for each country that shift and change as you progress through the game. the new tactical warfare really makes a difference too; gone are the stacks of doom from previous games. its a meat and potatoes tactical addition that really sets this iteration apart from previous games imo. its a must-own for fans of the series or turn-based strategy in general.",3
"just....one....more....turn. seriously dont expect to get any sleep. you will stay up all night trying to crush every one else on the planet.",2
"this may not be the best installment of these series personally, but is by far the most entertaining one. a lot of detail was cut from the previous game but all in order to make the experience more dynamic. thanks to this, civ v has te best multiplayer of the saga. recommended for the hardcore fans, the casual gamers, the strategy aficionado on anyone with the slightest interest, this game is brilliant in all aspects.",1
"i need to make declarations of friendship with real people for a change... 9/10 amazing game",1
"lots of competitors, none do it as well. hope you have a comfy seat.",3
"i love this game. except when my friend nukes me after an epic game when im about to win. if this were a review for my friends, itd say not recommended. but its for the game, and for that i easily say thumbs up.",3
"very fun game that lags in the later turns. easy to put 50+ hours in though.",1
"great for long term strategies, i never get tired of this game (escpecially with the workshop). the only problem is that its too addictive.",3
"a great strategy game for all ages. i strongly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys watching something grow over a long period of time. the graphics are good, a.i. is great and the diversity is fantastic. though it takes a lot of patience, it is a great game when you have developed your civilisation. 9.5/10",1
"brilliant the game is so good and i cant see any flaws in it **** 4 stars.",1
"i like this game beasase it includs lot of stratagy. it feels like you are aculy runing a governmen in acent times. the trading in the game is epic you can creat friend ship with coumputer controlled peaple or with real peaple. for the cunclshonh you should buy this game.",1
"time consuming political game, is what it comes down to. like a turn-based ages of empires but with intelligent political ais. played it for over 40 hours in 3 days of getting the game.",1
"ghandi nukes people 6 hours feels like five minutes so. many. puns. about. crabs. made u.s. a police state made russia a democracy 50/10",1
"if deep, complex, but rewarding and intricate strategy games are your jam, this game is a must have. if you dont like strategy or slow games, this is not the game for you! this is meant for you folks who dont like time limits and just shooting at whatever is in front of you. this is for those of you who will take the very long time necessary to learn to play a game llike this.",1
"this is one of the better simulator games out there, accurately representing the hundreds of years it takes to build a dirt road ten kilometres long",1
"so much fun. addictive and educational. yep i said it. learn bits of history witht he vanilla setup of the game. learn how leaders like gnadhi n such were. anyways its a great turn based strategy with a indepth game and great military units. shame i never have time b4 conquering the world to make buildings in citys so much",2
"i have played shogun to 2 and thought i would give this one a try, fortunately enough its a excellent game. nice graphics, simple controls. warning! you will spend alot of sleepless nights if you play this.",2
"this game is so sick. i have 170+ hours on this game. its beautilful to see your own civilization grow and it makes you appreciate the finer things like how other rulers can be backstabing s who will let you have pearls for 30 turns for you wine, bannanas, citrus, copper, iron, and 300 gold then to suddenly launch a preemptive strike on krakow, you most prized city and the wheat capital for all civs. a word of warning for those who i have convinced to get the game, montezuma does not wear pants. when you meet him, tell him pat sent ya. and if he tells you to settle your cities elsewhere, tell him to put on some pants.",3
"brilliant game. its an excellent time killer and its not hard to get a grasp of either. the diplomatic panel is smooth and pretty easy to use and the movement is basic but effective. 9.5/10",5
"this game is like getting a  from jesus christ himself.",10
"sid meiers time stealer v awesome for wasting an entire day on one game. 4/5 would recommend.",1
"one of the best games ive ever played, definitely the best strategy game. the learning curve isnt as high as games like total war, the interface is clear and the gameplay is a crisp and refreshing take on the classic series.",1
"possibly the greatest (and most addicting) turn based strategy game ever made. it has great graphics and an amazing soundtrack. i honestly am hardpressed to find anything to complain about, other than the fact that it literally eats my time.",1
"a great game that quickly sucks up hours of your life, the civ series never fails to disapoint.",1
"this game will leave you geeked out for dayssss. overall fun as hell!!!",3
"addicting, time consuming, immersive. these are words you hear when you describe the civ franchise and this is no different. while rough at launch, many updates, expansion packs and dlcs have made it a formidable game in the civ franchise. it still excels at allowing you to create your own stories, and keep you playing just one more turn! i recomend buying the expansion packs as they add many new civs and mechanics that add much needed depth that vanilla is missing, the rest of the various dlcs are optional however. buy this game, you wont regret it, but your to-do list might!",6
"i cant recommend this game enough. its exciting, funny, strategic, athmospheric and its simply epic to create an empire that will stand the test of time.",2
"i loved catan so much that i pissed off friends trying to make them play. turns out i just wanted to play civ v. 10/10",1
"so addicting... starting to even like it more than civ 3. its sad you cant stack troops though.",1
"much inculding within the game i still play it today.",1
"play this with my friends all the time. if youre not into competetive this is a great way to waste a few hours on thinking of creative ways to beat the ai.",3
"why cant gandhi stop ing nuking me its the ing 1850s 10/10",3
"i enjoy it a bunch. a single game takes hours to complete, and the suspense of a new world each time you play helps to change up how the game will be played. i recommend it to those who enjoy sitting down to play an intense game for an entire afternoon.",4
"i nuked gandhi. killed millons of people. wiped out entire civilizations. mowe(e)d down armies with superior technology. did`nt feel bad about it. then i got back to real life. ate something. walked in the nature. accidentaly broke a little stick on the ground. thats something i feel bad about.",4
"this is the perfect game if you have no friends. once you get this game you wont need them. if you have friends...eh screw them.",1
"what can i say about the best turn based strategy series? multi-touch support rocks, hex tiles are great. its as great as previous versions, offering huge civiliopedia to teach you actual history, stealing your precious life with never ending one more turns. your average strategy game ends in 1 hour, while civilization might not end in months. not everyone can play this game, can you build an empire to stand the test of time?",3
"one of the best games ive ever played! great replayability",2
"loved this game, always just wanting that one more turn before you quit. even the vanilla game itself is expansive, immersive, and has tons of content. i have yet to get bored of the base game, as there is so many different ways to play this game, whether its to gain a culture victory, science victory, diplomatic victory, or domination victory; all these types are exciting and intuitive to play! i would recommend this game to anyone who loves strategy games",1
"this game ultimatly makes you realize what it is like to manage a country in a dynamically changing world. the gameplay options available and how they are used really need forthought to be played effectivley. a great stratergy game.",2
"even just the base game is so in depth in every aspect. if you set down to play you better have at least six hours to play. incredible game 10/10",2
"and we stunting like aztec aztec, brazil brazil, london london, china basic scrubs play that  so i dont even bother i put that on my tech, i put that on my army korean empire representer, address me as your majesty yeah you can kiss the ring, but you can never touch the crown i create a million badass turtle ship i aint never coming down  you aint no ghandi i see you tryin science no culture, with no parts hurry up im just flyin",1
"this game is so worth the money. in the past year i have put 250 hrs into the game. 10/10 would do again.",4
"just.... one... more... turn.... *looks out the window to see its light outside*.... why are you so addicting, civ5?",7
"fun game both as a single player and multi player! expect to put a few hours in at the very least. its addiciting, you wont be able to pull away.",1
"if you want a strategy, buy this. if you dont, buy this.",4
"such an amazing game! i give it 5 out of 5, great replay value! my friend and i play this game all the time.",2
"sid meiers civilization v is arguably one of the best strategy based games of this decade.",2
"the best turn-based strategy game ive played. deep, and every dlc pack adds enough to make it feel like a new game. well worth the price, especially when on sale!",2
"awesome turn-based game. just one more turn is what you say late at night :)",2
"a fun game that is recommended to people that like building crap",1
"very fun game, very strategic. the npcs will punish you at the higher levels of difficulty, but it is worth the challenge. excellent game to play with friends, as long as they dont take an hour per turn :p",1
"i love this game! its so great. it is both entertaining and strategic. ive played 60 hours so far and i could easily play 60 more!",2
"many new optiuons and different game play from the other civs. in some way it tends to be civ lite, but once you get all the options in play it has its own depth and plays much faster than the earlier games. the mega death stacks of unit are gone. taking cities over without warfare are few and far between. a nice fun addictive game.",8
"this game is so addictive, 1 hour feels like 10 minutes",1
"its a really enjoyable game if you are willing to put the time into it",1
"its a great game with a lot to learn but easy to learn over time. its worth every penny, including the dlcs. but be careful, this game can easily take days away from your life",4
"civilization v is a really fun and great game to play!",1
"life = gone. few games can hypnotize me into 18 straight hours of gaming only to have me lurch out of bed on 4 hours sleep for more quite like civ can. a masterpiece.",5
"i love the game it is sooooo adictive, my only complaint is how long it takes, but i can live with that. i just really enjoy the game.",1
"go from being great friends to ing hating eachother. would recommend",1
"i bought and downloaded this game from your site and its glitching out constantly",5
"turned u.s.a into nuclear wasteland while playing as rome 10/10",1
"its civ, more streamlined, but still grand in scale and a great killer of time. brave new world has made it more complete than the vanilla version, making it one of the best games in the past two years.",1
"addictive game: who doesnt want to go from farm to giant death robot? :d",1
"one of the best games i have ever played. battle your way to victory or change it up and win a science victory !",9
"a great strategy game, and if you play smart, you can conquer the other people easy. take the city states and build your cities there, then wipe out nations one at a time",1
"this game blew my  off. i now have feelings of ambivalence of whether to sue, or to congratulate the devs on achieving such a feat.",2
"great game addictive only one more turn turns into about 100 more really quick. the depth and history are awesome especially for history ppl. totally recommend this game to all!",3
"if you like turned based strategy games, you should love this game. and war monger ghandi makes it even better.",1
"the gameplay is great but it takes forever for the next turn to begin later in the game :-(",3
"not enough time to finish this game dota is way better. - navi",1
"im not the best at this game, but its super fun and addictive. youll get sucked into a vortex. stay away.",1
"i never used to like strategy games all too much, specifically turn based ones. i found them too boring to keep me interested. but i suppose my taste in games has matured a bit since i would have to say this game is pretty good. granted practically any decent game in which you rule an empire gets my approval by default, but this is genuinly a good game. i have no gripes in particular and nothing to point out that i find amazing, its just good. i wouldnt sugest you pay the $60+ for it though, wait for it to be on sale or find some other cheaper way to acquire it.",2
"there are three dominant reasons why i recommend this game: 1. no micromanaging 50,000,000,000 things per turn later in the game, unlike other turn-based strategy games like rome: total war ii. a lot of game mechanics are autonomous, making smooth turn-by-turn play. 2. nicola tesla is a great engineer in this game. he has done some great stuff for humanity, if you arent aware. 3. there is a game of thrones mod for this game. there are freakin game of thrones factions and characters in it. that is amazing. if you dont think it is amazing, go make love to your sister/brother/father/mother/aunt/uncle/nephew/etc. and then try to tell me with a straight face that it is not amazing.",2
"! warning ! highly addictive ! warning ! buy only if you have lots of spare time to sink into this wonderful game ! truly amazing, but get brave new world and gods & kings with it :)",1
"guess i lost track of time. played it a little, worth buying.",2
"anyone that is a fan of turn based strategy games will enjoy civ can you stand the test of time",6
"completly worth buying mass multiplayer with good instructions and a interactive singleplayer i recomend considering a dlc or two",2

"sid miers civillization v is one of the most detaled and surpriseingly accurite simulation games ever. allowing you to follow and controll almost every aspect of civilization from begining to end. i however am aganst games with micro-transactons 3.5 stars.",1
"quickly build your empire up, make allies, declear war, reign supreme!",1
"great game.. very addicting ill quit after the next turn 50 turns later",1
"a truely addictive game , the game contains so many awesome moments like when you get surround by enemy troops as you fight them to your last unit and you legendery civilzation has been vanquished... or vice versa you take out a powerful might foe and you add his city to yours and then set off for the world... such moments make this game a classic if you dont own this game ... just buy it already!!!!!!",1
"this is definately the absolute greatest turn-based strategy game ever. i have been a fan since i first played civ iv and i could not wait for civ v, and i have to say that i was not dissapointed at all. the level of realism in the decision making aspects of the game is incredible and the graphics are phenomenol. if you are a fan of any genre of strategy game, i definately reccomend you getting this.",2
"keep your citizens happy or they will rebel, burn your friends fields, and then he wont play with you anymore because you think that deutschland muss vor allem glcklich, wenn wir mrz dem tank in die herzen unserer feinde und kmpfen, bis zum letzten mann steht das blut blut fr gott!",1
"what has not already been said about this game? nothing, you should buy it. that is all.",2
"one decision after another, one turn to something exciting. you cant stop until you win, or you rage quit.",9
"very good game, but games usually take several days to win.",2
"i couldnt even find sid meiers civilization the title is wrong",1
"amazing! i played the original one when it came out in 1994 and they are still the best turn based game in history",4
"civilization v is a great game if you have all the 2 major dlc which is gods & kings and brave new world. i love playing with my friends in this game and hour go by like minutes... tons of fun!!! 10/10",2
"civilization v is a very wel l made experience that will literally provides days of gameplay! with your friends, or running solo, the stories you create with this game are very well worth it.",1
"this is a great game but i think the best way i can describe it as being historical chesswith the a wide range of mods to allow you to play with a wide range races and contries",1
"if i could only play one and only one game for a year, this would be it. you will lose all your time playing this.",6
"the ability to rename berlin to snitzlestick and make it the holy city of infectionism is incredible. - 10/10",3
"this game is one of my favourites in my library. its a game for anyone that loves or likes geography, it teaches you about history and lets you mold history in your way. i recommend you play this game with friends, you can play online and solo, but its a little more fun with someone you know and like to play games with. i recommend this game! 9/10",1
"mortal man cannot define the brilliance of this game",2
"very original game which has brought lots of fun memories for me and my buddies :) if you want a strategic game based on real time events, buy this!",1
"great game, incredible improvement from previous versions.",1
"0/10 gandhi didnt  on my civ with nukes from the start",2
"buy this and the brave new world expansion 7/10 civ v 9/10 civ v+ brave new world",6
"you know when you go to a party and theres that one really good pie that youre just waiting to have and when it finally opens every runs for it and you fight your way through just to have one slice and you finally get to it and the biggest, best piece is left? yeah this game is that pie...its awesome",3
"a limitless gaming time. so many possibilities and having fun online or single player(or lan). one of the best games in that category!",2
"for some reason no matter how many times i repeat this game, it never gets old. everyone i know who has played it, including me has loved it. just buy it when it goes on sale.",1
"a great game... provides hours upon hours of gameplay. keeps you interested with random maps, opponents and many ways to win the game. it allows every player to adapt to their play style and if they get bored with it to try a different way to win.",2
"if you have something to do within the next week, dont buy this game you will need a support group.",1
"addiction is an understate as the famous sid said one more turn",3
"this game is ridiculously addiciting. start a casual game at 3 in the afternoon and end up playing til 4 in the morning. i love this game.",1
"my wife left me, i got fired, my dog hasnt been fed in weeks and all my other bills have gone unpaid for several months. twice i have been questioned by the police after my mother filled in a missing persons report. 10/10 this game is addictive.",2
"clearly the ai is this game`s greatest weakness but overall it`s a great game. the graphics are nice and the strategic aspects increased with the dlc`s. great to play with friends or other human players -> less ai and it is very addictiv if you start playing and intend to stop, it s just one more turn.... and another hour has passed or you start to realize that the sun just rose even thought you started playing at night",4
"a great game with over weeks of gameplay that will have you glued to your screen!",1
"if you love strategy games and have 50 hours to waste, buy this game.",1
"what can i say about sid meiers civ v that hasnt already been said? beautiful world map, great fun, and one of the best civs made. i really enjoyed bnw as well. would recommend.",1
"i have been playing civilization since i received a copy of civilization ii as a child. what an enjoyable way to learn about history. if you bother to read the civilopedia, and do some cursory research on anything that strikes your interest after, the reward is great. not enough explosions and breasts in this one though. and where is my snoop dogg narration? i thought this was america.",2
"sid meiers civ 5 is a great game for people who enjoy playing strategy games and trying to out play their opponents while the multiplayer is a bit glitchy at times with large amounts of people its still very enjoyable to be a part of all in all the game is very worthwhile to play or at least check out.",2
"great game. played it for hours, the expansions also add some really interesting new mechanics to the game.",1
"a fun strategy based turn game that not only gives laughes, but also a lot of fun for all experience levels! i love it! but remember, dont trust spain or france!",1
"civilization v had a lot of issues when it first launched, which resulted in that i dropped out of the game, because it wasnt any fun compared to the predecessor. when i picked up the game after it was on sale and my friend asked me if it was worth it, i immediately saw a lot of improvements. id reccomend this game if youre prepared to get the major dlcs (gods and kings and brave new world). the rest of the dlcs are just for fun :)",1
"huge time-vampire. worth every minute though- its still fun, challenging, and mentally stimulating. my 95 hours is about 5 whole games on the fast-paced setting. this is the game you play when you want a week of your life to disappear suddenly. its easy to learn, but hard to master- especially with the all additions to mechanics the expansions make. again, 95 hours, no where near mastery myself. i reccommend that you get both gods and kings and brave new world- without them, the game is a little lacking.",1
"if you have not heard of this game then you are either dead or been living under a rock for a very long time. if you have not got this game then you are either crazy or broke. if you have got this game then.... omg you are so totally awesome because this game is super cool.",1
"i really like that part of oldest sitcom in history of game development... ). so, guys, just try and enjoy that stuff. if u will play with friends, u will find great timekiller and funny moments in that game. ). civilization v back us to classic hexagons rather than civ iv. its first good sign. 2. great multiplayer mode. 3. great scenarios for lone wolves. 4. extended settings for your own game. 5. recommended by time. ). 6. of course, i love that soundtrack. great work by composers. 7. i think that game have balance. all nations have own bonuses. choice what u like and beat your opponents. 8. for newbies  easy to learn. omg... its just civilization, what i can say more?! and... only one bad sign i can say about civ v  cropped release version... because, if you want religion  you will need to buy dlc gods & kings... nobody like that marketing politic. cheers, mazy.",4
"some major changes, but i like them. way more strategic than just creating an epic stack and steamrolling the map. gods and kings dlc adds religion, and a few other parts of ai have had some updates. my only complaint is how dlc crazy they went this time. i would much rather have 1 or 2 substantial dlcs than 20 little ones, and then another that costs nearly $30 but only includes elements that probably could/should have been in the original release.",1
"this is way too addicting. if you need to sleep or socialise within 72 hours i would not recommend this game as it is far too good to leave for less than a 2 minutes pee-break tops.",3
"this game is one of my favorites out of all the games i have. this game provides countless hours of playing time with out getting repeating its self if you like stragey-turn based games. so if your into these types of games, then definitley get it.",1
"a huge fun game, that is one f the smartest toughest things to master. would tots recommened.",1
"if you are looking for a fun, creative, and awsome game, you have found it! this game is well worth the money. i recomend it. 5/5 stars!",2
"incredibly clever strategy game, offers tons of achievments to unlock, and lots of civilizations to play as. :o this game is much more advanced than those only with war; here you must focuse on currency and sciense while keeping your people happy. :o if you really wanna try a challenge, play one of the many scenarios available as dlc. :d this game is a 10/10! get it now! ps. new expansion packs are being released...",5
"civ just keeps on getting better. another great game from sid meiers.",3
"games kindda stale. the new game mechanics are certainly welcome for anyone familiar with the civilization series. with that said, its the same ol cheating ai. your comp opponent with still be in the stone age, but attack with tanks and watch how the next turn all its citites are amazingly teched to modern armies, as well. dimplomacy and trading is still a joke and useless.",1
"not much more to be said on the subject, but this game is great. my wife and i love playing together and we have put more hours into this than any other game in our steam lists. brave new world is a great addition to the already great core game.",2
"an excellent game on all accounts. if you love strategy, or if you want to remake history, this is the game for you.",4
"do not buy this game. i bought the game, started it once and immediately it crashes. i open it again, select the right direx and nothing hapens. i have tryed all and i mean all!!!!",1
"one more turn....one more....another!.....just one more!......please help!......one....more...turn...",2
"amazing turn-based strategy, possibly the best there is out there, however its not all perefct but with the expansions/dlc the game is complete so if you consider buying this title you should look to find bundles with brave new world or gods and kings. you do not need any other however these are very importent if you seek a really complex and enjoyable game. however if you lack the money or cant find a bundle that featrues both of them or either one. then you should go with civilization 4 , but if you prefer combat that is more chess like then civ 5 is your bet.",2
"civilization v is the epitome of the civ series. i know many civ fans would say they think iv edges it out, but the additions in v combined with the faithful execution of the core civ formula puts this one on top. hex-based tiles make it all the more awesome, and the elimination of doomstacks with the one unit per tile limit makes the game much more tolerable and strategic in many ways. with the expansions, there is a whole lot of content to see, and the best part of the game is arguably whats great about every civ game: flexibility to play the way you want to play. different victory types will keep you interested for mulitple playthroughs, and, like all civ games, you will find yourself laughing when you find your civilization on the brink of destruction at the hand of ghandis army. just be warned: the zulunation probably hates you.",1
"worth the money and a must have for strategy fans.",1
"i dont know what to call civ v. id call it boring, but you can seriously look up and go wait whered the last 6 hours go? i wish i knew more people that played it though.",1
"i have sunk a lot of time into this game, by my standards at least. completely reccommend to anybody who likes the genre.",1
"awesome game, now with a good tutorial. its basicly a combination of all the good parts of catan, simcity and tabletop gaming.",1
"this is way too good killer of time! spend like 10 hours to win 1 large map",1
"ghandi was being a smartass and then the game froze. i re-loaded it and ghandi was still a smartass.",1
"a very solid successor to the civ series, with excellent polish available in the expansions and a vibrant modding community.",3
"this game well swallow hours like no other. absolutely incredible.",2
"if your into civ then buy it. i find it boring until the fit hits the shan, then its just frustrating.",1
"make sure you stock your food pile. keep it near the computer before download comences, otherwise you should have an amazing time!",7
"this is pretty much the only 4x game i can truly get in to. i have never played a more immersive and rewarding strategy/simulation game before this. only one quibble, though. why do barbarian tribes still spawn in the 1800s and up?!",1
"one of the greatest stratergy turn-based games of all time. easy on the eyes and an extremely enjoyable game to wrap your head around. turtle and amass your strength, or spread everywhere as quickly as possible and claim everything.",2
"if you look closely the v in fact is not a roman numerial, it actually spells out virginity",1
"one of my favorite rts games. it has unique gameplay and the multiplayer is very fun. definitely recommend this.",2
"this game is amazing and addictive, it really is the greatest game ive ever played. just rememeber just one more turn is never going to happen.",4
"i started playing this when i was 19 and didnt leave my computer for anything. ive only just finished my first game and it appears the human race has been whiped from the face of the planet and the seamonkeys now control the planet. great game.",2
"be all the leaders! make all the wonders!! win all the games!!! have all the fun, all the time, forever!!!!!!!!!!!",9
"only game ive ever written a review for. its amazing, gameplay is perfect and addicting...never gets old... hope the next game is the same! 10/10",2
"this game has destroyed my life. buy it and all the dlc. its freaking awesome.",2
"great game that for once makes me feel so powerful and that nothing can stand in my way. almost like adolf hitler, but im not going into all that type of stuff. 9.75/10",1
"the only game where vikings can raid america, ghandi can drop the a-bomb, montezuma can assist jerusalem with a donated bomber to fight off the chinese, and france and rome become communist buddies.",2
"i love this game. if you have a life, you might want to discard it now",2
"time flowing like a river, till its gone forever. gone forever. 10/10 should play",2
"this game is great, a turn based hex game. you can nuke the whole world, make them succumb to your religion, make them pay you tribute, and much more! totally worth it!",1
"despite its faults (yes it has them) its a great game. one unit per tile gets rid of the death-stacks of older civ games, but makes it very annoying to move large quantities of units over large distances, especially since the pathing is poorly done. the introduction of airlifting in bnw is nice, but requires an airport in both cities. otherwise, the game is fun and there are plenty of mods to fool around with.",3
"best turn based strategy game i have ever played. it is very detalized, and you will enjoy it if you want to simply overtake the whole world or play a very difficult game. it suits all levels. it has many things done to it in workshop as well. there is so much to tell that you just have to try it yourself. as i said. best i have ever player.",1
"conquered the iroqois in the modern era while using infantry as carthage then got half of my cities nuked by gandhi and all the city-states declared war on me. 56/10",3
"good old civ with a few new twists. im especially happy about the army stacking going away.",4
"you cant get any better! i find that every time i play its a new experience, new tactics, new civs to hate on. if a game never gets old it should get an 11/10",3
"fantastic statagy game. breathes fresh air into the series, but holds true to core mechanics of past games",2
"singlehandedly the best game that i have ever bought. it is the type of game which you can play in so many different ways whilst continuing to be exciting. if you have the money to buy this game then snatch it up, its worth every penny!",7
"your average civ game. gandhi has completed the manhattan project! quit game without saving. exit civ 5. exit steam. delete civ 5. delete steam. shut down computer. punch the screen in. break the computer with a hammer. throw the computer out of the window. burn the computer with a flamethrower. dance on the ashes naked. buy a plane ticket to india. go to a missile silo. launch a nuke. leave india. watch and laugh as the rest of the world pulverizes gandhis smug face with nukes. kill yourself. alexander has won a diplomatic victory! come back to life. repeat. 8/8 gr8 game m8 gandhi with the pro b8s 420 nukes.",2
"this game is amazing! i recommend it for anyone who enjoys stratedgy games, it is one of the best ever made.",6
"this game overall is very addicting and a fun game and i 100% recommend it. the only thing i find dumb about it is the fact that if your civilizations borders are too close to another civilization they will eventually attack you no matter what. other than that the game is pretty amazing.",1
"this is simple. if you like turn-based strategy games, this is the king, the must-have of these games. get it on sale off of steam if you must, but get it, you will not regret it.",5
"one unit per tile makes combat much better while turn times are awfully long. as long as i play on smaller than average maps its not too bothersome, though and its a great game nonetheless.",6
"great game but not a game for those who dont like long games",5
"the most solid game ive ever played (by solid i mean really good, not hard). so many things to do, definatly get your mates to play, games can last a day, to a year! the game is so complex, yet easy at the same time... 10/10 for everything. if youre gonna buy it (do it!!!) buy it from {link removed}",1
"ive only played 10 hours and this game is  amazing. careful to not get stuck in the just one more turn loop if youre playing alone... ive legitimately lost sleep because of how kickass this game is. in that 10 hours i still havent finished a normal game. i think im in the medieval era still, so be prepared for some long  games if you set it to normal game length.",2
"havent played it much, i need brac  dlc to play with nick and collins... what the  i buy the game 5 dollars 6 years ago dont know hwo to play why did i eeven install it? 14/14 - its alright",1
"simply stated, the civ franchise is the best turn-based strategy games. civ5 has done the franchise justice while continue to improve the game overall from its predecessors.",10
"worth it, goty of the year of the game is good buy is good i play you play? you play you buy... you buy.",1
"best strategy game out there. addicting gameplay with so many different things to build and go for, and a ton of dlc. this game is a must have for strat gamers!",9
"0/10 would create a time paradox and change history again",1
"a very fun game, very addicting. the workshop has some great mods u can play around with if u choose. i keep finding my self playing it and get stop.",3
"i cannot recommend this game enough. no other game allows you to feel as powerful or amazing as this game. id recommend not having a job or anything though, it sucks time into it like a black hole.",5
"perhaps one of the most addictive games ive ever played. i have found this game to be a worthy succcessor to the civilication series, if you dont have it, get it, if you do, why are you screenshotting this just for reddit karma? seriously, its a great game.",4
"a game youll probably keep coming back to. replayability over years in my experience.",2
"essentially an enhanced board game with more depth than possible in an actual board game. does a great job of portraying events on a large scale in a streamlined manner. slow-paced as a strategy game, but it suits the theme well. style and design shows a lot of attention to historical details. semi-educational if you want it to be and worth putting some thought into. definitely recommended.",2
"its like drugs in game form. superbly easy to get addicted to, insanely hard to quit and uncanningly easy to fall back into if you somehow managed to quit (its like gravity, all it takes is a push). on top of that, its extremely detrimental to your health and social life. 10/10, would give up life again.",3
"awesome strategy game. even if you are not a big fan of strategy games (like me :p) you will like this game. really adictive, you can play for hours without even noticing. recommended!",1
"want gandi to invade your country? then this is the game for you!",1
"you will spent your all time for playing this game.",1
"i liked this game quite a bit in vanilla, but the replay value was a bit stale for my taste. the brave new world dlc has really beefed up the midgame, and offered a variety of new options that keep games fresh. still not sure it was worth $30, but grab it during a sale and you wont be disappointed.",3
"not as good as iv in some ways... better in others. any fan of the series will find things they enjoy about this title",4
"great game, the biggest complaint for the game would be the fact that no matter what, once your borders get close to another ai civ, not only will you be at basically guaranteed war, (no matter what previous relations) but the other civs and the one that declared war on you will categorize you as warmongering 95% of the time, when i wasnt even the one that declared the unprovoked war, deteriorating relations with allies that arent near my cities. plus, this scenario is almost definitely bound to happen, unless you play with 3 or less ais. its difficult to really push ahead of the other civilizations for a science or culture victory when your resources are being nearly forced toward military due to they covet lands you currently own!",1
"awesome strategy game. reccomended to anyone who wants to create their own empire from nothing and then nuke the  out of ghandi.",1
"fantastic stratagy game. this is the first civ game ive played and it is great!!! its just one of those game which you can keep coming back too.",1
