"loving the beta cant wait for full game on the 7th",5
"fantasic game improves every time and going to get better than fifa",1
"it has many bug on macbook pro (osx 10.10 yosemite). ex. every quality of match graphic isnt smooth. please deverlop for osx 10.10",1
"well its obviously much improved from last year fm edition, improved gui which need sometime to navigate through much improved scouting, etc that was exciting but of course, it can still improve for the upcoming weeks",2
"i saw rather a lot of negative reviews for this, complaining not enough has changed or been added from previous additions. this is the issue with sports games, we predominantly pay for the transfer window update and a new skin but with the return of the side bar, better player interactions and the weight of your decisions being more important than ever - football manager 2015 is just as addictive before and im sure i will sink many more hours into this until 2016 version is released, with updated transfers and a new skin.. ultimately, this is the best thing to sink hours into and with no alternative and its much better than fifa for management sims, this is as good as it gets!",4
"i bought this game expecting to be hired by a real football club however im still waiting this is slower than amazon",1
"too complicated for beginners... i think fifa 15 has a better form of football manager",1
"i have really been let down by this years verison of football manager. i just can not get around the new interface and it is making it hard to get inticed into the game. when i start my first season, a number of players get unsettled straight away. for example i have just started as fulham and moussa dembele is an 18 year old striker and is interested in moving straight away, i just do not understand these aspects at all. overall i believe si need to make greater improvements to their game.",1
"another great iteration on the football manager franchise. some upgrades and tweaks throughout, although the ui is a little harder to navigate this time around. matchday engine is upgraded and press conferences feel much more natural.",2
"it is now much easier to score goal, good chance in player mood swing. otherwise pretty much the same as previous installment.",3
"i just bought this game, and it does not work, on my mac, the game looks really old, the screen is black everywhere, every second line, has this black shadow, and when i touch it, it shows. when i remove the mouse, it gets all black again.. anyone, knows how to fix that???",1
"this years fm is truly a frustrating experience. my team seems to average about 2 injuries per game, ive been playing reserve players more than my starting 11. the match engine is nice but out of 10 games so far ive drawn at leat 7 1-1. the transfer market is nice but the scouting is terrible and you never get a players full report unless you scout him for months which doesnt help if youre in a bind toward the end of the transfer window. also it is impossible to take a lower level team in any division and even hope to compete with the top teams. the injuries are by far the biggest problem, seriously people ive played 10 games and have 10 players on my dl already, absolutely ridiculous. the pre-game interviews havent changed in years and the player-coach relationship still remains as hollow as ever. this game has been on the decline since fm 12.",1
"its another year and another football manager game. i will play it for countless hours again because i am addicted to this sort of game and i play fm because frankly, there is no alternative. does this mean i will either recommend it or give it a good review? once again, not this year. the lack of ability in si to actually listen to the reviews of its customers is just awful. this is a company that has been excellent in the past at implementing user ideas. in the past few season such bugs as far too many injuries (they argue there are fewer than real life, blah, blah) and goal keepers who just let the ball in after catching it have been glaring issues, just to name two examples but i could go on like this for hours with things they just choose to ignore or tell us are not issues at all. the new user interface is just trash, especially the tactics screen and this does not seem to be getting addressed despite cries from the user base, once again. i dont really need to write a long list of things wrong with this game, just quickly browsing the review section here will show you what is sorely missing and what is over looked. i want to love fm again, but it looks like they are just making too much money and only listening the fan boys on their main forums to care about the user base anymore.",6
"just one more game... just one more contract renewal, just one more scout report. prepare for just one more after the previous just one more highly addictive, very user friendly interface, a good guide for newcomers while playing and a great in depth gaming experience, from choosing and making tactics for set pieces, individual sideline orders in game, contract renewals, contracts talks, team meetings and talks and even individual promises if players believe they are not getting enough game time or believe they need rewarding with a new contract. a must play game for any simulator and football genre fan!",2
"waste of my time and money. i should have known after a mediocre fm 14 this wasnt gonnabe an improvement. i loved these games once, all the way back to the very first cm ever. the last one i enjoyed must have been fm 11 or earlier. the more new game additions, the more bugs and crashes, match engine sucks, 3d is awful ( never seen a player skip sideways on a pitch before). its ok to add 3d, but do it right or not at all. i dont think ill buy another fm for a while. cant enjoy this, i think i have champman 04/05 on an old pc. ill play that, 10 year old game is much better than this terrible bugfest.",2
"so i used to get pirate versions of this game , i tried the 15 then i decided to buy it. i love the game , the layout , the gameplay , this together with the fmrte and things are fantastic, i will not be playing 14 for a while. buy it!",9
"ive played until the end of the january transfer windows in my first season in the premiership. basically, my opinion is that the game has no realism as previous fms have been. the game is competely full of injuries, penalties and high scoring games that would simply no happen in real life. having read reviews of other gamers of fm15, it would appear that im not alone on this. a update is badly needed for this!! as for the 3d match engine, it looks like a cross between table top football and subbuteo.... fm has been using the 3d match engine for many years now, and it would appear that it has hardly been improved despite all the techology available these days. im afraid that the game is no longer enjoyable. i would recommend anyone sitting on the fence about buying it to avoid it. stick to fm14 until they sort this out.",1
"match engine a bit weird with this one, goals came too easy, its probably the highest goal scoring fm ive ever played since fm05.",4
"i used to pre-order football manager every year without fail. no longer. this game is poor, plays poorly, but at least we can play a buggy game with a fresh interface every year, because that seems to be all the consumer pays for. ps. injuries will make you punch your screen. repeatedly. till your knuckles bleed. 3/10.",1
"love the game new to the manager series computer and they help you understand everything and give you tips",1
"more realistic changes on form of a player tha before, plus closer realism on goals with scrambles and imporved grapics with the ball / players reacting as could really happen. watch out for transfer problems like transfer listed and work permit problems. still good stuff, very well researched",5
"miasanmia, lads! good game overall, its better than 2014 imo.",5
"this is a really frustrating game. too many offsides, multiple long term injuries after every game and goolkeepers conceding some ridiculously stupid goals. there are just too many bugs that need to be sorted out.",2
"great game, would recommend it. very addictive, (already played 500+ hours on it)",6
"im everton fc, i have bought the game expecting it to be better than last year. the most fustrating parts about last years game was the poor quality of crossing and almost no through balls behind the defence from the midfield to striker. this year the crossing has improved a lot and works well. however, this is the only way i can score and it is getting boring. ive tried pump ball into box which only affects the defenders and makes them hoof it. this game just cant seem to make through passes for the striker. dissapointing.",3
"brilliant game. got to say im addicted to it at the moment. as you can probably tell by how many hours ive played. its quite difficult at times but i got walsall to win league 1 in my first season so im pretty happy.",4
"bugged game. won premier league with arsenal. 10/10",5
"torrented it, played a lot, amazing game, buy it to give developers money. 10/10",2
"do you like hitting the woodwork at least once a game? do you like players staring at the ball and not running towards it? do you like helpful messages like we should put in more crosses as we are dominant in the air followed by it is clear our crossing just isnt working today? do you like injuries that come in groups? first wiping out all your strikers, then your defenders, etc, etc do you like opposing gks saving a ridiculous amount of short range shots while your gk dives the other way? do you like comebacks about every other game? do you like last minute winning goals about every other game? do you like teams asking insane amounts for players? if you like all these things and many other features this is the game for you. if you, like me, have been looking for a football management sim and not a football rts game with a broken match engine this is a huge disappointment and youre better off finding cm 01/02 and download the latest data fix for it.",2
"this game contains a lot of detail. compared to other football games such as fifa and pes, this is surperior in team managment, transfer negotiations and it also contains meetings and press confrences (which you can skip if you`re not to fond of that sort of stuff). this game i great mate, 8/8",3
"ive already bought the game. but when i go onto steam i cant load the game up. does anyone know what i can do",2
"-too many injury issues.its been nearly 5 months after released and still nothing changed about injury problems. -lots of ridiculous interview questions.(ive a cup game with a upper league team and they show me cup favorite and ask about lack of dicipline ! wtf ) -you cant have a interaction with a player or a manager without a reason.(like training performance or form of player and you cant make a comment about a manager in many situations). -promises: causes trouble.(i promised a rotation player for get a first team chance,after this he played sixteen of twenty game and blaimed me for didnt keep my word) -transfer politics: all my rivals make stupid transfers,lose their power year by year and it makes me win easier leauge and local cups .no challange after 2-3 years.not realistic !! -board:when election comes ; there is no chance of winning election the president who already in charge.even he succeed to win cups and league challenge. -unrealistic transfer prices for young talents.( 7m -20m  for an average talent .if were talkin about wonderkid 25m -75m  wtf!!! ) .. some problems i remembered.there are many of them.i corncerned about their company politics  release and let alone community at least they have enough time for solving this issues. we need update! p.s: sorry for my grammar,i hope i was clear.",5
"almost 30 hours into beta 15.0.2 the game is perfectly playable right now, but there are some issues with defending, which im sure will be patched before launch this friday. if in doubt then wait till the full release and reviews of the patched version before paying up.",2
"can really piss you off, but still better than its predecessors.",1
"i found the 2015 version to be so much better than the previous years. get it.",3
"cant even launch the game, played it yesterday after buying it in the shop now i cant even play the game because it just takes me to this stupid stream site instead of just loading the game!!!!!",1
"awesome game, love it! just wish there was more variety in the workshop. the game needs alot of things, like the kits, logos, etc. but still an amazing game to play alone or with friends.",1
"unrealistic results, lots of goals scored, silly goalkeepers. buy this game!",2
"when i try to load my saved game it just comes up with cannot load saved game?",5
"great game i played so far the new design is refreshing giving a new hole experience on this amazing saga of conquests!",1
"the most unrealistic simulation game ive ever played, where your every move has zero affect on the outcome. if you are a chelsea fan this is the game for you - they have gone totally unbeaten after season one and conceeded only 10 goals. yeah so thanks for the super realistic engine fm",1
"i thought people were overreacting about the number of injuries... boy was i wrong",4
"no to new interface no to bugs no to resticted interaction",2
"seriously bug after 15 minutes ,, all players in club change :d wow",1
"decent sports sim game, does have the drawbacks of quiet a steep price for what youre getting due to a certian amount of repetitivness. all in all a fun game though and if youre into football and want something different to fifa 15 a decent buy.",1
"the new ui is beautiful, but the text is too hard to read, it is not clearly enough.",1
"i have absolutely no regret for buying this game! although it is quite difficult to start with for some people, it takes considerable time to delve deeply enough into this game before you can get the hang of it but the rewards are far more than you can expect! as for me i totally love this game and i would encourage every football fan to try it and give it a fair shot. you wont be disappointed in most cases!",4
"great game. its getting better from year to year. i will want to see an option of be a player too.",9
"amazing game, really love the number of upodates and mods available for thsi game to. truly customisable.",7
"player asked to leave because he wasnt getting first team football. complained when i transfer listed him. 10/10",2
"i only recently started playing football manager again when i bought 2014 and oh boy, is it still addictive. play fm 2015 with caution, you will be staying up all night and day to see your team win the third division and you will celebrate like you won the champions league before collapsing in exhaustion as if you had just physically played a whole season of football yourself.",2
"overall the best fm gameplay ever !!! im hooked on to this fm15",4
"well its obviously much improved from last year fm edition, improved gui which need sometime to navigate through much improved scouting, etc that was exciting but of course, it can still improve for the upcoming weeks",2
"some good additions, little change but they produce a decent game every year.. was buggy at the start but im have no issue now",2
"great game with amazing detail, hard to learn how to play well but a season as a manager should solve that.",1
"i am turning back to fm 2014, loving it so much. sory but 2015 is terrible.",1
"ive picked up fm 2015 after 5 years abstinence and im hooked again. match engine has improved since the release with each patch, but again there is still room for improvement. every new patch states that keeper reactions are fixed but i still fear every shot on goal and slow keeper reactions after the save. everyone is complaining about tactical incosistency, how you can beat real madrid and loose next match against a lower league team, but its good to change up your formation and tactics from time to time. for me at least it is something that i like and keeps me playing. ui is useful and easy to learn. overall game speed is ok, im usualy playing with 7-8 different nation leagues and didnt experience any lag. i have no complaints on training and youth development. i dont like high transfer values and money spent for weekly/monthly wages but then again thats how it works in reality. does it have that addiction spice in the whole mix? yes it does, at least for me it has :). ive been playing fm (old cm) since i was 13 years old and now im 35 :). is it worth 50 euros? no, it certainly is not. but then again i didnt have any problem spending that ammount of money, because i want to support developers for making one of my favourite games :).",5
"if you buy it. you should buy more all item in game. it so badddddddddd so now i need to sell this game not make me fun at all",4
"every other game has the least 6 goals, why?? just finished a 6-5 vs liverpool and won the epl with a 10-4 vs spurs. what the hell? oxlade and giroud scored 5 goals each. how is this realistic?",3
"addictive. really addictive. really really addictive.",1
"i love football manager! this 2015 edition is still addictive and i personnaly really like the new ui which is a lot easier to use than the old way (in my opinion). lets be honest though, if you have already played fm13 or fm14, you are mainly purchasing minor improvements and updated teams with fm15, a bit like the fifa/pes games.",2
"--- below is my original review, but i have changed it from recommended to not recommended, because even after patching, the game and match-engine is unrealistic; how could the programmers not realise this? i regret buying it and have gone back to fm14.--- this game is definitely not as bad as some of the reviews say, though it does have its problems. id definitely recommend this to fans of the series. lets go through the pros and cons: pros: - i like the new ui, i think its improved on previous titles, with things like scouting/transfers in more logical places - it runs smoother: you no longer have that weird 10 second pause when changing tactics in a match; instead it takes less than 2 seconds. this means you can make lots more changes in the match withou being annoyed by the pause every single time. - i havent seen the oft mentioned issues with getting lots of injuries; its stayed around the same as previous titles on that front for me. -player interaction and media interaction are considerably improved cons: - weirdly takes longer to save than fm14. over a minute and a half for me. - the games are too high scoring, and this needs to be patched for realism purposes. i just had 5 games that were 6-3, 6-3, 5-3, 0-0 (lol) and 6-3 again... a bit silly... - goalkeepers are pretty bad, hence the high scores. - it feels like its harder to play a possession game, but that might be just because im leicester. its a fun game; im definitely glad i bought it. good for fans of the series; if patched it could be brilliant. they say theyve solved the issue of too many fks going in, but they dont seem to have",1
"ive bought every football manager game after the big split and a fair few champ man ones before that. have to say im slightly disappointed by this years offering. very little of interest has been added. sure more conversations to be had but the quickly boil down to the same six or seven answers yourre always giving. the management style is fun but quickly seems pointless and gaining the licenses if little more that a tick box exercise. the engine does look better and although far from perfect the board interaction is more detailed but with the bugs still there. what has to be the most annoying part for me though is the amount of time the game wants you to do basic hr work. from the exciting world or contact negotiations to micro managing every action your apparently half witted staff carry out is long winded. its made even more annoying by the fact your backroom staff rarely follow you and often the first few weeks at a new club (admittedly usually lower league for me) is spent waiting to get a assistant manager before being able to do anything at your new club. all in all its more of the same and the updates are enough to keep me interested.i hope that more effort is but into making the game more fun for those of us who like played 10/20 seasons into the future. more interesting press conferences with much more answer variety and maybe the ability to negotiate not just a move for you but your whole backroom staff. its a begrudging yes vote from me but hopefully with improvements in the future.",10
"great great game best football manager i have had and i have had 5",3
"football manager 2015 is a manager simulation game which is designed to put you in charge of teams within the footballing world. you can buy/sell as you please as well as hire/fire staff as you please and you ride the highs and lows of football management. if youve played the older versions of this game this game is a slight improvement upon them. this version has added extra features and improvements which most are very much in the background. truth be told the same issues with the preivous versions still exist in this version to a certain extent, such as the ai (at times in rare cases) is very frustrating and downright poor. ai issues have been adressed in the latest update, but much like many other games the orignal version was released unfinished/unpolished. much like the fifa franchise this game slightly improves elements such as graphics and adding one or two features which in my opinon is unacceptable there is alot of potentail and the creators should look to improve much more (such as the match engine and overall media/player interaction). to be more positive the game is fun, challengeing and does feel like an improvement the match engine is getting better and the accuracy of transfers between clubs is better, however the next version must have significant improvement in order to prevent the franchise from becoming stale. for football fans who enjoy the small details involed with football and would ratrher be at the helm of a club rather than a player this game is for you. overall an addictive game and a slight improvement and a solid edtion to a franchise with high potential. 6/10 (upon release) 8.5/10 (latest update).",3
"it says its in my library and its not, waste of money",1
"buy the game! its deep its deeper its the deepest football simulator ever",5
"the new interface is great. also new features looks awesome.",2
"will not be buying aymore of these.this one is basically the same as last seasons.dont waste yer money on this,its a total rip-off to us loyal fm fans",1
"great game, doing this for the steam achievement. but its so good to play on long flights/train and a welcome break from fifa 15",1
"love football manager since the cm series. too bad i can not use my steam wallet for in game purchase this time. keep give me error code 1",2
"poor effort from si games. to many bugs & glitches. game gets worse after every patch.",4
"good game but takes 3 minutes at least to save the game ...please fix that",2
"only negative i can say is in my 3rd season with man utd i hit some sort of glitch that meant i couldnt win away from home! seriously, my home record was; played 19 won 18 drew 1... away record; played 19, won 3, drew, 6, lost 10. i had scores like loosing 2-1 to brentford (whom had been promoted) leading arsenal 4-1 with 10 mins to go, to drawing 4-4. beat city at old trafford 5-0 and lost at the etihad 5-3. the scores throughout that season just seemed very random, no matter what i did. other than that its very much same old fm (which there is nothing wrong with) already played 71 hours. trying to catch up on the 600+ hours i played of the last edition haha",3
"it all comes together after years of being a wierd disjointed experience.",3
"sports interactive have really made a mess of this game. if you dont want to have a stroke because burnley are playing like real madrid and your keeper parries the ball to opposition feet then avoid buying it. far too many injuries leaving you to play with your worst players, tactics you set seem to be ignored. players are too easily offended. if ......and its a big if you get things going your way youll soon be slapped back down again by overall poor performances or injuries. awful. players also moan too much about game time which puts everyone on their period and you have to walk on egg shells. my god if i could swear on this i would. i have an alienware pc and with fm14 i could set the graphics to highest settings and it would play smoothly all day long, this pc eats up the system requirements and asks for seconds but on fm15 (exactly the same requirements) i have to leave it on medium otherwise the match engine struggles! ive loved all the fms and it rarely disappoints but fm15 has really let me down. angry with it in fact. extremely disappointed with it. ill return to fm14 to allow my blood to come off the boil and simmer",4
"i purchased this game two days ago while it was in the beta version and then today clicked to play and had to wait for a download (which i assume would be the fully updated game) and i have found it is exactly the same as the beta version. i am talking about things like the team badges (prem leauge) in the beta version they are made up and have seen videos on youtube of people playing fm2015 with the teams having the real and correct badges. can anyone tell me how this is and where i am going wrong......i have looked for another update for the game with no luck. the spanish teams have their real crests but most other countries do not so i feel steam have robbed me as i cannot find a way to contact them.",3
"getting better and better every year. good interface with reasonable match-engine.",3
"sound game! if your a fan of the fm series, then your sure to like this game; the game continues to progress each year. although, there is only slight change, it does make a much more beneficial outcome!",2
"ive been playing this game for 5 years and ill always say - yes to football manager and no to other soccer management simulation games. this game have the largest player and stuffs database, salaries and characteristics are close to real and the diversity of tactical changes makes us to think in a new way. with each new step developers doing football manager more interesting and better. the only disadvantage was and still is the graphics of 3d matches, but its not the games main component. there is no limit to perfection as they say. my mark is 9 out of 10.",2
"fix this game! everybody said what is wrong, just fix it!",7
"i like the new updates. nothing to complain about fm15. the work permit for the premier league is no longer an issue compared to fm14. i can now sign whoever i want and send them off to a feeder club or let them take up a roster space.",8
"i have been playing his game like 2-3 weeks and its simple: its terrible. match engine its year after years worst and worst, player dont do anything you tell them, complete the opposite. i had a right back tell him to short pass, as soon as he receives the ball bom! long ball to nowhere. the only thing the had to do was keep the same me from 2012 and thats all, just a few things here and there and you could sell this game year after year without problem. si has spend a lot of time to do it and when the put the game on sale its full of bugs, probably in december 2015 this game will be playable with hundreds of patches, but at that time we are going to be talking about fm 2016. i dont know, its so much things i could say, or maybe i just dont know how to play the game, maybe its too complicated. corner kick bugs, goalkeeper bugs... endless. impossible to get a win away, play counter, defensive, offensive, wathever you want, its useless. im starting to repent to put 20 pounds in this. terrible.",4
"its like having an abusive husband who you know you should leave but his few endearing qualities keeps you coming back.",6
"its a good game but the heading is a bit.......but i recommend",1
"vert good football manager simulation, but a game that costs 50 cannot have this column disappearing bug that makes the game unplayable. now i cannot see my roster. totally unacceptable.",1
"match engine not as good asprevious, needs major surgery if it is to succeed",2
"this game is nowhere near as good as previous seasons. they have screwed up on some of the most basic things like for example there are no arrows to scroll down lists, you cant switch between manager profiles properly anymore and things that were easily accessible before im struggling to find now. i am also having all the same problems as other people like 3 injured players in 1 pre-season friendly (joke) and after that 1 friendly my game crashed and now wont re-load. i have also bought every football manager since its split from champ man and this is easily the worst. i sell games for a living and have always championed fm but from what i have seen so far i am extremely disappointed and wont be advising others ton get it.",1
"one of the best football managers to date, this is because of the new skin and the better more in depth database.",6
"worst fm ever , even 2013 was way better , so a patch ago , everyone was marking over 4-5 goals per game. they fixed it ok , i can wait a bit , now new patch . every free kick = goal , every corner = goal . you dominate all the game and lose vs a corner/freekick. their goalkeeper is a freaking ninja , yours sucks , attributes dont matter regarding the goalkeeper. aguero from man city is a beast , he can mark goals from every position , ive played countless times vs man city , apparently aguero never misses ( i do not expect to win vs city, but i do not expect to get a goal from every aguero ball touch, yes i did marked him and asked my defenders to break his legs) . this game killed my nerves , i used to play fm 14 for countless hours and not with big teams, i was struggling my way up. here if you play vs a big team , regardless of your tactics , you will concede at least 3-4 goals. another bug chelsea has the line throw ups like they are corners, if the opposition player has better stats, your defender will not even try getting the ball, cause that player is imba, your defenders will just watch him go around , not even try to get the ball, at least seeing them try and fail would do, not just seeing them trying to stare the ball out of the opposition. else what can i say ? this game is not worth buying or playing, unless of course you wait 20 patches so they can fix every issue , cause they dont have beta testers or if they have , those guys are . this game was a waste of money/time.",1
"there arent any spectacular changes since 2014, imho ... not worth more than 10euro. since 2013 i havent seen any kinda revelations .... so sad si :(",3
"the only reason they still able to sell is that si has no competitors. me is absolute rubbish, unfixed problems from 14 still remain plus new plenty of errors. only real improvement is 3d match.  dumb si will never get my money after this",5
"magically manifest yourself as a footballing god then slam yourself into an unsuspecting team as their ruler and master. force players to bend to your whim as you capture, train and then send them into battle against other teams. spend many seasons working through the football ladder, competing for trophies and the souls of your fallen enemies, all the while waiting for a chance to stab your greedy, greedy board in the back and leap lovingly into the arms of a mexican sugar daddy; his promises of blood money enough to sway your morals. who needs them when you can buy messi and ronaldo for shrewsbury town? muchas gracias amigo!",5
"pros: + the ui improvement + the scouting is more challenging and not auto reveal skills, much more like real life + the game engine improved cons: - i play it too much 9/10",3
"there arent much changes from 13, i didnt purchase 14 because i knew there wasnt gonna be some huge updates and changes. sigames merely refined the game and touched up on some areas in 2015. they tried to shift the reliance of fmscout(genie) by allowing us to scout for potential and consistency of players. but, the scouting ui system is terrible... imagine scouting over 200-300+ players, and after the initials reports those players who didnt make the cut, you will have to remove them one by one manually.... genie is still the choice for me, its just too convenient... it was refreshing for maybe the first few days, after that you will realise its actually the same old thing being repackage with some minor tweaks and improvements. buy it if you are a real diehard football or fm fan, if not just stick to your 13/14.",4
"shitest game ever , cant even open game seriously crash files with shitest support in community.sigames every thread not solve my problem even ftp i must install filezilla and upload by myself . i never seen this before.",1
"avoid football manager 2015... until it is fixed. why? -too many goals conceded -ridiculous, crippling injuries -too many goals from crosses / corners -out of control player concerns okay let me start by saying im an huge fm fan, ive owned every single copy since the days of its predecessor championship manager: so were talking a decade and some, therefore its not natural for me to hate on a game ive always loved. however this game is awful- i have deleted it from my computer and wont be playing it again until it has been patched. i bought guardado a three star left mid for back up to tadic- i gave him a backup squad member contract- after three premier league matches where he came on as a sub in two he began moaning. tadic then got injured for 6 months (surprise surprise), it took guardado 16 premier league matches as a starting player to get over it. back up sqaud member??? i was southampton (decent top-half premier league side), i conceded 86 goals in 38 premier league games. i tried everything- defensive fullbacks, five at the back, two defensive midfielders, defensive setup, rigid approach, new defensive coaches etc etc etc. nothing worked, i thought maybe it was a bug with my game... i restarted with southampton, spent my entire transfer budget on my defense and yet again conceded 75+ goals in a single premier league campaign. avoid avoid avoid",2
"unplayable, its seruously bugged, please sort out asap. im on a mac and my friend has it on pc, it looks like two different games, block of black all over the screen, and now when i load it up its has the eula agreement which it wont let me agree to, so i cant play the game. i thought there was a point to alpha and beta realeases? worst 30 ive ever spent.",1
"i have always liked fm games, but this one is just plain and simply . do not get this game!",1
"as someone who is not your typical gamer, i never know what to expect from a game, but i thought i would play this as it is a bit different from the rest of my collection.. i was not dissapointed at all. it took me a little while to get used to all the screens, but as i went along i found myself really getting behind my team, and almost shouting at the screen during matches haha. very good, and a wicked time killer.",1
"great addition to the series despite a lot of negativity towards it. the new interface is great and improves on last years version, i do agree to an extent that injuries do get a bit ridiculous towards parts of the season - my most memorable being managing wolfsburg and having 7(!) regular starters injured all within a space of 2-3 months. aside from this, everything else has been great. tactics have been spot on, i also tested a few tactics from the workshop and i was surprised at how good some of them were - but it didnt make an instant difference. some tactics took a good 5-10 games to start flowing nicely, otherwise i would find myself conceding at least 2 goals per game. this year i was focusing solely on gaining most of the achievements rather then spending my life going through season to season with my favourite team. ive been an admirer of these games since championship manager 98 and think ive purchased it every year from then. it is true that a lot of the updates could quite easily come into a nice dlc bundle or same game upgrade, however this is not the case. people should note that they are not forced to buy the game every year, their are plenty of dedicated people within the football manager community that focus on updating the databases for older game titles in order for those to keep playing the old game, with the new data. overall i have loved fm15 and am pleased to say that after all these years, sports interactive are still making good progress in providing a richer and more fulfilling football manager.",2
"brilliant game just need some people to do online with now who can say they play between 5-6 and then not come back on for about 2 weeks -_-",2
"brilliant game. the best manager simulation out there at the minute. however, i feel it gets a bit boring after a few seasons - just my opinion.",8
"i quite like this games and i play it lots although im quite bad but my excuse is that i do it or the banter.",1
"won the league with liverpool. most unrealistic version yet. 1/10",3
"i have played this game for 4 weeks, and yes i have every version of all their games, so i am a football buff, but this game is different, i purchased as a download, and i have no transfer list, i have no way of changing payments from $ to sterling, your players do not follow orders, so if you say mark tighter, they dont, oh yeah the downloads for the game dont work either, in fact i would say this game sucks, and please do not purchase it. it is .",3
"first time ive been addicted to football manager since it changed from champ man",1
"ive bought this game for many years and think this might be my last. firstly im not keen on spending 30 a year on something that could be released as an update. the lack of competition in the manager genre has made si very lazy, to the point where they make one or two small changes and market it as a new game. here are some of the points where my problems lie -ridiculous injurys, in my first season there was not one point where i didnt have at least six players injured -how many times in real football does a team make all its subs then a player gets injured and they finish the game with 10 men? well in fm about one in three games but amazingly never to the computer opponent -its almost impossible to generate any momentum anymore in fm, you will be playing well then suddenly lose for no reason -football has always been in the headlines for footballers astronomical wages, thank god its not like fm, youth players who have never made a first team appearance asking for 40k! agents of average players asking for 5mill in fees! -instead of improving things like the ability to see how your players have performed in training during the week to help your decisions on who to play si add tunnel interviews?!? i can imagine the meeting at si so what have the fans on the forums been asking for well their all desperate for more press interviews in the game, they just dont feel theres enough as fans of the series we should treat si like an alchoholic relative and not hand over money to them to continue their bad habits, in this case their bad habits being treating fans like cash-cows that they can just make sub-standard games for and rely on fan loyalty",3
"i do not like writing about the games i have not completed,but... its rather hard to complete any fm series game. i have already spent some time with the game and i can say, that fm 2015 is good as always - which means perfect. i had some problems to get used to a bit new look of the menus after spending hundreds of hours in the previous edition, but after 5 hours i realized, that it is now even more clear and comfortable. there is no need now to click through three windows to find interesting stats or anything else. the authors added even more tactical features, which make the impression, that you have even greater control of the way the team plays the matches. the graphic got better, though its the least important part and of course the data base is updated adding thousands of new players, managers and more.. its impossible to describe this game shortly and there is no sense in writing poems about it. if you have never played any football manager game and are at least a bit interested in football, then give it a try. and if you have played, then you probably do not any recommendation.",3
"update: too many dramas!!! like most player became upset, cause i sold one useless youth player 0_o more complain because someone lack of appearance even their status are not regular, then playing him as starter 3 matches straight, asking for leave, whining to team mates, my team morale down wtf if you like drama more than football, buy this game and also match engine still ridiculous, any opponent can score 2-3 on my team.",3
"first days play: there is a lot of familiarity here and also a lot of new learnings. the ui has been revamped giving more of a taskbar feel and for me not a bad layout at all. i can get to more frequent places in game with one or two clicks now rather than 3 or 4 which is appreciated. takes a little getting used to in finding your way around but that was expected. im playing with england being playable and every other country viewable. filters include all regions top league players coming it at about 130,000. some nice new features include the touchline shouts which im still looking at the effects but generally seem to be working ok. some tweaks with the scouting and man management options too which i like a lot. the engine itself is different enough to distinguish itself from previous games yet isnt a true evolvement, more upgrade than paradigm shift. visuals have been upgraded all over. i really like the tactic options, feels more rounded now. lots of nice shortcuts. very happy with the purchase and looking forward to having long careers!",2
"i rate 8/8. but seriously though this is a great game. for the past two years ive spent way too many hours on football manager games and i reckon this wont be any different. yeah there are some problems, yeah it could be better in some ways. but hey, its a brilliant game other than these miniscual problems. i fully recommened it to anyone intrested in football as its a game with so much depth you wouldnt beleive. pros + detail/depth (the database is used by real clubs its accurate!) addictive (you just dont get bored) challenging (its much more challenging than in recent years) interactions (its nice to see much more options in interviews) 3d match engine (yeah its got its problems, explained below, but its still good) new ui design (the new user interface is so much easier to navigate, give it a couple of hours and youll never want o go back) cons - 3d match engine (the only reason its a problem is if your tactics arent good enough it makes the players make stupid mistakes and can be quite unrealisitic and frustrating. but if it was 2d it wouldnt be as bad just because you cant see the mistakes as much. just get your tactics right. match engine (so hard to defend, so easy to score. expect lots of high scoring games for no reason) crashes (this has happened 3/4 times since i got it on the 29/10 happens at any time, hope it gets sorted soon. just set it to save every fortnight and youll be fine) so overall another great game which i much prefer over the recent games and fully recommend.",2
"for all the people on here complaining about goal bugs etc, they have almost all been fixed. this is clearly the best football manager yet, much more in depth, and yes there are a few flaws, but if youd care to name me one decent videogame without a few flaws id be much abliged to hear. if you are a fan of football management sims, get this game! its as simple as that ;-)",6
"love this game and i have loved the games before it, real difference this year and i personally feel like it has improved leaps and bounds!! well done sega and the fm team!",3
"more realistic changes on form of a player tha before, plus closer realism on goals with scrambles and imporved grapics with the ball / players reacting as could really happen. watch out for transfer problems like transfer listed and work permit problems. still good stuff, very well researched",5
"i purchased this game two days ago while it was in the beta version and then today clicked to play and had to wait for a download (which i assume would be the fully updated game) and i have found it is exactly the same as the beta version. i am talking about things like the team badges (prem leauge) in the beta version they are made up and have seen videos on youtube of people playing fm2015 with the teams having the real and correct badges. can anyone tell me how this is and where i am going wrong......i have looked for another update for the game with no luck. the spanish teams have their real crests but most other countries do not so i feel steam have robbed me as i cannot find a way to contact them.",3
"this game is great! almost 400 hours on it so far. love it!",6
"fm used to be a great football manager, now it has become a great kindergarden manager, if that is what you are looking for. trying to keep footballers happy will either drive you insane or push you towards the ultra-vanilla classic mode. i wouldnt mind a slightly less realistic game if it was slightly more enjoyable to play.",5
"enjoying the new layout, although its taking a little longer than i expected to adjust. the game does seem to be a bit harder than 2013 and 2014, which is good.",2
"i havent played fm since the 08 so had a pretty tough beginner time with this one, but after a day everything seems ok now. i am surprised that i havent experienced the injury bug like a lot of people have been talking about in this patch, the game overall was fantastic. the only thing that pissed me off is the 3d match, really hard to tell if the players got tackled or not, sometimes it feels like the other players just purposely tackle ur players (the ones whos about to receive the ball) in the pelnaty area and nothing happens, even the commentary doesnt say anything. the models are just stupid sometimes, they just stand in one place and let the opponents run passed them. the goalkeeper never pick up the ball when they are supposed to, overall a lot of things wrong with the 3d system. hope they will develop in the next game.",2
"player asked improved contract. agent doesnt let him enter talks with me. complains to lockeroom, everybody wants improved contract for him, makes everyone unhappy, next thing i know xlllx. 10/10",4
"i will recommend that you buy this game, dont listen to all this negative recommendations",7
"the game has many improvements but untill they sort out the news feed which literally hurt my eyes and stopped me from contiuning due to not being able to read i cannot reccomend this game any more. sorry but the new design looks like its been designed by kids!",2
"great game. have been playing since the 98/99 days of championship manager and always find the money to buy on release day. better and better year on year, a credit to the sports simulation world! keep it going si games!",4
"match engine is very poor. spend so much time working to build a decent squad and to develop tactics that work only for it to be entirely spoiled by the way this game treats me. too many injuries, too many goals, morale crumbles at the slightest thing, players do not follow instructions, goalkeepers are pitiful, poor animations, players are overly stroppy, long saving times. this is a video game - game being the operative word. i dont really care if this is as realistic as it gets. id sacrifice realism if the game was fun, but its not. fm 2014 was poor too. im still hoping a patch will deal with some if not all of these issues, but part of me knows it wont. goodbye 20 years of loyalty to si. these things are too expensive for me to spend money on if theyre not enjoyable.",5
"gonna fail end of year exams because of this game. thanks si. 10/10 will still play.",7
"i dont know what people are crying about. i havent noticed any problems with the injuries and ive started several saves both in top and bottom tier football. overall this is by far the best football manager thats released to date althought theres still a few bugs here and there like theres pretty much every year. by the january update the game will most likely be pretty much a bug free, which is when most people buy the game anyway. the new match engine is very promising and i think its already better than in the previous versions. the new touchline team talks also seems to be working pretty well and the add another dimension to the game. the new scouting system is also superior compared to the previous versions. and then the new ui... its again way better than before and having the side panel back just makes its so much easier to navigate through the menus. so overall i think its the best football manager game to date, although it still have a few bugs here and there. if you are a fan of the football manager franchise then this is definitely a must buy. remember that the christmas sales are coming soon so its probably worth waiting till then if you havent got the game already by now. and this was written by someone who spents 1000-1500 hours with football manager each year and i own each and every game of the serie including quite a few versions of cm too.",10
"agree about the injuries, after two games i have half of my squad injured for at least 3/4 weeks, it needs sorting asap, and as for the layout, it can be confussing at first but once you get used to it, it works well.",4
"much better than 2014. simple lay out and good fun. a must buy!",5
"first off, i want to say that i was in two minds about getting this game. reviews from the fans didnt seem very positive and as this game has a great community and fan following i was quite shocked. the main criticism has been the frequency of injuries. from what i have seen this is not even true! if anything ive seen fewer injuries than in previous versions. i have been looking closely to see this so called injury problem yet ive never seen more than two key players being injuried at one time and not even for very long! its overall a great and addicting game and my favourite yet if im honest. however, the match engine, although improved, is quite poor and freak goalkeeper mistakes dont seem all that freak anymore as they occur quite a few times each season. however im pretty sure the match engine isnt much to go by (the commentary sometimes says completely different things to what the match engine shows - e.g player shoots really wide but the commenary claims it was almost in) this isnt much of a problem in all honesty and if you had commentary on only you wouldnt ever notice. the new menu layout is really good in my opinion and finding what i want to do is now much easier and quicker making me actually pay more attention to tactics, training and scouting (which i have often ignored to a large extent in previous games) overall id say this game is great and the series is still going strong. so glad i got this game, i would advise you buy it too!",1
"i shall try keep this brief as this is making me miss more time in game, i have only played this version and its predecessor, fm 14 was a great game in its own right and not many improvments needed to be done, in my opinion, then i strarted fm 15, straight away you can see the changes esp with the new and improved interface, it does take a little time getting used to but it is alot more in depth, the tactics page, you have alot more options on this giving players more options on how to play, one of the major flaws however in this years edt of the game which i hope they fix with a patch, is how many players get injured in a season, it feels more of an action game that could rival max payne games, my squad lost 3 keepers for 4 months all due to the same injury at around the same time, that is also not to mention all the other injuries i suffered thru the season, i also played an internation competion as england and somehow managed to beat germany 8 - 2, as much as i loved the sore line to the game and i buzzed for a while, in reality this is not possible, overall the game is very addictive and if youre into these kind of games, a must buy",1
"problems with the ***** steam! i purchased the game and i havent played it yet!!!",2
"the worst fm ever!!!!!! half of my team is injured and the graphics are sooooo bad, i wish i could ask for a refund.... 100% waste of money",5
"wont be buying football manager 16 as this game is on another level such as price you have to pay for players it can be up 2000% there value, wingers run and gradually slow down then are tackled and if a ball goes over the line it is a goal but according to football manager thats not a goal and what is it with clubs not having the badge plus cup logos and kits all ready included if i pay 30 pound for a game i want the game to have the club logos and cup logos and real names many many thing needed to be improved the acutual 3d game when watched is nothing like football a child could tell that 5/10 need serious improvement to match the price p.s sicki baba",2
"love this game.. very entertaining so far.. rarely i got crash on this game, fix it please",2
"not the best verion of fm but certainly not the worst. yes there are bugs and irritations but still playable.",5
"love the series, but this is only adding to the manner in which fms match engines are getting worse and worse. in my onw opinion, the series has been in huge decline since 2012; and this is absolutely no exception. own goals here, own goals there. 5 goals here, 10 goals there. goalkeepers? ha. until si fix the match engine - something that im doubting will actually happen after the way that the fm14 engine was awful throughout - dont purchase this. find 2012 online somewhere and play the last game in the series that i can say was a really enjoyable game.",2
"i thought it would be a good idea to spend a fair amount of money on this game.... how wrong was i. its just boring to play and sh*t, i thought playing with my friends would make it a bit more fun..... yet again how wrong was i, having to wait all the fu*king time just for some c*nt to press continue. the gameplay is w*nk, poor graphics and not even real names of the clubs are used. if you want to buy this game as something fun to play then dont its sh*t.",1
"most in-depth manager game, i bought this game reading all the bad reviews and not expecting much but it really is an improvement, if you love managing your team, then this game is for you! :)",1
"very disappointed with this years game. lots of screens have been changed and they are now harder to navigate and make the changes you need that before - seems like a bad change to me. a few of my grievances: the squad selection screen, you now cant left click on a substitute to chose who to swap them with you cant create custom views for the opposition instructions screen - why?!? who thought that was a good idea? im also not really a fan of the new match engine but i cant put my finger on what i dont like. is it too bright, choppy (even with graphics levels set low). *sigh* on the whole, i wish i hadnt bought it.",10
"quite different from the earlier versions and will take some time to adapt. some new fixes, but all in all it feels more or less just like an updated version of fm14 with transfers etc. would still recommand, unless you have higher expectations to the game.",3
"probably the worst football manager to date, bugs galore, stupid goals, saving take an age plus many more things wrong with the game. do not buy.",2
"bought original game and got a crash dumps error. no topic have solved the problem in the forums. no help from anywhere. dont even buy game. t is waste of money!!  am so regretfull. shame on you fm producers and steam employee",3
"so frustating. i dont know whats wrong. i feel like i lost my ability to play this game. i am noob all over again. (been playing since 2001). - my team keep shooting didnt score. the enemy 1 bullet to the heart! and of course i lost the game. - my wing back keep dribbling until byline wont cross, and if he do the crosses hit enemy foot and goes corner kick. frustating. - my goalie is dumb, enemies goalie is all neuer! unbeatable. i need. or we all need major fixes. please. :(",2
"although the most challenging of the series so far, more because of the new adaption to the layout and the scouting methods. for me its a big improvement on user interface but the harsh amount of injuries it makes progression a longer task where you have to put mild detail into the smaller things instead of throwing it to your below par am. i suggest it if you put a good amount of time into the later games but for a newbie 13/14 would be a safer choice in the way of enjoyment of the game and winning things.",1
"i have owned and loved every football manager game, but have to say that this new game is very hard to get into, and the menus in particular the finding players is all near impossible. bought it 2 days ago, have gone back to my old game on fm2014. 2/10, not a happy customer!!!",7
"i dont know why there is so much negative reviews out there, the game is great and the new scouting is much more realistic now. ive played this version since the beta (12 november) and ive only encountered 3 crashes overall so dont worry too much about that. new interface feels great, just need to get used to it. regarding the me, there seem to be a lot of goal from crosses making a tactic with wingers like 4-5-1 maybe too rewarding. ive already played +100hours in several top and bottom div and i havent noticed much irrealistics things happening, you still get a few dumb keeperes/dc mistakes but  happens irl as well so np. the databases are up to date except for the french leagues because sadly french scouts are lazy. but theres already a patch out there for ligue 1 and 2 so no worries. overall pretty solid new opus (i have 700+ hours on most fm since fm2010), people need to stop crying when city, chelsea, the psg etc... are buying wonderkids for 20+millions because thats whats happening irl duh.",3
"why you no work?? bought the disk, not the steam download, what a shocker it is not working. disgraceful for a game that has been running like this for so long!",5
