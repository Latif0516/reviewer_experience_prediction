Here you go: I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience. I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist. I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.", "num_groups": 32, "friend_player_level": 36, "num_badges": 41, "num_workshop_items": 0, "num_guides": 0, "date_posted": "September 9, 2014", "orig_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/app/10/homecontent/?userreviewsoffset=0&p=1&itemspage=1&screenshotspage=1&videospage=1&artpage=1&allguidepage=1&webguidepage=1&integratedguidepage=1&discussionspage=1&appid=10&appHubSubSection=10&appHubSubSection=10&l=english&browsefilter=toprated&filterLanguage=default&searchText=&forceanon=1", "num_found_helpful": 0, "num_friends": 149, "found_helpful_percentage": 0, "username": "Ernest Wolf", "profile_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/ernestmurdertrain", "num_screenshots": 43, "total_game_hours": 1440.5, "hours_previous_2_weeks": 0.0, "num_reviews": 21, "num_comments": 20}
