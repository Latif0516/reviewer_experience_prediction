{"num_found_funny": 0, "profile_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/ernestmurdertrain", "review": "This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go: I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience. I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist. I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.", "num_reviews": 21, "review_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/ernestmurdertrain/recommended/10/", "num_badges": 41, "num_screenshots": 43, "found_helpful_percentage": 0, "total_game_hours": 1440.5, "total_game_hours_last_two_weeks": 0.0, "num_groups": 35, "username": "Ernest Wolf", "rating": "Recommended", "num_voted_helpfulness": 0, "num_guides": 0, "num_games_owned": 379, "date_updated": "Jun 8, 2015, 11:40AM", "num_workshop_items": 0, "orig_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/app/10/homecontent/?userreviewsoffset=0&p=1&itemspage=1&screenshotspage=1&videospage=1&artpage=1&allguidepage=1&webguidepage=1&integratedguidepage=1&discussionspage=1&appid=10&appHubSubSection=10&appHubSubSection=10&l=english&browsefilter=toprated&filterLanguage=default&searchText=&forceanon=1", "date_posted": "Sep 9, 2014, 12:32PM", "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_percentage": 0.9543859649122807, "num_achievements_possible": 285, "num_achievements_attained": 272}, "steam_id_number": "ernestmurdertrain", "num_found_helpful": 0, "num_comments": 20, "num_friends": 149, "friend_player_level": 36, "num_found_unhelpful": 0}

{"num_found_funny": 0, "profile_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/RealToTheTenThousandthDegree", "review": "CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in. It starts off with a team trying to kill another team. I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun. Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course. When I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more. CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically. Over the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness. In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).", "num_reviews": 1, "review_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/id/RealToTheTenThousandthDegree/recommended/10/", "num_badges": 2, "num_screenshots": 3, "found_helpful_percentage": 0, "total_game_hours": 6059.1, "total_game_hours_last_two_weeks": 0.0, "num_groups": 11, "username": "ManaF", "rating": "Recommended", "num_voted_helpfulness": 0, "num_guides": 0, "num_games_owned": 19, "date_updated": "Jan 13, 2014, 1:45AM", "num_workshop_items": 0, "orig_url": "http://steamcommunity.com/app/10/homecontent/?userreviewsoffset=0&p=1&itemspage=1&screenshotspage=1&videospage=1&artpage=1&allguidepage=1&webguidepage=1&integratedguidepage=1&discussionspage=1&appid=10&appHubSubSection=10&appHubSubSection=10&l=english&browsefilter=toprated&filterLanguage=default&searchText=&forceanon=1", "date_posted": "Jan 13, 2014, 1:35AM", "achievement_progress": {"num_achievements_percentage": 0.7724550898203593, "num_achievements_possible": 167, "num_achievements_attained": 129}, "steam_id_number": "RealToTheTenThousandthDegree", "num_found_helpful": 0, "num_comments": 22, "num_friends": 268, "friend_player_level": 7, "num_found_unhelpful": 0}
