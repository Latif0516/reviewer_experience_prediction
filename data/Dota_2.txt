review: Dota 2, where do I start. This game has ruined my social life, I spend every day on this game, training, waiting, and drinking through my mountain dew, to one day become the greatest. My father said to me, "Son, you will never be dondo." I said to my father, "Dad, I mid, or I feed." My dad dropped to the ground in tears, screaming at the all mighty gabe newell, begging for his son back, but it was too late, I was already back on dota, at mid, blaming my team for sucking This game is why I wake up, Why I masturbate, why I decide that masturbating while playing is a good idea. Thank you for such an amazing game, without this game I would have nothing to get mad at when I am rock solid.

review: When I first started DOTA2 I was a little overwhelmed, as my first ARTS/MOBA game it was pretty complicated. I soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying. Before I knew it, I was performing  and better. I stopped making silly  and  got vastly better at not  the enemy . For the  part, everyone I've met was very helpful and , there  the   however. As  - play DOTA2    ,  ,     .      !

review: I originally played Dota when it was merely a UMS on WC3, so take this review for what it's worth. Dota 2 is an addictive experience; however, this game also draws a player base from the bottom of society. If that statement is an insufficient description of the game, continue reading. This game is not for the casual gamer, this game is for those who have the capability to log in hundreds of hours into a game. If you play this game, I can attest that there will be times you love it and times you just want to break your monitor with your keyboard. I have a few hundred hours into the game and no matter how long you play, no matter what you do, you will encounter someone who will complain about something you're doing poorly or not doing correctly and it may ruin the gameplay for you. I can only recommend this game if you have thick skin or you have friends to play with. So here are what I consider the pros and cons of the game: Pros -This is a very intricate strategy based game that relies heavily on teamwork and timing. -Free to play with optional cosmetic costs. -Gameplay always varies due to each individual hero selection. This, in effect, increases replayability tremendously. -Wonderful voice actors with interesting dialogue choices by the developer. -Winning matches in this game often triggers the release of dopamine in the reward center in your brain creating the desire to play more. This in effect causes players to really want to win and may be the trigger of many cons of the game. Cons -This game has a steep learning curve, believe me, there is way more to this game than you might think at first glance. Unlike hero customization in League of legends, not all heroes are created equal and not all ward placements are either. It can be a little intimidating to think that your team is already at a disadvantage from the hero selection, but thus is DOTA. -Secondary to the steep learning curve, games tend to be won or lost by the actions of an individual on either team. This can be ameliorated by steam implementing some sort of "fundamentals of gameplay" video instead of the current lackadaisical tutorial they have. Suffice to say, many new players do not understand that every time their hero is killed by the opposing team, the player loses gold and the other team gains gold. This doubles the impact that each individual has for gameplay. -Unlike other video game developers, Steam does not region lock. This brings about an unforeseen consequence where individuals from any country can join any server despite having a language preference. You can imagine how difficult it is to create a coordinated cohesive team push when there's a Russian only speaker, Spanish only speaker and a Portuguese only speaker on the US WEST server. -Blame is a word that is thrown around in this game like the word inequality is thrown around in America. Unfortunately, this is by far the worst aspect of the game. The game community has very little to no interaction prior to gameplay or thereafter and there is no review conversation on what an individual can do to improve in the future. More often than not, an individual will oversimplify the ongoing team loss to 1 action by 1 individual because of time constraints and heated emotions. -There is no team forfeit vote option in game and often you are sitting there for 10-20 minutes as the other team wastes your time despite securing a victory much earlier. This review is from personal experience and your gameplay may vary. Of course, if you do meet someone ingame who is a decent person, be sure to commend them at the end of the match for their ingame courtesy. Final Rating: -Game 9/10 -Game community 3/10

Sorry in advance There once was a man named zeus His team put him mid on the loose He could totally  But had no escape and so he got ganked like a moose One time Pugna I tried to play But forgot that there is no way To get more than five health Without massive wealth And bounty hunter stuck his peepee in my bum over and over and over and I cried Sometimes if there is a dragon You need to purchase a dagon And then you go ZAP And all 'cross the map People made the excuse they were laggin' Nyx nyxnyx nyx nyxnyx nyx Nyxnyx nyx nyxnyx nyx nyx nyx Nyx nyx nyx nyx Nyx nyx nyx nyx nyx Nyxnyx nyx nyxnyx nyx nyx nyx There once was a brave little feller Who wanted to be the best speller But he was russian And people are 's So now he lives in a cellar There once was a brave little a bear Who smoked into Roshan's lair So hard he tried But he got bashed and died And now his team is giving him the glare If you play dota beware Because it's sometimes a pit of dispair Advice you will heed But your teem will still feed And then you will switch to solitair So I just wasted a solid 25 minutes making jenky limericks about dota...

review: I've always wanted to go to Russia. To learn the culture, eat and drink and see the sights. But I cannot do that, as it is expensive and I'm busy doing my uni work. But then I found Dota 2. This free learning course teaches you all about Russians and their culture. I can even speak decent Russian! However, these Russian people can get quite angry and annoying. They often shout the phrase "" and bring you to the depths of insanity. I got forced to drink my sorrows away during the beginning of the course, but it was worth it in the end. If you don't have the time and money to travel to Russia, I'd suggest you pick up Dota 2. A fantastic learning resource. 8/10

Whisk flour, salt, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Add vegetable shortening and work into flour mixture using a pastry cutter until it resembles coarse crumbs. 2. Form a well in the middle of flour mixture and mix in hot water. Work flour and water mixture together with a fork and transfer to a cutting board. 3.

review: There is fine line between bravery and stupidity - Juggernaut. Going into DotA 2 is crossing this line. You've got to be brave to even consider playing it in the first place. If you stay here longer than 2 hours, then I'm sorry but you're stupid. So am I. Because this game, as enraging it can be, is also really enjoyable experience. If you want to be constantly surprised by game, developers and other players, and there is inner drive of self-improvement in you it's game for you. Even if, at the end of the day, you suspect yourself of masochistic tendencies, just try it.

review: Dota 2 is sequel to critically acclaimed hat trading sim, Team Fortress 2. What Valve has managed to do with hats is astounding. They've improved upon everything that the original had to offer, and then they kicked it up a notch. Imagine a world where everyone and every thing has a hat. Now imagine that you can become THAT hat. You are the weapon, you are the bullet, you are the sword edge. That's immersion on a new level. Never before has an experience been this good. I recommend this to anyone who has ever, or will ever dream of hat, hats, or hat accesories. If you haven't yet, you need to experience this. Go do it. Now. 11/10 Hats, it's alright.

I especially enjoy it when super awesome pro players stream the games to twitch and say that their 5 viewers are laughing at me. Classic banter. Every now and then I'll give back some playful jabs but I'm not very imaginative. My favourite lines are "i'll wear your skin kunt" and "your whorsish mother will taste your  blood tonight stain" Classic banter

review: Dota 2 is quickly becoming the most played game on Steam, and for good reason. The blend of well-balanced multiplayer, infinite replayability, gorgeous aesthetics, and the time and care Valve has put in to support the community is a recipe for perfection. I simply cannot reccomend Dota 2 enough. The game boasts a roster of over a hundred heroes, and each one feels unique and well-designed. In any given match, you take control of a singular hero, and victory or defeat hinges not only on how well you play that hero, but how also on how well you synergize with your five person team. Unfortunately, the barrier of entry is high. Quite a lot of research, preparation, and knowledge is required to be sucessful, and it can be frustrating losing repeatedly. However, tutorials are available to guide new players, and the time spent learning only adds to the satisfaction of landing a five-man Black Hole or pulling off that perfect Blink-Poof combo. Spectacularly enough, the battlefield is not the only area where the game shines. Dota TV is an in-game spectator mode that allows the option to watch professional teams play in tournaments, including the multi-million dollar International that Valve hosts on a yearly basis. And all of this for free. There are cosmetic items that can be used to customize your favorite hero, however nothing availble changes gameplay in any way. They are mostly designed by members of the community and can be purchased or recieved randomly while playing. Content patches and new heroes are being added all the time. Dota 2 will continue to grow for years, hopefully continuing to find new players interested in a fast-paced online multiplayer experience that is equal parts exhilirating and engaging.

LoL has childish names like Blue Team, Red Team, Minions, Turrets and Inhibitors. Not to mention all the champion names are like that too. Its targeted at 4-9 year olds that recently quit runescape and want a DirectX9 game because their computer is too wooden. These days, easy games attracts NOOBS. Many LoL players used to play Dota but they got wrecked too hard, so they just play LoL, therefore the all the worlds worst gamers are addicted to this no brainer game. Same reason goes why Dota TI players OWN in ranked LoL, but LoL Worlds players cannot even survive in unranked Dota. The gap for the skill requirements for these 2 games is simply uncomparable. Simply amazing how Riot earns millions of $$$$$$$ yet still can't keep their servers functioning. The time it takes to download and install Dota2 is about the same as the time to update LoL. Its true that its a selfish company created for REVENUE ONLY. WTF is $10 for a NAME CHANGE? WTF is $20 for a server transfer? I ALMOST FEEL SORRY FOR LOL PLAYERS GETTING THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY STOLEN BY A TRASH COMPANY THAT EMPLOYS STAFF THAT USES THEIR SERVERS TO TOAST MARSHMELLOWS

review: great game if you hate having fun. the anti-fun levels of this game are the highest i've ever seen. if you like having fun or being happy, stay well away. this is a game made for people who like having their bum smacked by a girl and being told to enjoy it. the voice acting is pretty good as well. -- EDIT: by special request, i'm going to tell you how to find little nuggets of fun in this game that will improve your gameplay experience if you decide to try this game. -ignore your grumpy teammates and use your abilities and items when you want to. -stay away from tryhard meganerd modes like captains* and play fun gamemodes like diretide. -if you see any weird letters like  or that one that looks like a 6, MUTE everybody on both teams and stay on the lookout for opportunities to have fun. -never queue for matchmaking without a good friend. things that are NOT fun and you SHOULD NOT do if you like fun -buy wards when you have no spare money -pick dumb heroes with lots of buttons like chen -listen to grumpy teammates i hope this has helped you to get more fun out of valve's Dota 2. please mark this review as helpful if it has helped.

review: I guess I have to review this game because I've banked so many hours into it. I'll keep it brief. Dota 2 is probably the most frustrating game ever created. Your team will let you down constantly, the enemy team will consistently pick the heroes you hate playing against the most, you will never get the hat drops you want, and your own mind and body will frequently betray you and make you contend with the fact that you are not nearly as good as you think you are (or, more likely, force you to live in a fantasy dream world where you are as good as you think you are and just blame your teammates some more). It'll turn you into a monster and destroy your life. It'll murder your loved ones and feed them to you. But you'll play it anyway. You'll ragequit and uninstall and stare at your library of games as the creeping realization sweeps over you that you not playing Dota 2 will not effect the universe in even the smallest way, will have no conceivable effect on anything. You will be filled with a sudden dread that nothing you do matters and life has no meaning. Basically the same feeling you get when you play Dota 2. And Dota 2 will be your only distraction from this dessicated husk of a life. So the next day you'll find yourself drawn back into it like a moth to a flame, staving off the moment when you'll have to face your demons for as long as you can. You will probably die alone some day and nobody will remember how high your MMR was or your sunstrike accuracy. So what are you waiting for, you worthless peons?! Get out there and dance! DANCE FOR THE PUPPETMASTER GABE! GO EARN YOUR HATS, YOU CRAVEN MONGRELS! 0/10 would not recommend to anyone but can't stop playing and won't be able to stop you either.

review: Support died because trying to save carry. Carry: "Please no feed, support." Carry: "0/7 lol, noob" Neither they know, support stunned the enemies for their kill, slow them, silence them. All for them. Support is the guy who is behind the carry, doing stuffs. Without a support, where will be the courrier and the wards be? Support is love, support is life.

review: At first I thought this game was pretty good, but that was until the first time I was called a "feeder". Dota 2 is basically a game based around teamwork, except the community only does three things. 1. Call each other f*gs and berate one another for slightly foolish decisions. 2. Do solo farm and try to win the match by themselves (which never works, ESPECIALLY if they are playing against a team of 5 players in a party, also known as a five stack.) 3. Make fun of, and ruin everything for, new players. If you want to learn how to play Dota 2, you either need a really good guide, or a good friend who has more than 500 hours into the game. The tutorial just teaches you the basics. No, you can't learn by yourself by playing matchmaking with random people. All you'll learn from the other players is that you suck because you're new and don't understand any of the tactics, and that the best course of action would be to uninstall. There's also the fact that some people create new Steam accounts so they can be matched up against newbies and annihilate everyone. Also, this game stole all my friends. We used to play other games, now they play nothing other than Dota 2 and one of them has spent $40 in the game... ON SKINS! COSMETIC ITEMS THAT ADD NOTHING TO THE GAMEPLAY! YOU CAN BUY SOME OF THE BEST GAMES ON STEAM FOR LESS, I REPEATE, LESS THAN $40! AND THEN HE TOLD ME HE ONLY PLAYS DOTA BECAUSE HE CAN'T AFFORD ANY GAMES ON STEAM!!! So there. Terrible community, steals your friends, incredibly addictive if let it be. Don't touch this game. I spent way too much time hating myself while playing this. Never again. EDIT: 172 people read this review. Wow. Also, I have to say, I think the in-game tutorials are better than the actual game, because the actual game has only one map, unlike the tutorials. I know this is pretty standard for MOBA games, but for me this contributes greatly to actually ruining variety and fun in the gameplay. It's just all the same tactics over and over on the same map. This doesn't only mean less variety, but it also means that veterans will know the game just that much better. On another note, this game is like the opposite of everything I like about TF2. Unbalanced classes (According to Google, every Dota hero/champion/class/whatever the hell is overpowered), only A SINGLE MAP, relies too much on teamwork when it's hard to find online (whereas TF2 benefits from teamwork, but still, it's not the key to winning a game, and it's much easier to achieve teamwork, because TF2 doesn't rely NEARLY as hard on your early-game. The early-game in Dota literally either makes or breaks the whole game for you, setting the outcome of the match in stone almost literally during the first ten minutes of the game.), and also, a horrible community. Not saying TF2's community is good, but hell, it's miles above Dota. Don't really know why I am comparing this game to TF2, maybe because Valve made both games, but still, just wanted to throw out there some actual criticisms about the game itself and not the community. Now, some people have been telling me "Pfft, just block the trash talkers". That doesn't change anything. They're still horrible at teamwork, which, like I said, is the entire point of the game. And if you block them, you can't coordinate with them. Basically, it's not only a bad game for new players because you suck, it's also a bad game for new players because everyone else sucks. Except for Koreans, whenever you see one in a game, bam, you already know his team has won. Overall, I think Dota, nay, the whole MOBA genre, has great potential, but it's just too bad I've yet to see any game in the genre actually achieve to fulfill it.

review: Dota 2 is a very highly skilled game, don't expect to walk in and expect you being very good. You are going to die alot and probably yell at your team mates but that's just the nature of this game. Dota 2 takes place in an arena where you will fight to destory the enemies Anicent if you destory it; you win. The Ancient is protected by 11 stuctures called towers that protect it. Each of these towers are found in each of the three lanes bottom, middle and top. You take control of a unit that is a hero, many of them are diverse and have a lot of pros and cons such as Crystal Maiden who is really good at locking down heros early game with her stun but she is also the slowest hero in the game. You are accompanied by 4 other players including yourself to fight against another 5 players. You need to push lanes to be able to destory the enemy towers in each lane but the catch is the enemy team is doing the same thing, so you need to not only push to your victory but to stop the enemy team from pushing aswell. There is 107 heros in Dota 2 out of the 112 heroes that are in the Warcraft III. They are categorised into 3 groups. Strenght, which are usually the tanky guys. Agility, most carries are found in this category and Intelligence which most of the supports are usually found. All these heroes have different skill levels, such as Invoker who is an intelligence hero with 14 spells. He is able to create spells with 4 of his spells, creating the other 10. He is able to create tornados which disable enemies, meteors which looks epic and burns enemies that stand in front of it. Just an all round crazy hero. Viper is arguably the easiest hero which as 2 passive spells (Passive spells are spells that work all the time, you don't need to activate them) and 2 other spells which are targetable. You can customise your Dota experience with annoucer packs which change the voice of the annoucer which include Glados and the narrator from the Stanley Parable. You can change your HUD to different themes. The game allows you to buy tickets where you can support tournments, some of these tournments allowing you to directly contribute to the prize pool. Most of the time it is 25%. In 2014, The International is a annual tournment created by Valve for Dota 2. In 2014, the prize pool for this tournment became 10.9M dollars. First place got 5M dollars! If you are into ESports then this game will be up your ally. Dota 2 is a hard game, but if you look in the right places you are able to learn a lot, if you aren't sure you want to play this game, you can PM me and I can teach you how to play. I honestly don't mind.

review: This is yet another new release by the company "MOBA" (you may know this company from their popular games such as League of Legends, Dead island Epidemic and Dawngate). This is a very slow paced first person shooter set in the age after the 3rd great war in which humanity has been set back in the ages where magic was still okay to use, in this game you play as an ex soldier trying to defeat the main communist overlord "sniper" who threatens america as we know it. The single player aspect of this game is probably the best experience you'll have in this game as the online is currently dead, the developers stopped updating this game after league of legends was confirmed to be more balanced and a hell of a lot better. They did however unlock a new game mode called "Compendium" in which you simulate reading a book and collect trading cards. I'll give this game 3 meepos out of 5, it's okay but the fact that you're required to be able to speak russian to get this game really lets it down.

review: First twenty hours playing this game, got called NOOB for so many times that i went down to my basement and cried daily Second twenty hours playing this game, joined others and called the new guy 'NOOB' to avoid being called 'NOOB' Third twenty hours playing this, I finally got the courage to call others 'NOOB' all by myself Fourth twenty hours playing this game, I finally became mature enough to stop with all the NOOB bs and started to give advice to the other players from atop my mighty throne Overall, DOTA 2 is an addictive, competitive MMO whose community precedes its reputation, almost everyone is downright selfish, everyone only wants more kills to sate their hunger for commendations, which they even beg for. The trick to enjoying it though ? start playing with friends or people you know, make a plan, help your teammates, and CHOOSE A SUPPORT IF YOU SEE THERE ARE NONE ! and reach level 13 and you can play ranked matches, where the people are not much friendlier but will at least help you out. EDIT: oh and always remember to uncheck 'Russia' when selecting servers why ? no reason, just thought i should say that ^^ GODLIKE GAME ! someone kill it (you will get this reference after playing the game)

review: DOTA 2 is the best in the MOBA class. I've played LoL, DOTA and some lesser known MOBAs and DOTA 2 is by far the best. In addition, it is F2P which is amazing. Unlike LoL or HoN which require you to use a rotating hero list until you buy your own with real money or accumulate enough in-game currency to buy a single hero, DOTA 2 immediately gives you access to its entire library of heroes, for free. The only paid content are cosmetical items that do not change gameplay. Graphics are great. Gameplay is great. Crashes are very minimal. ITS FREE.

review: Dota 2 is the semi-sequel/remake/re-release/evolution of the long-running WarCraft 3 mod Defense of the Ancients, which in itself was based on a custom map for StarCraft called Aeons of Strife. After the release of the original Dota map in 2003, the WarCraft 3 community began producing a long line of Dota spin-offs, sequels and mods (just as Eul, Dota's creator, had used AoS as inspiration for Dota itself), which culminated in the release of DotA: Allstars by Steve "Guinsoo" Feak. Allstars would become the most dominant and consistently updated version of all the Dota maps and mods. In 2005, Guinsoo passed the torch to the enigmatic IceFrog, who has been supporting, updating, and shaping Dota ever since. His changes have been the most significant, the most popular (the mod grew more during his time than ever before), and arguably have benefited and enriched Dota as a whole. By 2010, DotA: Allstars became simply DotA, and IceFrog was showing no signs of stopping. Later that year, Dota 2 was formally announced (with its development spear-headed by both IceFrog and Eul, both of its most important "authors"; its past and present, alike), entered a semi-closed beta in late 2011, and was finally officially released in mid-2013... and the rest is history. History lessons aside, Dota 2 is a game of uncompromising depth and complexity. Though its gameplay intricacies can appear opaque, arbitrary and incomprehensible at first sight, the way these expansive game mechanics interact with one another when exposed to the element of player imperfection is truly remarkable: over a hundred heroes, each with at least four spell-based abilities and all capable of using up to six magical items, from a massive arsenal of over a hundred. Games can last anywhere from 25 to 55 minutes, and possibly far more! Dota's metagame is constantly shifting, and as of writing the game and mod are at total parity through version 6.80, released earlier this year. On top of that, it is completely free to play, with no features locked out to any players whatsoever. Not even cosmetic items, which form the backbone of the game's vast micro-transaction-based economy: these items are freely distributed by Valve to all players through level-based gift drops and random-chance item drops. Free game updates alter the game balance significantly, while introducing new seasonal game modes, and far more. And that's not even scratching the surface of the game's competitive scene, with its many tournaments, its constantly evolving teams and its own storylines, all leading up to the annual Valve-organized grand championship: The International. It may be incredibly difficult and frustrating at first, but given time, patience, simple memory and a keen mind, anyone can ultimately come to see Dota as perhaps the most enjoyable, enthralling and captivating game experience ever conceived. Oh, and it's

review: the game itself is good, had a lot of fun. But the problem with this game is that u are too much dependable on the people u get with you in matchmaking. Apparantly you have too much people who want to play carry, and then fail at it, what results in a waste of time. It usually starts already a hero selection. People don't communicate, only play what they want to play and usually lacks of teamplay when the game is busy. Too bad, because the game itself is good, the community is for 80% flamers, egotrippers, wannabe carry players, very rude

review: Valve is afraid some fat kid might commit suicide for being called a noob. And with this horribly broken matchmaking I see no sane reason to play this game anytime soon. And because Icefrog and the his devs ignorance about the EU servers turning to s'hit because of russians, who select english on purpose because their own servers on East is unbrearable with the horrible people who mostly feed and rage in their games, talking smack all the time. Now don't misunderstand, this is a great game with huge potential. But the truth of it is it's rotten from the bad matchmaking and somewhat horrid and lack of brain community. Main reasons not to play this game goes undisputed as follows: 1# Russians ruining games, talking russian when they clearly selected english as the preferred language. In case anyone hasn't noticed dota is a team game. 2# Solo queue has been removed(this means that you can be matched against an enemy 5 stack when you are playing alone) 3# No real community Q&A support from developers, and complete ignorance on the game dev forum, mods deleting posts that's not deemed "worthy" even though there is issues surrounding the topics. 4# Ranked is viritually a joke in comparison to normal MM, the only difference is a number for self gratification purposes, It viritually means nothing when most MMR's you are still playing with complete '. 5# Broken Solo-Queue. At times, matches you whether you are alone or 2 players playing together, you will often or not(depending on your luck) you will be matched with an enemy full 5 man team communicating in game, while your team is just 2+2+1 or just all solo players. This creates a huge disadvantage at the start of the match. Now Valve, has it ever occured to you in the small strains left of what corporate moral fiber you have that you should fix Dota 2's blatant community issues? Is this really how you get out of your responsibilities by ignoring and deleting users expressing concern in a non-inflammatory way? It's shameful considering how much of a profit you're making on it. At least you'd have the dignity to give us something back no? I've personally almost quit this game two times because I can't handle the community and players I am matched with constantly, they don't speak my language, share my mindset or my skill level the least, except an actual good match on some occations. Which leaves me with a horrible experience most of the time.

It's a incredibly deep game which intergrates complex gameplay and mechanics, its a very popular game when you notice the international competitive scene. however be warned that this game has a steep learning curve and I still consider myself a casual gamer type for this game and as most multiplayer game, you will encounter abrasive players in the community which could ruin the experience, though that can bes fixed by muting or reporting the player(s).

review: Dota 2 is one of if not the most frustrating and aggravating game ever created. Your teammates will cater the enemy team, not back you up, and refuse to call missings or place wards. The enemy team will always pick combos or  heroes that will make you want to immediately leave the game while your teammates pick 4 carrys after you randomed Phantom Assassin and tell you to buy the wards. Every other game you will get a Russian Pudge picker that feeds 3 kills mid in 5 minutes and immediately ruins all the work you've done last hitting every creep and harassing the enemy out of lane. You'll rage and call "GG" early and trash talk your teammates but you'll still keep playing in hope that the game will turn around. As things start to finally look good, you get bashed 5 times in a row by a faceless void or the Ogre Magi will get a 4x multi-cast on you 2 times in a row while the Nature's prophet is pushing your top barracks. But after all the rage inducing pain, you keep playing. You suffer through it for the chance of that amazing, satisfying comeback even though you're 20,000 gold behind the enemy team. Only to have your dreams crushed when the enemy team finally kills your ancient. But you still keep playing due to the feeling you get when you get that rampage that allows you to push to victory. Even so, after the game you'll still rage because of the common chest you get as a reward for your 60 minutes of pain and suffering. When you finally get that mythical you've always wanted, valve will come out with an event that lowers the price and makes it almost worthless. It's a drug that once hooked to, is almost impossible to break. You almost don't even realize you're raging and forget that you're telling your best friend how much of a feeding  he is and how this lost game is because of him when you're the one who has 1 kill and 13 deaths. You keep playing in hope that you'll get good enough where you'll be able to play with Dendi or the other pros and you know that'll most likely never happen but you keep playing in hope of it happening one day. I would not wish this addiction on my worst enemy. But I can't stop you, nor can I stop playing myself.

review: I have been a gamer for my whole life, but I never really put a ton of time into any one game. In the early 2000s, when I had a lot of free time, Quake 3, Elite Force, Jedi Knight 2, et cetra all took up a ton of my time; but as my age progressed, I had less time to dedicate to gaming. Mass Effect 1 and 2 both took about 100 hours away from me; but that was probably the most I'd invested in many years. I currently have around 500 hours of Dota 2, and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. The gameplay is spectacular, the community is great (I have made more Steam friends on this game than any other), the meta is interesting, the professional scene is a blast to watch, and the game is extremely well supported - especially with the recent Wraith Night/Legion Commander content update. The thing is that I'm not great at Dota 2. I've put almost 500 hours in, and there's still more for me to learn - there are still some heroes I have yet to play! It is a lot of investment, but once you 'get' it, you will have an absolute blast. EDIT: Just updating this now that I've put around 1600 hours in. I still completely stand by everything that I said previously. The game is super fun, and I'm really enjoying playing with all of the friends I've made in it. I've also experienced some of the negative parts of the community, and they're unfortunate; but I must say that they are far and few between. The community is largely welcoming, and I've made some fantastic friends through it - ones I hang out with in real life now. Definitely play the game, the learning curve is steep but entirely worth it.

review: After playing 1.500 hours (like there is 200 on the 2nd one) I have finally quit this game. Here is the reasons. 1)Broken stupid  meta , icefrog's nerfs and buffs. First of all the guy who makes all the balancing things doesn't even play the game itself. IF a hero gets picked too much in the pro scene , icefrog will nerf the  out of that hero and make it unplayable (Exp:Ember Spirit). Or he just buffs a hero like Riki since the day he came in Dota 2 (Riki is generally easy to counter in high skill pubs but he wrecks the  out of new players) and nerf a hero like Crystal Maiden both nerfing her damage movespeed etc. 2)THE ING COMMUNITY+MATCHMAKING (+Russians on English Lang.) AND RANKED Aaand here we are at the best part of Dota , the community... It is filled with immature kids who will rage at you and say stupid  like ''omfg u so noob'' ''learn2play feggit'' ''y u use midas on big creep'' , it's literally cancer for someone sensitive aganist stupidity . Believe me after spending hours and hours inside those people you will slowly become one of them or atleast it will cause depression + anger issues. Ranked system of Dota is just simply broken. There is no difference between a 3.5k player and a 1k player , it is all the same. The points are just there so some  can brag about his non existent 6k mmr lie.(Hell i typed a comment under a vid related to Dota some guy just came in and said he had 6k and you are a ing noob you should kill myself omfg) And the public matchmaking, slightly better than ranked a little bit because 1 out of a KAJILLION BILLION CHANCE you can actually meet with people who are funny and nice to play with (i made a lot of friends like this) but believe me most of the time you pick EU server with ENG language you will get Russians who farm Dagon on CM in hardlane and never communicate with you. You will slightly learn Russian because these guys never speak English even if they know it and since they love to scream in mic (like idi nahuy pidor  blyat padaroshnik pizdec bla bla bla...) you will instantly learn MOTTHEEERR RRRRUSSIA ACCENT.+Either you will get (Not being racist here , but Dota really does make you racist) Esta muerto mexican fellas , Spanish people on American server (or Russians with 9000 ping). Btw don't ever write guides like I did. I innocently wanted to help the other new players with a few guides about the heroes I know really well. Some Armenian kid called me a  with his poor English. (For telling people to use Midas on the big creep in jungle camps to get a level advantage) 3)Lastly (Because i dont need to say anything more why this game is so piece of ) the ing effects on you... Why do you even want to play this game , it is like eating an apple with 4000 worms inside. Anyways arguing with a Dota player made me realise that this game completely destroys your social life and your ability to think, go try it yourself try to say something opposite to these s... (There is a big ''real life'' world for you to discover out here. Get a hobby instead of playing this.) So im done please never ever ever start playing this game.

review: An accurate representation of pubbing in this game would be to imagine yourself trapped in a sewer swimming around eating nothing but turds your entire life, each turd represents an average public game. Now imagine after all of those turds you go to eat the another one and to your surpise it is a chocolate bar, it is the best feeling in the world. That chocolate bar represents those occasional games where everyone is evenly skilled and tastes so good that you continue eating turds just hoping for that next chocolate bar.

review: I really can't say anything other then this game is ing amazing. Look at all the hours I've spent in the game. You all are probably like "well, there are these people who have spent thousands of hours in the game, so that's not many." But do take into account that my total time owning this game hasn't even exceeded a year yet. There is not a day I remember since I got this game that I haven't at least opened DOTA 2. Usually to play a public game, sometimes to play a bot game, and sometimes to brush up on hero knowledge and look at guides. This game will ruin your life and obliterate all your free time. My only warning to new players is that the community it pretty toxic to new players, and not everyone speaks english. Just mute anyone calling you a noob, flaming you, etc. But never do so to the people that legitimately want to help you. Overall Rating: 11.6/10.

review: Hello everybody. First I would like to introduce myself :) . OK my name is etro, who has a hobby of playing a lot of games like skyrim, minecraft,pokemon, and etc. OK here's the point when I played dota 1, the first try of the game was hard and I really can't understand it very much. The moment I played dota 2 , that's how I realize and understands the game so the thing that I'am saying dota2 or valve can explain better than dota 1 (no offense , ice frog) so I would gladly recommend playing dota2 than dota 1 for the first try of the game :). Others say that dota 2 is not a good game or a bad game (well we all have our opinions :) ). For me it's the best game of all the time :D. I respect the Lol (league of legends) players. Even though they are saying that dota 2 sucks. Here in my country (philippines) many Filipinos say that they like Lol better. But I really don't get their point I mean (no offense to the Lol makers and producers) but Lol kinda copied dota 1 ( I don't even know if Lol have their permissions or paid icefrog for copying the main idea of dota) but valve paid icefrog for dota 2 so it means valve have their license while Lol doesn't have. I don't really know guys if Lol really have their permissions or paid icefrog. But I think they didn't ask for permissions or paid ( if im mistaken please correct me or you can just tell me to remove this review. And im sorry if im mistaken that Lol really have their permissions or paid icefrog.but i really think they didnt. Well the real point in this paragraph is I will play or follow the one who have permmisions or paid and that is dota 2 or (valve). If your noob or getting annoyed it's OK cause we all started like noobs :) and just ignore the people who are saying that you're noob,stupid,idiot, they will just annoy you and they have no hearts (they are monsters). Anyway for them to easily ignored just press the heroes panel at the upper left of the screen. In there you can see a speaker's icon then press it and wahhla you muted the player you chossed. I hope this really helped you guys :) OK thank you guys for reading my review with this game. I hope you recommend this :) bye.

review: DOTA 2 is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, that adopted most of its mechanics from the original DOTA Mod of Warcraft 3. Now, let's come to some of its features: - --> Once you understand the basics, and become good at the game (oh wait, everyone of us is a noob) , you will soon have a huge backlog of other games. :P --> Basically hat simulator. --> Can cause rage, anxiety and affect your mental state. (too many , griefers) --> You make 1000 good moves in a game, and you won't be recognized. Go feed once and get reported. --> You will start putting aside other priorities. Ty Dota2. --> To sum it up, it has a  community like most other MOBAs, unless you are insanely good at the game. 10/10 Recommended! Best game ever played!

Fourth : most people come in game only for curse to you and your family and not more. Sixth : all people ever fight with russian , some of russian really good play and some of them really bad play but this right to whole of people not only russian. and finally : if i tell you dont play you motivated to play, then when you start to playing dota : after 3 month play you only play for having more rank and not fun after 5 month you only play for trade not game after 6 month you come as a pro robber in trade and curse to russian for no reasons and only play to tell other people your so pro players. :) really if you want to play , play this game as a game not more 3 hrs in week so enough. Dont west your time on internet gaming, pay your times on your job :) and for understanding who you are. Good Luck in Your Real life, sorry because my bad en language.

review: Dota or Defense of the Ancients, was the first of its kind, and originally started off as a Warcraft 3 custom map but it quickly grew to become one of the most popular games in the world as well as spawning a whole new genre which we know today as MOBAs. The game is simple, 5v5, 3 lanes and both teams' objective is to destroy the other teams' Ancient. There are over 100 heroes in the game each with their own unique skills and attributes and forming a well rounded team with synergy is key to victory. Closing notes - The community can be awful. You will get yelled at, flamed and even reported for making mistakes. If you can overcome this, the game is amazing.

review: Cyk@ and axaxaxaxa are the only phrases you'll only ever have to use to communicate.  Don't be decieved by the server names, as every server is a Russian server.  I'd recommend never to play this game with friends, as your friendship will be destroyed into tiny pieces.  Phantom Assassin is the source of all depression.  Going into the depths of low priority is like taking a trip to hell with no way back.  You better be lucky if you random otherwise you'll probably get Earth Spirit.  If you're afraid of rats don't play this game as there's a gigantic one named Nature's Prophet.  Pray to the Lord that you'll never be against Spirit Breaker because his name doesn't lie. But somehow I keep coming back to the game. gg wp Valve 10/10

review: I don't usually write reviews, but I have to for this one. Extremely toxic (horrible) "community", the worst I've seen in any game, ever! Yes, worse than the old, pre 2005, US servers, World of Warcraft, Barrens chat! I've seen more team work in Team Fortress 2 than in this game. I've now played more than 72 matches total & also completed every single training mission and I've witnessed not just the other team but even teammates attacking eachother & myself verbally before the hero selection even starts multiple times. I don't mind if the other team trash talks sometimes, but in a game where teamwork and communication is a key to winning it's detrimental for people on the same team who don't even know eachother to abuse eachother for no reason. I don't even have enough "reports" left for this week, yes, they allot you a small number of times you can report people per week for being abusive or detrimental to your team, when in fact you need many more to report all the terrible people playing this game. GOOD LUCK if you want good communication and teammork, the majority of the time you will be matched with people who won't communicate properly in chat or won't work as a team, you'll have to end up soloing every match since your teammates will be "feeding" enemy heroes or off doing who knows what unless you have your own party of friends with you. If you don't have any friends queing for matches with you I suggest never picking a support since you'll need to be soloing 1 vs 5, which is unfair as it is. But the problems don't end there, since you are doing all the work your "teammates" will EXPECT you to win the game for them, and if you die they will verbally abuse you & report you or in fact they might do it anyway just for fun at your expense! If you only choose in the options to play with English speaking players, don't be surprised if noone on your randomly selected team but you speaks English!, instead it will be Spanish, Turkish, Chinese, Russian & more! They may even know English but just choose not to speak it, all the while trash talking you in their own native language. Many times if you tell your teammates which lane you are taking before the match starts and select it on the map someone will insist minutes after the match has started that instead you do what THEY want, for example, they want you to put a low on mana support hero by themself in the middle lane. If you ever notice your teammates ignoring the chat not telling you what they are doing or doing things together that may or may not be detrimental to winning the match it's because the majority of the time you will be matched with people who know eachother in real life and will only communicate with eachother outside of the game; whether by in person, or voice communication software, instead of communicating with you as well inside the game, so you will have NO IDEA what they are planning. Also, for the new players reading this review, do not expect ANY help for anything, like asking for advice or how to do something from the people you are playing with, as you WILL be verbally abused & reported (which is something that seems to happen often in this game whether you are new or not) instead just for being a new player or any other stupid reason, so I suggest doing all the training missions before you do any real random matchmaking. NOTICE: This review mainly applies to US servers, other server experiences may (and probably do) vary. UPDATE: So far, European servers are a MUCH better & different experience! All that being said I do recommend (not highly) this game after all if you are playing it with a team of friends & you love a highly competitive Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) aka real-time strategy (ARTS) game or you simply want to use its steam market.

review: One of my favorite games in my library. My play time reflects how much time I have spent appreciating the team work and competitive spirit of the game. Supports who actually support the team, carries who can carry the team to victory, and players who can execute a base push as timely as the New York Sunway. By the way, I love subway sandwiches. I eat a BLT without the T almost every week. Bacon is the most delicious meat. Lettuce is like the cup to the tea party. You can't have tea without water, and you can't hold water without cups. Unless of course you use your hands. Or your mouth. But lettuce cups are pretty delicious. So imagine the bacon and the lettuce together but without the disgusting creatures known as tomatoes. Which while they rhyme with potato, don't taste anything similar. If potatoes tasted like french fries, tomatoes would taste like awful fried wet vegetables. Speaking of wet tables, If you put water on tables, it gets wet. Not stuff like multiplication tables that are way too complicated. What is 6X6? Its like 64 or something. Which is like 10 if you add them all together. What does that mean? I am not sure. Math is hard. Unlike DOTA2. Which is a great game. Especially as a carry. Actually I never played carry before. It seems like a pretty easy job though.Just kill things until you win the game. That is a pretty simple job description. Unlike support or mid or offlane or jungle. I mean jungle is a location, how is it a job? It is more like a forest than a jungle. I mean jungles have lions and stuff right? Forests have angry bears. I am not sure where man-birds and horse-men are from though. Horses aren't jungle creatures I think. They sound more like mountain creatures to be honest. I haven't seen a troll before or a gnoll, but I bet they are forest creatures as well too. So jungle should really be called forest. Mid is a pretty self explanatory position. Its the middle of the map lane. Like if you had 3 lanes, he would take the second one. Or she. There are female heroes as well. Are they called heroines? Well I wouldn't want to call anyone a dangerously addicting drug. That would be sexist. I mean playing Lina is pretty addicting though. Fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire . Its like if you had a charmander and combined it with a jynx. Thats what lina is. Which reminds me that pokemon recently came out. X and Y are pretty popular with my friends, so I wamt a 3DS. Those things cost money though, but I head I can trade my items for cash. That sounds pretty amazing. Earning money while palying games, its like the American dream for people who don't want actual jobs. Not that I have a job yet. All I do is stay home and read manga. Which is pronounced mane gah, Like mango but with an a. I sometimes forget myself and add a false accent though and pronounce it mahn gaaaa. So offlane is the lane opposite of the safe lane. So the dangerous lane as they would call it. It isn't very safe cause you cross the mystical safety river to fight bad guys. Its like chinese vampires and running water. I don't think they can cross running water. Many they would have a hard time with modern day plumbing. One flush of the toilet and the go poof. Or do they? I actually know nothing about chinese vampires. I only know vampires from the books my friends lent me. It was the Twilight saga. I really preferred the Jacob to the other guy though. I was pretty upset when Bella made the wrong choice. I mean who wouldnt want a guy you could play fetch whenever you wanted. Plus the other guy was like 439434 years old. Yuck! So Support is the last job you can play. Not only do you provide moral support because most teams don't ever have asupport, but you also help buy buying items no one else in their right minds would buy. Like a slave donkey to carry your items for you. He can even be given magical wings for more than his actual buying price. Why wouldn't I want another donkey instead of one flying one? I am pretty sure two donkeys are cooler than one flying one. I mean how would you even catch a flying donkey? It could poop from like 60 feet and it would be awful. Like a divebombing terrible smelling equine terror. But donkeys are pretty cute. So keep them on the ground. If donkeys were meant to fly, god would have evolved them wings instead of using magic. So that is Dota. Its a pretty good game. But it has some problems too. After all, even BLT's have T's. Here are the digusting parts of the BLT. Games take a while to finish. So if you tend to have sudden gas attacks like me, you might have an accident while you are playing a particular game. A game of Dota can last from as long as 30 seconds to 50 hours. Like I am not even joking how troublesome it is to stay on the toiler for over an house to finish my game of Dota. I mean look at my avatar. That is my face for like the first 5 minutes of Dota before my legs fall asleep and I start getting cramps. It also has too many different heroes. I think the game could cut its hero count down to about 7. It would also encourage faster hero picking if the last 3 players couldn't choose any hero. It is a definitely annoying to choose the tree hero and the enemy hero picks an all fire team and the lumberjack hero. You are literally counterpicked because you chose too early. It would be better to give some kind of gold option or a repick option. Some game modes take forever. Like captains draft can be much shorter if they removed all the bans. Sometimes I want to make team electric, but then a ban comes up and I accidentally ban Mr. Thunder or the masked electric emo. Then Team thunder is ruined. I can understand why bans could be good though. Cause everyone chooses fat butcher guy. He uses his hook to hug you then you smell him to death. Sometimes he tickles you for extra damage. What is worse is that he eats you, he gets fatter and stronger. The biggest tomato of the problem is the fact that the game has too much action, but not enough story. Its like worse than Dynasty Warriors when it comes to story. I could use a few cutscenes telling me why I am teaming up with a giant spider, a porcupine, a baby rock, and a angel man. At least there was a reason in Dynasty Warriors 7 about why I am fighting Guan Yu with my hated enemies the filthy Wu. Were those filthy Wu actually even men? The way they fought with their cowardly fire arrows and powerful navy instead of facing the numerically and superiorly led enemy army head on just screams uncultured barbarians. So I think I will give the game a 1/10/14. Its a pretty good game, but the lack of story gives it only a 1 in that category. I understand that every hero has its own lore, but the bigger connection is quite lost when I team up with my biggest rival against my best friend. A 10 grade for the excellent team spirit of the game. People play like men instead of filthy Wu women. But Ali, why the 14 and not a 17? Because the game has that huge tomato. And I hate Tomatoes. I love BLT's without the T. BL is the greatest invention of man, till someone introduced the uncessary T. I would have BL everyday if I could afford it, but I have no job and spend all my time reading manga.

review: My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 24, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me CANCER anyway.

review: Most ed up game ever, took me almost 1k hours to find out how ed up the community, matchmaking and everything around that game is. Sad, and I'm the only one to blame for flushing my time down the drain. On the contrary, PRO community is one of the best communities out there, always fun to watch and follow, from players to casters, everyone is cool. I just can't play this  anymore, it's a pain, mental and physical pain...

review: Dota 2 - it's a kind of game which can easily become a part of your life. Once you get really interested in it, you'll never be able to get it out of your head. I've never thought that I would be into a game like this. It's just amazing cuz of many different characters, team roles and skills - it gives you a freedom to choose between lots of strategies. This game can teach how to play in a team efficiently, how to help each other in order to win, how to organise your small group if there's nobody to lead it... It isn't always easy to manage with all this stuff, but it makes the process even more challenging, more catching, you know. Dota 2 is so popular and loved game cuz it makes ppl think, realize themselves as a part of a team, choose the best strategy to achieve their aim. + a lot of characters + oceans of items + various game modes + great events + lots of strategies + improvement of your reaction and co-operative skills + an ability to create your own team - random teammates can be absolutely dumb and wry-handed

review: If you can get past the initial learning curve and burden of knowledge the game puts on you, then DOTA2 can be extremely rewarding. As far as most MOBAs are concerned, this one has a good blend of strategy and relfexes that rewards those who can use both to their advantage. The gameplay is, as a result, solid, and every sessions provides new opportunities for fun and strategy. The UI is a little underpopulated, however, and doesn't explain much. learning how to do some of the functional things, like leaving a game that's safe to leave, or muting people, or reporting people, are not super intuitive: you have to dig. Furthermore, the options available, though very powerful and plentiful, are not explained super well. As a result, it's important to toy around with your settings a bit, which can be a hassle. As far as the F2P model goes, it's pretty fair: you can play the whole game without needing any of the micro transactions. The only thing they do is customize your aethetics, and happily not to an extreme extent. Because of this, the game has a really unified look despite all the different items your characters can wear. This might dissuade people from buying them, because some of the items are barely even visible. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone with a hankering for a challenge. The game is NOT easy, but it is worthwhile and a lot of fun once you get a hang of things. Veterans of the genre will find a lot to like.

review: Dota 2. One of the best Moba's to date. I'm very fond of this team-building, strategy and interactive game. Dota is what started it all, League of Legends. Based off original Dota, this game is what started the Moba hype. Though the game does have it's faults, the tutorial is a little rocky. Not being anything like the actual game, and learning little to nothing through it. The game is a great F2P title, there are no microtransactions that will change the game, besides your character's appearance. Though the Dota servers are rough in some regions around the world, forcing players from those regions to play on other servers. Based for other regions, causing many problems. Such as language barriers, lag, and overall less team cooperation. If Valve improved some of the servers, instead of focusing mainly on N/A servers, this would most likely improve game quality for everyine around the world. Overall I would give a positive rating of: 8/10

review: Great moba game. If your deciding to start on a Moba game your probably going to choose between League of Legends and Dota 2. Both are great games and I think Dota 2 is a better expireance in my opinion, here is why. Dota 2 all characters are free so you dont have to waste your time trying to unlock them, the game takes more skill (IMO), characters have a bigger learning curve, the community is not toxic, game allows you to use your mic (You can turn off mic volume in less than a minute), no micro transactions, you can trade item sets (A.K.A Skins), you can combine item sets, you can buy item sets on the Steam market, you can parts of item sets for money. This list can go on for another 2000 words. The game only has one map so the game probably sounds repititive but its not, there is many ways to play the game, such as carry, support, tank, jungler, etc. When you check out this game it probably is going to look boring but definitly check this game out, one of my most favorite games.

review: this game is horrible, but at the same time good, it takes a tonne of time to get the hang of the game, and it's normally only fun when you win (differs from persons) i love it, but at the same time hate it, you really need a party of friends, or good players to win, in this game you loose if you have one bad player on you're team, and if you don't have the right balance of supports and carries/ semis then you loose :L some hero's are overpowered and yet some underpowered. and for some reason people in low priority are better than in a normal match one of the first mobas ever made, when it was made is was very popular on warcraft3 and of course its free, most rage enducing game since call of duty you need to play it to understand so enjoy!

review: If you ever wanted to learn russian, then this game is totally the best one to learn basic russian and insults at one place. Forget about school, get Dota and play with cold-blooded russians, which doesn't shrink back to insult you because you're not playing good with a hero, which is in their opinion, the easiest hero in the whole game. Well, the only thing is that you cannot understand them while they're talking ingame, because they're mainly talking russian. Get yourself a dictionary and start learning russian there! It's the best thing you can do. 10/10 would play it again.

Its a great game to learn foreign languages and such but not much else. Unless you are a tryhard I would not suggest this game as the community is rude as hell. Its pretty addictive as any other MOBA but by far not the best ive played. Even if the community is less racist then HON and more mature then the community of LOL, its pretty bad. The only way i am ever playing this game is with a group of friends.

review: Just like its previous installment when it all started back in Warcraft 3 as a custom map, Dota 2 is pretty much the whole same thing with several new additions added to which couldn't happen before. As someone who's been playing Dota since its beginnings, the first thing you may recognize and notice is that many of the games features such as map layout, heroes, and gameplay is almost, exactly the same but with a better and more refined look with updated graphics, making the entire map feel more lively and a refresh of old. Of course, that's all good but at the heart of Dota as many may know is its gameplay and replayability. The amount of hours I've pumped back in the first Dota was unforgettable, clocking more than +2500 hours of time played. Just like Dota 1, Dota 2 shares the exact same formula, pick a hero, last hit creeps/farm up gold, and win team fights to gain victory. Simple and straight forward, right? Wrong. If you played back in Dota 1, you'd come to realize the more you played it, the game had a fairly, high skill requirement in order to do well, especially if you're pushing to be top in a region or tournament. The amount of time and practice makes perfect as you will want to eventually learn every hero, how they synergize and working together with your teammates. It gets rough but extremely fun and satisfying, especially if you're on high level play. Unfortunately though, most people tend to ignore these kinds of games since difficulty is fairly high or they just can't stand to put the effort to actually play the game well and properly, otherwise various issues can occur, such as getting hate from other players and getting reported for not being able to play well. It's an immediate turn off and can easily have people packing their bags and finding another game. Unfortunately, again, this is thanks to the toxic communities that have spawned across all MOBA genre games. You will always have to deal with these kinds of people who will give you  and you have to bare with it as those kinds of players won't be going away anytime soon. I strongly believe competitive games have the highest chance to have ragers compared to other types of games out there and it's tough to avoid the negativity that comes with it. Now with some additions, they've added a store where you can purchase from hero skins, UI skins, to different voices for the default announcer, different couriers and selling/buying through the steam market. The thing that seperates skins here compared to others is that skins come in seperate, armor pieces you can equip on a hero, meaning you can say, keep a helmet and sell the other parts, like gloves to someone else on the steam market. It goes to show how much control the players have and what they have in their hands. The best part of all this, is that all heroes are free right off the bat to everyone, so no need to spend money and unlock the heroes you want to play. It allows us, as the players to explore and see what heroes we enjoy playing the most and if you're into cosmetics, you also have the option to buy a skin. The business model for me personally, is fair and likeable as I've had no issues with it whatsoever, it's equal for both the customer and developer. Now, while the gameplay is still the same and fun at its core, what else has been added by Valve? Well, we now have various events that take from time to time, usually worldwide holidays such as Christmas or Halloween are some examples. These events bring in replay value to want and play the game more such as getting limited skins for heroes, UI skins, couriers or just straight up rare items that can be sold across the entire steam market so you can get some funds put into your wallet for perhaps other items/skins on the market or even just saving up to buy another game entirely from either the steam store or in-game store. They've also made several changes to the UI compared to back in Warcraft 3. The UI is bigger and straight forward, and buying items through the shop are easily seen as everything is now categorized properly, and accessing them with a simple click. It's easily noticeable but just in case, you may have noticed, some heroes have not been put into the game yet and are missing. It's mainly due to copyright issues with Blizzard, seeing as how Brewmaster was a Pandaren from Warcraft and now Valve has changed him to a Koala beast of some sort? In fact, every champion for the most part, have been changed in their appearance because Dota started off by using Blizzard races and even some famous lore characters such as Thrall (Disruptor) or Rexxar (Beastmaster). It's certainly slowed down some heroes from being brought back, the recent being Legion Commander (male to female) and Terrorblade (no longer the demon hunter/Illidan). Valve still has a few more heroes to change and get out, such as Techies, so if you're a big Techies fan and/or mainer, you're going to have to wait a while longer until Valve finally pushes him out. Alright, and now my few personal grips about this game other than having a toxic community as I mentioned earlier throughout these types of games. I just do not appreciate or enjoy the art style that Valve has brought into this game. NOT in terms of quality but art style. The quality is fine for some but most heroes I feel, lost their identity and instead of something different, or unique, Valve just made most of the heroes look ugly and feel uninspired in my honest opinion. I mean now Earthshaker now looks like a mutated version of Beast from X-Men with a mix of a Koala (similar to the new Brewmaster). Hell, I still appreciate Blizzards art style so much more in Warcraft 3 than this new look, look at Pudge and Slardar, they had the look, voice and feel back in Warcraft 3 but now it's just not as strong anymore here. Even the almighty and fearful Zeus doesn't look like an intimidating god anymore, but a scientist. Another thing that I do not find a lot of fun a whole lot anymore is the gameplay itself, yes, the core gameplay. It's literally been the same thing over and over, nothing new or innovative, just a rinse and repeat of picking a hero, farming up gold for items, and winning team fights. Maybe it's just me after playing thousands of hours in this genre or perhaps if you take a look past the gameplay and look at what it really offers, there's really nothing going for it. Last hitting isn't fun anymore, as that's all you're doing most of the time early on, with team fights mid to late game (unless you personally find it fun). The worst part, is you will fall behind if you say die a few times to an opponent carry, it pigeon holds you because now your team has little to no retaliation or chance of hoping to win since that carry will just roll face your entire team and there's a decent chance someone on your team will call you out, meaning more anger and frustration can occur. I can safely say as a long time Dota 1 player/fan, Dota is still fun but it's not fun if you want to play decently at the average level because the amount of mechanics people know in that level will put you in a disadvantage if you just learn a few because most just don't have time to do it. So what can I say, I mean in the end, this is basically Dota 2.0 with better graphics, same gameplay like the original, a few added features like events, and the in-game store associated with the steam market. Everything looks great except the art style for most heroes (personal opinion) and of course, the ease of access to newcomers while it may seem straight forward, it gets more complicated in-depth, meaning there's a harder learning curve and barrier to pass through to fully enjoy the game at its fullest, meaning you'll need to spend some time and practice.

review: This is basically dota 1 with an upgraded user interface and graphics. Its still a work in progress but all in all this is what the original dota style gameplay needs if its going to increase its declining marketshare in the moba genre it itself once pioneered. The spectator interface for viewing live games is impressive and though it seems the matchmaking algorithm is not really active at the moment for a beta the parts that work do so rather well. The attack and spell animations are all reworked and changed in this version so even for old dota 1 vets there is much to learn that only comes with the experience of engaging in the matches themselves. If you can get an invite and you like the MOBA genre you will find far more to like than not. But as usual in these types of games it all comes down to how evenly paired both teams are in skill for a game to truly fire on all cylinders.

review: I've had this game in my Steam Library since beta, and occasionally I'd give it a try to see if I could tap into some of the excitement that continued to elude me, for some reason. 62 hours later, on May 12, 2014 (today), after reading the first 10 headlines in the Dota 2 Steam "forums", I promptly uninstalled the game. I'm not one of those dudes who mistakes his opinion for fact, so I'll just say this game isn't for me. Rude, unfriendly community coupled with an overtly pretentious, self-important theme and arbitrary, unnecessarily difficult online play ("laning"? "ganking"? "last-hitting?" REALLY?) are unappealing to me. I suppose the kids prefer the game this way because they feel like they've "accomplished something" when they win (as opposed to the rest of us who simply "play video games"). As an over-30-year-old gamer with kids of my own, perhaps I'm just too old for this. Anyway, thumbs down. NEXT.

review: I don't really enjoy competitive games, as a rule. I like the idea of them, but I don't play them. I have been playing a lot of Dota 2 though, because I don't think that Dota 2 is really a "game." I sometimes lose a game so badly that I wake, days later, in a cold sweat. At first, all I can think is that I am happy to have woken from the nightmare. Later, in a moment of creeping fear, I will realise that the real nightmare is how bad I am at Dota... and yet I cannot stop myself from playing it. Dota 2 is an endless nightmare from which I cannot wake. To install it is to introduce into your life a hellish netherworld, one in which close friends are so disappointed in one another that they cannot even express it. One in which improvement means only that you will be matched against better opposition... All of this horror floats on the constant threat of the "low priority queue," a stygian hellscape that this review could never hope to describe. Summary: 10/10, would play again (until my sightless eyes drop from their sunken sockets and the cold grip of death frees my mortal husk from its trap).

review: My favourite game of all time, amazingly deep pvp experience that has me still feeling like every game is something new and different after about 2-3000 hours given between dota 1 and 2. First off a warning. This is game is hard to get into. It has an insanely large learning curve, (and a community who (mostly) don't deal well with learners or anyone not at the top of their game.) If you push through this, which isn't so bad if you have some friends to show you the ropes and get you into it, you will have access to a high action strategy game with so many variables to each game that you can always be suprised no matter how long you've played.

review: This is the worst game i have ever played in my entire life, the most depressing and anxiety inducing game ever. Its an addiction you can't stop, a drug you cant refuse. Every thought you have is about the game...the lanes, the heroes, the creeps, the items. If you play this game, you fall into a deep dark pit you will never climb out of.

review: Of the majority of games that feature animal people, I don't think any other game of our generation can shout BLATANT FURRY CULTURE FORCING more than Dota 2. Ranging from the down and dirty Gondar lines like "for the right price, anything" to the drunk, pitiful Mangix; and you thought Disney was bad. On top of that they even added a character called "Troll Warlord" which is obviously a Homestuck reference. These guys are really milking the fandom department. Why can't a game just be about boobs like the old day- I mean what ever happened to good old Christian family values like Monopoly and Scrabble. Now we've gotta fill our games with fanservice and sell out to an audience that is somehow greater than ours? I don't think so. And there's even a character that's a flamboyant homosexual. I had to bring my children to therapy after they heard the words "puddin pop" from one such "Storm Spirit". On the topic of inappropriate directive, I can't believe a Greek Gorgon such as Medusa would go so far as to talk about her 'gays'. This is simply not alright. This "game" is nothing but a manifestation of what our society is becoming, and we can only petition to have Valve remove funding for this project to save our youth.

review: English Review I was a fan and player of DOTA 1 and I've been passionate player of new version DOTA 2 for some time already. Audio and video are incomparable. There were cube, cross in the older version, but in everything's smooth in new version. I mind the looks of some heros (sorting by race), but I used to it. Though what I miss from the older version is graphical visualization of objects, which was glowing out of them (aura, colors). But sound messages are just wonderful! Control, choice of using spells, items ... it's up to player, also like graphics and sounds. Great benefit is that you don't have to download and search maps, there is automatic update and synchronization. I give a big plus for buying, gaining of trading items. It's just huge jump and movement in this game. Who was devotee of the older version, he will also fall in love with this one. I recommend for 100%. Rating: 10/10 Slovak Review Bol som fanikom a hrom DOTA ''1'' a som i novej verzie DOTA 2. Audio a video s nezrovnaten. V starej verzii boli ''kocka, krik'' v novej ve pekne vyhladen. Trochu mu vad na poniektorch herov vzor (rozdelenie poda rasy), ale to som si u zvykol. o mi avak chba z prvej verzei je grafick vizulizcia predmetov, ktor z nich vyarovala (aury, sfarbenia, ...). o sa tka hlok: ,,S uasn!'' Ovldatenos, vber pouvania spellov, itemov, ... je na hrovi, taktie ako grafika i zvuky. Obrovksou vhodou je nesahovania a nehadanie mp, ale automatick aktualizcia a synchronizcia. Vek plus dvam i kpu, zskavania i trejdovania itemov. Proste obrovsk skok a posun v tejto hre. Kto bol zarytcom do starej verzie, tak isto si zamiluje i tto nov. Odporam na 100%. Hodnotenie: 10/10

review: Welcome to Dota 2, the Hotel California of online gaming. Late Last March, I was naive enough to dip a toe in its beguiling waters and today, 450 hours of gameplay later, I return as a semi-functional human to regale you with tales from its realm. Dota 2 is unlike any other game Ive ever played, both in its nature and history. It started off as a StarCraft mod popular enough to be ported to Warcraft 3, which then exploded into a kaleidoscope of player-made variants and eventually coalesced again into a single entity titled Defense of the Ancients Allstars. There is no single author of Dota, though all the anonymous contributors whove made it what it is have come from the community that first started playing the mods. As such, Dota is the very definition of grassroots game development. The idea of a game made by the people for the people, as a certain American president might put it, fills me with a particularly warm and fuzzy sensation. Of course, I knew none of this when I first picked up Dota. A friend recommended it because its free and Im cheap. I understood that the game had a team-based format where killing the other guys was a good thing, like with first-person shooters, but your character also leveled up through the course of a match, as in role-playing games. That seemed like a recipe for unbalanced gameplay, but as it turns out, its precisely Dotas balance that makes it so unbelievably addictive. You start off as a member of a ragtag group of five heroes intent on destroying the enemys base, which is embodied by the titular Ancient structure. Through a series of skirmishes against the other team, their defensive towers, and waves of autonomous creeps, you gain experience and gold, the latter of which can be spent on items that make you stronger, swifter, and deadlier. The more you kill, the more you make, the more you buy, the more you kill. Rinse, repeat, and make sure to say "gg" at the end. LEARNING A LANGUAGE MIGHT BE QUICKER THAN MASTERING THE FULL BREADTH OF DOTA Excuse me if Im making this sound simple, because it really isnt. Dota 2 has a roster of over 100 heroes to choose from, and the combinations of items they can obtain is an order of magnitude greater still. Each hero has four or more unique abilities, and to have any hope of defeating a skilled opponent, you have to know what those are, what items he or she is carrying, and how they affect your chances of survival. Ignoring all of that nuance, I jumped straight into the game with the Juggernaut and was promptly beaten into a pulp of samurai sushi. A dozen humbling  whoopings later, I was online and reading the Dota Fire hero guides. DOTA 2 CHOICES The key reassurance I can offer is that all of these intricacies are, in fact, worth learning. As daunting as Dotas complexity may be, without it the game just wouldnt be as rewarding. My way of rising to the high bar of basic skill required was to pick the last enemy hero to destroy me. Thus I went from playing Juggernaut to Bounty Hunter to Bloodseeker to Ursa to Spirit Breaker. Each time I was sure I had the "right" hero, a better player would come along, expose my weaknesses, and teach me something new. Im the worst loser I know and yet I played Dota 2 for nearly 100 hours before I could get my winning percentage above 50. Maybe if I could actually see that I was being dominated by 14-year-old kids listening to Darudes Sandstorm on repeat, I might have felt sufficiently embarrassed to retreat in shame. I stuck through it, though, because, in the immortal words of Agent Smith, "as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery," and Dota delivers both with just enough victory to keep me titillated. And once I had a couple of hundred hours of experience under my belt, I too started passing on the sacred knowledge of Dota through the time-honored tradition of owning noobs. IM THE WORST LOSER I KNOW AND IM ADDICTED TO A GAME THAT KEEPS KICKING MY  This is not a game for the impatient. Success in Dota 2 requires the strategic forethought of chess, the unselfish teamwork of basketball, and the steely nerves of poker. None of those skills are acquired with ease and theres no magic number of matches or hours played to achieve Dota competence. Its a lot like learning a language: I never felt discrete upgrades in my knowledge and skill, but eventually I got to the point where I could tell you every typo in the games hero descriptions and every corner of its single asymmetric map. Just know that the commitment required is on a whole different scale to other games. You could complete the epic Mass Effect trilogy (plus all of its expansion packs) in less time than it takes the average Dota player to familiarize himself with everything from Abbadons Aphotic Shield to Zeuss Lightning Bolt. But thats really the point. Mastering this game in 50 hours wouldnt feel anywhere near as satisfying as taking a good 500.

review: Being an old League of Legends player I really needed some time off LoL since I knew every champion, every item and every possible outcome for hero duels, I came to Dota 2. If you are just like me then I would strongly suggest taking a look at dota 2. It is much more realistic and I can guarantee it once you get to know a little bit the mechanics of the game and if you play it with a friend or two then you will have so much fun. No bugs whatsoever, very fluid game and most of all very diverse range of heroes. The only bad thing there might be (from what I have seen) is that there is quite a big number of trolls in the game.

review: A true masterpiece and a milestone in gaming, this sequel to a genre-definer that is now just bursting in a global scale is a great point of reference to anyone attempting to make a game of this genre. Great graphics, amazing sound and voice design, and rich backstories in every corner are just some of the features that make Dota 2 great. But it's major strong point is the depth in its mechanics. While Dota 2's gameplay might seem daunting at first, it's one of the best and more engaging ever seen in a game, and learning it is just one of the reasons why this game is addicting. Other games such as League of Legends end up falling short because their devs decided to cut much from the original formula, but Dota 2 kept it intact, and makes sure you learn something new everyday. Not only the core game is strong, but also the eSport scene surrounding it is amazing and growing, with several tournaments going on, including Valve's own The International. At the time of release, the game looks like a train with no brakes, about to crash against its competitors and run them over, raising the bar on the genre with a myriad of awesome features that perfectly compliment an awesome game.

review: More Russian than Moscow! 10/10 DotA2 is a Russian simulator, explore the every day life of a Russian glued behind his computer screen wondering why these English capitalist dogs do not speak the almighty language of justice. Enjoy not being able to understand your teammates and swearing at eachother in a variety of Spanish/French (very rarely English) and most of all: Russian. You can play on the Europe West servers (with Russians), American servers (with Russians) or if you're missing out on that full Russian experience, play on the Russian servers. No wonder Ukraine is not taken yet, they're all too busy ''playing'' this game. Feel free to enjoy Solo Queue and end up with a group of 3 Russians and a Spanish 13 year old repeatedly, listening to a repeated soliloquy of backwards letters you've only seen once in a Chernobyl documentary. Attempt Duo Queue and end up with 3 Russians, which kind of diminishes the full blown Russian experience; thus I do not recommend you try this or you can play with bots, which are surprisingly better teammates than the Russians. Just for good measure I'll throw in an extra ''Russians'' to get the point across. Enjoy yourself, comrad. For those of you that do not enjoy the full Russian gaming experience, there is always CS:GO, which is the softcore version of DotA2. Disclaimer: Long exposure to DotA2 might cause capitalist ideals to give way to communism.

review: Dota 2 is a 5-v-5 MOBA game. You have a selection out of 108 unique heroes, each with a unique skillset. Every hero is also available from the minute you start. No playing X amount of games before this hero becomes available. The object of Dota 2 is to destroy the other teams Ancient. To do this, you can work your way down any of the 3 lanes (Top, Mid or Bottom) by destroying the outer towers. Youll start most matches pairing up or going into a lane solo trying to get some experience and gold by last hitting creeps. As the game progresses, youll start teaming up more with your other team members to take on the other team or to quickly kill of a solo member of their team. Because of the importance of coordinating your attacks with other team members, communication is a very important aspect of the game. I therefor also recommend playing this game with some friends because random people that youll be teamed up with wont always show the same willingness to communicate. If youre just starting out playing Dota 2, I also recommend playing with a friend who already has some experience in the game because the learning curve is very steep, especially when you have to figure everything out by yourself. The skill ceiling is also extremely high. So every time you play, you might learn something new. Due to the high number of available heroes, skills and items, you can be sure that every game is unique. Something to be wary of is the community. There are people out there that take this game way more seriously than you might. Most players have an opinion of what you should have done in a certain situation and will be happy to blame a lost teamfight on you not taking that action. Flaming is something that could happen often. But if youre playing with a team entirely made up of your friends, this shouldnt prove to be an issue. If this is not the case, dont worry. You can always mute the players that are causing you grief and continue enjoying this wonderful, team oriented game.

review: Dota 2, a very frustrating game that forces you to play with and against other players. You'll rely on your team to preform their selected roles, and then watch in horror as they completely ignore the game mechanics and just chase down kills, rarely successfully. You build in game items during the match to enhance your characters role and then hope and pray your team doesn't feed the opposition too much. Team fights, normally 5v5, tend not to happen as you watch your fellow team members run to meet their fate and be a hero. Sadly this ends up throwing the game and you lose. I would still recommend this game, purely for those few matches when the your whole teams synergy is in harmony, watch as the gold floods in, the towers crumble and the opposition blame each other for their loss.

review: A message to my fellow conservatives: all is lost. A message to my fellow classical economists: we're all Keynesians now. With the release of How to Train your Dragon 2 (which might've been more suitably named "How to be a Dictator 2"), Communist influence has been seeded into the minds of the children, destroying the potential for a perfect laissez faire economy for future generations. How to Train your Dragon 2 is a story of a young Shaggy Rogers discovering the wonders of "Sandwiches" for the first time with the Rottweiler he owned before Scooby. Our protagonist, a rebellious socialist who never came to grasp the true meaning of Republican Motherhood, is a frequenter of the parks, motivating the homeless by promising them peace and beating them until they promise to get a job or preaching to the innocent picnickers about the evils of animal cruelty. A subtheme of gun control is dished out discreetly as the script writers encourage us to do better than what game theorists think we are capable of with flawed moral consciences. In the same way viewers are assured that we have learned from the days of the arms race by subtly bringing up the Marilyn Monroe-JFK scandal. Obnoxious and unorginal, the production draws content heavily from the movies E.T. and Avatar, indicating that it could have been funded by a collective effort between PETA, James Cameron, the public health institute, Heidi Fleiss, and Joseph Stalin. In the end, the main character's tyrannical liberal-minded father boards a boat to Russia under heavy artillery fire by social darwinists, portrayed as defiant and unruly teenagers that want nothing but an end to civilization. I can say with certainty that any child who watches this film WILL become a democrat at some point in their lives, and, like the movie suggests, the only way to prevent the disease from spreading is to contain it. Oh and Dota 2 is a pretty good game too.

review: Defense of the Ancients 2 or DotA 2 for short, is like being addicted to an extremely harmful substance. No matter how many times you queue for Europe West and get Russians. No matter how many times you get an insta-pick Pudge going mid to feed. No matter how many times you see a Bounty Hunter build BattleFury. You'll keep coming back for that one taste of glory. It's an extremely abusive relationship that is impossible to leave.

review: I can't really write a good review for the ever-changing landscape that is Dota2. But I will say the following generic things: Dota2 is not a simple team game. There are a huge amount of advanced techniques that you will have to be told or lookup online. You come into Dota to have fun with "tools", every character is a different tool. They move different, they turn different, they attack differently. If you enjoy playing the same game over and over and perfecting little, small tricks to give yourself a slight advatange, then this is for you. If you come from any fighting game for example, you can get into this. Like really into this. What makes Dota2 different from other MOBAs? Depth. Dota offers much more variety, much more freedom to experiment. Other MOBAs shy away from the huge complexity that is giving more tools to the tools. You have items that give you more movement options, that take away movement options from the opponent, even random modifiers that spawn on the map periodically. In other games you will find these "options" baked into a character, they try to guide you into learning how a character "should" be played. Dota2 gives you the sandbox to experiment, As a reminder, it's never anyone's fault when you fail to build your tool properly. This is a game. Have fun. Most people just look up to a player and copy his playstyle, and Valve facilitates this. But you don't have to. Everything depends in Dota2. Should you try Dota2? Yes. But remember to have fun. You will be playing a game that can last 1 hour per match. Enjoy. Smile. A lot of people forget this. If you're not enjoying Dota2. Uninstall.

review: When you play for the first time all this game seems like is just a bunch of wierd colored creatures punching each other with sticks. It seems really stupid, but you suck it up and play through the tutorial. Then you stupidly decide to play your first game of real dota. Put short you fed, badly. After going 0/30 your first game you kinda hate dota. But you stupidly decide to play another, and chances are you lost again. And this keeps happening until you discover your first newb hero. Drow seems so op doesnt she. Afterwards you decide to play this hero again and again, and doesn't it feel good to win. 50 games deep you'll hate noobstomp heroes like riki, sniper, drow, and bloodseeker. Obvisously these heroes are really op. 100 games deep and you'll find yourself trying out some new heroes, tidehunters ravange is pretty epic you have to agree. 200 games deep and you'll have played every hero, with the exception to earth spirt. How the hell do you play that guy, I dont get it. 300 games deep and those newb stomp heroes dont seem so bad anymore. Manfight riki, stand right next to drow, get blademail for sniper, and buy a tp for bloodseeker. And dont forget to buy dust. 400 games in you will know how to ward, rune control, stack and pull and play a support. You will understand the basics of having one person farm while another supports and harrasses. Holy  you've made it to 500 games. Remeber your first match if only you could see yourself now. By this point you understand the basics of dota! Remeber to dodge the sunstrike! 600 games in and you'll realize that for the past months dota is the only game you have played. Like the only game, because once you start playing dota you never come back. Unless your power dies.... By 700 games you'll start playing against trilanes. Now as an offlaner you have to do your best to not die, and get some farm. Hide in the trees and sap xp where you can. By 800 your tempted to buy that arcana. Not saying you will but it sure does look tempting. By 900 you know what to buy, and you get what every hero can do. You know where to be and when and you get the feeling when there smoke ganking and roshing. Gamesense op! By 1000 games you hit a milestone. The game doesnt seem like colored creatures punching eachother. Welcome to dota 2. Noob Advice: read guides when your trying out new heroes. Practice in bots, and dont stick to one hero, play them all. And stick in there, your first 10 games will suck. Purge has some great guides that you really should watch before you even step into your first game. And also play with friends, otherwise you might have to put up with peruvians who keep screaming noob in chat when you make one mistake. People who have to rage at everything (thats why theres reports), and russians who will play uber aggresive all the time, which to be fair on there part works half of the time. Welcome to dota 2. Oh yeah and nerf void!

I only played a handful of matches, and being at least semi-literate in both MOBA UIs and old custom Warcraft and Starcraft maps, I can in no way recommend this game to anyone but the most hardcore of MOBA fans. The UI is unintuitive, the shop is a mess to look at if you're new, and you will likely get your face smashed in by even the computer-controlled players time and time again while you punishingly learn every little thing it takes to be good at this game. If you have never played a MOBA, if you don't have a friend who already plays this and can walk you through what to do, do NOT try this game. If you really love MOBAs and are looking for a new one, yes, definitely try this and I hope you enjoy it. I did not, not even remotely.

review: Don't bother spending hundreds on other language learning programs, or ones that claim to be the best, like Rosetta Stone. DotA 2 has the market cornered and you would have to be a fool to pay anything for these "superior" pieces of software when DotA 2 is completely free of charge! When you want to learn a new language, simply queue for your region, and select the language that you already know. Valve's patented system will immediately match you with other language speakers who will get you on the fast track to success! You will love your learning experience. I can guarantee that you will not grow to hate other cultures due to a language barrier, because soon you will be able to speak Portugeuse, Spanish, Russian, and Chinese!

review: Of Warcrafts Custom Maps, one stood a little taller than the rest: Defense of the Ancients. Here the heroes of Azeroth, freed from the tedious management of cities and armies, could fight as they were meant to: with weapons and experience, teamwork and tactics, all unadulterated by some abstract general and convoluted mission. A vast pool of heroes, pulled into one map, normalized and equalized through patches, armed with improved weaponry, combined to cement a gameplay experience that appealed to our encyclopedic minds, our fantastical tendencies, and our social impulse. Here was an unthinkable union of knowledge, skill, mythology, role playing, individuality, and balance. Here DotA matured to perfection. But this perfection was uneven. The brilliance lay there, but burdened by the crust and grime of history. The games greatest hero, Ice Frog, was a player who saw in DotA a wondrous achievement and vowed not to let that masterpiece deteriorate and die. Seeing the game as a growing process, owned by a community, ever meant to experiment and improve, Ice Frogs leadership kept DotA alive. Suffocated by a dated engine and forgotten game, he and his team worked with the legion of adoring fans to nourish what could be saved, and eradicate what could not. But even tenacity has limits, and in order for DOTA to break free it needed a new body; a new platform in which to siege the world. Here, as ever, an angel swooped from above. It was Valve, and they released the building pressure of DOTA into the atmosphere of mainstream gaming; steam that would finally power the community it deserved. The rest is history. Adopting the FTP model, utilizing the source engine and steam community, DotA has its outlet: DOTA 2. Players marvel at the games sheer number of balanced heroes, how it feels difficult yet strangely compelling, sophisticated in its strategy but gleeful in its murder, at times silly but still dark, oppressive but always promising emancipation if you practice hard and reflect often, so reliant on your allies, often complete strangers, that autonomous action can never rival teamwork. Like members of a symphony, clashing with your enemies in near perfect tug-and-war, entailing chess-like prediction and FPS-like twitching, your team fights together, wins together, and dies together. Never before except in professional sports has your weakest link dragged you down or raised you up. But drag you down they do. Even in the most porcelain masks do we see blemishes, and DOTA 2 has its fair share. Teams can and do exploit the weakest member of the opposite team, bullying with a savagery only seen in competitive gaming. Because of this exploitation, and the difficult nature of the game as a whole, frustration often runs high in the experience. Losses feel more painful than wins feel enjoyable, and the hope for those rare games in which perfect harmony among both teams leads to razor-sharp tactics and thrilling plays can be ruined by the cruel hand of fate, where a single hero out of position or a single RNG move can turn the tide of battle. DOTA 2 is, paradoxically, rarely satisfying, but when it is players never forget that feeling of triumph. Video Games, more than any other art, rely on us to deliver an experience. Whether they tell a story or present puzzles to solve, games need us to be competent and attentive. DOTA 2 takes this to new heights, and presents us with an outlet where the more we pour into it, the more it gives back. Eventually our exhaustion clouds the luster somewhat, but we shouldnt judge the game by our own limitations. Feral, profound, and terrifically challenging, DOTA 2 is competitive team-based gaming in its prime.

review: It's a purgatory simulator based on the existential novel No Exit, in which you are trapped in a game with 9 other people who hate you. You spend your time killing the same enemies, who spawn every 30 seconds for all eternity, until you have amassed an arbitrary amount of gold/items with which you kill the other team. The worst 2 players in the game are blamed for every mistake made and ridiculed without mercy, while the player with the highest kill/death ratio (often times not the best player) calls you a  for the 60 minute duration. It's a nice game and I highly recommend it.

review: A big portion of my nerve system died while palying this game. I no longer can express human emotions. My friends abandoned me as I fail to laugh at their joke or show I feel them when they share some tragic news. I am working on a application that can modify my photo with my emotionless face to a state I am really at. Most likely I will make billions, as Kristen Stewart is already on the project, so are many other famous actors (Mark Wahlberg, Channing Tatum and so on). I would recommend this game, as even if a part of you dies.... New part is always being born! Sometimes new part might require a straight jacket.

review: The neverending story. Skills never achieved at best and very hard game to learn. Many mistakes can be reason of losing game and game one of the hardest with opportunities which requires the years of effort and practice. Community full of all type of people from global. Players can report each other and happens often get reported by player because of his own mistakes. Also you must be smart and strong to survive people harassment. Definitely harder than League of Legends, World of Warcraft and many others games. Game play improved by many years of development and will be improved until Dota exist. Community loves professional players and players playing most of time very good at games but hates beginners or people not playing good enough. Better you play, harder you will win games alone. One of the best games for playing with real life friends, solo or with teams.

review: this is an excellnt game if you want a really dynamic playstyle and a unique item shop which offers much variation. The reason i choose dota over LoL is beacuse of the friendly community and the helpful players i often find in the games who are always willing to help me out if im stuck with what to buy or when they're telling me i shouldn't be initiating teamfights as the courier but whatever this game is great i'd give it a solid 7/10 just beacuse it's such an easy game to pick up after about 100 games you will have the basics mastered like how to last hit the minions and once you have that down you can learn how to kill your own minions to deny gold which is pretty hard and i still can't do it properly. I hope that in the next 20 games or so in can manage to get the basics of jungling down because it's very complicated and i always forget to eat the trees for health LOL. yes would reccomend definately to any new players looking for an online moba game which is really easy to pick up and get going aftert 10 games.

review: With over 110 heroes to choose from, Dota 2 has one of the steepest learning curves of all the games available on Steam. Many players find that even after 100+ hours of gameplay, they feel incompetent at the game. While this is probably Dota 2's greatest downfall, it is also the aspect that makes the game as great as it is. There is just so much to learn in this game, that it will provide fans with countless hours of playtime. Verdict: Dota 2 is an extremely difficult game, and that is what makes it most rewarding. Yes, the amount of time it will take a new player to become even an "average" player may take well over 100 hours. However, if you are can overcome its steep learning curve and are looking for a game long term, DOTA 2 may just be the best game you can currently find - and it is free.

review: Dota 2: As we are entering the moba territory where the fan bases exist to the extremes, I decided to test out all the moba games that I had access to which was League, HoN, HoTS, Smite and Demigod so that I tested out all games fairly and equally. After playing them all I believe that DOTA 2 is probably the best moba out there if you like strategy and a more grownup moba game. DOTA 2 does well with a focus on each hero being unique and each having their pros and cons to assist the team in their own special ways, so this means that each match will never be the same due to the choices of heroes and peoples playstyles. Its developers and lead designer Icefrog have a focus on balancing every hero on every major update and making sure that no hero is extremely overpowered. The game follows Valves concept of Free to Play games where the only thing up for purchase is cosmetics with nothing that will change or alter the gameplay, the game also has item drops at the end of the matches but at the time of this review the drop rates were changed and its current nigh impossible to even get a single item. The only issue I really see is the issue with some of the servers due to the outsourcing of servers to other companies and their locations. So Ill write down the list of servers that have issues that I know of: SEA (Location: Singapore) (E-Club) - Its a gamble, there is two servers and one is good and one is awful. Sometimes up, sometimes down. Good luck. Japan (Location: Tokyo) (NEXON) - It doesn't exist yet, they are holding it hostage for the past year. US Servers (Valve) - They are currently using Mail Pigeon for packets. (West - Seattle, East - Sterling) Russia (Stockholm) (?) - The server is perfectly fine, the only issue is the distance from Russia to Stockholm causes increase latency -------- Other than some of the server issues you can have loads of fun and you might even pick up the Russian, Spanish, Portuguese or Filipino languages. Dota is a quality gaming addiction and language learner. 10/10

You will be screamed at by other languages and dont know what is going on. Then you will be in games with blamers that blame everything on you. Filled with racism and Yelling 10/10

review: Dota2 often claimed to be the hardest MOBA there is and that is because the game is very complex, which is why there is a ~10 hour tutorial trying to breakdown the game mechanics into little pieces and if you want to get faster and easier into it you can't avoid watching videos for more tips'n'tricks, which makes this game very time consuming, not to mention that an average game is between 30 and 50 minutes long. However when you dig yourself through the wall of Dota2 and got to the point, where you start understanding what you are doing wrong. Then the game gets very rewarding and fun. Playing Dota2 is a combination of strategy - which hero to pick, where to lane, what items to buy and satisfying combat, one hero usually has 4 abilities and one of them being there ultimate ability, which is the hero's strongest ability, for newbies, there are a lot of hero's with passives and few abilities. Something, which I don't usually mention in reviews, is the voice acting, this game, although it has 108 different characters, has really good voice acting for every single hero. Although the game is getting to get a bit older now, its graphics are definetly up to date and personally I really like the water, it looks really good. Overall if have a lot of spare time and for a very strategic in-depth game go for it! It is free and you have excess to all heroes from Level 0 on. This game gets a 'G' for Good(A>G>O)

review: Pros : 1) Free 2) most played game on steam guarantees you can play this game 24X7, when the world is asleep, dota players are raging at their noob teammates, or being a noob themselves 3) low system requirements means your 3rd world friend with a  pc/laptop would be able to play the game Cons: 1) Most toxic community of any game, you know you are doing well in the game as a noob if you arent asked to uninstall the game 2) selfish players that take heros that make no sense considering the enemy draft. 5 carry teams or 5 support teams are not too uncommon 3) you are guaranteed to rage at the same noobs that you were when you start getting good at the game. not recommended for heart patients or pregnant woman.

Even when people Think or Say that people in Dota aren't Friendly, they're probably wrong, I won't decline the Fact that there are some of them, but Angry Gamers are in every game possible, y' know? Even when I've played with a "plague" of Dota 2 and CS:GO - Russians, I've heard 5-6 Swears and mostly because they were amused. About the Game itself. Gameplay may seem a Bit hard for the First time, but after you Play Tutorial + Some Matches, you'll get familiar with it. It's quite fun and Teamwork-ish, nothing here is Possible without Teamwork ( and Creeps ). Plus, it's this kind of a Games, where you have to be Sliced in a Half, and Complete some Objectives while Farming for Some EXP and Gold. The Match is getting REAL somewhere around 17 Minute of a game, Both teams got Heroes with Special Attacks, new Items, more Creeps. That;s where it starts. When you Bash through a Horde of Creeps and Kill a Sniper who was About to use a Shrapnel, then attack Creeps from Behind and you Push through Towers and even More Creeps with your Teammates. Sadly, but this Game was so Negatively Reviewed for most of the Time, but, everybody has an Opinion, right? Try it out by yourself, you'll Like it.

review: It's worth maybe somewhere between 1000 - 1500 hours, but once you become fairly decent at the game, you realize there's not much to it. it's neither complicated nor possesses too much variety. The most fun portion of this game is irking the other players. Actually, it also becomes fairly monotonous as you find players who don't even know what last hitting is despite attempting to employ advanced tactics. However, the game ios intrinsically bad, not in result of the players. Like I said, once you get somewhere between 1000 - 1500 hours of playing every character, it becomes boring. They end up playing too much like one another. I never feel a difference between playing lion, lina, vengeful, Cm, etc. as support. Sure, the abilities vary, but the use of those abilities don't. You're still going to stun when you need to, you're going to harass when you need to, etc. It's all the same. Unfortunately a majority of people I've met who are actually social are the ones whom I've seen play DOTA frequently.

review: DotA 2; What is there you didn't want in a game? This game; Yes can be frustrating and unforgiving and yes can be hard to get used to, BUT that is the fun in which this game provides you with. You may struggle to survive in the jungle against a five man gank and continuously get slaughtered but as a team and with strategies, you and your team can survive to become the victors at the end of the game. When I first started playing this game I had a hard time getting used to MOBA's and never had seen them before which in turn made it so much more difficult for me to understand what was going on but with the support of my mates I learnt and gradually got better. I would strongly reccommed new players to play a few hours of Bot games first because going online with no experience (like I did) doesn't benifit your team, yes you may win but was it worth all the jeering and crude comments from both your own team for feeding and the opposition for being quite horrible at the game? But MOST importantly you MUST have Fun. Playing a game without having fun makes there no reason to play it.

review: Extremly rage inducing game, recommended only for ages 12-65. You will be able to learn every aspect of racism and realize what actually "e-" means within DotA 2 i.e Anyone below 3000 MMR is trash tier with a 2 inch  and their opinion is always invalid. DotA 2 is also a pathway for you to be fluent in many different languages such as Chineese, Korean, Thai, Malay, Russian and many others. The secret to climbing MMR is insta-locking the most broken hero in every game. Overall 10/10 game, highly recommended.

review: If you enjoy dedicating your life to this game while at the same time ignoring your family, friends, and any sort of social interaction, then you will certainly enjoy fighting with your teammates over who will support or who will buy courier. By playing this glorious game you will also learn how to speak several languages as for some reason russians and mexicans like to join the US East and West servers when they have servers in their own country. Im sure you are already sold by this point, but just to add on one more thing about this game is that you will also learn how seriously people take this game and realize truly how terrible you are at this game because you are a noob with less than 3,000 hours on a game.

review: My least played heroes are some popular badass carries cause no one buys wards and couriers on my team and I have to play support all the time. Wards placing and couriers buying simulator.10/10 Normally people don't speak English on US server while I'm not even a native English speaker and I speak English. Multi-languages bad words learning tools.10/10 The most words you will hear from your teammates are not good try or nice play but OMG THAT XXXXX IS A ING NOOB. REPORT HIM AND FF PLZ Learning the attitude to your teammates like a real loser tool. 10/10 Conclusion: Find 4 nice teammates in order to group up and shout at each other or just play bots game and do kill secure with Dagon while reading others typing really? all the time. And yes, dota2 is not a MOBA game. Dota2 is a hero sets and unusual couriers simulation, which is 10/10 also.

review: I've played this game since I was in my highschool, Dota 1 days were surely a jumpstart for me. Now I'm a licensed Interior Designer and I still play this game. In-game items make this game a whole lot more interesting than before. But since I'm a new player, it's sad to know that DYNAMIC PRESENTS are now unavailable. Rendering Old Players an edge of having good set of items while New ones can never have while they level up. So this makes leveling up your dota profile a bit of useless to me. Leveling up a profile knowing that there is no use or benefit can be disappointing at some point. And hopefully soon there will be an AUTOBAN for rude players in-game. Some sort of a "PROFANE" word detection thru out any language. There are a lot of rude and tactless players out there that can most of the time disappoint newbies from playing the game. Not everyone though. But nonetheless, this game is still as awesome for me as it was before in Dota 1. Very nice graphics and enjoyable game. Keep up the good work!

review: This game is fun and entertaining if you actule have teammates to play with.... Do not play this game solo you will get crushed by partys from opposing team who know how to make combinations with heros... But that is not the worst part of this game, the worst part is the fact that you will most likely get teamed up with Russain players or Spanish who are uncapable of speaking English language at all. I have spent two years in this game trying to find one or two good teammates, but all i found in this game is non English speaking teammates who keep kill stealing and blameing others for their own mistake. This game is no fun for me, its real pain filled with anger and haitred....

You'll also find the best matchmaking system ever known to man, that puts you with EVENLY SKILLED PLAYERS no matter what, and a report system that will punish toxic players that trash talk or feed, 10000% guaranteed. In this long escalation of skills you'll find better players as you improve. It's one game you'll never want to stop playing, teamwork, communication and frinedliness are in the order of the day. Greatly recommended to anyone that enjoys teamwork and competitive teamwork oriented games.

review: I started playing Dota 2 around 2 years ago, at that time it was still at Beta and I would never have expected that this game would greatly affect my life. When I started I did not have any experience and much expectation of the game, due to the genre - it was all new to me, however before trying out the game it took my friends awhile to get into the game because I did not like the fact the game was still at Beta and at that time I was detesting its predecessor DotA due to the fact the gameplay was confusing which it turned me off and also the graphics was years outdated without even trying the game out. I was able to give its successor a chance when a friend of mine introduced the ESports scene within the game community of the genre. I was hooked due to I never have expected that a type of sport has been running for almost a decade which it has been under my radar. I personally was not a fan for Sports in general although after hearing about ESports is completely change my perspective on both of the game and sports. ESports is a term for organized video game competitions, especially between professional. It is known as competitive gaming, professional gaming and cyber sport. The most common video game genres associated with electronic sports are real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena. Generally Dota 2 would fall under the MOBA genre due to it consists of session-based online multiplayer matches, in which two teams of five players attempt to destroy their opponents' fortified strongholds known as Ancients. Each player controls a "Hero" character and, over the course of an individual game, focuses on improving their Hero's abilities, acquiring items, and fighting against the other team. Welcome to Dota, You Suck, is a well-known proverb within the DotA Community, which is aimed at new player. In fact is the truth, especially for new to the genre, for the first dozen hours or so, you will be showered with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. On the other hand if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. It's an achievement owed to uncompromising depth and complex gameplay, being a free-to-play, and the great features developer Valve has built up around it. That said, you should not expect to have fun on your first day playing... or even your first week. It is due to the unforgiving players within your team which expects you to do your job flawlessly although it is impossible even pro players can make a mistake, however theres a method of this insanity. In order survive in Dota 2 you need to understand every single hero and mechanics and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and gold theyd get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of complex abilities. There are 102 Dota 2 heroes (and counting) each consist of different abilities and mechanics and serves different roles from each other. For example Riki, is an melee Agility hero in which when he acquire his ultimate at level 6 he becomes permanent invisible, which is an obvious choice for most of new player. However there are various ways to counter an invisble heroes, this can be done by purchasing either a Dust of Apperance, Sentry Wards or Gem of true sight, anyone can purschase these item during a game, making the game more balanced. In addition some heroes has an ability to track an invis heroes for a short period of time. In conclusion, DOTA 2 is fun and challenging and deeply rewarding unlike other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. It has clear visuals and more balance gameplay unlike League of Legends and has an incredible longevity

review: You see... As a true christian, I was raised to to believe the true saviour, gaben. But when I heard about this game I said "This game has everything I need, religion, no sinners and a very casual experience." I praised the lord for this mighty gift from the highest heights of heaven. So, like any other true christian would I decided to play and not stray away from the reightous path, but when I loaded up the game the loading screens were riddled with satanic images and meanings. I was outraged by this atrocity more than when my son told me he had "sinned" by doing some dispicable acts. As Matthew McConau said in chapter 16:9, "Thou hou slay thou demonic presence shou nourish in the heighest points of heaven". So, after I got away from them satanic signs I started to become somewhat suspicious of this game. I pressed play and began to sweat as the jesus juices excreted from my body. I crossed my heart and prayed to God to forgive me for this act of satanism and waited for the match to started. Upon the game starting I was stunned by the amount of pagon rituals and signs that were in the game. I closed my eyes and picked a random hero only to discover something truly horrifying. My beer had run out. My bacon stained, sweat soaked vest had ripped. The russians were here, they were everywhere. My ears started to bleed as the russian flame began. I tried to continue on the righteous path but sin was inevitable. I pressed enter, I started to flame back, my fingers were numb. And then I realised, I had sinned. My heart stopped, I could hear God reaching down to me, but even he could not stop this. I had become the thing I dreaded most (more than a gay person)... A Dota 2 player.

review: I've been playing DotA 1 since 2003. I switched to DotA 2 a couple months ago from all my friends shifting over. Here is a short list of pros and cons that I have seen in DotA 2 as opposed to DotA 1. Pros: * Better mechanics, many heros function differently in DotA 1 due to the restrictions of the Warcraft 3 World Editor. * Visually stimulating, DotA 2 has many ways to customize heros, couriers, wards, animations, and more. * Item drops, as opposed to DotA 1, even casual players can end up making some money just by playing. * Spectating * Much easier for new players to learn due to the new system to help starting players. * Builds display on the item panel * Has many events in which additional items can be earned * Has an in game mic system as well as quick toggle phrases. Cons: * Currently doesnt have all the heros or neutral camps that DotA 1 has. * Lacks some of the game modes of DotA 1. * Surprisingly, lacks some of the important mechanics of DotA 1. The most notable one that I can pull off the top of my head is Batriders napalm does not trigger any damage bonus on radiance + veil even when the threshold for doing so is met. * Servers tend to be down for a brief period of time after nearly every update. * Doesnt have as well of a language division as DotA 1. I que US east and west with the language of English in DotA 2; yet 1:3 games, if not more, will have another language. I wouldnt even mind if it was something like Spanish or French, but I am getting everything from Russian, Chinese, Portuguese, Ukraine, Korean, Japanese, and many more that I cant even identify. * Double courier is a lot harder to use in DotA 2, even with hotkeys and grouping. I find this to take away from bottle crowing as well as make it harder for 2 farmers to get their items quickly for they will likely be on the opposite sides of the map. Even if they arent, the offlane will still likely need it to get items to survive. Every game will only have 1 courier unless someone accidentally buys another. Neutral: * DotA 2 has much better pathing and makes it harder to get stuck on unpathable areas. This makes sure you will never stupidly get stuck somewhere, but also takes away from some hero abilities that do move other heroes or yourself. * There is currently no public lobby system. There is everything from private, fiends, guild, etc., but there is no way to host them publicly for anyone to join. * Your computer needs to be decent to run DotA 2. At least 4 GB of ram and a decent graphics card is highly advised. In conclusion, DotA 2 is definitely a f2p game that you should look into. If you have yet to play any MOBA it may seem a bit difficult at first, but it will grow on you. To avoid the initial hate you may come across, I advise having someone assist you with learning the basics or look up some tutorials online. Going into this game with absolutely no knowledge of how this game works is definitely not a good idea. Once you learn the game, it can easily become the most enjoyable strategy game you have ever played.

review: So after 781 hours of this game (up until 8/16/14), a lot of yelling by commendable teammates and dozens of items later, I still enjoy this game. Previously with most games, they get really repetitive and boring after about 200-250 hours but Dota 2 is not one of those kind of games. I would recommend for others as this is an incredible MOBA, but may be difficult to learn for the un-educated. I would not recommend for others to procrastinate from school/uni work. Trust me, I learnt the hard way. All in all, I give it a 10/10. Story Time! Me (Sven) 200 health: Probably should get back Milkman (Ogre) full: Ye, probably should *3 enemies come from nowhere* *thinking I'm going to die anyway* MIlkman: Dude, get back NOW!

review: This game is simply the most thrilling game I have ever played. The combantion of the complex mechanics and the team based gamplay make this one of the best games to play with friends. However this game has many, many side effects such as..... Trash Talking anybody on your and the enemy teams, Lose alot of sleep, any money that you have will be spent on usless cosmetics such as skins, hudskins and announcers. You will not eat any food as Dota is more important, you will learn to hate every member of your team or the enemy team that is from eastern europe (mostly the russians) as they suck balls at dota, everybody else on your team will apear worse than you and you will want to kill them with a blunt object. these are just some of the reason to play the amazing game that is DotA 2!

review: I started off hating this game due to its massive learning curve, and quite frankly that is a good thing to hate about it, some people don't want to dedicate a lot time of to ONE game, that's understandable. I put 10-15hrs into it across a few weeks and then uninstalled it. A year later I jump back into the game and gave it an ACTUAL try. They added a tutorial, after I finished that; learning a few things along the way, I starting playing easy bot practices with a few easier heroes. The game's less complicated than it is on surface, once you get going certain things quickly become easier, however certain things take a long time to learn which is where its learning curve comes into play. That's where a lot of people (including myself at a point) are put off by this game, LoL is an easier alternative. But once you break past those first few (horrible, death filled) matches of you being confused as hell and making a ton of mistakes the game really starts to shine. You see the depth the game contains, the tactics. You start to get sucked in (if you're anything like me.) You start finding heroes that suit your tastes. THAT is where the game shines. Once you've put about 30hrs in you're probably bored of bot matches, so public matches here you come. This is where the game is the best, and also where it's the worst. The game can get very intense, if you're with the right people; a lot of teamwork will come into play. But (especially for a newbie) this is where the game is at it's worst. The community in this game is among the worst I've ever seen. You will be yelled at for making minor (or major) mistakes, for some reason they don't realise you're new, and they were to at some point. You have to start somewhere with Dota, so with all of the above in mind, do you want to start?

review: I dont get this game, it's like Civilization, every one picks one of the 108 country but it's a 5v5 game. The diplomatic exchanges with your team mates are limited because you can trade a limited amount of luxuries and you have to spend a big amount of gold to upgrade your country, there is no research feature, also the spying are realy limited as you can only place "wards" (wich replace spys in this game) on the map but they are usless. They are city states but they just stand here and hit what's in range and never come to help you when you are far from them. Finaly there a only 3 era (early, mid and late) but it dont change much the gameplay and some country are too OP in the late era and you can't buy atomic bomb to nuke them 2/10, this game lacks a lot of content to pretend to be a Civlization-Like

review: This is a game that will quene you with people that have 40% of your Hours played. This game will show you the worst scum of the worst and will favor them in a Trial. This  game will show you that in this Cyber world, there is a hell, and you are in it once you start palying rankeds. This game will take away your will to get better at it by throwing hords of Russians, Peruvians, s and whatnot who speak only their Native language, but start playing a Ranked in which team Coordination and Communication are a MUST. This game will take away your hopes of a normal Match and it will leave you with a bad taste in your mounth once you lose a game by being the only one that did his job right and is not feeding. Overall i give this  game a 4/10, the game itself is worth at least a 9, but when you put Russians and  of the entire world together without putting them in their own servers or restricting them by their gameplay, this is what you get, people that cannot communicate and play together to win. I promise you, this games community will make you loose all hope in Humanity and in everything that is good, if youre unlucky, you will end up as one of them. I, for this matter, am abandoning this ship, after 1,3k hours played i finally figured, this game is being ed by its own community because it fails to set up people who can communicate, i might come back and play it once valve makes people stay in their respective regions by creating dedicated servers ( Like LoL ) but untill then, i will no longer participate in this Shitfest. Thank you and good luck trying to make something out of this game, you will need it. (FYI, im pretty sure there are some typos and grammatical errors but i dont really bother checking them right now) Regards, Steve, a once diehard Fan of this game who was hoping Valve would do something about the Community but was dissapointed over and over again.

review: Heroes of WHAT? League of WHAT? Sorry, what was that? I can't hear you clearly over THE AWESOMENESS OF DOTA.
game-hours: 13.5
review: Alright, listen up. Instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians, I'm going to tell you how Dota 2 really is at it's core. In a nutshell Dota 2 is a great game, but a terrible experience at the same time. You want to keep going back to it, but you also hate to go back. Why? One word: community. Dota 2's community is for the most part rude and hateful (and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own), sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting MOBA. It's unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake. Make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away... at the best of times. Often it's much worse and I would prefer not to go into the details. Sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you haven't actually done anything wrong. Occasionally though you come across friendly players, and when that happens, the game is a pure joy to play. However, since the game is 5v5, coming across four nice players at the same time (if you're solo queueing) is a rarity. Why then have I played the game for over 2000 hours? The sensation of winning. Your determination to keep playing, despite of the discouraging community, is fueled by the fantastic sensation of winning. That sweet moment when you see the enemy Ancient blow up and look back on the match, remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying. But even a victory can come with a grain of salt. Many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning. There is a mute option, but that doesn't stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat. People can intentionally feed the enemy team, ignore their own team, teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player. It's really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time. Going ranked doesn't really solve the problem either, at least not completely. Ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in Dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill. It feels much more professional and "tryhardish". Although you meet nice players more often, nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell. Having played some matches in ranked, I can say the mode isn't "hate free". I had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode. Another problem with ranked is that, like I said, it's more "tryhard". Many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and such. But don't get me wrong, Dota 2 is a great game in itself. The core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well. No technical issues to speak of (not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so, of which I have had none myself). Graphics are great and have a very subtle water painting type feel to them. All the various spells and abilites look great. The game is very deep and complex with tons of items, skill and item builds and strategies to learn. It can be a bit terrifying to beginners, but once you get the hang of things it's engaging. All the playable heroes are well balanced (although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being "OP") and free to play from the start. That's another thing the game does right. All the heroes are free and playable from the start, unlike Dota 2's undeniably very successful competitor, League of Legends. Dota 2's microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff, which means there are zero "pay to win" elements in the game. It really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this great game. To put it roughly in perspective, it's like playing Skyrim, but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make, calling you a "fooping idiot" every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective. Failed to kill Alduin? "Uninstall Skyrim, noob." Don't know how to make dragonbone armor? "Learn to play, tard." It's like that. Having played the game as long as I have, I would say that you are better off not playing Dota 2. The game is fun when you're winning (because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine)... which is 50% of the time. Sometimes not even when you're winning. It isn't the losses that make the game unpleasant, it's the unfriendly people. If you're one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you, you have a better chance of not finding Dota 2 so terrible. But realistically, why should you even have to? Videogames are supposed to be a form of entertainment and when you can't have fun half of the time, the game isn't worth it. People will tell you that Dota 2 is great, but that greatness comes with a price. Do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view. This review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what it's really like, not just the great things. If you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis, then you're golden. The game is at it's best when you play with friends and don't have to worry about getting "a stick in the mud" player on your team. Great game with a bad community.

review: Dota 2 is a multiplayer game (though you can play against bots). There are two teams of five players - the Radiant, and the Dire. Each player picks from a list of many characters, each with a different set of abilities. The two teams start on opposing sides of the map (there's only one map in the game). Each team has a base area, in which resides an "Ancient". From each base, creeps - these autonomous NPC creatures - spawn periodically in waves, and start a journey toward's the other teams base. Towers are scattered around the map that will automatically fire on any enemy unit. The goal for each team is to destroy the other team's Ancient, while defending their own. Hence: Defense of the Ancients. Sounds simple - but there's a lot more to it than this. Imagine the game starts and both teams just stay in their own base. Creeps from both teams will wander out from one base and head to the other, meeting somewhere in the middle of the map, where they will fight (again, they do this automatically without any player input). The creeps are evenly matched so typically they will both wipe each other out. The next wave of creeps will clean up anything left over - or they'll reach a tower, and get smashed by it - and the cycle will continue. Basically, nothing will happen - the game will not end, because the creeps can't get anywhere. Now imagine just one player from one of the teams goes out with his creeps. He can attack the enemy creeps, and support his own creeps as they make their way across the map, knocking down towers along the way. Eventually, he'll get to the enemy Ancient, and be able to destroy it. But if just one enemy player comes out to meet him, the teams will be more evenly matched - and it comes down to a player versus player (PvP) scenario. The PvP is, of course, the heart of the game. It is of a high level of complexity - the learning curve is quite steep, making it challenging for noobs, which is one of the reasons why the community was famed for being full of what I will euphemistically call "short tempered people". One player who doesn't know what he is doing can easily bring down the whole team. The complexity comes from two main parts - first, the sheer number of selectable characters in the game. At the time of writing, there are 102 characters - with more added periodically as the game is updated. Each character has four different abilities (sometimes more) that are active (requiring the user to press something to make them go) or passive (they just operate automatically). The abilities are character-specific, though there are common elements between them. Some of the abilities require chaining to use them effectively, and each ability is leveled individually as your character earns experience. After you've done the maths and figured out how many different abilities there are between all the characters - and thought about how long it would take to become familiar with even a small handful of them - consider that in addition to that, there are over 120 different items that you can equip your character with. Items can perform new actions or augment your existing ones (again, they are active or passive in nature). Oh yeah - each game takes a long time to finish - around 45 minutes is pretty common. You will never get away with saying "I'll just have a quick game of Dota" to your significant other - at least, not once they've put up with you playing it a few times. So - learning curve. Big one. Time investment (or sink, if you prefer). Big one. Especially when you're trying to play with other people and they're abusing you for not knowing what you're doing. But the real question is - is it worth it? I've clocked up almost 400 games (and there's still some characters I haven't played). I'm not turning pro any time soon, but have a reasonable handle on the fundamentals. My win rate is about 50%, which seems to be fairly normal. Losing is often traumatic, especially after you've lost a couple of long 45-60 minute games in a row, or you're saddled with random teammates in the matchmaking who are abusive idiots (or just bad). But the games that are good - they're really good. With so many combinations and different ways to exploit them, the level of satisfaction when you're playing with friends and manage to co-ordinate a five-person push on a tower, laying down that perfect combo that takes advantage of all your abilities, wiping out the other team.... well, that's what keeps me coming back for more. Not only that, but once you've invested a bunch of time and gotten over some initial learning humps, it's genuinely fun exploring the different characters and item combinations. There are always new builds to try and new items to buy. I've gone through several "favourite characters", depending on which new ones I've played recently and how well they worked out with my natural play style and with my teammates. Even after around 400 hours of gametime, I still have more to explore. I do, however, only really enjoy playing the game with my friends. I've tried a few games "solo", just picking up teammates using the matchmaking service, and I find this massively less fun. It's less engaging because I typically don't like to communicate with randoms via voice, and your chances of picking up toxic players are increased. I've had good games with randoms, but generally don't bother playing unless my mates are online. As with all reviews, this one attempts to help answer the question: "should I buy this game?". Well, good news - Dota 2 is free. It has just come out of a long invite-only beta period, so your actual financial investment in whether or not you should get into the game is zero. But there are two big questions you need to ask yourself: 1. Can I justify the amount of time I need to get decent at this game before I start enjoying it? Make no mistake, the learning process for this game is An Ordeal. If you're prepared to spend many hours reading guides and playing with bots until you can beat them on a reasonable difficulty - maybe 10 games? - then that's a good start. If you've got mates that are happy to babysit you then that's good - but note that most of them will not want to do this because it almost certainly means they'll be losing (a lot) while you're still struggling with the basics. The best way to approach it is to read some guides - I recommend Welcome to Dota, You Suck - and play with bots until you can beat them on Hard, reliably, with one character. Then find some friends who are happy to play with you knowing your noob status, and play some games online with them. The more friends the better; if you're matchmaking with randoms they will probably be less tolerant. 2. Why is it free? I seriously can play this without paying anything? Dota 2 is built on the "freemium" model. It's free to play, and you can purchase in-game items for money. By giving the game away, Valve hope to make more money selling in-game items than if they'd charged for the game. This is an increasing trend - so get used to seeing it more, especially for games with a strong network effect (i.e., anything with multiplayer). The things you can buy for Dota 2 are basically adornments for the characters. For example, you can outfit them with new armour, or a new sword, or some new spell effects, that are different from the stock-standard one that they come with. You can get some of these for free - they'll randomly drop at the end of games - but the good ones for your preferred characters you'll have to shell out for. It's very important to note that these items are purely decorative and have no impact on the gameplay at all. You can't pay money for a new sword that does more damage - it just looks different. This is critical and stops the game from becoming a silly pay-to-win thing. If you're a content creator, you can also create your own stuff and sell it in the store (splitting revenue with Valve).

review: To fully illustrate what makes DOTA one of the most compelling multiplayer games of all time, it helps to have a bit of background on the game itself. DOTA has its roots as a Warcraft 3 modification. Warcraft 3 introduced a unique mechanic in its campaign and multiplayer modes of "hero" units - units that actually gained experience points, abilities, and items as the game progresses. This really made it feel like you had an investment in these units, and you grew attached to them. To a degree these hero units, effectively commanders of your army of relatively disposable units, became your avatar in-game. It was a brilliant concept, and DOTA took it a step further. DOTA created a multiplayer mode that focused *exclusively* on playing these hero units - it removed the base building and unit management seen in the standard RTS format. It's one of the best examples of "less is more" than I've ever seen, and that description hardly does it justice. Managing your individual hero and your income, position on the map, constant decision making, and being able to size yourself up versus your enemy brings more depth than any other game I've ever played. I've yet to play any other multiplayer game where *every* member of your 5-man team is crucial to your victory. Everyone must do their part, and do it better than the other 5-man team. There are very few cases of where a game can be winnable 4v5, and teamwork becomes a huge factor. In the most intense and close games, the level of immersion really can't be matched. It's hard to think of another game that draws you in more than DOTA, especially when other people are counting on you to do well! It's a hectic, stressful, enormously complex and in-depth experience - not to mention absurdly fun. This is what keeps me coming back, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to really experience what multiplayer gaming can truly offer. If you're new to the game and want some background on specific heroes and strategies, or just want to watch some gameplay, be sure to check out my YouTube channel. Thanks for reading!

Actually i could say that the transition from Dota->Dota 2 gameplay was amazing,they didn't forgot a single thing and added even more than original Dota.The game got amazingly cool graphics and a great Soundtrack.The menu organisation are very simply and easy to understand to all new players.Valve really cares about your learning in Dota2 so they've made a "Learning" page where they "teach" you how to play better by making you a recommendation of the best items (Dota 2 have in stores always recommended items for you to purchase for each hero),because Dota 1 didn't had that option,so you need to now by your experience what to buy.They have videos where they show you each skill of each hero and it does.If you also want you can play with tips in your game if you need more help and also ask a more "professional" player to teach you (it's called coach),he will spectate your game and make you tips. The gameplay is amazing,i love it because it's very realistic and logic (dota 2 got a lot of logic,instead mobas like lol don't have).The art of Heroes are sorry but i'll repeat it,are amazing,everything is amazing in dota (almost) xD Still dota got some problems that need to be corrected: 1st-The community.Dota 2 community is full of stupid noobish kids,who don't know how to play and don't even learn how to play,and when you say them don't feed or other item,they'll always say to you fuc...you,noob,i've fuc.. your mother...(typical answer of russian 12 y.o kids). 2-Some updates that don't needed to be done (like removing the pudge fountain hook,because it had a lot of logic....and they removed it).but nevermind to this. 3-I can't tell you if Dota2 still got many bugs or not,but i notice that they still have a few,like shop bug where you can't buy items. 4-Servers.I don't know why but it's normal to have the servers down in dota2,and sometimes in the game will appear "Searching for Dota2 Network",don't know why this happens but probably their servers can't hold so much people?(my opinion). So yeah thats pretty what i've wrote.I hope you play this game and like it and enjoy as i do. Good Luck & Have Fun :)

review: DOTA 2 is a fun and challenging game where you and 4 mentally challenged people fight off against 5 high skilled players, the main objective of the game is to defend your base from the enemies for as long as you can (since no one on your team will try to attack the enemy base anyway). You can also yell at your teammates for trying to 1v5 , or farming the jungle while your team dies! Communicating and working together is crucial in this game to get the high score for "Longest time trying to carry your team" You can choose from a wide selection of really well-made and balanced heroes like Huskar and Death Prophet. You fight the enemy heroes on "Lanes", pathways across the maps where your creeps spawn and try to attack the enemies on the other side of the river, people refer to these lanes as Top, Bot, and Mid or feed. You can also tell your teammates that the enemies on your lane are missing, warning them about a possible gank, but for some reason that function doesn't seem to work. Last - hitting creeps and enemy heroes grant you gold, but keep in mind that no one on your team besides you has the ability to do that . Getting kills or good items only help you defend against the enemies longer, since the result will ALWAYS be the same! DOTA 2 is also a very educational game, yes! From Russian to Spanish, you will expand your vocabulary greatly! It also teaches you new ways to break your keyboard and monitor everytime you play!  YOU, DOTA  YOU

review: Very similar to League of Legends, although I haven't played League of Legends. Been looking at gameplay of the two and Dota 2 looks better overall. If your contemplating getting one of the two I would suggest Dota 2, played a bit of it and the people I was with didn't mind that I was a bit of a 'noob'. So from what i've experienced, the Dota 2 community is the complete opposite to the League of Legends community. Anyways; about the game. The game seems very competitive; as a new player you will encounter various players who are way better than you. First game I played two of my opponents had 0 deaths at the end of the game and a fair few kills (We did win though). You also will get loads of team mates who sit in the spawn; AFK, this is because they are just there to get the exp at the end and cant be bothered with the game. Why get the game to be AFK, and you are not contributing by doing so. Basically, you help the minions on whatever side you are on make their way to the enemies base. Pick one of three paths and guide the endlessly spawning minions down your path where you will destroy two enemy towers. The other paths will have your team mates on who SHOULD be supporting the minions on their path. You will encounter enemy packs of minions which will usually have a player supporting them. (As I said; a lot of them will be better than you). You earn exp whenever you are around and helping your minions kill other minions. You also get exp for killing other players. You will level up which lets you upgrade your 4 abilities which are all useful in different ways. You slowly earn gold randomly which can be used to buy various items. You have to find a merchant in the middle of the forest if you want to purchase the best items. You also earn more gold from getting killing blows on minions and enemy players. The game does take some stratergy so you must develop your specific playstyle while also contributing to your teams gains. Dont try to take someone elses playstyle if they are beating you with it as you will not be able to pick it up quickly. If you like the sound of this game then I really recommend getting this game as it can be addictive. There are people with over 4000 hours on this game; theres your proof on the addicting thing. It is very fun with friends.

review: Dota 2 is a multiplayer game (though you can play against bots). There are two teams of five players - the Radiant, and the Dire. Each player picks from a list of many characters, each with a different set of abilities. The two teams start on opposing sides of the map (there's only one map in the game). Each team has a base area, in which resides an "Ancient". From each base, creeps - these autonomous NPC creatures - spawn periodically in waves, and start a journey toward's the other teams base. Towers are scattered around the map that will automatically fire on any enemy unit. The goal for each team is to destroy the other team's Ancient, while defending their own. Hence: Defense of the Ancients. Sounds simple - but there's a lot more to it than this. Imagine the game starts and both teams just stay in their own base. Creeps from both teams will wander out from one base and head to the other, meeting somewhere in the middle of the map, where they will fight (again, they do this automatically without any player input). The creeps are evenly matched so typically they will both wipe each other out. The next wave of creeps will clean up anything left over - or they'll reach a tower, and get smashed by it - and the cycle will continue. Basically, nothing will happen - the game will not end, because the creeps can't get anywhere. Now imagine just one player from one of the teams goes out with his creeps. He can attack the enemy creeps, and support his own creeps as they make their way across the map, knocking down towers along the way. Eventually, he'll get to the enemy Ancient, and be able to destroy it. But if just one enemy player comes out to meet him, the teams will be more evenly matched - and it comes down to a player versus player (PvP) scenario. The PvP is, of course, the heart of the game. It is of a high level of complexity - the learning curve is quite steep, making it challenging for noobs, which is one of the reasons why the community was famed for being full of what I will euphemistically call "short tempered people". One player who doesn't know what he is doing can easily bring down the whole team. The complexity comes from two main parts - first, the sheer number of selectable characters in the game. At the time of writing, there are 102 characters - with more added periodically as the game is updated. Each character has four different abilities (sometimes more) that are active (requiring the user to press something to make them go) or passive (they just operate automatically). The abilities are character-specific, though there are common elements between them. Some of the abilities require chaining to use them effectively, and each ability is leveled individually as your character earns experience. After you've done the maths and figured out how many different abilities there are between all the characters - and thought about how long it would take to become familiar with even a small handful of them - consider that in addition to that, there are over 120 different items that you can equip your character with. Items can perform new actions or augment your existing ones (again, they are active or passive in nature). Oh yeah - each game takes a long time to finish - around 45 minutes is pretty common. You will never get away with saying "I'll just have a quick game of Dota" to your significant other - at least, not once they've put up with you playing it a few times. So - learning curve. Big one. Time investment (or sink, if you prefer). Big one. Especially when you're trying to play with other people and they're abusing you for not knowing what you're doing. But the real question is - is it worth it? I've clocked up almost 400 games (and there's still some characters I haven't played). I'm not turning pro any time soon, but have a reasonable handle on the fundamentals. My win rate is about 50%, which seems to be fairly normal. Losing is often traumatic, especially after you've lost a couple of long 45-60 minute games in a row, or you're saddled with random teammates in the matchmaking who are abusive idiots (or just bad). But the games that are good - they're really good. With so many combinations and different ways to exploit them, the level of satisfaction when you're playing with friends and manage to co-ordinate a five-person push on a tower, laying down that perfect combo that takes advantage of all your abilities, wiping out the other team.... well, that's what keeps me coming back for more. Not only that, but once you've invested a bunch of time and gotten over some initial learning humps, it's genuinely fun exploring the different characters and item combinations. There are always new builds to try and new items to buy. I've gone through several "favourite characters", depending on which new ones I've played recently and how well they worked out with my natural play style and with my teammates. Even after around 400 hours of gametime, I still have more to explore. I do, however, only really enjoy playing the game with my friends. I've tried a few games "solo", just picking up teammates using the matchmaking service, and I find this massively less fun. It's less engaging because I typically don't like to communicate with randoms via voice, and your chances of picking up toxic players are increased. I've had good games with randoms, but generally don't bother playing unless my mates are online. As with all reviews, this one attempts to help answer the question: "should I buy this game?". Well, good news - Dota 2 is free. It has just come out of a long invite-only beta period, so your actual financial investment in whether or not you should get into the game is zero. But there are two big questions you need to ask yourself: 1. Can I justify the amount of time I need to get decent at this game before I start enjoying it? Make no mistake, the learning process for this game is An Ordeal. If you're prepared to spend many hours reading guides and playing with bots until you can beat them on a reasonable difficulty - maybe 10 games? - then that's a good start. If you've got mates that are happy to babysit you then that's good - but note that most of them will not want to do this because it almost certainly means they'll be losing (a lot) while you're still struggling with the basics. The best way to approach it is to read some guides - I recommend Welcome to Dota, You Suck - and play with bots until you can beat them on Hard, reliably, with one character. Then find some friends who are happy to play with you knowing your noob status, and play some games online with them. The more friends the better; if you're matchmaking with randoms they will probably be less tolerant. 2. Why is it free? I seriously can play this without paying anything? Dota 2 is built on the "freemium" model. It's free to play, and you can purchase in-game items for money. By giving the game away, Valve hope to make more money selling in-game items than if they'd charged for the game. This is an increasing trend - so get used to seeing it more, especially for games with a strong network effect (i.e., anything with multiplayer). The things you can buy for Dota 2 are basically adornments for the characters. For example, you can outfit them with new armour, or a new sword, or some new spell effects, that are different from the stock-standard one that they come with. You can get some of these for free - they'll randomly drop at the end of games - but the good ones for your preferred characters you'll have to shell out for. It's very important to note that these items are purely decorative and have no impact on the gameplay at all. You can't pay money for a new sword that does more damage - it just looks different. This is critical and stops the game from becoming a silly pay-to-win thing. If you're a content creator, you can also create your own stuff and sell it in the store (splitting revenue with Valve).

review: I used to be a healthy and contributing member of society until I encountered Dota 2. The moment I started playing it, I thought to myself "Wow.", "This is it.", "The game that will finally do what no other can." I was right, ever since I played Dota 2, my family has disowned me, I lost my job, my girlfriend dumped me, and I was left by my dog. Instead of talking civilly to other human beings like I used to, I now simply scream expletives at them without even looking. I no longer have to remember purposeless numerics such as my social security number, my cellphone number, my age, and even the number of children I have. Before I played Dota 2, I thought I can measure my life's worth with useless factors such as my income, quality of living, or contribution to society, but now I know the truth and realize how foolish I was, Dota 2 taught me the true meaning of living, that is, one's MMR, the one thing that separates 7k gods from other 1k scrub trash. After Dota 2, I have never looked at life the same way again. 10/10

Its very addictive especially once you get the hang of it. My favorite characters are Sven and Zeus, they're pretty good. I personally think Ursa and Sniper are overused, So you may wanna use some underused characters like Death Prophet! >:D Have fun playing!

review: Listen here, you uncouth curs. This a game about "heroes." Not "champions," HEROES. They go around and do crazy  like hit each other with magic and , all high fantasy nonsense. Look here man, I watched some lady dressed all in black two shot a ing god, where else can you find this level of ludicrosity!? WHERE?! On top of that, this game goes way back. It has like, an established culture and if you don't follow it, you will be ostrascized as if this were ing Sydney. That was a lame  joke but it makes sense because where else would find a rat- ostrich than Australia?! WHERE?! All you need to know is that words like "" and "blat" are some of the finest praise that you can get in this game, and feel free to use them when you see an invoker drop an EMP or when you look at the shop and look all lost and confused. You will fit in just fine. But what the  do I know? I just play wtf mode with my one really cool friend and this other guy who I really dont like to be seen in public with.

review: What is Dota 2?  A welcoming community, where everyone is so kind, that they are even ready to take care of your relatives, especially your dear mother.  9/10 players are always ready to play with you  A very multicultural community. It literally erases the borders between genders, nations, ages, anything. Just like in real life, you can meet foreigners anywhere.  Has a lot of mini-games within such as: King of the Hill, Hot Rapier (a Dota 2 version of "Hot potato"), Hide and Seek, Base Race and many others.  Experienced players are always ready to teach you how to play. Always.

I personally like this a whole lot more than League. Dota 2 has all of the things League of Legends is missing, like couriers and a stash. It's free and the costumizables are a huge bonus, just like in TF2 with all the hats. Although it might be hard in the beginning, if you stick to it I'm sure you'll find many hours of fun, and to add one last thing: it's best played with friends!

review: 10/10. By playing this game you basically sell your soul to Gabe Newell. Aside being one of the best balanced ARTS games ever, other features include: > Dota 2 offers a system called "matchmaking" that allows you to learn multiple foreign languages. > For a fee ranging from BZZ pugna bracers to Dragonclaw Hook, you can customise any hero's look (Except Zeus, he is already fabulous.) with virtual hats. > Owning and frequently playing Dota 2 allows you to safely assume every other ARTS (or MOBA, in other languages such as LoLspeak) is inferior and therefore concluding that Dota 2 is the best game of its genre. > A very balanced ranking system measured in "MMR" also known as "e-peen points" that has no meaning whatsoever past the 6000 mark, since matchmaking pairs you with 4000 MMR players and 5000 MMR bought accounts. Bored with the game? No problem! You can indulge in the world of Dota without playing via a plethora of ways: > You can participate in Steam discussions where you can assume you know what you're talking about. > Go on reddit and discuss anything about Dota, whether it's a thread about serious metagame discussion, or a thread about Arteezy tweeting about a thread about Arteezy tweeting. > Or you could experience the "pinnacle" of human stupidity by participating in any popular Dota 2 stream's twitch chat. The persons chatting there offer a broad range of insight about the stream or the game in general, be it "() I'M LOL FAN AND I HAVE DOWN SYNDROME ()" ,"   (___FISSURE_____()" or the simple, yet very concise "322" or "fEEd."

review: How to Properly Play the Game Step 1: Open Dota 2 and jump straight into matchmaking in Russia, it is multi-functional as you can learn Dota 2 AND Russian racial slurs Step 2: Pick the coolest looking character you can find Step 3: After you picked Meepo, head to the middle lane Step 4: Die to the enemy, it shall boost their morale to make them more reckless Step 5: Keep dying, it probably will pay off Step 6: At the 15 minute mark, buy the courier that everybody has been swearing about Step 7: Click on the courier Step 8: AHA! YOU CLICKED ON THE COURIER! Now, you will forever be a Donkey, in the midst of your confusion, bravely clop to the battlefield Step 9: After much "wtf", blame the support for being a noob to keep your reputation intact Step 10: After you lost the match, head towards to the store and buy everything you can to improve. Cooler looking stuff should probably buff your character, right? Step 11: Get mistaken for a pro due to your accessories Step 12: Repeat steps 4, 5, 9, and 10 until you lose your soul Step 13: Sue Valve to calm your emotional distress

review: A great game filled with action and strategy. Takes a very long time to learn, longer to master. After 700 hours I still cant play each hero, and havent mastered quite all of the advanced mechanics. You must play this game for 50-100 hours before you can even think about deciding if its a game for you. It is very competetive, and sensitive people will not enjoy it. You will be insulted, a lot. If you get to a high lvl and have played many matches like me, you wont be paired up with Peruvians or Russian quite as much, but at the beginning there will be someone who doesnt speak English (in a U.S. English server) and they will most likely suck and lose the game for you. There will be heros that will wreck you every game until you (and those idiots you call allies) learn how to play against them. Even after all the hardships, I'm still playing this game. Those 700 hours? I found this game 6 months ago, 500 of those hours only on the weekends, even with school. It's a fun game, but people suck. Enjoy

review: Okay, I recommend and do NOT recommend at the same time: Why I recommend: - It's a Valve game, Come on people! - The training missions are good. I put 2 hours into them. - It's freaking free - Just get it if you're looking for a random game to play Why I do no recommend: - It just sucks - I am not the kind of person to play this game. - I like campaigns, not massively multiplayer stuff.

review: When I first started DOTA2 I was a little overwhelmed, as my first ARTS/MOBA game it was pretty complicated. I soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying. Before I knew it, I was performing  and better. I stopped making silly  and  got vastly better at not  the enemy . For the  part, everyone I've met was very helpful and , there  the   however. As  - play DOTA2    ,  ,     .      !

review: To fully illustrate what makes DOTA one of the most compelling multiplayer games of all time, it helps to have a bit of background on the game itself. DOTA has its roots as a Warcraft 3 modification. Warcraft 3 introduced a unique mechanic in its campaign and multiplayer modes of "hero" units - units that actually gained experience points, abilities, and items as the game progresses. This really made it feel like you had an investment in these units, and you grew attached to them. To a degree these hero units, effectively commanders of your army of relatively disposable units, became your avatar in-game. It was a brilliant concept, and DOTA took it a step further. DOTA created a multiplayer mode that focused *exclusively* on playing these hero units - it removed the base building and unit management seen in the standard RTS format. It's one of the best examples of "less is more" than I've ever seen, and that description hardly does it justice. Managing your individual hero and your income, position on the map, constant decision making, and being able to size yourself up versus your enemy brings more depth than any other game I've ever played. I've yet to play any other multiplayer game where *every* member of your 5-man team is crucial to your victory. Everyone must do their part, and do it better than the other 5-man team. There are very few cases of where a game can be winnable 4v5, and teamwork becomes a huge factor. In the most intense and close games, the level of immersion really can't be matched. It's hard to think of another game that draws you in more than DOTA, especially when other people are counting on you to do well! It's a hectic, stressful, enormously complex and in-depth experience - not to mention absurdly fun. This is what keeps me coming back, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to really experience what multiplayer gaming can truly offer. If you're new to the game and want some background on specific heroes and strategies, or just want to watch some gameplay, be sure to check out my YouTube channel. Thanks for reading!

review: If you're looking for a good, visually appealing and challenging game, perhaps you like League of Legends a lot but you're looking for a new game? Then this is for you. I personally like this a whole lot more than League. Dota 2 has all of the things League of Legends is missing, like couriers and a stash. It's free and the costumizables are a huge bonus, just like in TF2 with all the hats. Although it might be hard in the beginning, if you stick to it I'm sure you'll find many hours of fun, and to add one last thing: it's best played with friends!

review: I highly recommend this over it's competitor, Rosetta Stone. While Rosetta Stone promised "Adaptive Learning", "Social Sharing", and "Community Learning", I found Dota 2 to be a much better product in terms of cultural exposure and hands on training. Unlike Rosetta Stone, Dota 2 matches you up with real Spanish-speakers, Russian-speakers, or dirty Pinoys that are fresh off the boat and ready to help you delve into their ethnic practices and language. As an English speaker, I learned the Peruvian dialect of Spanish in less than 3 months solely playing Dota 2 for an hour a day. I highly recommend this game. As we say in Spanish, "jajajajajaj gringo noob la  madre concha tu madre. idiota hijo de la gran  calla csm. que huevon eres. pajero de  .l. jajajajaj xDDD."

Blaming you in a common indicator to show that theyre russian - well this seems legit but its not always as easy as some of them are playing with a name of arabic letters, dont show that theyre russian or sometimes even write in english - You need to grab those black sheep as they refuse to offer free classes of russian - zz thats quite unfair whilst the rest puts a lot of effort into teaching. Spanish and portuguese isnt any use for us as we only want to learn languages which help us in everyday life. 700 million people all around the world is fairly and squarely a joke compared to the use it is to win a russian friend (Geez theyre crazy fun fellows) and have lots of fun trying to get a russian accent while talking to them (and of course) attaching the previous words which strenghten the bond of friendship between you and your feeding teammates.

Other than that, when you're in a game, the little book thing in the top left contains community guides that will light up which skills you should get in order.

review: Dota 2. Well, Dota 2 is definitely the best game I have ever played in my whole life. From this game I gained so many awesome friends,mates and never felt bored while playing with them. It's a fun game if played with friends. Dota 2 requires TeamWork in order to win the game properly. Dota 2 is purely based on Skill. And I said this for four reasons : 1-Counter picking. 2-Map awareness. 3-When to start a team fight when to defend. 4-Picking right items. Plus the more you play Dota 2, the more you want to learn about the game, and then you will enjoy playing it more than anytime! So actually Dota 2 is more like a team game. But playing solo is an other story... In solo matchmaking TeamWork is laughable. People will most likely tell you what to do step by step. If you don't follow what they're telling you. [All chat] "report player". Your random teammates will blame you for every single mistake you have done. And they won't even try to help you. They will just start insulting you in [All chat] and this will result to a lost game. I have tried to be nice with all my teammates when playing SOLO but as everytime, it's either I carry the team or I will lose the game. it's my mates attitude, I rarely get to play with people who speaks English properly. I will always get the " squad" spamming in [All chat], "REPORT INVOKER NO GANK!!" " blat, adi nahoo". I'm not quite sure what they're saying, but I'm positive, they're insulting me or my mother, most of the time. Well of course there are nice guys, but they are rare. Overall this game is awesome and somewhat addictive. B E C A R E F U L L. 8/10

review: I'll give a thumbs up only because the game itself is pretty good, but this is not an actual review, its more like a short summary about my over 900 hours spent into this game (LOL n00b cant write  until 2kh NOOB). I started playing it because my friends convinced me, and because almost everybody in the forum I post on play this. So I started playing it both with my friends and solo. Today at the end of my very last match(which I lost) I realized that I have never had fun in this game. I mean, out of 900 hours I can only remember like, 7-8 really funny moments where I actually laughed. Oh, the irony of fate, the very last laugh was in my very last match. I was Earthshaker top dire in lane with Warlock against Death Prophet and Batrider, we got first blood like 10 seconds after the 00:00 mark, I spotted DP warding our jungle, I used fissure to block her escape way and Warlock used Shadow Word. While we were AA her, she started to move left and right like she didn't know what to do, it looked like she was dancing, and it reminded me of that case of mass hysteria happening around the early XVI century in France, where several people started dancing uncontrollably for weeks until they died(yes I know, my interests are ed up), and THAT actually made me laugh, THAT to me was a funny moment, not the quick first blood, not the 2 more kills we did on bat in the next couple of minutes (warlock got all of them btw) but the fact that DP started dancing while we were beating her up. This made me think a little, but only for a couple of seconds, there's a game to win here guys! Focus! There's very little to say about what happened next, the typical things that usually happen in a bad, unranked, 0 MMR, trench  tier match; me without blink until 25:00; our Drow disconnecting (and abandoned) cause of PC problems, Lina with Aghanim and no Meka; wards only for half match(I'm guilty of it too); we lost Roshan two times, over 20 kills of difference for the Radiants, Lina and Storm Spirit arguing with each other, calling names, your mama did this, your fatha did that, your sista lul  don't evel let me start on that one, and so on. At the very end of the match, we hid in the fountain waiting for them to FF GG WP EZ QQ M8S ecc, and in that moment, reading the argue between Lina and Storm, i asked myself some questions: Am i having fun? Is this game making me laugh? How many funny moments i can remember about this game? Is that normal that to me every single match i've done looks exactly the same as the others(lul of cuz yes u ing <2kh scum n00b)? The answers to the questions were: no, no, not even 10, i don't know. In that instant, I realized that this game, to me, was just a gigantic waste of time. How many times have I actually enjoyed what was going on on screen? Why am I taking this so seriously? Why do I want to win so desperately? Why do my teammates want to win so desperately? ... How many times have I smiled while playing this game? ... These are not pro player matches we play, we are earning nothing from this, there's no need to yell at each other! This makes me sad. I've heard yelling my whole life, I play games because they help me forget about how life is hard, to relax and laugh at the hundreds and hundreds of funny, silly, nonsense moments this beautiful piece of software can gift me. Games really help me, they help me a lot. Please, guys, stop, dont get mad, Im serious! This is a game, right? Games are meant to be fun! Please stop arguing, we lost a videogame, its not the end of the world, next time you will win, we will all win :) and even if you don't, who cares! Its just a videogame! Enjoy the little things you can get out of it! Remember DP dancing to death? Wasn't that fun? Remember Pudge denying himself after we wasted literally all we got at him? And then the Radiants team wiped us? Yes, we lost money and experience, but wasn't that kinda fun? Sorta fun? Even a little bit? Yes we lost this match but cmon! Don't hide in the fountain! Lets do something silly to them! Lets annoy them! Storm, use your ulti to get near them and then immediately go back in the fountain! Lets watch them throwing everything at you in the attempt of catching you! Isn't that fun? :D <<Storm?>> <<Storm?>> <<Storm?, are you listening to me?, Storm are you still arguing with Lina because of her Aghanim? She made a mistake, everybody makes mistakes, there is no need to take it personally! Now she knows that Aghanim is a no-no, shes got it, now just chill out man, its a game!>> :D *SLAP* << :O b-but Storm, w-why? ;( >> <<BECAUSE U R A ING L0SER THATS WHY YOU PIECE OF SHIET!

review: Dota 2 is a Multiplayer Online Battle Area (MOBA) game with a huge community and fanbase. This game takes the player's hand-to-eye coordination, decision making, reaction time and teamwork and puts it to the test in a 5 vs 5 situation. Unlike most of the MOBA games on the market Dota 2 is free of charge from the beginning with no money, in-game or real money being spent to unlock playable characters meaning players do not have an advantage over others on the choices they have and it's easier for beginners to get to know a hero. However this game does have a rather steep learning 'cliff' (similar to a learning curve but instead of gradually learning, it takes some time then the game *snaps* into focus for you and you become pretty good and then it's a normal learning curve from there on). There are a few issues with the levels of toxicity of some of the players but overall this is a good game, higly addictive though and you'll probably end up being glued to the screen for hours on end.

review: Dota 2 is one of those games which cause a myriad of emotions. You'll love it and hate it all at the same time but that doesn't stop it from being the most competitive and professional eSport games on the planet. One of the first negative things you're going to encounter in Dota 2 is the learning curve. It isn't like most games. It requires knowledge of many unique aspects and only after encountering every hero at least once, will you start to get comfortable. If you want to take Dota 2 seriously, or even casually, prepare to invest a lot of time. Guides can of course cut this time substantially. When you do learn to play, you will be rewarded with one of the biggest feelings of accomplishment of any game. You will feel like a god among men - but remember, most people feel this, and as such, the Dota community is one of arrogant and toxic tossers. There are nice players, but there are plenty of unpleasant ones. If you want to play Dota 2 properly, you need to play with friends - or just learn to mute people. Overall, Dota 2 is a team game that is really hard to play casually. You will either love it or hate it - but more often than not, both at the same time.

review: Dota 2 is probably tied with Call of Duty for the best online multiplayer indie anime game. The people who made this game knew what they needed to do to make this into the great game that it is today. I have about .3 hours on this game and I can tell you those were the best .3 hours of my life. The great thing about this game is the friendly community, I remember after a match the person on the opposite team said I was a , I assumed that was the German word for Gg. All and all I reccomend this game to any one who loves a game with a good campaign and story. And remember to say  after every Dota 2 match.

review: Day in the life of Dota 2 player: -Wake up in the morning and think about playing some Dota but instead prepare for school. -Watch some famous players play Dota the last few minutes you have before you leave. -Get on the bus and fall asleep only to think about Dota. -Get to class and make murmurs here and there about Dota and curses about noobs or matches you lost. -Get random smiles throughout the day when you remember a really amazing match, but sadly have nobody to share it with because all your friends play League. -Get on the bus to get home and realize you have a lot of homework, have to walk far from the bus to get home, and play Dota. -Run like a mad man from bus stop to get home for Dota. -Have an argument with yourself on whether you should play Dota or finish your project you have been putting off for Dota. -Play dota for only 1 match he says. Finishes at 10pm he does. -Hate yourself because you didnt finish any work, talk to any non-Dota friends, and played 7+ hours of Dota. -Cry yourself to sleep and wake up in the morning to do it again. Dota has essentially ruined my life. I went onto the steam store to find a F2P game because I was always bored with hours of time. I played stuff like warface and what not and I kept seeing this. I had also heard about youtubers making jokes about the game so I figured why the heck not. Played the game ONCE. That's when the addiction started. Soon my hours of freetime reduced to minutes, seconds, sometimes I would stay up 3+ hours later just to play more matches. DONT EVEN THINK OF MAKING FRIENDS ON HERE, THEY ONLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO PLAY MORE. Dota has essentially taken my life away, and I must say im ing loving it. Dota is love Dota is life. Warning game causes following symptoms: -Racism towards Russians for reasons you don't even udnerstand, -Insomnia -Anxiety -High blood Pressure -Low blood Sugar -Malnutrition -EXTREME LEVELS OF STRESS -Hyperventalation -High amounts of giddyness and happyness -Extremem amounts of sadness -Rage And carpul tunnel.

review: Created by Blizzard and stolen by Valve, Dota 2 is one of today's most popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena games, with a mere 9 million more monthly players than its close competitor, Avalon Heroes. Based on a third-party modification for Warcraft III, Dota 2 strives to fill the wallets of its developers and empty the wallets of its players. This classic strategy game offers a substantial amount of playable heroes (each with their own unique and blatantly overpowered abilities to fit any playstyle), only one map and a metric buttload of entirely worthless cosmetic items. Being the best video game in existence comes at a price: Dota 2 has a very steep learning curve, requiring an estimated 14 years played before gaining a basic understanding of how the game works and another 30 years to get a very weak grasp of any one hero's hundreds of thousands of spells and abilities. On top of individual skill, this game heavily relies on teamwork, coordination and communication - this ensures that you will get buttraped the first 500 games you play. Also it's free. Rubbish game straight from the bargain bin; 10/10.

review: A team game were over 90% of people dont want to cooperate, play as a team, talk, plan, do strats and so on. Game looks good at first, but at the end of the day, its just a horrible online experience. If you have a 5 man stack, with good game knowledge, good coordination, yeah matches can be decent (but i recommend setting up "inhouse matches" with another 5 man stack!!). If you dont have a 5 man stack, its a pub train all day (or just plain bad/noobish). You win 50-5, then you lose 45-7, then you win 41-17, then you lose 60-28 and so on. Its all about the "lucky roll of the dice" named matchmaking. Most players that play this game have lvl 0-1 accounts, with only dota or other free to play games. So dont think if you report them, they care. They just make another account to troll, feed or w/e. Also, alot of people play this game drunk, stoned, or just very tired. That can be ok i guess in a 1v1 game, or a 2v2 with one of their buddies. But in a 5v5 team game, its not nice. They just ruin the experience for alot of other people. Most people use their own language. Chatting or writing. Teamspeak or just skype is not on their menu. So most russians will speak russian, most turks will speak turkish and so on. There is no region lock. Again, for a 1v1 game, maybe that could work. But for a game like dota, having a player from Australia or Peru joining the Euro server with 300-400 ping is not cool. And alot of people just check more servers for faster queue times and also check more languages. So if you check EU West or US East, and expect all people to have good pings and speak english, think again :)). At least some of the dota 2 players, played wc3 or dota 1, dont even get me started with the other mobas... Its the only genre that makes me feel ive wasted my time in most cases when i play the game. Bonus: People either flame/curse etc, or just dont know what the hell they are doing. In most cases both ^_^ So, i recommend using your free time / gaming time, playing other games. And stay away from all free to play team games / MMO's. They are a magnet for trolls, kids or just noobs that dont care. And you know why? Bcuz they can make 1000 accounts... So if they get banned or their ranking has gone down, its no problem, new acc on the way. Its kinda sad, game could have been fun. But its not. And thigs will never change bcuz of all the reasons ive stated above. The game at its core is good, but the overall online experience is bad. Cant recommend this for a new player, a true newbie. Cant recommend this either for an old skool RTS player. These guys online dont even look at the minimap!! So most of the time the games/matches wont be good and fun. Even most of the wins are fun just bcuz you had fun / a good talk or w/e, with a real life friend that you had on skype, or a gaming friend that you laned with, not bcuz of the dota match tbh. So just go and drink beer with that mate, or just play other games with him/them. With this concept of f2p and team gameplay, i cant see valve fixing this, so i cant see a reason to recommend this. Sure you can get random good matches, but after all my experience playing this, i think you are better off without this game / genre completely. Peace!

review: This is truly a masterpiece of gaming. Naughty Dog's latest title, and their first foray into the first-person shooter genre, is without a doubt a dazzling success. Drumstick of the Albatross 2, co-designed by Gabe Newell and David "Phreak" Turley, has everything: HUNDREDS of weapons to choose from, an ENORMOUS array of materials obtainable to build one's own home base, and THREE different unlockable character models. At the low price of $5.99 each, booster packs are an amazing addition, allowing one's character and mount to be personalized even further. But where DotA 2 really shines is in its gameplay. The tight control scheme, designed exclusively for the Steam controller, allows a seemingly seamless interface between man and machine--you ARE the character. The experience of battling with enemy mechs up-close and personal is unrivalled by any game, especially with the advanced mango physics. Overall, I would rate DotA 2 a 9.8/10 experience; its only flaw is the slight lack of purchasable, pay-to-win content that I usually rely on to make my gaming experiences successful. I'd love to see a DotA 3, especially if Zynga takes a note out of Blizzard's book and makes the game dozens of times easier for paying customers to succeed at PvP.

review: This is a short story about a player named Karl and his experience with Dota 2. There once was a time, long ago when Karl played games expecting no help from the team... He chose snowball heroes his MMR rose, there was a certain joy in his victories no matter how badly his team did. Then after long nights of 1v5 he thought to himself "I wonder how it would be if i played with those other four russians" For a week he tried to help lead others into the light of smart plays, excelent ward placement, and proper item choices. He led by example keeping the games close through the mid-game. But when the late game struck and the enemies BKBs were built, the team he spent the past thirty minutes of his life guiding and supporting were not there. They were not there when the bottom rax fell, they were not there when the ward spotted the Radiant attempt on roshan's life, they were not there when the mid rax was taken, they were farming, chasing illusions and supports. When the time came. When the last set of rax seemed doomed to fall, they came. In came my four hard carries like the lost children of a single mother they came to defend my home from the void. They had spent so much time farming and leaving the fighting to me that they hadnt a clue how to fight together. the four of them died a horrible death, only killing a crystal maiden they saw on their way back to the base... Why do i tell you this tale? Because there is a moral to the story, never play a support to climb the MMR bracket. It only leaves you heart broken, and 25MMR less. 10/10 would Carry again.

review: One of the most addictive games i have played so far. Yes i have the greed of drops no lying but this one is just kickass :D Different heroes their abilities and the items. <3 Heroes range from funny to creepy :D . Okay for those who will start new there are a few things. Just don't ignore the tutorial it's boring at first but really important. and do ask you friends while in game which item is good for which hero and go for easy heroes at first like Rikki or Razor, don't wish to make lots of kills at first just hang around your friends and towers and defend, it's generally a helping community, Start making friends when you understand the game better to make a team for when you have to play ranked matches. People do say go after the recommended items and it's right for when you start playing first but after that every item has an detailed explanation just go through them and with your gut feeling because it doesn't matter what skills the heroes have what matters is how you use their skills and no one knows it better than you yourself.

review: I'll make it easy for you. This game is amazing! If you want to know why then keep reading. DOTA 2 is a completely free to play MOBA. The things that you can buy are mostly just for novelty or cosmetics for your heroes. There's no paying to win in this game. If you are interested in winning expect to put a lot of time in as this game has a STEEP learning curve. The good news is that this game is so popular that you won't have any trouble finding some game guides or youtube videos to help you out. Dota 2 is also one of the best Esports games out there currently. They have tournaments on a regular basis and you are able to watch them directly from in game! This game also has fantastic graphics and can run easily on most PCs. On top of that the game is developed by Valve so of course it has fantastic support both from them and the community. This without a doubt is one of the best games available today. Did I mention it was free? Read more game reviews at

review: I don't like this game very much. Every time I play it, I want to kill myself. Anytime I play with friends, I don't want to be friends with them anymore. Anytime I play with random strangers, I want to kill the entire population of this pathetic planet. This game is bad, because it makes you realise how bad everything else is. The game itself is 10/10, but playing the game is a whole different adventure. It ruins your life. Don't start playing this game, it will consume you. A+++

review: Biggest learning curve known to man. Not really but enjoy spending 1000 hours learning and memorizng all heroes, all items, and all creeps and mechanics along with damage types, warding, the gold system and so much more. Fun game if you slog through all that  first- don't play bot matches they make you garbage. Queue up with no idea how to play, like a man.

review: This is a great game. I used to play the warcraft 3 user map settings version. It was addicting way back then, and it is still addicting now. I played league of legends before I played dota 2, and I admit i was a little scared of the transition from league to dota. But as I write this review now, I do not think I will ever play league of legends again. I will stick to playing dota2 from now until forever. Perhaps it's the nostalgia it gives me or perhaps it's fact that everyone is a  on league of legends. Eitherway, this is a great game to get into, especially if MOBAs are your type of game.

review: You might see this  installed in my friends list and go "Wow, you really have a MOBA installed?" No I don't you ing weebs. I don't play this nerd  so just stop right in your  tracks if you were gonna ask me to help you get some  360 noskill points or climb out of your "cardboard-cloud-9-tier" whatever that you dorks do. I won't have that . I installed this "Dot A" game because some disgusting ski-mask-wearing cockbiting chuckle put a gun to my head and said if I didn't install it then he would suicide bomb every bald eagle. We all know I don't  around when it comes to the greatest symbol of freedom on Earth so I installed this dumb spaz  before punching that  in the throat and breaking his  neck and promptly washing my hard drive in bleach. Because Corporal Jace Stryker once told me "I don't negotiate with Cyber Terrorists" and I don't either god dammit. #SemperFidelis

review: Very crappy matchmaking. Opponents too OP. Bad graphics. No first person view. Long loading screens. Unpolite and awfuly rude teammates that call you in many bad names. Even my grandma's toaster has a better frame rate and It also makes you crunchy bread. Heroe's are called just like pornstars, for example - Queen of pain, Crystal maiden, Bounty hunter, Silencer, Witch doctor. Or just sounds a little bit too homosexual - Lone druid, Razor, Batrider, Nature's prophet, Beastmaster and Tiny. Last, but not least is MAGNUS. This hero does not only wield a name that`s destined for a huge , but his horn also looks like one too. Sadly, heroes appearance is also poor. Meepo looks lika a rabbit that smokes weed before every round. IO is just a light bulb. Kunkka is the Heihachi Mishima from Tekken. Morphiling is just water. I think Sven and Juggernaut are twins. Storm spirit looks like an avarage asian man, only he loves drinking energy drinks and watching tentacle porn too often. Nature's prophet cannot even smell flowers because he has no possesion of a nose. Ogre magi has the nicest . He/they beat even cuties like Mirana and Windranger. Faceless void? Let's just call him Eyeless d*ckhead. All females look... let's just say - pretty bangable. Annddddd..... Magnus. Name says It all. Lastly I`d like to say that all maps are identical which makes game boring after a while and game's ending is too predictable. All items that I buy always disappear starting the next round and I hate when games don't have easter eggs or other skins for characters. If you have read this until the end, listen to me, listen to the voice of reason, turn off the computer, go outside and discover all the things the world can give to you. If you don't, well, welcome to the dota nation.

review: A solid Multiplayer-Online Battle-Arena game... What is a MOBA? a Moba is probably a game where by fundamentals everything is first set in total equilibrium... and players actions, skills, teamwork and effort is what makes the difference for one team to finally win over another. With over 100 different heroes to choose from, all absolutely free, no need to unlock and no need to buy anything.... On top of the "seemingly" repetitive one map and mode there's actually different events with a very distinct gameplay and features.. ranging from Team versus Team like Diretide and even Co-oP like the Wraith Night. The game's business model is the way I see it, most user-friendly... Everything you want unlocked is unlocked... Everything that u can buy is purely eye-candy and visual effects and models... But at the same time, one courier... one announcer... one "set" on your favorite hero is enough to make the game experience just SO MUCH more! Be Vary though.... Amongst the player base lurk some really irrittating and annoying children from all across the globe, who's primary aim and goal ( in game and in life ) is to just annoy people and piss them off for their own pleasure. Steer clear of falling into arguments with them that cost you the whole game and some nerve cells... There's the report abuse button and let the MODs do the rest!

review: For all of Dota 2's flaws, including but not limited to - Russian kids on almost every server, a learning curve high enough that it has a bloody overhang, obnoxious "It's all about me" fools who think they can carry a game while getting their teats kicked hard enough it can turn a good match into a one-sided slaughterfest - Dota 2 is now one of my favourite games of all time. Despite the abysmal learning curve, there's one very simple step you have to take in order to be good at Dota - ...yourself. Getting over yourself, realising you can't carry a match on your own as any Hero, and learning to fight with the team is a fundamental aspect of being good at Dota. For example, one of my favourite heroes is Juggernaut - a Carry/Pusher. Come on, he's tailored to kick the asses of the enemy team if he is played right, but he's fantastic fighting in your own team thanks to the fact he's strong on both offense and defense, but the defensive part goes to waste if you don't work with your guys. That's what Dota is about. Don't just do it for the sake of getting as many kills as possible. It's the team that matters. At the end of the day, it's the exploding rock garden that wins the game, yes? So for God's sake, people, work together. Plus, it's loads of fun. Valve brings its best polish for this one alright - loads of characters to choose from, a cartoony style not as exaggerated but certainly reminscient of Team Fortress 2, and, personal opinion; miles better than League of Legends, but that's really down to personal preference. Reco-bloody-mmended.

The depth of this game is amazing, a huge variety of items and characters to do battle 5 vs 5 in online multiplayer. I would like to point out that this game has only one map. One ing map that never gets boring. The best way I can describe Dota 2 is that it's like chess and football, it's a game of momentum as well as timing and skill. Everyone needs Dota 2 in their life. Put it like this, I have 80+ games that I may as well uninstall because I only play this game. 10/10.

review: Dota 2 is the sequel to the popular Warcraft III mod known as Dota. It is very well crafted and improves the gameplay from orginal modification in the source engine. Gameplay mechanics are solid and is very difficult, it requires to be attentive at all times. Positioning is key throughout due to the very long stun times and high damage output by every hero at a certain point in the game. Dota 2's graphics are much improved from the original Warcraft III modification in the Warcraft engine respectivly and shows great colours and lighting on the map and characters. Unfortunatley due to it's difficult nature and very large learning curb and tends to push back a large amount of players. My recommendation is to start with a group of friends in bot matchs, and play every single hero at least once to figure out their abilities. Then play the game online where everyone is an idiot or russian. GLHF

review: The Warcraft III Mod that took the world by storm is now a stand alone game in F2p model with microtransactions and cosmetic items that allow for customization as well as a bustling digital market for trading currency. I can see this going the way of TF2 where it stays a relevant game for years to come. I bet Blizzard is kicking themselves over cause if they had picked this up before Valve did, they'd be making a whole lot more money. M.o.b.a. games are a trend these days and the original DotA was a game i really got into for years. I recently only started playing again and immediately i remembered how petty and elitist certain players are. Sometimes you don't even enjoy playing the game, sometimes you just play cause you wanna even up the losses from the last time you lost. This game makes you rage in ways you thought you never could. Ah but the feeling of crushing your enemies is a fair trade off, no? Good graphics, gameplay hasn't changed that much, events are pretty cool, marketable items are nice too. If they do promotional tie-ins with certain games like how TF2 did (for rare items. other than that genuine master thief set.) that'd certainly make it more interesting. Pudge with a super meat boy outfit or maybe Sniper with a tf2 sniper set. I give it an 8 out of 10. Play it if you don't mind getting flak from your teammates when you mess up one tiny bit. I'd play LoL but then its too cutesy for my taste. To each his own.

review: Steep learning curve, but once you invest the time to not suck then it is a pretty addictive and fun game. The teamwork aspect of it is what makes it and/or breaks it if you are unlucky to be paired with a feeding player. That said, if you can find a small core of people that you consistently play with then win or lose it is a pretty awesome game. Oh, and don't use Riki or Sniper unless you have to. Just trust me.

review: Dota 2 is a lot of fun if you meet the right team - too bad that doesn't happen very often. The community is more toxic than botulinum toxin. On the other hand, I've learned several Russian swear words since 70% of the community is Russian. Russian simulator 10/10

review: Would you like to play one of the most competitive, high skill capped games on steam? Here it is, you are gazing upon Dota2's famous legacy, down from my childhood Warcraft 3 days, where I'd be mid with some other guy not knowing what to do. To now my current self, playing on the competitive scene. This game is free, AMAZING! The community is by far better than most other known Mobas *points at League* It also has great micro-transactions incase you wanna make your favorite hero a total and utter badass with items, but wait. You don't need to buy the items, because in time you will get them! Sure it's all randomed and time is consuming but that's the joy of it, it's all just free. Great Game overall, I could spend countless hours on this thing, and many more! I'd give this a solid 9.2/10 Just because of how great it is

review: Game is awesome. Took me a little while to get in to it, because when you first start Dota seems complicated, confusing, and spontaneous. After a week or so of playing/trying to understand the game I understood it and tried to learn some of the basics so I could actually play. So try it, it will take you a while to get a hang of it but when you do this game will be so fun you need to play it every day for the rest of your life. I HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone! Try it out!

review: Not that hard of a game to play.Really the only hard parts about this game are the items and heros.You must at least be familiar with the 3 types of hero styles.As you progress through the game you will be familiar with the heros and even know which hero can counter others.On the other hand there are the items, now most heros are not as good without specific items ,others are already good without them.Although It does take time to learn the items and which hero there better off with, I still highly recommend this game.

review: Dota. I have played this game for a short while. I never played the original as I was staying in cell 6 of the Wakefield high security prison. However in Dota 3 I have experienced nothing but vile language and Russian profanities. This is painful, as when I was learning to play in a public match I was violently insulted for taking the wrong 'lane'. I mean obviously I went in the left lane, that's the correct driving lane here in England. I believe it is nothing but the simple minds of children that know nothing of the real life world. After I lost every game I have played, I realised that I had been reported a number of times. This was upsetting. I felt as if I had to return the prison I came from, hated by the community of players I put the game aside and played League of Legends instead. A community of 12 year olds is far more satisfactory that 40 year old Russians. At least I have a fighting chance, verbally... 10/10 million.

review: DotA 2. This is one of the MOST AMAZING games I have played in a very long time. It's a simple idea, a 5 vs 5 arena with the same map everytime, both teams trying to kill the others base. You fight as over 100 heroes, each with different roles. That's all it is. Team communication is VITAL, you can't win without coordinating and fighting as a team. Overall, it is definately a game for certain types of people. You need to be able to work and talk with your teamates, and be concentrated pretty much 100% of the time. Also, it's a lot more fun to play with people you know. Form up a group with four of your friends, and it will be much more fun. The games can take anywhere from 30-70 minutes, but most of the time game I play only take about 40-50 minutes. Lastly, don't jump right into matchmaking right away. You will probably get flamed and insulted and hurrased by your teamates if you don't do well. Play some bot matches first, learn what heroes you are good with. If people DO flame and insult you, take it with a grain of salt. Just don't yell back, that won't help anybody. It's a really fun game, and you should all try it out. Bonus: It's free, so you don't lose anything by playing a couple games, then learning you hate it. Chances are though, you will LOVE it!

review: This is a great game. I used to play the warcraft 3 user map settings version. It was addicting way back then, and it is still addicting now. I played league of legends before I played dota 2, and I admit i was a little scared of the transition from league to dota. But as I write this review now, I do not think I will ever play league of legends again. I will stick to playing dota2 from now until forever. Perhaps it's the nostalgia it gives me or perhaps it's fact that everyone is a  on league of legends. Eitherway, this is a great game to get into, especially if MOBAs are your type of game.

review: If you're fond of blaming others for everything or uncomfortable with acknowledging the fact that there will always be someone better than you out there, this is not the game for you. If you like a constant challenge and you're capable of continual improvement than it comes highly recommended. The game itself is crazy fun and varied, the map is ridiculously intricate, and it's all free-to-play without being pay-to-win! The matchmaking system on the other hand leaves a lot to be desired, ie. no region lock, solo-queue disadvantage, questionable balance methods, etc. The community really isn't as bad as everyone says, and the hero that you think is OP is not. There's always more to learn, and that's what keeps me coming back.

But I love it. I love coming back from piss &  circumstances and winning with 25 deaths and 2 kills.

The animation is perfect, the voices are pristine... however every game has its flaws. The community is horrible, there are numerous bugs and that's just grazing the surface. That being said, I never recommend this game to friends as once you pass that learning curve you won't be doing anything else once it latches on.

review: I was jungling chaos knight one afternoon, racking up the six figure kill spree when I had an epiphany. After about 3 matches you've seen it all- this is a painfully simple game that offers no challenge whatsoever. I have some suggestions to improve the gameplay at least twentyfold: 1. Introduce a loadout screen and killstreak perks, such as uavs and AC-130s, to reward hardcore junglers such as myself. 2. Have an in game marketplace, where in game gold can be purchased for bitcoins, at a ratio of 1:1. 3. Increase number of players per team to 16 for epic battles.

review: This is by FAR the greatest choice making RPG to date.There are over a hundred characters and each character has stunning storys that can change based on your choices. It seems every new game I start has diffrent NPC and voice lines that drive the story through the end. The ending is generally the same wether the Dark lord or light lord wins. This single player RPG allows building of the story through dicisions and item purcheses. Like recently I choose the Character Phantom Assassin and built the powerful mechinism that allowed me to heal my party members. The dialoge on this story line was great though the curse filter was removed as I heard lines from the ever changing juggernuat character such as " this noob feed loses the game" and "She took safe lane for a ing mech?". though there are still a few bugs such as the one that causes incorrect traslation of the NPCs lines, as in my PA storyline the Puck character was translated in spanish and my ally in arms Keeper Of The Light was incorrectly translated to Russian. Though sad I will miss their dialoge im sure there is much more to come, as I havent had the same dialoge yet in my 3000 hours of gameplay [10/10 would shoot myself.]

I had lost 5 games in a row, one of which was due to 1 second lag in the first 5 minutes of the game which corrected itself right after the point where I was too underfarmed to do anything anyway. Then, I played a game and I started winning. I worked well with my lane partner, I ganked the enemy safelane five times as Timbersaw before the 10 minute mark and got my bloodstone at 7 minutes. Then, during an exciting teamfight in which I was the #1 damage dealer and Ace on the team, the game crashed. The entire East Coast crashed. Because I was winning. Because I was having fun. Half of America's DotA servers blew up because I thought I could have fun.  you, DotA.

Upon selecting any of the US Servers you will promptly meet someone or a entire lobby of people who don't speak a lick of English. Better then any language learning program out there! The best part? It's free! You can also dress up your little people and make them move and talk while learning the language! Best interactive learning software I have found to date.

review: Its a wonderful yet brutal experience which leaves you with a strange love-hate feeling for it, like any worth while relationship does. For veterans from Warcraft 3 mod days will fell quite nostalgic and really appreciate the up scaling done to the game. Newcomers will still have a sense of how detailed the game is, both graphically and game mechanics wise. At its core it's an RPG through and through with leveling systems, items and fixed hero abilities. The community still needs to grow in terms of mannerism but anyone with thick skin can power through the nasties, which aren't that many anyway.

P.S- The game does have a tutorial to get you going but If your new to the MOBA scene take the time to learn, watch guides becuase this game has quite a steep learning curve and quite a big selection of items to buy (it can be overwhelming to the new player), i recommend playing a few bot games before jumping into a match against other players.

review: I want to introduce you to a game, Defense of the Ancients is its name. In this game, our chances are all the same So when you are good, it will bring you fame. But when you are bad, it will bring you ''flame in-game'' Since becoming a good player always be your aim. And the game starts for Radiant and Dire Ten heroes are picked from a pool of 107. Five heroes for each, all different styles From being Supportive, selfish to even vile. Unstoppable, wicked sick and beyond godlike, For a single purpose: to defend the ancients with all their might Many many more i'd like to say, But it will take too much time of my day. So i will stop and step out of your way, Cause you've known the basic, it's now your time to play...

review: It takes a while to get in to, but once you're in, you will never get out. A great game once you know the basics and has a huge range of what you can do to get better at in the game, it is very deep. The back stories of the hero's are very interesting and it is very good on the game mechanics side, and the story side. Some heros are however quite fustrating to play against, but it seems that Vale and the developers are still definitely updatimg the game and trying to make everything balanced. Also I have never tried Dota's competitor Leauge of Ledgends so I cannot say wether I think it is better.

review: Ok first off a sortof mixed review. I love and hate this game. I first started playing dota just after the international 2013. I moved into a house where the housemates were hell bent on this game and had friends over every day to play it. It was the 1st MOBA i had ever played, infact i had never even heard of the term MOBA before, (and for those who dont know it stands for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) First of all i was LUCKY i had friends who played this, and watched and got help from them as they played before even starting the game, as when landed into the thick of it, it is quite daunting. The tutorials are BLAH... until you actually get to the main gameplay tutorials, but no mention of custom build selection??? , this is another reason why some of my friends have just given up. From my experience, if you are a keen gamer STICK WITH IT. However if you value your life then give up now because it is very addictive, stressful and fun in the same sentence. DOTA is a very tactical game, which is extremely fun, overwhelmingly addictive too and by knowing the basic fundamentals and working as a team and not being arrogant or being able to take advice you can have a great game. You dont have to be an absolute strategist to win, although it does help The problem with this game is the community, and that is not the communitys problem, infact i blame the creators VALVE for not putting enough restrictions in place, and the restrictions they do put in place are ridiculous. First of all you have to have a half decent machine to play this on standard settings ( i sometimes even have problems on lowest settings on this machine and my machine lives up to their MINIUMUM SPECS. That saying that the game is quite playable for the most time on their minimum specs, but it seems bugs do keep popping up that they just wont sort out Also take the game as it is... free to play... and if anything happens just suck your gut in and relax. VALVE support absolutely sucks, so if anything goes wrong and you have any problems dont go running to valve for help because i have done this on more than 3 occasions, with a 2 day + response of just "sorry we cannot help you with this issue". And my last email getting the response "We will ignore any future emails about this issue from you" Back to the community... Dont take ranked too personally. DOTA is a TEAM game, however many times you will get landed with players who cannot play as a team, don't get the essence of DOTA in the same way you do, are absolutely rude and ignorant and arrogant. My advice after lots of headaches.... sod them, you are playing because you like to play, if you suck they dont help by screaming at you, and if you are dieing too often (and not intentionally feeding) then it is their fault for not working as a team and protecting you. Also matchmaking, you will find when you get into the game servers.... english speakers take off everything except us east, west and europe west and set language preference as english. This wont stop you being annoyingly teamed with people who dont speak english, but it sure helps... for some reason people dont understand communication is fundamental for a team game and selfishly pick servers where the know they will be teamed up with people who dont speak their languages. YES I AM SPEAKING TO ALL YOU RUSSIANS WHO SELECT EVERYTHING OTHER THAN RUSSIA. Other problems are that with the report system or restrictions. Now people with low end computer who get annoying bugs ingame which randomly kick them off suffer most. However it goes for everyone on the report system. I rarely use it anymore because it does jack  unless you are with a group of people you know will report the same person for the same actions. You get 3 a week no matter how much you play, which is dreadful, and you only get a report back if action is taken against someone, which seems to me it doesnt matter what they have done, if noone else reports it there is no check and they get away scott free. Unfortunately if you are in a game and the rest of your team is a party, and they dont like you for some reason... excpect a 6 game ban in low priority. Also a new bug bear that has come out is this "Failed to load" Scenario.. My games usualy load up, with some slow lagging problems at the start but manage to settle itself out. When the games didnt load it was a pain in the  and you may have to search another 3 - 10 mins for a game, but that was an annoyance i could live with. Now on the odd occasion i fail to load i get penalised for half an hour from finding ANY game, except ones with bots, remember failing to load does not effect the game as the game hasnt currently started, and it is annoying but getting a ban from finding a match for 30 mins (i even got an hour at one instance) is ridiculous, taking in account that a game lasts between 30 and 60 mins on average. that means sometimes when you only have a set ammount of time to play you are screwed. Other bugs ive experiences are random spikes in loading (it will flick on and off the shop/skill attributes at the start of the game randomly and sometimes even boot you off) and the courier button just dissapearing... sometimes the whole thing, sometimes just the flying bit.. this usually comes back if you reload but not always, and sinc most people dont have the decency to pause the game it screws you up rotten. Other than that this game is the most fun game i've ever played, and so rewarding so no matter how crap valve are, or no matter how annoying the game can be at times, i alway come back for more. Even if it means playing out my low priority ban matches with complete s

review: Never before have I had such a profound hatred for other human beings. You can't leave. I've tried, and will most likely try again soon. Mostly what this game has taught me is this- I am a racist bigot. Everyone I know is a racist bigot. Even the peruvians and russians are racist bigots. Everyone is stupid. Teamwork, like sleep, is a false promise. Don't queue in groups of people less than 5 Never go alone. Seriously it's that important. You will not have fun. Angsty narcissistic 10 year olds exist everywhere. Everyone is a noob. Even you. Don't delude yourself. Search your feelings, you know it to be true. Run.

review: Heard of Dota 2 all my life from friends around me.....and now I see why xD Its.. 1) Addictive 2) Fun 3) Competitive 4) Challenging 5) Teaches something that's not only important 'in game' but also in the real life which is TEAMWORK! 6) This point may sound awkward/weird to people to be a PROS instead of a CONS...but! its the 'LEARNING CURVE'. Wut!? how is this PROS instead of CONS you say!? Let me explain... Every game you play you either win or lose. Now not all games are meant to be won ;) Cause its when you lose you learn something and even when you think you havn't learnt a thing from a game of loss? You just did. You learn't that you did something wrong to have achived that loss and should try to improve in that missing element. Knowing the fact that no ones perfect. This is what makes Dota 2 fun and keeps you playing over and over, day after day so its hard to get even close to 1% of being bored. Plus in top of that there are 100+ Heroes, that makes getting bored of this game dead impossible :') and that gives us point #1 ;) So I recommend everyone to play this game, even if you're a cat...... cause cats are awesome.......so is Dota 2 ;) Happy Gaming! -Arafat / TRAPWOLF

review: Though DotA 2 is not beginner/noob friendly at all everyone is able to play it. There is nothing much to say about why you should try it or not, but the sheer number of players and year-thousands of cumulative playing time spent on this game should make you giving this a try. Be aware that the learning curve however is exponential. This means that you will most likely be bashed down by the complex mechanics of this game for like the first 300 hours, depending on how eager you try and how naturally skilled you are. After you are in it and got some friends to play, you will be able to have a thousand (or more thousands) of hours of gaming time in which there is variety and fun. Also, for the big and free game like this is you have to expect by a 50/50 chance to find games with 'bad communication', meaning that either your teammates or the enemies are not friendly/helping etc. You just have to deal with it. But on the other hand you will get to learn some russian, french, spanish, korean etc. curses you did not knew before. Also this is F2P, but there are only smaller cosmetic items. Nothing involving the gameplay. Just for your information: If you played LoL or HoN before you will not have an easy going here as this game takes the genre some steps higher.

review: Dota 2 is a fast-paced first person shooter with some RPG elements mixed in. In all my years of playing indie games, I have never seen a better real time strategy game. For a space travel simulator, its lacking in rocketships, but overall, it is one of the greatest zombie survival game on the market. If you could possibly desire a better game, then you should think about purchasing Drake of the 99 Dragons. Both it and Dota 2 share many similarites.

The Best MOBA I have seen and played besides maybe Smite, I would recommend this to anyone with a good group of friends who like to have fun and play Video games like it.

The only hope for a goodgame is now only in the ranked playlist, and even there you'll get your trolls from time to time. If you're going to play, bring some friends to have a team, or dont even bother at all. It used to be fun and you could search an all pick and actually encounter people who want to win and play but now it seems that all the CoD casuals have drifted over to DOTA 2.

review: I love the game! It really gets addicting, which explains my playtime, lol. You might not like it at first, but I bet it will really turn into your close-to-everyday hobby after a while, once you have gotten the hang of it. It has a huge variety of heroes to choose from, enjoy, experiment, and master. Though there are still a few missing heroes from the original Defense of the Ancients, like Arc Warden, Winter Wyvern, and Abyssal Underlord, the constant updates on the game which balances heroes, and adds more content will still make you have fun and be strategic on the game. Hero sets, and other custom items like HUDs, Loading Screens, etc. are present in the game. Hero sets are a handful of items which customizes the whole hero. From head to toe. And I guess I don't have to explain the custom HUDs and stuff, right? There are a few yearly events to look upon on as well. Like New Bloom (Chinese New Year), Diretide (Halloween), Frostivus (Christmas), some random events like the recent Foreseer's Contract event which gives you and possibly quite a few more that I have missed since I have not played the game for long. Each of the first three events offers a new map as well as new content, as I have mentioned earlier. Map changes may also vary on future game updates. But like all other games, there are flaws, the #1 flaw would be the really bad community. Only rarely you see friendly, good players who will actually help newbies learn. Most people in the game are rather stupid in the sense that they insult people who are new to the game, blames others for their own mistakes, and those who trashtalks for no reason. There are players which does not know how to wait for someone too, causing them to receive an abandon and gets them into the low prioprity punishment pool. Gets really really annoying. No justice done, really. There are some people who ruins games too, which can be explained in one word - "troll". They feed the enemy team intentionally. Worst part is that, reporting them never does anything. The reports need better management. No, Valve, the low priority pool isn't that good of a punishment either. Some players just report other users with no apparent reason, and I think causing them an LP would not do any justice. At least examine the reports before taking action? Another thing is the servers. Some users has gotten problems where the server would just kick them out for no reason which yet again causes them an abandon. There are instances where the servers would actually crash due to an update during a really good game. Really. Happened to me once, was not happy. Especially when the game is already over an hour long and you were winning a hardly fought match. Seriously. This is just based on my own experiences and my opinion, you might disagree on some stuff I have uttered, but overall I like this game. It gets even better when you get to know the right people, and I think I'll give it an 8/10. I have met a lot of really good friends from this game, I hope you try it out and find your own. Have fun!

review: Dota 2, arguably the steepest learning curve strategy game you will ever play, yet none more rewarding. A highly competitive game that is now played by millions (for millions, TI4 winners took ~5million USD), that is hugely satisfying. Pros: * Variety in hero builds and teams * High replay ability * Real-time mixture of RTS and MOBA elements Cons: * Brutal learning curve and impossible to master * Demanding community and poor tolerance thresholds * Huge, huge, huge, occupier of your time! (Some games last more than 60 minutes) Otherwise, what are you waiting for... At 805 hours total, I am beginner/intermediate level, and have no plans on stopping now...

review: If you have a penchant for feeling completely let down by your team-mates. If you want to see team mates ignoring the objective and dying under towers in places they should never have been after fighting hard for nearly an hour and seeing defeat snatched from the jaws of victory, this IS the game for you. No , it really is. Do you have an unyielding sense that the participation aspect of team mates in communicating effectively to engeander positive co-operation in fulfilling victory after victory in both the battles of defending and attacking, and the war as a whole is absolutely necessary?.. Then providing you have the ability to speak russian, spanish, and portuguese and understand that even though you have chosen to play on an english speaking server, you are likely going to be in the minority and everything that goes wrong is going to be your fault , waste no time, install this game and jump in, the incredibly forgiving and supportive community is waiting to help teach you how to play. You to will soon have 6.5k mmr and can hang out in the reddit chat with the rest of the 1337 dotoists. And just remember this one thing and you will never go wrong. If someone has a lower mmr than you, no matter what the issue is, they are always wrong. welcome and glhf.

review: This game is good, that's all I have to say. If you think you're good at it, chances are you're a noob, anyone can be a noob, everyone is a noob, even pro players are noobs. It is a very fair game, at the same time you will be left gobsmacked at how unfair and flawed something in this game can be. I recommend this game because it has earned my 2 cents... Or should I say 400 hours at the time I write this review, I have fed the community market a small (ok maybe medium) sized amount of money over my career to make my little characters look as pretty as I can and that's only a small (ok maybe completely full) aspect of the game to many (Oh yeah I should also mention don't buy Arcanas, they are expensive, like really expensive... Or legendaries, they're not as expensive, but they still are and you know they are.) Short story short, download this game, install this game, play some easy bots matches, play some medium bots matches, play a couple of pubs when you feel confident, get your  kicked and trudge back in there to beat up their asses, so you can feel proud, and move up to the next scrub-tier! But don't forget, have fun! (And give Gaben all your cash monies)

review: Dota 2 is one of the best games out there. It is a massive rage factory, and you will hear insults come out of your mouth that you didn't even think you knew. You can play powerful heroes, like a succubus with a pain fetish, or a massive red man who loves to splatter people into numbers. Also, the learning curve is best described as a learning cliff. But whatever i tell you doesn't matter, because you people read the reviews for comedy, rather than purchasing information.

review: A solid Multiplayer-Online Battle-Arena game... What is a MOBA? a Moba is probably a game where by fundamentals everything is first set in total equilibrium... and players actions, skills, teamwork and effort is what makes the difference for one team to finally win over another. With over 100 different heroes to choose from, all absolutely free, no need to unlock and no need to buy anything.... On top of the "seemingly" repetitive one map and mode there's actually different events with a very distinct gameplay and features.. ranging from Team versus Team like Diretide and even Co-oP like the Wraith Night. The game's business model is the way I see it, most user-friendly... Everything you want unlocked is unlocked... Everything that u can buy is purely eye-candy and visual effects and models... But at the same time, one courier... one announcer... one "set" on your favorite hero is enough to make the game experience just SO MUCH more! Be Vary though.... Amongst the player base lurk some really irrittating and annoying children from all across the globe, who's primary aim and goal ( in game and in life ) is to just annoy people and piss them off for their own pleasure. Steer clear of falling into arguments with them that cost you the whole game and some nerve cells... There's the report abuse button and let the MODs do the rest!

review: Its a wonderful yet brutal experience which leaves you with a strange love-hate feeling for it, like any worth while relationship does. For veterans from Warcraft 3 mod days will fell quite nostalgic and really appreciate the up scaling done to the game. Newcomers will still have a sense of how detailed the game is, both graphically and game mechanics wise. At its core it's an RPG through and through with leveling systems, items and fixed hero abilities. The community still needs to grow in terms of mannerism but anyone with thick skin can power through the nasties, which aren't that many anyway.

review: Dota 2 (Defence of the Ancients) is an online Battle Arena video game, it requires strategy, concentration and determination for the whole team to win a game. The only problem is it relies WAY too much on your teamwork. To win a game you have to destroy the opponents Ancient after you level up and become powerful. Killing the enemy heroes levels you up faster and gives you more gold than the creeps. Because of the teamwork thing I would rate it 9/10, but yes I seriously recommend this game to everyone because it is addictive and really fun.

review: When I started with such types of games.. Shifting form First Person Shooter. I was confused. And I did not know if League of Legends or Dota 2 is better. So I downloaded Both. Starting from Dota 2. I played. It was complicated. But the games I found fast. And the Understanding of the game.. It made sense. After playing about 100 hours. I decided to Give a try to League of Legends.. hearing that It is one of the top ones. I expected it to be better.. But frankly.. I was horrified by LOL's quality.. The gaming is very arcadish.. U get defensive upgrades at the cost of boots yes.. that cheap. Anyone can hide anyone can get back to town withouth scroll.. it was.. senseless to me.. I never the less gave it a go.. played league of legends for 30 hours. The waiting for games were long. choosing for sides was irritating. So then I Removed LOL and havn't looked away from Dota 2 ever since. Oh the game.. The lust for getting those kills.. One map.. Infinite possibilities.. I specially enjoy the Ability Draft.. Makes the game even more enjoyable as u may make a new hero all together.. The Community is friendly.. and The best part about Dota 2 is.. It makes sense. A lot of sense. And the Physics ingame are very much realistic. The Dev's Have done some amazing Job in the game. And I thank them for their constant efforts. :) So after such a ... strange review.. my point being is.. It's an amazing game. And hence Must for everyone to try it. :) U'll be hooked, M sure of it. :D

Honestly within 10 hours of gametime, I was a natural speaker in Russian a language of which I had never had prior knowledge to before. This game is great for racism as you learn to hate the Russian people despite how much they love or hate gays. It's a great team building exercise as you learn to love those that you do not know despite how well they're playing, because after all God taught us to love each other. Apart from Russian;  the Russians. Overall;   ,            ,     ;              .

review: The latest in rage simulation technology. Dota 2 is supposed to be a team game but plays like call of duty where your team is full of little kids, non-english speaking players and people who play like they are using a trackpad. What is supposed to be a objective based game turns into a team deathmatch if you get matched with russians. Valve constantly releases patches to try and balance the handicap that peruvians give you but its not working, what seems like a 5v5 match in reality is a 8v2 or 9v1. I do not recommend this game unless you like getting angry at yourself for not being able to win a 9v1

review: Though DotA 2 is not beginner/noob friendly at all everyone is able to play it. There is nothing much to say about why you should try it or not, but the sheer number of players and year-thousands of cumulative playing time spent on this game should make you giving this a try. Be aware that the learning curve however is exponential. This means that you will most likely be bashed down by the complex mechanics of this game for like the first 300 hours, depending on how eager you try and how naturally skilled you are. After you are in it and got some friends to play, you will be able to have a thousand (or more thousands) of hours of gaming time in which there is variety and fun. Also, for the big and free game like this is you have to expect by a 50/50 chance to find games with 'bad communication', meaning that either your teammates or the enemies are not friendly/helping etc. You just have to deal with it. But on the other hand you will get to learn some russian, french, spanish, korean etc. curses you did not knew before. Also this is F2P, but there are only smaller cosmetic items. Nothing involving the gameplay. Just for your information: If you played LoL or HoN before you will not have an easy going here as this game takes the genre some steps higher.

review: Dota 2 is a fast-paced first person shooter with some RPG elements mixed in. In all my years of playing indie games, I have never seen a better real time strategy game. For a space travel simulator, its lacking in rocketships, but overall, it is one of the greatest zombie survival game on the market. If you could possibly desire a better game, then you should think about purchasing Drake of the 99 Dragons. Both it and Dota 2 share many similarites.

review: A fantastic multiplayer experience. This game is deeply complex with it's metagame and many strategies a team can employ. The community is not as toxic as many say it is. Yes there are the few rude, obnoxious, and annoying players but that is true for all multiplayer games. There are many ways to play such as the carry, support, nuker, initiator, and jungler. These roles all have their place in this game and there is something for everyone. Pros: - complex but easy to get into - many ways to play - relies on teamwork - great esport community - 100% free - nice aesthetic - many heroes to choose from - great ui - very rare glitches - dota tv - metagame Cons - a little difficult to get into - players not playing on thier region's server - first few hours are not very fun - occasionally takes a while to join a game

review: Dota 2 is a game I've been playing for about a year or so now, and I don't think I've ever been so addicted to a game before. It's a game with teamwork, strategy and beautiful visuals. The hero pool has a huge variety of different looks, skills and basic stats. The game modes for the online mode are also cool, but I wish some people who play captains mode will actually listen to their teammates instead of just picking wherever they want to. Overall this game is really fun to play and it's free! I would definately recommend this game to people who have a semi-long attention span and a quick reaction time.

review: Really great game. Introduced me to MOBA's. Very addictive and a friendly and helpful community. Little confusing at first but fun once you get used to it. Fascinating graphics and crisp sounds. Gameplay can feel repetitive but there's always an element of suspense. Each player hero is unique and powerful and the user interface of the game is easy to understand. Does not constantly bug you for micro-transactions which is great. Only problem is that finding a match, even on my closest servers takes quite some time (3-4 mins.) Loving the game otherwise. 9/10 - The Best MOBA

How about having thousands of hours on record, and still being a miserable scrub-feeding noob? Well then, Dota is for you! It will frustrate you, take all your time, make you feel worthless and have you come back for more!

review: DotA 2 is your ordinary high school classroom. It has affluent kids who have all the latest hats thinking that pre-cal subjects can be passed with these. Most of the time, they only want to show-off and has no real understanding of the subject. It has absurdly-gifted students (those with high match ratings) who turn into snobs when forced to work with members 'inferior' to them. Little did they know that it is they who serve as role models to their less intelligent mates. A class clown happens to be in the same subject some of the time. These people are so funny that you wish they do not get grouped with you. Air heads who do things repetitively and who seem not to get on the team's conversations. Farm - get killed - respawn (rinse and repeat). Then, the average reasonable dudes. Some of them think too highly of themselves while others have the potential of being your friends. Did i mention ladies? They are not myths. They exist; however, they are as rare as women in engineering classes. If you survived high school, this game is for you. P.S. Ironically, the average age for people playing this game is less than seven. 10/10

review: If you wish to learn russian quickly, turn to no other programme than Dota 2. Unintentionally valve have came up with a brilliant tool to comprehend the angry sort of russian language for example ''. Before trying a michael thomas or rossetta stone course consider dota for your soviet language learning experience. 'Thanks, and have fun' ~Gabe Newell Now to be serious... Dota is extremely difficult to get your head around. To start, if you are new to moba's, you will be lost and somewhat overwhelmed by the gameplay. But as you advance in skill level and playing against rivals similar levels to you, you then realise how fun the game is. You will get raged at and you will fail, but that is whole point of improving. Dota is brilliant.

review: Dota 2 Is literally one of the best games I have ever played! I give the game 8/10 because It can be really hard at the beginning If you dont have anyone telling you how to play it. Dota 2 has about the same type of game as League of Legends, but I like Dota 2 much better because its more real-life. LoL (League of Legends) Is almost the same just with comic book look alike textures and more champions.. If you dont agree with me, then thumbs down. Your choice! If you want to play a mmo/rpg game, that has AWESOME and AMAZING textures you should definately download this game right now! Be sure to thumbs up if you agree or this made you wanna play it!

review: Dota is strategy game where 10 players pick a hero and fight. Fight to win and make other 9 players lose. Ironically there are only two sides of conflict, but you will have to mange- it's all out war there and war don't take prisioners. At the end of day, after games full of hate, rage, feed, brain scarcity, RUSSIA SUPREMACY, birth defects and your own shortcomings, you will notice no one is a winner and text at the end of the game "RADIANT/DIRE VICTORY" give you only as much as few points of MMR, a hollow rating feeding only your ego. For that Dota2 would be perfect for any anti-war commercials, pointing at the end that "In war, there is no winner". But for nolives like us it doesn't matter, all we need is our own ego and MMR so we fight, fight those other 9 players and hope, hope we will see that side we are with wins, hope that our MMR will reach as high as our ego, hope that other 9 players will die from cancer or other painfull diseases.

review: Much better then League of Legends. This is coming from someone who played LoL since beta up until 6 months ago. Dota 2 shines above other games in the genre for these reasons; 1. Hero versatility 2. Learning curve is steeper but more rewarding 3. Games snowball less, but if they do its for the RIGHT reasons. 4. Games are less likely to be decided early therefore there is always plenty of time for a comeback. Overall, the game is much more rewarding for someone who is starting out in this genre, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

review: this EN GAME! Reasons dota sucks. 1. Dota is filled with some of the worst scum sucking pigs that have ever walked planet earth 2. Dota is so unbalanced, it has tipped the very universe upside down creating chaos and the Ebola virus to spread to the states via illegal russian imigrants 3. Dota grabs you where it hurts and makes u squeal while relentlessly calling you a "" while listing off the different ways he ed your mother. 4. Dota doesen't sleep, Dota stays up till late into the night while whispering into your mother en ear "One more game, just one more, i know you lost those last eleven, but one more will make it all better" 5. Dota doesen't forget..... Remember when you first started playing dota? U found a hero that was fun and easy like Sniper or Drow and u played the hell out of that hero till it made its way to your most successful heros list? Yeah? Well  you! Dota takes that hero and slams it in your face FOR A GOD DAMN YEAR! SO NOW AFTER U LEARN OTHER HEROS AND U SEE THAT SACK OF  U ONCE HAD FUN PLAYING, U LOOK IN THE MIRROR IN DISGUST AND JUST THINK "WOW IM A USELESS PIECE OF  SNIPER PLAYER" 6. Dota hates u and everyone around you 7.Dota laughs at your pain. 8. Dota makes you hate the ones u love most. 9. Dota spelled backwards is Atod, thats not even a word, Dota doesn't know english 10. Dota is fun. 1 Comments

review: As much as I only have 20 hours on this game, There isnt much to talk about. The game is addicting as  and can ruin your life if you dont control it. Its the same game over and over again. Two sides, the same map, same defences and ancients. The sounds, graphics, and game play is just awsome. However, I do find the community to suck alot. I do not have a problem with the Russians but my problem is most of the people who do speak English are the most whiny  people and report if you dont do as they say. Then theres the unfair system of the penalty pool. The fact that one can get reported with no evidence and suffer longer waiting times and ier . In conclusion, I recomend people to play this game with a group of friends, maybe time to time random servers but be careful that this game wont ruin your life.

review: An Educational game that teaches and develops the required skills that was needed during much earlier times. Based on true historical facts Dota 2 has given the player unique heroes throughout history so that the player is able to get an understanding of life in the early 1900's. Dota 2 also allows player to see the true horrors of war and allows them to get deep into the bloodshed so that they are able to learn about the true terrors when facing war, it also helps the player develop their own strategies when in combat so that when the day comes they are battle ready and won't go down without a fight. Not only is Dota 2 a historical game about combat but it also shows an indepth field of dedication. This allows the player to not just learn about dedication whilst seeing their characters dedicated to their job so much so that they will kill themselves many times for a kill, but also the player may also himself use his new skill of dedication upon the game itself. After many years of dedication he may enter tournaments within the game and develop new skills like; Teamwork, Compassion, Bravery and even Empathy. So not only is Dota 2 a historical game but it teaches the player unique skills for living day by day. This is trully a master game and it cannot be compared against any other games of its Genre. #Dota2 #History #LifeSkills #10/10

review: Dota 2 is a very intensive video game that is just as good as League of Legends, although it is somewhat lacking in it's misogynistic protrayal of women, where all the female heroes are highly sexualized and often oppressed by the patriarchal standards of the game. There is only one strong female character (both metaphorically and literally), named "Legion Commander", and even she is highly sexualized and often the target of pornographic parodies. Although they are perfectly equal in the terms of gameplay, Valve has quite a ways to go before they reach the same plethora of well-characterized and non-sexualized female characters as Riot Games managed to do in League of Legends. Therefore, although the game is reasonably fun, I cannot honestly recommend it to any mature gamers out there.

review: i hate this game like seriously i hate all of this like i have learned to hate things i cannot understand, peoples i have never met, and emotions ive never know to feel before i playd this game. its like learning just to fail. it tests the limits of humanity in a philosphical way that degrades the mind, and stamps on the soul. why did i ever play this? why did i particpate and ignore the warnings of others and sink all this time into this madness? This game is like your crush continuosly telling you she doesnt like you and slowly pushing you out of his or her life. This review says i have around 400 hours of gameplay. But you dont understand, every one hour of stress is about 5 more hours and self hate, loathing, and mass sprits of depression man this stinks

review: Graphics: + detailed heroes + nice animation and effects + living setting - blured textures Balance: + very good hero balance + video tutorials for beginners + train with KI - very hard for beginners Game Size: + currently 108 heroes + over 120 items + many tactics - only 1 map Sound: + diverse hero sounds + nice music + nice battle sounds + 7.1 surround Language: + learn easy different languages (russian, spain etc.) :) Welcome to Dota 2! They say, before concluding with, You suck. They're not wrong: for the first dozen hours or so, you'll be bombarded with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. But if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. A fantastic free-to-play model. Dota 2 has become notorious even among its MOBA peers for its difficulty  and thats totally justified. Its a double-edged sword that leads to both a terrifying introduction and a world-class game at the highest levels. You should not expect to have fun your first day playing... or even your first week, maybe months. Dota 2 is a deeply layered construct of systems, and to survive you need to understand every single one and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and gold theyd get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of abilities like Bloodseekers Rupture (which deals huge damage with every step you take) is a big barrier to entry. Even figuring out which of the 108 heroes fits you best is a time-consuming challenge. Your learning has just begun when you've settled on what roles, heroes, and builds suit you best  you also have to adapt based on what other players choose. If the other team plays a Riki, you need to compensate with an emphasis on detection. Go up against Bloodseeker and his hideously powerful Rupture will force you to carry around a Town Portal Scroll to get home. Shop System: Only cosmetic enhancements, almost all of which are created by the community. Tournament goodies (such as tickets for viewing live events) are for sale. Theres not a single paid on the in-game balance, and thats great! In short words: Dota 2 pits two teams of five players against each other. mix of strategy and RPG, skill management and tactical gameplay. 108 heroes, each with their own style and combat abilities. most heroes have 4 skills that can be increased in power by levelling up by killing enemys. there are over 120 items to choose from within each game, each with their own ways to power up your stats and active abilities. creeps that charge down the game's three lanes, and the player controlled heroes on the opposite team. Theres a huge time investment before you can enjoy a game. it creates a playing field where skill and teamplay is top priority. the best DotA game. many heroes, items and a great balance. Thanks for reading! If you Like my Review, give me a Thumbs up in Steam (not the youtube video). I make this for the Community and your help is greatly appreciated :)

review: A game with an amazing community which never fails to blame everybody else when they make mistakes. Dota teaches a variety of different languages including the infamous Russian, which teaches players to despise anybody who does not speak English as their first language. As well as being multicultural, the dota 2 matchmaking is just phenomenal. It always ensures you are put with first class Russian feeders, which really improves the gameplay as it allows you to be unable to play a game of dota without experiencing the variety of different 'styles of play' that this game offers to the community. As a whole this game encourages suicidal thoughts, rage and possible brain hemorrhages and/or heart attacks. 10/10 would uninstal, then reinstal. 11 vodkas  cyka blyat mid or fid

review: Community with toxicity levels rivaling the other horrible competitive games out there. Avoid it unless your Warcraft 3 nostalgia is a large as your tolerance for Humanity's pettiest of creatures. Nice people do play the game, but they are overshadowed by the far-larger "variety of unmedicated disorders" that plague the gamer community as a whole. What's worse is Valve has three cash cow micropayment fests now, and they don't look to be dissuaded from that. They've hidden it so well since they're price-tagging "holier than thou satisfaction" (percieved social status through cosmetics) rather than skill-removing or advantage giving items. it's holding art assets to ransom instead of code. I don't want to have to pay USD$2.49 to unlock the orange HEV suit skin or "classic" crowbar reskin some day.

review: It's a good game and all. but it has so many flaws. first off, the pros. The game is getting massive content every now and so and it feels fresh, the map is fantastic and simple to learn. same with the heroes too and the community made content is fantastic! but the cons.. where do I begin? now, I love this game and everything... but the community is just what ruins it. I've been into games and I have over 800 hours plus and still being called an noob and everything and blames me. there is some situations that I couldn't do anything and my friend keeps trying to help, and no one else trys to come to the lane. and i'm the one getting blamed. also, the game seriously need either: more servers, or region locks. because I am sick and tired of being matched with peruvians, portugese, russians, etc. and not to mention, if you're in a parties. more chances you're gonna find some stupid clan team that does nothing but just does stun stacks while we just wanna have fun. the worse of all, is the people who always spam "UMADBRO?" and take insults from . but seriously, it's impossible to not be frustrated in a video game, espacilly dota... seriously. it's just sad that these kind of communities just ruin a game, and I can no longer have fun. To me, the game is just not fun anymore. some heroes are broken as hell, heck valve tried to nerf riki... but they just buffed him more instead. well gg.

review: I have played a game that has similarities to this one. It is called League of Legends. I can tell you this: "If you are one of those sub-humans that think L.O.L. is a decent game, I feel for you. I pray to valve gods that RIOT sinks into the sea, and you all are saved from the horrors that lie deep within the L.O.L." George to the Apostles 2:16 DOTA is the game to go with. If you are a male in your 30s and you love to hit it off with actual humans then play DOTA, but I suggest being part of the PC master race before playing. If one plays on a Mac, You will find it hard to be liked. People will ask "why you are playing on a toaster?", or "What is this 'Mac' you speak of?" On the third day Gaben had cometh and said to all the sub-humans in conjuction to himself, "Illumanati...I belive that is how you spell it...Wait I mean the 'Orange box 2.0' will include HL3, LSD, Cocaine and Cocaine accesories." GABEN- Illumanati 2019 Pretty much, DOTA 2 is good. Unless you are a dingo baby-eating, coco puff-sniffing turtle soup . -A loyal RITO Consumer

review: I used to play this game in order to clear my mind and relax from playing League of Legends but now it's exactly the opposite. Very addictive game, loads of fun, coming from someone with a fair amount of experience in MOBAs. Loads of heroes to choose from (all free to use with purchasable skins), tons of items and possible item builds, some nice workshop content and a lot of support from the community. Community overall is not perfect but you will never find a "perfect" gaming community. I recommend this game to people who enjoy playing battle arena games and remember: you're playing for fun, not to win.

This game sucks because you automatically get every champion and they are all confusing other than sniper which has to be the most skilled champion in this copy cat of a game.

The graphics are good, the game mechanics are fun and varied, the enviroment and map seems to be quite detailed too, I may not play it too much, but that doesn't means I think that indeed this game is one of the best; if not the best game out there of the MOBA genre.

League of Legends offers you better artwork than better graphics, with a paid roster of over-designed heroes that makes it look like an all-star fighter game, also with more sellout boobs and more fan-made porn Dota 2 offers you height vision, unforgiving death penalties, buyback, fortification, day/night cycle that affects gameplay, all chat, a state of the art replay system, over a 100+ items with various active effects and more! League of Legends offers you... nothing? yes. "League of Legends is more popular than Dota 2" is what you're gonna say? Does it make it the best game? no. Because if i followed your logic, then Candy Crush Saga & Flappy Bird are the best games ever! or Call of Duty is better than Battlefield? Rust is better than DayZ? Counter-Strike is better than Insurgency? Team Fortress 2 is better than.. oh  this one anyways, its a breeding ground for casuals who cant handle frustration and competitiveness in videogames. Anyways... Pick your poison, DotA or LoL?

review: My first MOBA game. Very difficult, and very competitive. Easily the worst part of this game is the community. However, your performance does impact your team's performance, so be sure to watch some videos, play some bot games, and ask some questions before you play matchmaking, or you will definitely jarate off your entire team. There's a very nice hero selection, so you have a lot of choices. It now just needs more maps ;) (I'm no map purist)

review: Strangely addictive after you've figure out one hero. Alternatively frustrating and exhilirating. Interesting events. Nice when you have a team or bunch of friends but also good to play solo. Love the hero items and effects. Agonizing to play when the internet connection is bad or when you have abusive teammates. Every game, even played with the same people, is different. Infinite combinations of heroes, items, usage and player skills. Takes some time to get the hang of any hero at first but some help always... helps... hahaha... =) Enjoy!!

review: Dota 2, sebuah game yang menuntut pemahaman yang lebih dari seorang gamer yang ingin mahir bermain Dota. 800 jam saya bermain bahkan saya belum berani berkata bahwa saya sudah mahir bermain Dota. Dota 2 adalah game bergenre RTS, dimana didalamnya pemain akan bertanding 5vs5 dalam sebuah map dengan 3 line yang akan digunakan untuk lining (istilah untuk farming exp dan gold) dengan tujuan akhir menghancurkan ancient lawan. Tiap pemain akan memainkan sebuah hero, yang hero-heronya itu memiliki role dan peran masing-masing demi mendukung kemenangan tim. Untuk memulai belajar bermain, saya sarankan menonton tutorial di Youtube akun DotaCinema :) Dota 2 menurut saya sudah sangat baik dalam hal gaming experience, akan tetapi masih kurang dari segi cash in game yang berguna untuk kosmetik hero yang digunakan. Pengembang Dota 2 seolah tidak berusaha untuk mengendalikan pasar item yang harganya sangat-sangat mahal. Hal ini disatu sisi memang menunjukkan bahwa Dota 2 memiliki pemain yang serius dan berdedikasi untuk game, tapi di sisi lain cenderung tidak ramah kepada pemula-pemula yang ada. Tapi hal ini bukan masalah yang serius, karena banyak orang yang menikmati permainannya tanpa memikirkan itemnya. Sebagai game yang memiliki pemain aktif terbanyak di Steam, anda harus mencobanya!

review: I hate competitive games. Especially moba's and starcraft. This one however managed to suck me in with "vs bots" game mode and cosmetic items store. I'm still not sure how or why it happened but i do enjoy playing Dota and sometimes i even play vs people, even though it makes me want to cry or yell in rage. There are few major issues with Dota 2 at the moment: 1) Absence of communication between developers and players. Dev forums seem to exist only for players, since thousands of bugs (especially cosmetic ones) and suggestions simply remain ignored. 2) Infrequent content updates and lack of features. They could've at least allowed us to play game modes from different events to diversify gameplay or added new maps, instead they keep focusing on adding new cosmetic items. 9 out of 10 updates only include "hats". Game folder keeps growing but nothing changes gameplay-wise. They even stopped adding new bots to my favourite game mode. 3) Constant server side issues which they can't fix. There are issues with downloading replays, reconnecting to games, watching matches, searching for games and even finishing matches without somebody getting crashes or disconnects. 4) A lot of racism, swearing and general anger towards other players. Especially Russians. Report system is completely inadequate and doesn't help at all. I would recommend Dota 2 because its cute and well-thought game, with amazing voice-overs and excellent replayability. I do advise however against spending money in their store since once your start you cannot stop. This is probably how drug addiction works - they pull you in with free stuff and then you just want to complete a set, buy new items because of the modified effects, gamble for a chance to get some common item which would later cost hundreds of dollars (valve deliberately removes some items to drive up prices), find some unusual courier which could easily compensate all of your spendings... or plunge yourself into poverty if you get unlucky with chests.

review: Great game, really enjoyable. The character selection is fantastic. They still add in new heroes from time to time to keep it lively. They keep it updated to keep it lively as well. Great selection of community made skins, weapons, etc. alongside a fun selection of voiceovers that you can choose as the announcer. If you don't like buying DLC or add-on content, they allow it to be shared in games so it eleminates the hassle of never being able to see it in action and, for me, eleminates me having to ever buy the content =-). It's one of the top MOBA's out there. Only drawback would be the community that encompasses it. Sometimes it's not so bad depending on the group you get matched with. Obviously, the way to get around this problem is to play with a bunch of friends you know so you won't ever get "grouped" up with others. Nevertheless, the learning curve on the game can be harsh, as can the general rules of the game. I prefer the fact that it is punishing if you get killed frequently/on a regular basis.

review: Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena game from Valve. Dota 2 is the next installment from the previous game or mods Dota. Dota 2 has the same gameplay as Dota. You pick your heroes, and then battle them in one map against another player. In the arena, as you kill and progress you will get coins and the use them to buy items to enhance your heroes on your current battle in the arena. You need to pick the right items each time you play as it will decide you will win the game or not. Dota 2 introduce item drops each time you finish a match online. There are many items in Dota 2 that can enhance your favourite heroes looks. Each item has rarity, the more rare the items, the more expensive it will become. Most items can be sold in the Steam Marketplace. Dota 2 has far improved graphics from the previous game. Heroes are even more detailed and the arena has better view. All heroes ability effects are also improved, even the UI is better. Dota 2 has many tournaments that you can participate. The biggest is "The International" Dota 2 tournament. Most tournaments can reward players with some rare items just by watching the tournaments. Dota 2 is the best MOBA game yet. I recommend this. Rating 9/10

review: A very confusing game, that strives to continue where Heroes of Legends left off, but resorts a bit too often to slavic jump-scares to create an immersive Slenderman-like experience. Current main issues: Pros: - A friendly and positive community - Possibility to make friends and discuss delicate topics with new people from various ethnic backgrounds, chat comes with emoticons and other essential stuff - Strong focus for learning new languages - Full of fun mini-games if the main game is not compelling, like the Shopkeeper's quiz, buying stuff from the Valve shop, in-game advertisement clicking, guess-games for DOTA 2 network offline times etc Cons: - I picked the Sniper class but had trouble aiming in the first person mode, needs to be fixed asap - Playing the game with Oculus Rift resulted in nausea - Low replayability, after their first game everone I know has practically reached their skill cap - Basic things like in-game quicksave and quickload functionality is missing - Raid bosses like Roshan and Troll Warlord are hard to understand and severely imbalanced - Steam achievements were teased but are still not working, I already ate my 500th tree but didn't get the achievement - The crafting system is confusing and unintuitive - Want to create a drum? Well, you need a robe and a bracer, of course! Want to create a buckler? Yep, you guessed it, you need a chainmail shirt armor and a branch! - Hitboxes are off and often clipping; for example, I bought a bigger sword for the Sven class, but game doesn't register hits that clearly happen against smaller models like the Phantom Assassin - NPCs like the mud golem and the shopkeeper only have few lazy dialogue lines, I was more interested in hearing their immersive part of the story while constructing a hut in a nearby forest out of treebranches - RTS system for building or repairing base components are limited to only a few heroes and could use a revamp - Character wipes happen a bit too often in the servers I've been at Without going into too many spoilers, finishing the campaign left me with more questions than satisfying answers. For example, why was the evil Dragon Knight so eager to hurt the seemingly innocent creeps for monetary gain? Why did the mysterious Drow Ranger attack our valiant hero? Why does Axe look like a tomato? So many questions, yet so few answers. Overall, the game is OK for an early access FPS-RPG hybrid but doesn't entertain the more hardcore gamers for very long. For a small-time indie developer team I guess it's acceptable, but I'd wait for more available DLC expansions before paying anything for the main game.

Having a big studio behind it and loads of fans from Warcraft 3 times made it very easy for DotA 2 to become an competitive game and e-sport, but for me is not enough to hide one of the biggest flaws this game has which is: RNG. DotA 2 has loads of items and heroes based on procs and other random elements which leaves many fights in this game to chance, a thing that i dislike so much in PvP games. DotA 2 is a good game, but is not the PvP game i'm looking for.

review: So basically what happened was I was talking to my drug dealer / grandma about addictive substances, and i was running low on crack so she told me to try out dota 2 since it was free. Long story short i tried to rob a bank so I could afford the Arcana set for Legion Commander and now my cell mate's name is Chester. He keeps asking me what his name rhymes with but I dont know. He always spanks me and calls me naughty boy. Anyways, play this game if you like screaming and waking up your neighbor with epilepsy.

review: Stop playing LoL and WoW..... play a game that requires real skill. Just remember, you suck at DOTA2 til you have about 500 games won. Takes about 30-45 minutes per game..... and you're not winning a majority of your games. edit:wrote that review when I had played less than 30 hours of the game. Having played almost 1,000 hours on DOTA2 now, I stick by my previous assessment that DOTA ing sucks. I will  you in it though..... :D

review: I find it amusing because I'd actually say that DOTA2 is a bit easier. To deny, just right-click. League, you actually have to plan ahead and play significantly more cleverly to deny, predict your enemy's backing/roam more and be able to clear waves to use the tower instead. The mind games play a much larger role, as well as efficient use of skills, rather than just buying hard-counter items to match a given situation. The trouble is, it /looks/ simpler at first glance, while actually offering far more depth, strategy and complexity. So those who play at a low level never actually see anything more than 'simplified' gameplay, and quickly go back to D2 or HoN. And nothing of value was lost.

review: Funny game, competitive, every match is different... and best support and innovation I've seen in a long time in a game... And all this for free. Yeah, I could say we are in front of the best MOBA game in the market, but I can say some things that are not that great though about Dota 2 at the end of this review. It's true that this game is bringing the best innovation I've seen in a long time in a videogame. This industry is a bit stuck in making money giving just enough for the clients and players and then adding more to pay via DLCs, some times they even launch a game that is a Beta at 50 bucks price or higher. When I talk about innovation I mean, for example, about the best support for watching games, replays and tournaments. But the bad side of this is that if you want to watch tournament games... ALL of them requires a ticket to be bought, except the only free yearly tournament that is The International, being the only exception. Also, the visual customization of the heroes is insane, you can customize by separated parts (helm, shoulders, arms, body, legs, weapon...) just like in a MMO, and even some animations or skills... and you can trade all of your items in the market or with friends. The great thing about this game compared to others like League of Legends is that paying money does not affect to gameplay, just visuals. In League of Legends paying money gave you the advantage of having more and better runes and more rune pages, for example, giving you a little advantage in a competitive scenario. Also you need to buy some heroes/characters or you can't play all of them when you feel the need to. Even when you can buy those things without money, it's almost impossible to get everything without paying, even if you play a lot. Big limitations to competitive gameplay. In Dota 2 there is no restriction: you play every hero, you play with every skill. Also there is a lot of other great things like user skill and item builds and guides that you can select and use in-game and rate up or down, you can customize your own for each hero and even the announcer if you have one, among other things. Then, what is the bad side of Dota 2? First of it, you ALWAYS need a team in order to play or get some fun. Solo matchmaking is not just bad, it's horrible. No matter how good you are and how long you've been playing this game you will end up with drunk players, idiots, trolls, bored players who are not focused on the game... And this is on both sides of the game, in your team or in the other. Report system doesn't work at all (maybe just a bit for excessive cases), and even if you play with friends in a full team... You won't find balanced games. The common issue here is either you roflstomp the other team or they roflstomp yours even if you played great. Of course, playing with a full party of friends can decrease the chances this happens, but even with that, playing a good balanced, funny and competitive game will be hard. This said, they need to implement some kind of public ranking system in order to maybe avoid that a little. And then, maybe the things could become really better. But overall this is a great game with a very good support from their developers, constantly adding content and not just focusing on getting your money, something rare to find nowadays in the industry.

review: The game, where all s gather. If you thought annoying COD kids were too much, then you haven't experienced dota2 yet. It's full of obnoxious, rude people, who have absolutely no idea what a co-op / team game is about, and constantly whine about stolen kills, like if this was some FPS. The following list contains the type of people you will meet in dota: 1. 12 year olds, thinking they know everything, and play dota for life, while skipping school 2. People who can't speak english at all, despite playing with the english language filter 3. Reporters, who do nothing but  about everyone else, and report them for everything 4. Multiple account 'pros' who constantly swear about how their team sucks 5. Idiots, who tell you to attack 1v5 / close range against long / ask you to help and then run away 6. Quitters 7. Mr. AFK who gives up at the start of the game and just hangs around spawn 8. New players who get talked down for not completely understanding the game after 2 seconds 9. Extremely rare, but nice and helpful people Worst. Community. Ever.

review: Dota 2 - A Game worth getting/playing Generally let me start of by saying I usually play alot of playstation but Dota 2 got me hooked and im still hooked on it. Ranged from using abilities, working as a team to the just pure enjoyment of having a last kill. Player friendly, can spend hours enjoying it with mates/friends and well if you decide to go alone, take some time to practice and learn the capabilities of each hero. I think this game is fun and yeah what makes it amazing is each character takes some time to play with its not like easy from the start which makes it fair for the noobs/newbies to the game. Positives about the game: Loads of characters Loads of items to choose from Epic duals to awesome kill streaks And well u think there are negatives, but its hard to find one except for the fact that the creators have created a awesome game but my only negative would be the maps. Stuck on the same map makes u wonder when the update will come or if will ever but yeah its only a small lag in the game which u can bypass!!! Negative Different maps Anyhows said enough, if u guys find it helpful pls like it and yeah catch u on dota 2 :)

review: Recommended. I'm not playing anymore, but still. + Nice graphics + Lots of new stuff coming to game + Big hero pool + Lots of gamemodes - Annoying people - here, in EU, it is kind of big problem. I was playing on EU servers (west and east) /w English prefference. But people usually don't care; I need to say, that raging EU guys are annoying. When you make mistake, you are hated from them, reported or something. And that's big problem. Mostly for new players, who just want to try for example new hero. - Pinging - this is pretty much connected with "Annoying people" point. You know, you can always ping or draw on map. I once met guy who stole my items and pinged me all the time. It is annoying and you can't focus. (btw. I reported him. When you have to, report. Don't be scared) - AD spells - some are not working. Idk why, but they aren't.. It is really stupid -but this is just small thing. Guys, guys! Play this game, really. It is fun. You just need to learn it. ~ Thx for reading.

review: Dota 2 consists the most unblanaced heros for any game on the market as of right now! There so many over powered abilities on too many heros. In fact, the heros are considered over powered are played every single, of every single match. Dota 2 is the worst game, I have ever played due to the lack community(which is toxic), hero abilities which are over powered, and all around broken game. If you like your sanity, do not play this game. If you do not want to become racist, do not play this, if you don't rich pumping  tons of money into professional gaming just so the game can make a buck or two, do not play game. If you do not like Russia, do not play this game. If you do not like any hispanic, do no play this game. Basically, what saying to you, if you want to play a moba, go play league of legends.

review: If you want to get rich playing games then this is the game to play. This is an amazing multiplayer online battle arena. The real-time strategy is the best part. If you ever want to win a game you must out think you opponent. Communication with you team is key, although you might end up hating them shortly after they start dying. The only down fall is abrasive players, if you tend to die lot and feed the other team some of your teammates will release their rage upon you. Other than the sore losers that you will meet from time to time this game has an amazing community. The Dota 2 community is a bit crazy but in a good way for Valve at least because they spend over 20 million dollars in just over 2 weeks. Currently about 8 million of those dollars are going towards the prize pool of The International, the ultimate tornament for the best Dota 2 players in the world. The team that gets 1st place will get around 4 million dollars and 2nd through 8th place will split the rest. Keep in mind that this game is free to play it is not pay to win; you never have to pay anything to enjoy Dota 2 at its full potential. Everything that is sole in game is cosmetic and does not affect you performance in-game. Again I say if you want to get rich playing games then this is the game to play.

review: This is the best video game I've ever played hands down. I have so much to say where do I start. Ok so dont be turned away by the huge learning curve, when you start you will be TERRIBLE but thats ok and likely you may never be great but you will make amazing friends and have so much fun. Actually I wish i could go back to being a blissfully ignorant noob because learning hero's abilities, what certain items do, lane compesitions, ect I can go on forever about how much there is to learn even after 2.5k hours (probably 1.5k - 2k hours actually playing) I'm still learning! The game hits an odd paradox it can be the most satisfying and exciting game I've ever played but also the most enraging and frustrating, its a ing emotional roller coaster sometimes. There will be highs there will be lows from amazing comebacks, to terrible throws, great teamwork, and Brazilian  feeders. I've even tried giving up after long agonizing losing streaks but nothing, no other game can quite fill hole not playing this game for a few hours a day leaves. Its perfect for me, I love being social, competitive, passionate, and excited all maybe too much at times but thats just the kind of person I am. Some of my best friends I've made playing dota with and even though I've never meet most of them I love them all and noting can quite compare to queueing for a ranked captains mode game with a 5 stack. Valve is an amazing company and I'm glad they took the game and ran with it. Were constantly getting new seasonal events, heros, game modes, and more cosmetic items I can throw my money at. Oh and one of the best parts, all the heros are free and unlocked from the start! No progression system where you can buy characters with in game currency or level up some  passives in a skill tree or something (like a certain game). You don't need to spend a dime but I strongly suggest you should considering your funding not only the people who make the game but the cosmetics are created by the community who they pay! Also all the items are tradeable, Ive spent countless hours browsing trading sites looking to swap my items that I got for free as random drops for my favorite heros new hat or whatever. Ive spent way too much time watching pro games as well which Valve fully embraces, they even host one of the biggest e-sport tournaments ever every year called The International. I put a good bit of time into writing this review so thanks for reading it all if this even gets one person to give it a try then its not time wasted. I hope you enjoy the game half as much as I do.

Hundreds of hours spent on playing on the same map, even with lots of heroes. After first 20-30 hours, u'll start to be too agressive. After first 100 hours, u'll split up with ur girl friend and u will play dota even more times per week. After 500 hours, u'll  every mom u will meet. After 1000 hours... You're nobody. You got no friends, no girldfriend, no knowledge... Everything u have is DOTA. Do not play this game.

review: This is pretty much my favourite game of all time. The learning curve for the game is pretty brutal and it is quite difficult to become good at it, but once you do become a competent player, the game is infinitely rewarding. The game is always changing with regular balance patches and holiday events and the cosmetic item system is pretty awesome. You can customize the appearance of all the heroes and it does not affect the balance of the game and I find collecting cosmetic items to be quite fun. If you are into trading you can make a ton of money (steam wallet funds) playing this game. Pretty much all my steam games come from profits from cosmetic DotA 2 item trading. I have been playing DotA for 10+ years (including WC3 DotA) and never get bored of this game. I have played other DotA style games before and HoN and LoL can't hold a candle to this game. Seriously, those other games do not even come close to being as good as DotA 2 in terms of game and community. There is also a large esports scene around DotA 2 if you are into that.

Can be a Walrus. Very enjoyable once you've learnt the basics. Cons ~ This game is not newb friendly what so ever. Smurfs. Leavers. 10 year olds. Pudges ;-; Steep learning curve. You WILL sometimes be the only person on your team that speaks english (Even if you are queing for servers where you live.

review: "Actually DotA HD" I came into this game a little uneasy, my past with DotA1 not being the brightest in the world; but seeing something named "DotA2" I excepted new features, characters, etc etc. I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG! Valve honestly didn't add a single thing (except one thing we'll get to later) the shop interface is still more unfriendly than a rabid bear in heat, mages are still completely useless in late game are are the least used class of character, the balance is still horribly out of whack leaving a single fed agility hero to be able to take an entire team by himself *cough* Antimage *cough* and it just feels lazy. Even the characters were lifted straight from the WarCraft III modles. Now back to what valve actually DID add... Hats. Not even joking. This is a shameless cash grab by Valve, do not spend money on this game. If you want the REAL "DotA2" play "League of Legends" it was an upgrade from the orignal BY the original creators, there's a reason LoL is #1.

review: this game is interesting because while it is very enjoyable and there is lots of variety; the people you will play with rarely know how to work as a team and when they do its becasue the enemy is really bad at the game. Also the community is very unwelcoming to noobs so if you just joined and are learning how to play nobody likes you. all in all it is one of my favorites but i will warn you it isnt the easist to just pick up and play. Also there is a low prioority pool so if you cant get out of that you will always be with noobs even if you are a good player.

review: Dota 2 consists the most unblanaced heros for any game on the market as of right now! There so many over powered abilities on too many heros. In fact, the heros are considered over powered are played every single, of every single match. Dota 2 is the worst game, I have ever played due to the lack community(which is toxic), hero abilities which are over powered, and all around broken game. If you like your sanity, do not play this game. If you do not want to become racist, do not play this, if you don't rich pumping  tons of money into professional gaming just so the game can make a buck or two, do not play game. If you do not like Russia, do not play this game. If you do not like any hispanic, do no play this game. Basically, what saying to you, if you want to play a moba, go play league of legends.

review: If you want to get rich playing games then this is the game to play. This is an amazing multiplayer online battle arena. The real-time strategy is the best part. If you ever want to win a game you must out think you opponent. Communication with you team is key, although you might end up hating them shortly after they start dying. The only down fall is abrasive players, if you tend to die lot and feed the other team some of your teammates will release their rage upon you. Other than the sore losers that you will meet from time to time this game has an amazing community. The Dota 2 community is a bit crazy but in a good way for Valve at least because they spend over 20 million dollars in just over 2 weeks. Currently about 8 million of those dollars are going towards the prize pool of The International, the ultimate tornament for the best Dota 2 players in the world. The team that gets 1st place will get around 4 million dollars and 2nd through 8th place will split the rest. Keep in mind that this game is free to play it is not pay to win; you never have to pay anything to enjoy Dota 2 at its full potential. Everything that is sole in game is cosmetic and does not affect you performance in-game. Again I say if you want to get rich playing games then this is the game to play.

review: Dota 2 is one of the best Free 2 Play First Person Shooters of the Animated Cartoon Genre I have ever seen. I have played this game for over 1000 hours and have learned many new languages such as Russian and Peruvian, I have learned that no matter how long you play the game there will always be someone there to tell you you are a "noob", and I have only thought about murdering my friends over this game twice.

review: Easily the most fascinating strategy games in years and easily the most exciting to watch (regular matches to tournament / championships) Bringing the most spectacular and vividly detailed strategies to players and viewers alike. One of the most addicting games ever made; and one you can never master as something can always be countered. While some people may be turned off by the first few games due to he learning curve; rest assured if you dip atleast 10 hours into learning how to really play the game and the character you chose to start playing with, you will soon be engulfed in an AAA package unlike any other game, which is why I give it a 10/10 - Many RTS games, RPG Games, MOBA's, Hybrids, all bring new innovative things to plate; or end up getting big by copying a formula near exact (such as LoL... -sigh- ) - DOTA 2 is the best "Action Real Time Role Playing Game" or "MOBA" (Name doesn't matter) but it's the best in its field and one of the best online centered titles you'll ever play.

This game is better off you recognizing every aspect of the game and getting used to the learning curve, play 600-2000 hours, get mad at it, and fanboy over professional teams. Fanboying and following professional teams and tournaments is the best way to go. Also the lore isn't half bad. TL;DR this game is better than League of ies

There are three types of heroes: Strength, Agility and Intelligence. Strength heroes are more on physical abilities and tough to deal with. Agility heroes are more on damaging and ints are more on supports.

review: Dota 2...where to begin? Dota 2 is a game of ups and down, heart break and happiness, and most of all, utter ing sadness. This game will literally kick you when you're down,  on you, and then continue to make you give your own father fellatio. Dota is not a game for the faint at heart and one should only attempt to play it if ready to lose; but losing the match isn't all you'll lose! When playing with friends you will find yourself constantly hating each other as you or your friend(s)  up. You will latch onto that hate and it will consume you. If you can survive the hate and keep coming back though, you will soon emerge into a world of new found misery and sometimes joy, as you begin to learn the basics. You will start to win, while you remain to lose at the same time. Dota 2 is a game where the player never truly wins. The player is never truly good, they're only slightly better each and every time; and every time will be different, no matter how many hours you pour into the masochistic game, that is -- Dota 2.

review: '"Is DotA2 a fun game?" is usually the first question people ask about this game. Great games in recent times seem to often have set themselves apart from other games by being an 'experience game' as an example Proteus is 100% experience and very little game. Braid was great because it was an innovative platformer but some of the greatest lasting attraction I felt to the game was because of the endearing story and symbolism that was symbiotic to the music and art of the game. DotA 2 is not a game that tries to make it as easy as possible to 'experience' the game and then be done with it, unlike the set of games that have defined themselves a new genre in run of the mill First Person Shooters which make it as easy as possible for new players to complete sections of it and reach great heights in an attempt to lower the dominance new players have through tricks like fast healing, killstreaks and fast respawns. It doesn't fit with Half Life 2 like games in being a great singleplayer experience which you run through like a roller-coaster ride either: each game starts out the same but can diverge in an incalculable number of ways due to the enormous number of variables innate in the vast number of heroes and builds. DotA 2 is a game; a game with rules and learning and practising; a game where you can't see the top of the skill ladder from the middle, a game that is challenging and intriguing at every turn. What is it that makes a game fun? I don't think anyone knows the true formula, but we know that fun activates the reward centres of the brain. DotA 2 will give you the rulebook and some practise scenarios, but you cannot expect to have it play itself. You must teach yourself the game and through your endeavours you will get noticeably better each time and you can and will feel proud of it. DotA 2 challenges both the intellect and the reflexes with battles between an enormous range of heroes each with interesting, astoundingly well thought out and developed move-sets and characters. Because of the sheer challenge and complexity of what DotA 2 provides, it is a very fulfilling game with much room for growth; it is a game that will be enjoyable, I expect for a very long time. Because of this, DotA 2 is not a game that is inherently fun in as much as you can't pick up a pack of cards for the first time and expect to play poker. But we have touched only on the mechanics of the game: DotA 2 takes place on a very beautiful map, complete with birds and squirrels, fish and butterflies, spiders and cobwebs, day and night; and forests and ravines. In honesty, all it would require for me to feel its atmosphere was perfectly polished would be weather effects it would be wonderful to see rain splashing in the river, or even little streams! The game has over 100 heroes, each memorable, with well-developed movesets, storylines and copious amount of character-to-character dialogue which allow the game's endearing heroes to cater to a huge variety of playstyles. Overall, DotA 2 is a game that is not made to take Game of the Year one year, then fade into obscurity as people complete it, it's a game that sits in that category of games that you go to to have fun with some friends, it's a game that wants you to keep coming back to it and you know in years time you can still pick up the cards and have fun again. If you want to pick up DotA 2, which, I should again emphasise requires some self-investment I suggest you ask a friend to introduce you one-on-one to the game's concepts with passive bots, then practise with bots, trying characters until you find one you like and are good at. Progressing to be able to beat the hard bots with little difficulty is very good preparation for multiplayer. Then, all get on mic and play an online game, you'll win or at least have fun if you co-operate.' - Zemnmez 2k13

review: This game allows you to exert your knowledge and understanding of layered mechanics (and exceptions of those game mechanisms) onto randomly-selected regional people without their permission or interest. Heated debates can lead to forged alliances to achieve that common goal or end into displaced frustration projected onto others to substitute one's own failures and inabilities to execute one's characters' (heroes') qualities. On the other hand, this game allows one to create 'hero build' guides as a pretense to be productive with his/her vexation as well as to fruitlessly raise the standard of expected knowledge of the game through item and ability walkthroughs in hopes that those one encounters in the future, rely on these indirect, serviced suggestion(s).

review: Quite tough for new players, but you once you start digging deep you'll find an infinite amount of depth in this gem. Originally a Warcraft 3 mod, this faithful remake brings the original into an all new graphics style which is very pleasant to look at. The game itself is a bottomless pit of mastering every hero, every item, and digging deep into the mechanics for the win. This game rewards time investment with a world that in some ways rivals ten games in complexity and depth. Plus, it's completely free, save for cosmetic items that don't affect gameplay at all. This means that all the characters will be unlocked right from the get-go. And of course, new heroes are still being added from the mod. I really look forward to the ongoing future for this game - winning a match beats everything else in its euphoria effect, and riding the high is half the game of Dota 2. Play it - even if you're scared of the community.

review: If you're jumping in this game alone, you're gonna have a bad time. DoTA2 is a team based game, if you're not playing it with a team mindset, you're wrong, and you're impression of the game will be wrong. The character select screen is incredibly daunting when you first start, and most of the characters are unique in their abilities, it takes many hours (days?) to even consider yourself a rookie in this game. After a week of playing nothing but 'Least Played' mode, you'll be pretty in the know of most of the characters, it's going to take watching youtube guide videos, experimenting, careful study of the tournament games and overall pure luck on who you get teamed up with (god help you if you're playing solo) to be able to win a game and even understand why you did. In short, what you need is; Trustworthy teammates, lots of free time, dedication, the ability to adapt well, and a looped playlist of 'Eye of The Tiger' and 'You're The Best'. Then maybe, you'll be considered a "nub" that won't get reported.

review: Gamenya bagus banget, grafik luar biasa dengan gameplay sama kayak dota 1. Nilai tambah disini karena steam yang menopang game dota 2, dimana keamanannya luar biasa ketat, namun jadi boomerang sendiri yang kadang dimana keamanannya malah sedikit "menggangu" player, karena tiap ada hal yg berhubungan sama security harus nunggu berapa hari Di Indonesia mungkin kurang ada wadah buat nopang player yang  game ini, mungkin lebih ke akses pembelian barang, dan lain-lain. Diharapkan steam bisa membantu player Indonesia yang ingin menyalurkan aktifitasnya agar menjadi lebih mudah didalam dota maupun steam Overall good banget!!

The continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. It's hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. I'm helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. If you can spare the time - play it. :)

review: I used to play DOTA 1 on my old Pentium 4 PC back in 2009 and it was a great experience. And when I learned that Valve acquired the rights to make a sequel for 1st mod game I was shocked like "How can they do that?, are they going to collaborate with blizzard to develop a new one?".. But then I found out that the project will be a standalone sequel without Warcraft or Blizzard.. And when I tried the final product I was surprised cause it's very similar to it's predecessor and for those who enjoyed the first one, I'm pretty sure that you will surely enjoy this Valve version as well, not to mention Ice Frog, one of the main modders of DOTA1 was the lead designer of this game so expect that the features that you've loved on the first still remains in this version.. Kudos to Valve and Ice Frog.. So far I'm enjoying the game more than any other titles on Steam... I will definitely recommend this to MOBA addicts out there, especially the DOTA 1 patrons..

review: Do you like being matched with non-English speakers on English servers and losing to "right click to win" heroes? Do you love lack of communication between team members in a team game? THEN YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE! Introducing Dota 2, the most innovative method of mental self-harm known to man. Some games are so "fun" (ed), you'll want to commit seppuku to end the miserable experience. The best part about Dota is when you make the life of the other team miserable. Then you're in for a world of fun. PS. Always, always, always bring along some friends. Dota may be agonizing otherwise. The more friends you play with, the better.

review: Dota 2 is a free Strategy / RPG type game made by the worlds most biggest and succesful Game Company - Valve. Dota 2 gives you the oppurtunity to learn skills and tactics you have never been able to learn before, and also has a money making potential to it. Dota lets you master different players in the game, getting stronger and unlocking new items for them to make them more "Buff". There are three lanes in Dota, Top, Bottom and Middle, all in which occupy a tower to defend the teams "Ancient". To win the game, you will need to destroy the towers to get to the ancient and then destroy the Ancient with it. 10/10, I love this game.

review: This is a very competitive game with some incredibly complicated mechanics. The graphics are nice, everything runs well and I've rarely seen issues, which are fixed on a regular basis. What makes it entertaining to me is the combination of hundreds of available characters, each with their own relatively unique skill set, along with hundreds of items to be bought during the course of each match. In a 5 man team, there are endless combinations of roles which can make for a solid strategy. There is a matchmaking system that does a fair job of creating balanced teams (hopefully, dear player, after you have practiced playing with bots and know all of the heroes) and an endless learning curve. The only problem I have with the game is how much abuse is prevalent in the community. New players are able to join matches before they have the experience to make reliable teammates and rather than give them advice or instruction, many would simply vote to kick a player from the team, and 4v5 is hardly ever winnable. I wish there were more people able to demand some respect and cooperation, that I had more reports for those who use the word noob regularly and then claim the game is over before it began because of anything else. If you like competition, teamwork, hilarious math, reflexes, and leadership, then this is one of the best games you'll find. But it will be frustrating at times.

I've travelled wide and far to experience the european servers but no matter how hard I try, I can never seem to find the promised lands. I've been around to experience the following: Ti3 = Na'Vi fountain hooking whilst Gabe Newel was clearly there. Diretide 2013 =   _  Give DIRETIDE VOLVO! Chinese New Year = "Broken ShiTblades,  my life I quit this  game." Ti4 = Techies confirmed, Valve shut up and take my money. 12/10 rated. Much fun. Very Russian. Too many reddit leaks. Would recommend, have recommended. They continue to play Call of Duty & GTA V. Maybe I should recommend to PC gamers, League of Lung Cancer still beats Defense Of The Ancient-russians 2

review: Dota 2 - A Game worth getting/playing Generally let me start of by saying I usually play alot of playstation but Dota 2 got me hooked and im still hooked on it. Ranged from using abilities, working as a team to the just pure enjoyment of having a last kill. Player friendly, can spend hours enjoying it with mates/friends and well if you decide to go alone, take some time to practice and learn the capabilities of each hero. I think this game is fun and yeah what makes it amazing is each character takes some time to play with its not like easy from the start which makes it fair for the noobs/newbies to the game. Positives about the game: Loads of characters Loads of items to choose from Epic duals to awesome kill streaks And well u think there are negatives, but its hard to find one except for the fact that the creators have created a awesome game but my only negative would be the maps. Stuck on the same map makes u wonder when the update will come or if will ever but yeah its only a small lag in the game which u can bypass!!! Negative Different maps Anyhows said enough, if u guys find it helpful pls like it and yeah catch u on dota 2 :)

review: A pulchritudinous looking game, it is definitely my personal favorite MOBA game yet. It has a huge hero roster, is completely free (the only possible transactions result in aesthetic changes), requires coordinated teamwork and has a huge fan base and community. That said, you should be wary of many of the players, as many are extremely negative and will work to frustrate and annoy you in whatever way possible. In many cases you will feel that an opponent is overpowered, or a particular hero is cheap, but I can assure that in 95% of these cases, that is not true. I would also highly recommend that you learn the basics first and complete the tutorial, because your first few games are gonna be rough; you will probably get crushed into the finest paste you've ever been in your life.

In my 600 hours of gameplay I regret nothing except for the mass amount weight I have amassed playing dota a total of how much i gained. I figured for every hour played I gained 1.5 LBs now I am going to be competition for the worlds biggest man. Overall dota is a great game. I would recommend this to anyone I have noticed also my grades have slipped but I have plenty of time to catch up with the grades becuase I am only in thrid grade.

review: Oh wow look at me, writing a review for 1 of my 3 favorite games on Steam at 10:00 P.M. time for spell check spam. Well anyways as I said it is one of my 3 favorite games on Steam so lets start at the begginning. It all started in World of Warcraft, I bought the game in 2008 and knew little about. Later I found out it was Warcraft 4, so I went and looked at Wacraft 3. One of the mods for Warcraft 3 is called Dota (Defense of the Anchients) sound familiar? Well it is a super worked on mod that eventually turned into a game. Dota2, this has got to sound familiar to you now. So basically last time I counted there were 100 something classes in the game so obviously I wanted to try them all. Yah, I got to about 1/3 and I got tired of failing with new classes. So I chose my favorite class. Phantom Lancer. Anyways in Dota2 you can go around and kill people in a 5v5 match, doesn't get much better than that... Oh wait! It does. When ever you think you have the best class, there is one better than you. So you'll always get owned by someone, unless your Riki, C'mon that guys a god. Basically the goal of Dota2 is to use teamwork and your brain to destroy atleast 5 towers, 2 barracks and the, well, Anchient, hence the name Defense of the Anchient. So I want to make this really long so I am going to go on. When I got my first name tag, kill counter, and description tagged and jumped in joy. I was able to make the best item ever! (It is a common xD) So, in short do you like MOBA games? Roleplaying games? Strategy games? Teamwork games? Games where you break your keyboard? Dota2 is the game for you! To continue on with my jibber-jabber I would like to introduce No one the Puppet. No one the Puppet: Hi bros and brodettes! Get this game! It's free, fun, fascinating, furious, fabulous, frightening, fantastic, funny, fuming, another "F" verb and so much more! So get it. Post more "F" words below! Anyways I give this game a 9.5/10. Only thing I don't like about it is that matches take 30-60 minutes long... and you don't want to leave your screen during that times. So get this game!! But I feel like this review is to short. I am going to talk about Riki. So Riki is a Dranei (flying space goat) Assassin, heh, that obliberates. He has a shadowstep that can teleport him to a target, where he can 3 shoot the enemy with 3 backstabs, throw down some powder making it so his enemies can't do crap, kill the other 4 enemies, vanish, and go buy a Divine Rapier. Yah that is pretty OP. If you want to suceed against Riki make sure he never hits level 6, when he gets his stealth ability which is his elite skill. He can basically be forever stealthed when he is out of combat for 3 seconds. More on elite skills, every class has one which is his or hers greated ability. But in my opinion Phantom Lancer is better. Once he is high level is invincible! He can do lots of damage with his normal attack and when you run away at 15% health he shoots a lance at your, finishing you off and summon an illusion. When you attack you can summon an illusion, and when that illusion attacks he can someone another illusion, so on and so forth. So basically what I am saying is that Phantom Lancer is also OP. There is another class called Sniper which you use in tutorial mode. Basically you can have Riki stand invisible by a tower, so you have a view of the tower but the tower isn't attacking Riki, then have a Sniper, outside of the towers range, shoot the tower down and destroy it in glory! This would also work for any other stealth classes. Well I do not know much else to say so I am going to end this here.... but... I have 1 more thing to say... GET THIS GAME! IT IS AWESOME!!!

review: Are language tutors like Rosetta Stone too pricy for you? Do you enjoy repeating tasks for hours for losses that will tear apart friendships and wins that will be forgotten about immediately? Do you find pride in knowing that you and your group of friends can work as hard as you can, and train for thousands of hours, only to be destroyed by a melanin enriched man livining in his chicken-farming parents' shack? Regardless of whether or not he's on your team? Do you like to receive a couple shiny, colourful virtual objects that compel you to spend money on more? Do you enjoy spectating other people playing games, and thinking to yourself "Gosh, they're so bad. If I were them, I would be doing so much better."? Do you enjoy semi-high pitched 'ping' noises? Do you enjoy shouting being emitted from a chain smoking Peruvian, into a ham radio, into a headset from 1993 radiating out of your speakers? Do you enjoy being blamed for every fault within your team? Do you enjoy right clicking? Are you a masochist? If you answered yes to any of these questions, Dota 2 is the game for you.

review: To start with if you're thinking of playing Dota2 it's going to be rough when you start and it's probably best to start with some friends, BUT when you get past that barrier you'll never find another game to fill that void of Dota2's MOBA experience. Would totally recommend this to anyone thinking of playing just beast through the beginners block and ignore the flamers :)

review: This game litterally ruined my life. I started playing dota awhile ago, thaught it was hard, but fun, so kept playing.... But now, Dota has taken everything away from me. Dota is my new life. I now don't get to go outside with my friends in the glorious sunlight. I no longer worry about grades at school. My dream is now to be Dendi. This game a has also brought out the dark side in me. Out of the over 800 hours i've been playing this game, at least 20% of me playing has been me screaming at my FREAKING TEAMATES BECAUSE ALL THEY DO IS FEED. This game has also made me extremely rasict to all non english speakers, especially: Peru, Brazil, every spanish speaking country, and Russia. Do I reccomend this game? HELL YEAH 100/10

review: There are a lot of MOBA games out there. A lot of them are basicly the same thing with different graphics and heroes/champions (you choose what you want to call them). However, there is something different about DOTA 2. I wouldn`t say it`s the difficulty (that depends on community more, than on the game itself). I don`t even think it`s the heroes, there are few unique heroes, you won`t find in other MOBA games, but a lot of them are simmilar (either visually or in their skills). I think this game has somethign in it, that makes you want to play it. It can`t be described. You won`t be able to tell what it is, but you will now it`s there. So it`s hard to say if this game is for you or if it isn`t. You won`t know until you play it. Be aware though. If you choose to give this game a try, expect that you will hate it and love it at the same time. You will hate and love the community. You will hate and love your friends you play this game with. BUT BE MOST AWARE OF HOW MUCH TIME YOU SPEND PLAYING THIS GAME, AS IT WILL TAKE ALL YOUR TIME ONCE YOU WILL BE DRAGGED INTO IT..

review: A real competitive game, Valve did a very nice job bringing dota 2. A real strategy game, a challeging fun game. There is over 112 Heroes to try, each one is balanced, and no hero is the most powerfull or the most weak, every hero in the game is equal, every hero have his / her's high and lows. And that my friend is Dota 2.

game-hours: 116.1
review: When I first tried to play Dota 2 - around the same time it came out - I made the mistake of jumping right on in thinking I knew exactly what I was doing; obviously failing, I gave up and left about ten-minutes later, and throughout the course of a few months, I did this about five-times, because I wanted to understand what the big deal was about it, and why people found and still find this game so addictive. Up until recently, I hated it with a passion - not only for being killed over-and-over - but also for the sheer complexity of it overall, but, now I know, I wasn't taking the time to actually appreciate that complexity and realise that the learning curve was so full of depth, that if you set your mind to it, you can seriously enjoy it. Considering it's all based around one map, with the same game-mode every time, it's evident you'd think it'd get boring quickly - but you'd be wrong. Even though this is the case, there's so many different heroes, with different abilities, and different play-styles, it just makes it more enticing. It's also extremely strategic and teammates count for everything, which means you'll be working together and maybe even making some more friends. In conclusion: This game is worth every hour you're willing to invest into it, and if you enjoy learning, teamwork and have an addictive personality like me, then those hours are going to be endless.

Strategy is perfectly orchestrated into the captivating gameplay and perfect graphics, storyline is not key but there are hints and traces of it shot out at you through weapon flavor text and fanmade comics. All in all this game is great, and although it may seem that this game is kind of lame because you don't keep items after matches at first, that doesn't matterf after the first hour or so of gameplay.

Just be warned though people are not friendly, people trashtalk a lot, people are very elitist regarding the meta builds and does not want you experimenting. If you encounter this people, mute them ASAP, dont bother firing back. Just remember you been warned. Have Fun! :)

review: the websters dictiondary definition of ancient is ancient adjective \'an(t)-sh?nt, 'a?(k)-sh?nt\ : very old : having lived or existed for a very long ti and Boy this game is old and existed a long time. Steam made the old game DO.N.A. and now made it into the new game D.O.T.A.2. it stands for Defence Of Ancients. it used to be a old game for nerds but now It's a real life recration of the medevil life style. you can go down to the street to buy wares from the Fat man down the Street like olive branch, the slippers, and a eye ball on a stick. Just like medeval Times. Its a real life simulater so its got night and Day also. you can do all the chores you want like chipping down a tree with a leaf and driving the donckey horse down to the river to drink (your Team Mates will get mad if you do this wrong so get a lot of practice) if you like to be wizzard and cast Magic this is the video game for you. its technically a Massiveley Multiplayer On Line Battle House, or MOBO. this means that 1. 1. theres a LOT of people thats playing it. I counted at least 8 people in one house. 2. theres A lot of magicyou can cash a spell and it makes the little guy glow with magic glowing rings. I think theres a nother spell but I did not try it yet. 3. theres a lot of medeval guys (and the ladies) to pick from. Marana is the best one though because she shoots a really big arrow and rides a lion cat so shes the fastest. Watch out though that its pro grammed to be a Realistic arrow so its slow. you can also play as a donckey horse and this is easier except some times it does not like to listen but thats what stubborn donckeys do. 4. and if you like Secrets then Boy there is a lot of secrets in this game to choose from. if you chip down the right tree in the forest you get hit by a lightning bolt!!! It's a hidden secret and i could not find out how to make it happen again. it also happened when i didn't chip down a tree so its weird. also did you know theres a secret Fat man in the woods that sells wares but i could only find him once. if you find him again please make a web site saying where he is. 5. theres a lot of peope that shout a insult and curse word at you. this is the bad part of the game. I dont know why Steam put this part into the game but the voice acting is not very good. if its too loud you can leave the game house though. also i have a gameplay Tips for you. -stay onto the side of the house that you started on. if you go to the other side you get killed by a building. I dont know why Steam did this. -theres a Dragon in the forest. just like Medevil times. if you Slay the dragon you win i think. I killed the dragon after drying two times i finally killed it. then the game ended. I wont spoil it but its a big hole in the ground with little guys jumping and it says Die Wins. -some times people say things to you but its a secret code. i figured it out though. if they say b it means bad or g means good. some times they say Top or mid and bottom, it just means you have to tell the donckey horse to drink in the river and mid means go to the middle of the river.

review: Ok. For a game built for Russians, played by Americans and won by absaloute swearing at team members so that sniper can go top, this game has taught me more about the great passion that people have about winning games such as DOTA, your feeling do not count for  on the playing field, no. Niether does your spirit, but just your hero and its abilities and how fast your able to use them.To play this game requires not a patient personality but your skills at how fast your able to press "1,2,3,4" and where you use them. You will be sworn at, ed over and hated at first......which is fine because your not gonna get better at a game like this, oohh no, firstly to even count yourself as even a little bit past begginers level, you have to asess yourself. 1.) Am i russian? - if yes continue 2.)  ? - if yes continue 3.)          ? - if yes continue if you have answered no or yes to any of these questions you are still and undoubtedfully not a skilled DOTA player, please take it lightly that you wont do well in life, you cant play Dota, you cant play life.

review: "Welcome to Dota 2: You Suck" TL;DR : Amazing game, try it. I was never really the type of guy to play one game for prolonged periods of time, but there are exceptions. Dota 2 is one of them. I discovered this game through a friend, downloaded it, played it, immediately hated it, and everything about it. But not because it was a horrible game. I hated it because it was soul-crushingly cruel; coming from FPS games, I was tossed into the game with no idea on how to play passed last hitting. Even that, I couldn't do right. After about six hours of trying heroes, different lane combinations/strategies, and subsequently feeding, I essentially gave up on it. Three months later, I decided that I didn't give Dota the chance it deserved. I redownloaded it, studied up on guides, practiced for hours as one hero until I got it right, and I found that this game was much deeper than I had initially thought. I was a long-time FPS player, but I was familiar with League of Legends. In LoL, you're expected to push and harass; amass gold, gank and kill to win. Simple, right? So I thought the same should be done for Dota 2. Just push the lane until I win, that's how things are in League. I learned one thing after hours and hours of getting owned by Medium Co-Op bots: Dota 2 isn't LoL. Not even close. In LoL, it's basically a pushing contest with ganks thrown in. In Dota 2, I had to learn how to counter pick, orbwalk, gank, control creep waves, stack jungle camps, stack ancients with helm of the dominator, deny junglers EXP by placing wards in camps, harass without getting aggro, what heroes countered my heroes (all of them), which lanes are best for which heroes, learn when it's better to defend or trade towers, when to buy items like Hand of Midas. It's a daunting task for... anyone. To learn all of that at once would be nothing short of overwhelming. But you don't learn it all at once, you learn it through hours and hours of humiliation and practice. Then there are the heroes; I prefer Dota 2 heroes over LoL Champions. In LoL, they expect you to work for heroes or buy them right-out with real world money, the same for any cosmetic items you may want. Dota hands you all the heroes in the game for free, and any item you see in the shop can be earned (at random) through playing a match. The items are also tradeable. The champions in League were always so-so to me, I never really connected with them either because they looked cartoony to me or because they just simply didn't talk enough/have enough lines. Heroes in Dota are rather serious and usually have over a hundred lines each, which really lets you get a good feel for who they are. Note: I don't dislike LoL as I've played it myself, I just prefer Dota. Like I said before, I was a long-time FPS shooter before coming to Dota 2 (I still am, but I digress), and a part of why it was fun was because I had friends playing with me. Yeah, I get to talk to people I know while we kill random people online, that's fun. But it was just us going rogue and seeing who can kill more people than the other while we talk about mundane things. Dota 2 is different. My friends and I found that we *had* to rely on each other to win. We were given the opportunity to organize plans, tell each other what we were doing, if we needed a gank, ect. High fives went around the room whenever we won, and gaming with friends has never been more fun. Dota 2 is that rare type of game that doesn't hold your hand through it all; you don't just pick it up instantly. It demands your time and attention; it deserves it. Dota 2 has one of the steepest learning curves of any game, the steepest I've ever experienced. But that doesn't take away from how great the game is; even when you fail, it only feeds your desire to become better. You get to reading more guides, finding which heroes you play best with, getting rid of the ones you don't, learning of the strategies you could use, and learn how to talk with your team. Much more emphasis is placed on learning, practicing and communication than most games, but that only adds to the greatness. Dota 2 is needlessly cruel, but it may be the most fun you'll ever have. An amazing game, there's no reason why you aren't playing it. Give it a try, you won't be sorry when you come out of it.

review: - Disclaimer - This review is for the Standard Edition of Batman: Arkham City, as of 08/08/2014 the review feature for said game has been disabled - This game is a bomb. I've never been deeply into the Batman franchise, never read any comics. Back in the day when it was on TV, "Batman - The Animated Series" gained my attention and never lost it. Batman:Arkham city is arguably the best, longest and most refined entry in this current series of games. It was thankfully developed by the Rocksteady studio under the guidance of Paul Dini, the main writer for the Animated Series. That whole thing plays like a Batman movie produced by Christopher Nolan. Talking about immersion. You will think you are batman. And that the events happening really occur TO YOU as the witnessing player. Stunning graphics, excellent sound design and a well rounded combat system give this game the edge it needs to turn you into a non lethal crime fighting combat machine. Comes with leaderboards,challenge maps and a multiplayer mode, nothing short of a single player campaign 30+ hours rich, set up in an open air prison this game shows, how deep the rabbit whole of human cruelty really goes. This is lore wise easyly one of the best games I've ever played in my whole life and I hope Rocksteady will soon deliver an Arkham City 2 after the letdown that was Arkham Origins. That what you get when you change a winning team, Eidos. If you like super heros, or punching based action games, or just good movies in general, pls do yourself a favour and buy this game. It'll be a sad story if you miss out on it.

review: Dota 2 has to be one of the most annoying, unlogical and stupid games of all time... but i still love it and play it almost every day. Bear in mind that i have only about 1000hrs on this game so my opinions and views are based only on the short time i have spent playing it (yes 1000hrs is not much game time at all) and i have only two bits of advice for some who is starting dota: 1. Stick at it, never give up, never give in. Comebacks are possible from almost any situation and although you will probably suck at first, only trying out the easiest of heroes - drow,riki,viper ect- soon you will become better, soon you will graduate from noob school and become novice level (like me), This happens at about 750hrs. 2. Dont rush for the same hero every time, even if you really like the hero dont do it. Picking every hero will teach you their abilities so you will know what each of them are capable of when you play with them or against them, so try randoming for the extra gold too. Do this until you have won a game as every hero or have played a hero atleast twice. Good luck and may Dendi be with you!

review: This game, like most Moba games, is like an abusive partner, it will hurt you and make you feel awful so you tell yourself you will stop yourself and that you will put an end to the relationship but when you confront it it pulls you close and whispers in your ear while gently carressing your back that it is sorry for hurting you so you forgive it and the cycle continues. Great game

review: As a drop while playing Dota 2. Because Dota 2 is a free-to-play game, players do not receive free cards like most other games. Instead, a card drop becomes available for roughly every $9 USD spent on cosmetic items in the Dota 2 Store. If you have card drops available, they will appear automatically in your Steam inventory as long as your Dota 2 client is open. Cards drop approximately once every 15-60 minutes. From the Steam Community Market. By trading with another player. From a Booster Pack. Booster Packs are packets of several cards that drop randomly after you have forged one Dota 2 badge. Booster Packs can also be bought on the Market. Booster Packs drop more frequently for players with higher Steam Levels.

The continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment.

Very heavy focus on team play, stunning graphics, massive hero/heroine selection, and the only thing you actually need to pay for is cosmetics. Honestly, I don't care much for the flamewar between DotA and LoL. Seriously, shut up already - it's obvious DotA 2 is better.

review: This is my review for one of my favorite games, Dota 2. Dota 2 is much like League of Legends, in the sense that it is a MOBA game, and the best MOBA out there. I have tried other MOBA's like LOL and Infinite Crisis, yet Dota 2 seems to prove its the best of them all. With over 100+ heros, Dota 2 is very diverse from other games where each hero has a great skill set and personality. Each hero serves a role in-game, and items are bought to your choosing or what best fits the hero. But the game is very balanced, because each skill and items can be countered by another skill or items. This makes each and every game unique and very stratigic based. After over 500+ hours in-game, I have come to love this game. You couldn't ask more from a free game, and it is very fun. Although it is free, the game does have a store where you can purchase items that change the appearance of your hero or HUD, to having the in-game voice somebody else, to making your own workshop content that could be put into game. Training for the game at first is very difficult, and alot to take in at first. But if you are persistant and play against bots to practice and better your skills, Dota 2 becomes one of the best games out there. Although the game is hard to understand at the start and the community is harsh on "noobs", with time this game is one of the best free games out there, and I highly recommend it.

review: You wont like DotA2. You may be one of the millions of people that think you like it, already playing it and making it the single most popular game on Steam by a ridiculous margin, but thats only because you dont understand it. DotA2 is pure abstraction, complexity for the sake of complexity, and rule sets within rule sets that are broken at random. This game is so far removed from the theme of heroes with swords and spells clashing in combat that you might as well be playing a game of chinese whispers in a mental institution for the mathematically insane. Many of the subsystems only function the way they do now because of the limitations of the Warcraft 3 engine, while many others have been quietly modified for this sequel. This game is a triumph of accidental design that rewards memorization, social adroitness, deductive reasoning, and the ability to predict what other humans will do in a complex system that they do not understand. Ask yourself why you play games at all. Compare the aforementioned truths attributed to this game to your definition of fun. You see? I've just saved you a lot of time. This game wasnt made for you. It was made for me.

review: I haven't played this game that much but from what I have played, this game is really good. Game is a MOBA ARPG game. The objective is simple enough, destroy the opponent's Ancient which lies deep within their territory. Graphically speaking, the game is best in all the games out there for sure, very nice animations, looks of the heroes can be improved though, to me they look more like cartoons and I would like a realistic approach for them. Voice acting is nice as well, soundtrack can be improved. The best part of this game is that its not pay to win, all the items that you can get only alters your look in some way and not your performance in the game so no matter what weapon you are using. Be it vanilla or $10 weapon for a hero, it will do same damage to the opponent in all cases. I for one don't care much about Hero looks so its a big plus for me. All in all a very good and polished game. It also updates very frequently which is good and bad depending on your bandwidth. Must play for sure. :)

review: Dota 2 prefectly inherited the play style and cs feeling of Dota. The game flows pretty well with the new visual upgrade and getting rid of the old Warcraft3 system, it's entirely a nice try. However, it is an embarrassing situation Dota 2 and its Valve behind it are facing: first, the same old problem of Dota-it's just too hard for new players to play, even a seasoned player of Warcraft3 find it pretty hard and need months of practicing to become an ordinary player, not to mention those young players who never touched Warcraft3 before; second, for old Dota players, the old and familiar sound of each hero vanquishes, instead are newly created heroes that lack the lore backup them from Warcraft, I don't know how other old gamers feel about it, to me, it's a completely different game, lost the contest by his young and more energetic grandson--League of Legends. Sorry to say, but the golden age of Dota has faded. Dota 2 is merely a replacement of the greater past. When we play it, what haunts in our head are "The night beckons.""Us here to obey.""I'm here, as always." No...not really, you are not always here. Farewell.

review: I only recommend this game based on the FACT that this is the most generous Free2Play title you're ever going to find. The amount of content and support here is insane. There's a reason why seemingly millions of people play this game for years on end. Chances are, you'll like it if you're looking for a free game. But if you're looking for a free game, chances are you're young, unemployed, with tons of time to kill, which is what most of the fanbase here is. It also happens to be the only kind of person who can LEARN this game properly. You'll need months and hundreds of hours before you're any good. I want to say that, besides all that, it's a great game, but I can't. I've dabbled in DOTA when it was just starting to get attention. It was the only reason I installed Warcraft 3 a second time. My overall distaste for RTS games is actually not a factor here, as DOTA has very little in common with the game it was built on top of. No, my problem with the game is almost every core mechanic it expects you to learn is not fun at all to implement into your sessions. I disagree completely with the tasks at hand that are in every MOBA out there. I don't like the pointless, constant, neverending flow of creeps. I don't like how everything is a race to earn EXP at the fastest rate instead of using actual tactics, and if you die or leave the proximity of a fight for 60 seconds, you'll never catch up to the enemy leveling so you better just give up. The item shops are super convoluted and have nonsensical upgrade paths. I don't like the ESSENTIAL systems of "last hits" and "denying", as they make no god damned sense. Killing your own infantry so that the enemy doesn't get the EXP is LUDICROUS! It's the dumbest videogame logic I have ever witnessed and I can't get behind it. If all this stupid crap were removed, I feel like we would be left with a fun game, but perhaps that game has already been done elsewhere, like the PVP arena battles in Guild Wars. I just feel like if this were simplified down to heroes battling each other directly with their core abilities, I'd have a good time. It's so beautiful. So well crafted. So much innovation in the networking features. Presentation is tops. Epic as all hell. Everything you could want. It's a shame that all this is pasted onto a core game that is incredibly busted and dumb.

review: Do not play this game unless you have already been playing it for 2 years or more. As a new player YOU WILL get matched against players with 2000 games or more experience, and YOU WILL get matched with players who have 100 games or less even after years of playing, and no matter how good or bad you are YOU WILL STILL LOSE about 50% of the time unless you have 4 more friends who play with you every game. This game is JUST AS BAD as LoL and HoN in every aspect. PEOPLE WILL rage quit, go afk, feed on purpose, give up after first blood. The game is so well balanced most games will have 1 team with LESS THAN 50% of the other teams score, NOT JUST IN KILLS, but in experience and gold earned also. If you are thinking of switching to DOTA 2 from LoL or HoN, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, it is the same game with the same issues and you will be 2 years behind the learning curve. If you have never played a MOBA before, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, more experienced DOTA 2 players will just treat you like garbage for your first 300-500 games and make you want to not play.

review: I'm not a huge fan of MOBA's, but I do enjoy League of Legends very much and iv'e played Smite when it first came out. Like most MOBA's, the community can be cruel and insane at times, torching you for the simplest mistakes. Neat and interesting abilities that can be even complicated the first time you use them, this game has a lot of replay, giving you the choice to play many many heroes. Unless you like competition and a fierce community, stay away from Dota and try LoL or another MOBA, but you should still give it a try, play a bot game or two and feel the game. No Pay 2 Win as its a official steam game, and a very successful one. You can earn and buy costumes and cosmetics through playing the game and buying them with real money. If you feel up to it, you can also trade unwanted cosmetics for ones you want through the steam trading system. Personal Rating: 3.5/5

For 2014 the game I have already dedicated about 300+ rounds of play to is DOTA2. If you're a fan of team vs team games; This is the game to play. I'd love to play this game professionally in tournament style and make my way into The International - DOTA2's highest paying tournament for millions of dollars.

review: This game is dumb. No charm of the original WC3 game. Models are outdated, buggy, and sometimes just boring. LIttle to no equipment for other heroes, while some have 6 different sets. Will literally make you rage and wish you could kill a man with nothing but your bare hands. But this game will also bring you close to your friends. Like, that special gay close. Like so close to your friend who picks CM every game for you and you just wanna stroke his ear and say, "Thanks baby, I wanna do something special for you now." still the game sucks. I hate it. 10/10 would play again.

review: A wonderous 5 lane world of 20 kill supports, 1 v 5 heroics and lost russians. Each game guarantee's: -A noob who does exactly the opposite of what the team suggests, this is a great time to practise reverse psychology. -At least some form of Russian, be it english players that enjoy their newly learned dialect or a "Genuine player of Russia" who due to their 3rd world conditions are obviously too famished to actually play the game properly. -A pudge pro that insists on mid and then deems it a great time to showcase exactly how not to attempt to hook players for all of 27 minutes while the other steam rolls you entirely. -A support with a Dagon. With numerous repetition of the line "BUT I THOUGHT HE WAS GETTING AWAY" while he is now 4 levels above the Medusa right next to him. In summary this game will make you very... very... angry. A lot of the time. I can't go a single day without playing it.

review: The MOBA equivalent of getting kicked in the , repeatedly, for hours on end, until little remains of what could resemble genitalia. However, the truly astonishing part, is that this wasn't torture, but done through your own volition; you wanted to made miserable. Hell, you probably paid for it a little. Every game brings such traumatic pain and anguish, this game should be considered a war crime. Psychologists have analyzed why DOTA players put themselves through this kind of Hell, and all tests have come up inconclusive. This game has caused the perpetual virginity of thousands of people. Friendships have been ruined, careers lost, and marriages have ended, all because of this game. Dear God, get rid off this awful blight on humanity. Only the dead can know peace from this evil... 10/10 I recommend this game to all my friends!

review: When I first started DOTA 2 my brain had downs, I had no idea what I was doing at all... But I soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying and the learning the heroes (All heroes are free!). Before I knew it, I was performing better and better. I focused and kept learning little by little and BINGO! I got pretty good. You will encounter a lot foreigners good or bad but most of them can understand english. There's a lot of great people in the game and some are trolls and jerks but it's fun . I recommend this game for everybody! If you play LoL stop, unistall, and play dota 2. That game is canerous especially it's community has grown to filth I played since 2009 it was a great MOBA for many years until this game came out and perfected the orignal one(Warcraft III Mod). It's really hard at first I know that but give it a try and learn.

review: I can say that this game is kind a good. I really love it and i continue playing it. I think every gamer who like strategy and mmo rpg games will love this game. So many things to do and learn, so meany characters and items, so many item builds. However you can see a lot of awesome animations and effects. You can explore the map at day and night. Also this game is not pay to win like other games, You just pay for character appearance ( if you would like ). I was a LoL gamer but when i tryed Dota 2 i thought that i left 5 years of playing kiddy game. This is an EPIC game with a lot of PVP and PVE and TM ( TeamWork). My rate is 10/10

review: This game improved so much since it was released on the beta. There are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as DOTA 1. I know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in DOTA 2 and I think it will help new comers. I know some people who play LOL might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. Its like comparing COD and Battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, I think bot of them are good) Give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. I think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. Try it out, its free and badass,A great PvP game that offers some of the most intriguing and nuanced team combat around. The Best Game Ever

If you answered yes to any of the above questions then this game was essentially made for you. Now I could spend hours verbally blowing this game and telling you all the reasons you should play it and love it or you can just download it yourself you lazy sod and learn why it's the most played game on steam.

review: Dota. Dota. Dota, Dota, Dota Dota Dota Dota. What do you know about Dota? I know that it's the best competitive teamplay game in existance. Fun may or may not be found there, but once you get good, sure as hell you will have satisfaction from outplaying these pesky Queen of Pain and Invoker with your Earth Spirit or rampaging through the enemy team in Chronosphere as a Void who was allowed to farm for a little too long. You will have fun sometimes. You will get mad. You will get mad a lot. And you'll love it. 11/10 would sell my soul for.

review: One of the best Esport games in history. A lot of people have problems with it's steep learning curve. It'll be hard for really long time to compete with veterans but it's an Esport game so that's what you should expect from games of this type. Also prepare for flaming from Russians. They think everyone know their language so they select all servers to 'communicate' with wider range of people.

review: A great game to think that it only started as a mod ^^ Played it at the time, still playing, one of my favourite games ever. + Teaches teamwork. + Recuires multitasking, map awarnes, calling misses, ETC. + Great to play with friends, makes losing actually still quite fun (as long as you are not curp stomped). + Fun way to meet new people ;D - Takes a lot of your time, why? Addictive as hell... - Like all MOBA games (even this the great ancestor) community can be quite punishing. - Steep learning mountain to climb.

Before you can properly assess this game, you must first climb the highest mountain while your consciousness is implanted into a robot at the bottom of the sea. The moment you realize the gold that this game achieves is the very same moment that you become one with the greater knowledge, so please wrap yourself in this higher power by becoming one with the Dota 2.

review: Dota2 is a gateway game of the worst kind. It's a bad game, a cluster of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive waifu ry and DARKNESS. The normal gamer can see this as the  it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the game itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad. However, these very aspects that try to smear over the  of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie, unsociable underageb& s who engage in every kind of ry both online and in the real world. The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the abilities, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole hero ry and everything about the Dota world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on revenge, and overall preachiness of the game make it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of  that makes little kiddies and underageb&  eat this  right the  up. Dota is basically THE series to attract the most hated game fanbase known to steam, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every gamer to troll the  out of this game and everyone who likes it, and ensure that no Dota threads ever encourage the newfriends to show their faces here. In short: 10/10 game, would buy again.

Why would they need something new when theyve got this incredibly deep, rewarding multiplayer experience? Rating: 9.9

review: I remember the first time I played a MOBA; back in Starcraft, playing AoS which was later re-made in Warcraft. Aeon of Strife, AOS, that's how we came to know games of its like. Afterwards, Tides of Blood popularized the custom map variant and the original Dota and it's ilk *About 100 different or so versions of it* spammed the custom map channels. Until All Stars came in and swept the competitions. Now we see Dota 2 here, nearly a decade later and I have to say... It's even better than it was back then. The balance now is impeccable (Not withstanding popular competitive picks), the community is friendlier (Than LoL or HoN's to say the least) and although more complex than its competitors, the game gives you everything from the start. It's a difficult game to be sure, but as a RTS-RPG hybrid, it contains depths of strategy, tactical complexity, and split-second reflex gameplay that is sure to delight and impress any gamer. Dota 2 is a highly polished e-sport designed to draw in and awe. Is it perfect? No. Is it good? You bet. For those of you who don't know what Dota 2 is, Dota is a mobile online battle arena, otherwise known as MOBA. You control a singular hero and play in a team of five heroes, who's task is to protect their ancient (home base) all while laying siege to the enemy ancient. The team who destroys the opposing ancient, wins the game. In conclusion, I highly recommend anyone to check this game out. You won't be disappointed.

Russians are a problem, but you get over it eventually... and yeah, let's hope you have some strong friends because after this you'll be screaming their head off. But who am I kidding, if you're playing this, you don't have friends.

The continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. It's hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. It took me a long time to warm up to, but I'm helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. If you can spare the time - play it.

review: Dota 2 is one of the deepest and most interesting games that I have ever played. Sure it's difficult to learn, but once you've grasped the basics, Dota will provide hours upon hours of entertainment. The learning curve is undeniably steep and the community unforgiving of your mistakes, but the game itself is worth the pain. I highly recommend learning Dota 2 with a friend-it will be much more enjoyable. On the question of LoL or Dota: Both games are great and I recommend you to start the game that your friends are playing. After all, MOBAs are team games, not solo efforts.
game-hours: 608.4
review: I wouldn't recommend this game. After a huger then huge learning curve, you will log in, be online, and  up our matches, because you suck. After proving you suck, we will still have to play with your noob  for at least 30 mins. So you will get hated on. You will get reported, you will be in waiting queues forever. After about half a year you might grow some ing sense and skills to play decent, but I doubt it, and even then you'd be no match compared to the OG's.. So, stick to CSS dude, go play TF2, have a nice Portal experience or something... Just keep away from this game, it'll damage you beyond repair, and you will intoxicate our DOTA2 experience, and besides that, your just too dumb. Now get lost. Move!

review: Who would have thought that a mod for a popular strategy game would give birth to a subgenre of strategy games that ended up as the most popular and most prestigious form of competitive PC gaming. The original DOTA was a mod for Warcraft 3. Dota 2 is the sequel where most of the original heroes made a comeback despite the game being developed by Valve themselves instead of Blizzard. Two teams of 5 competiting to bring down the enemy team's Ancient. Simple sounding, but Dota 2 is not a simple game. It is probably the most difficult and most aggressive MOBA currently. The game itself is good. Graphics are nice and most PC rigs would be able to support it nicely. It however, takes time, A LOT of time to learn to play each one of the heroes properly. When things go down to the wire, it gets really, really hairy. Only the ones who make the most of what items they have and using the right abilities at the right time would come away as the victors. And when you do win, it is one of the best feelings in the game. The heroes or champions in the game are as different as they can be from one another and each one of them has a different job to do in the in a team. Not only that, they do look awesome as well. But Dota 2 isn't perfect, far from it, actually. Mostly it has to do witht the community. You think CoD's fanbase was bad, play Dota and you'll think different. Trolls, whiners, noobs and really dumb people are common in the public matches and it is them who bring down the fun experience in the game. Also, Dota 2 is a free game so you can bet people with bad connections or bad PCs would try to play the game though and what happens is a cluster**** of annoyances as certain heroes and their abilities require precise timing. Dota 2 isn't the best game of all time (definitely not). But it is a timesink for those who'd love a challenge or want to be a part of something large in the PC gaming community. I personally spent more than 300 hours in the game as of this review and I am thinking of taking a break as Dota made me neglect my other games. But whether I quit or not, Dota 2 was fun while I still played it, despite experiencing plenty crappy moments.

review: 75% of characters look like undead piles of crap and all the human females look like s... 10/10 In seriousnes, most of the charcters look pretty cool, even the undead ones, no hold backs on the female humans looking like s though. I'm not really a big fan of the game or any MOBA game as a matter of a fact, but when trying this game out I actually got pretty addicted to it for a while. I recommend trying this with friends though, makes the expirence better and gives less worries of meeting a stranger whom is gonna curse you out for eating his tree that one time... I recommend trying out the hero named "Sniper" if you're gonna play the game for the first time.

review: Dota has become one of the most popular games ever, being one of the Top 10 most played games on Steam. Here's why. The learning curve. Some might say this is the worst part of the game but almost no one can deny that it's what gets you addicted and stuck in this world of heroes, might and magic. Like any traditional MOBA, each hero has it's own distinctive role from support to carry and many other positions. Dota focuses mainly on building your character up in the beginning of a match and then through teamwork and strategy, going head to head with the other team and "pushing" (Destroying the enemy team's towers, creeps, etc.) all the way to their "ancient" leading to its destruction and victory. It might sound strange to someone who may be unfamiliar with MOBA style games but, it's an art and science within itself, with millions of diehard fans constantly urging themselves to become better and more efficient with their playing styles. With the inclusion of the 100+ available characters, there are at least five different ways to play each character meaning there is an insane amount of replayability already staked onto the stellar online multiplayer experience of both casual, experienced and professional Dota 2 players. The game's learning curve will take at least 40 hours of in-game time and potentially hours of research outside of the game (YouTube, Wikis, etc.) which can seem like a major turn off for a game such as this. However, there is an offline practice mode available for new players to hone their skills and find out what characters they enjoy playing the most. I've read the other reviews for Dota 2 and found that many people are upset with Russians and Chinese going on US servers, causing a language barrier and potentially losing games because of that. I will admit, this is a problem that will hopefully be fixed in the near future, as it is rather problematic and detrimental to emerging victorious in a Dota 2 match. In conclusion, Dota 2 is a great game and has become one of my personal favourite games of all time. The amazing diversity of every match, the fantastic community and the overall amount of content being added every month is astonishing. Plus, it's a free to play. Not a pay to win, it's legitamately a F2P game. What do you got to lose? Give Dota 2 and try and find out what everyone is talking about. You won't regret it.

review: Dota 2. Better than LOL or HON by almost every extent possible in my opinion. The graphics are beautiful, you can deny, slower pace gameplay, more impacts when you die. All of them have a problem with their Community. You get everything for free and only have to pay for announcers, hero skins, and other stuff that only affects looks. Not Pay To Win. It's Play To Win. Get it now. It's free. The reason people don't like Dota 2 over LoL is because "it's too slow and harder for them" or because "it has a higher skill curve".

The game is bright and colorful and with a huge variety of characters to play and has easily become one of the biggest played multiplayer strategy games I've seen.

review: A RTS game which play by 10 players,divided by 2 teams ( Radiant and Dire) This game is so excited because of there are so many heroes which their skills are so variants,such as stun,kill,healing,disabling and so on. DoTA is the game like chess and soccer, because you must use strategy to defeat your enemy,not just kill,looking for gold. For amateurs this game can use build help if the amateurs dont know what item must they build. Remember,in this game you must be patient and cooperative when your teammates doing some fault because in this game there are winner and losser,the way you prove that you are pro is by cover up your teammates. I very reccomend this game not only just a guy can play this game,also a girl like me can also play too. End of my talk, I LOVE DoTA2

review: DOTA 2, this name needs no explanation, and yet, so much explanation. To say that this game has not changed my life would be a lie. DOTA 2 has proven that it can both create and destroy life, in term qualify itself as God. To speak lowly of DOTA 2 is heresy, but I am a heretic by default, a devil's advocate who speaks out against DOTA 2. DOTA, its predecessor, was an amazing map that I used to play with friends, DOTA 2 is just a target jokes nowadays. Boasting a lovely all Russian Matchmaking, with off-branches such as Turkey Matchmaking and Brazilian (HueHueHue) Matchmaking. If you wish to play DOTA 2, all I can say is go ahead. It's an amazing game that deserves so much more, a one man's story. It's you, and them, your team's just a meat shield. Don't let others coerce you into wasting your precious, hard-farmed gold on those pesky wards or, god forbid, support someone. Remember, chicks dig carries, so always pick them. Plz add VRZO, pokemonftw. 420SwagYOLO4EVER!

review: Ruins lives. prevented me from studying for exams. my mummy got me a fedora and some dank after i got my 1st rampage which was 1 min in coz im asian. the long seating hours made my lower body jelly and immovable. plus the loong hours of masturbating over io made me run out of , thus making me unable to reproduce. this game made me learn 5 languages in 1 game when i selected language preferences to english and got russians, indians, koreans and other various languages. the dota community is so friendly that they called me a noob when i was carrrying the team and lead them to victory. this game is reccomended for people who have no life and dont give a  about wat happens in life. also good for people who like dank and porn bcause u can smoke this game and wank over it like i do. the flavour of the doritos and mountain jew when playing this game is so amazing it makes my brain fart.

Once you learn the heroes, and get a good play style down, and learn the gear choices, its a lot of fun. The game flow is better as well, and having a courier is awesome. The graphics and physics handle really nice, and the heroes all look way better as well. All in all, a great game, and lots of fun.

review: An interesting proposition. Unlike most games, this is the gift that keeps on giving. Over the lifetime of dota 2 many additions have been made, and many continue to come along. Dota 2 is based on an old warcraft mod, and on a weekly and monthly basis, valve continues to update and add features to the game. Aside from being a lucrative scene for competitive gamers, it also has a steep learning curve and endless combinations as far as team compisitons go. If you aren't the kind of person who likes to play versus other players, the game allows you to play cooperatively against bots. And to further add to the lifespan of the game, the developers release festive events every 3-5 months to add something extra for players to do. As the game is free to play, this game can potentially net you some gains in the form of the marketable items you recieve for playing.

review: Dota 2 for me has set the standard for MOBA's. The level of detail gone into this is brilliant. The characters are well thought out with hilarious quotes and rivalry with the combat being fluid and fast paced. The only downside to this that I would say is the matchmaking. There is a steep learning curve when it comes to playing proficiently and already seasoned players do not take lightly to new players. Beware of this, and if this kind of stuff doesn't phase you then match-make away!

The community may be fierce at times, especially when you are new but once you log a few hours and get the base mechanics under the knee the game and its community actually become pretty enjoyable. Serves to provide many laughs and WTF moments and is best enjoyed in a party with people who will be willing to help you get through the first few games.

review: A couple of years ago, a friend of mine started me on this game, and, boy, what a ride. I won't get into the details of the game, but there are always a few tournaments going on that you can watch as well as the Free To Play documentary (on the first edition of The International Dota 2 tournament, look it up on Youtube), to get a good feel on the game. If you're still interested after that, if you have friends to play with, if you have patience to learn, and if you have time to spare (each game lasts 40 minutes on average), I wholeheartedly recommend you try it. This is what competitive video games are all about. It is daunting at first, has a steep learning curve, but every day I'm playing I'm learning something new and that is rewarding by itself. It is a team-based game so you'll get your fair share of frustrations, but as long as you be smart about your decisions, salvage every mistake as a learning experience, and most importantly have fun doing so, this is your game of the forever.

review: Possitives: Have you played any other MOBA before playing Dota2? Well allow me to introduce you to the first son of the MOBA genre's father father, the one that started it all, Aeon of Strife. Dota 2 is a well balanced and evenly paced MOBA which offers a lot of variety when it comes to Heroes to play and items to make your hero stronger. The game has quite a steep learning curve, but once you feel like you've gone over that curve then the game becomes so enjoyable especially with friends. The game has now been released and is F2P, so what do you have to lose? Negatives: The community is quite hostile to anyone who doesn't play very well, sadly. A lot of Russian players don't even want to play with other Russians and instead choose the 'English' language preference and end up screwing over the people who actually do speak English and causes communication issues. The toxic behavior some people in this game can be unreal, and they will sometimes do whatever it takes to make your game horrible. Yeah, you can mute them and try to ignore them but surely they would be inclind to just help the enemy team by feeding themselves to them just because you done one thing wrong that they didn't like. But that's why you should try to play with as many friends as possible, in order to minimise this issue.

review: Welcome friends and all to the greatest game of the millenium. By the year 2030, dota 2 will have infiltrated into mainstream media and become the game to decide all conflicts and terrorities. A frantic rush to recruit all the top players was undertaken by the nations. A great battle was sieged and only one victor emerged . With excellent teamwork, vocabuary, the Philippines quickly became the sole ruler of the Earth. I have returned from this apocalypse and now I regularly play and hone my Dota 2 skills for the day when the Philippines will rise against us. 10/10 would play again.

review: DOTA 2, the resurrection of the old classic MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) game that started the craze. I played in the original WC3 version ages ago, and it was interesting to give it a try. The game has various "really-not-warcraft-heroes-srs" like "not-Sylvanas" and "not-Arthas" and a variety of more original heroes to play. Free to play, and easy to get hold of as Valve throws a few dozen copies at me every now and again. The skinny: 8/10 if you're looking for a tree-harvest avoid-the-murderer simulator. I'd give it about 3/10 for gameplay if you want a MOBA. 1/10 for community - and that's because a) some friends of mine play it, and b) there's a lot of Steam Workshop content. The good: There's a lot of Steam Workshop support. It's free. The bad: From what I've seen, completely unbalanced player combat, which narrows down to who gets the first hit in, and has little to do with actual skill-based play. Majority of the time is spent cutting trees, but game is advertised as a "battle arena". Before the inevitable "UR butthurt" complaints, I'm not usually the poor sod being killed. I tend to play support, and hang back a lot, watching the tree cutting competition. The ugly: I'm not sure what it is that entices some players to this, but it's a harsh, bitter community that judges you even before you've had a chance to speak, or played a single game. Doesn't matter who you are. For those who I speak to, I'm pretty hard-skinned, and I can appreciate a good troll. This isn't that. This is hate, and there's almost nothing to help narrow it down. Some people keep playing it religiously, however. Perhaps there's something magical that they found in this tree-cutting simulator, because that's what the majority of the game time is spent doing. Then someone finds someone else, gets a stun off, and kills the other party before they get control of their champion back. The player who gave "first blood" to the enemy team is then reported for feeding, then their team quits, and you queue back up for another rousing tree harvest simulation. Overall, I'd recommend other games in the same vein. Because this one is pretty bad. In a game that's meant to be about community involvement, DOTA 2 doesn't have anything to entice me back. If anything, it has things to push me away - it skips past the ribbing and trolling and dives straight into XBox Live chat styled hate. For some, it's addictive. For me, it's not.

review: Most games reward the player to some degree, when they have sunk hundreds of hours into them. Dota 2 is the only time sink I have experienced where you get absolutely nowhere for your troubles... thanks to a heavily broken matchmaking system that can take forever to queue up a game (as I am writing this, a 5 stack for a ranked match can take up to 20 minutes!). Dota 2 is less about how skilled you are, and more about who you know. If you don't have at least a dozen experienced friends who are consistently competent, prepare to queue with some of the worst players you have ever played a multiplayer game with. As an added bonus, you will often get players who do not speak your language -- even in ranked games! I have often wished that I never started playing this game...

I appreciate some people trying to make the game a good game but the game is simply overrun by immatures or people who just wants to rage at others. As for people who are curious if they should play this game or not. My answer is: go ahead since it's free to play. As for those who just wants to have fun, this game is not for you. People who play this game is not about fun but about winning. If you plan on having fun, I suggest go get other game or people will just insult you in many different crappy languages (that doesn't even exist).

review: Dota 2 Dota 2 is a F2P MOBA game made by Valve and was in beta for a long time until it became free to the public in 2013. Dota 2 requires alot of skill and it isn't a game where ou jump right in to the game like TF2. Valve intended that players should find their favourite hero and learn tacticts with that hero however most players don't get that and hate on it for childish or just ride the hate wagon. Let's get to the game now... You start in the same map each time (And I would appreciate some more maps). Each side looks similar and there are 3 main roads to each team's spawn but they are protected by minions, towers and players, the objective is to destroy the towers and get to the enemy base and destroy this core thingamajic. You start leveling up your character and your abilities/hero gets stronger and it's key to the game. You will really need to play as a team rather than a lone wolf and will require you to speak with your teammates and not expect them to know your stun and attack plan. I will give this game a 4.7/5. I think it's a good game but it might need some new maps.

review: A wonderous 5 lane world of 20 kill supports, 1 v 5 heroics and lost russians. Each game guarantee's: -A noob who does exactly the opposite of what the team suggests, this is a great time to practise reverse psychology. -At least some form of Russian, be it english players that enjoy their newly learned dialect or a "Genuine player of Russia" who due to their 3rd world conditions are obviously too famished to actually play the game properly. -A pudge pro that insists on mid and then deems it a great time to showcase exactly how not to attempt to hook players for all of 27 minutes while the other steam rolls you entirely. -A support with a Dagon. With numerous repetition of the line "BUT I THOUGHT HE WAS GETTING AWAY" while he is now 4 levels above the Medusa right next to him. In summary this game will make you very... very... angry. A lot of the time. I can't go a single day without playing it.

review: The MOBA equivalent of getting kicked in the , repeatedly, for hours on end, until little remains of what could resemble genitalia. However, the truly astonishing part, is that this wasn't torture, but done through your own volition; you wanted to made miserable. Hell, you probably paid for it a little. Every game brings such traumatic pain and anguish, this game should be considered a war crime. Psychologists have analyzed why DOTA players put themselves through this kind of Hell, and all tests have come up inconclusive. This game has caused the perpetual virginity of thousands of people. Friendships have been ruined, careers lost, and marriages have ended, all because of this game. Dear God, get rid off this awful blight on humanity. Only the dead can know peace from this evil... 10/10 I recommend this game to all my friends!

review: When I first started DOTA 2 my brain had downs, I had no idea what I was doing at all... But I soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying and the learning the heroes (All heroes are free!). Before I knew it, I was performing better and better. I focused and kept learning little by little and BINGO! I got pretty good. You will encounter a lot foreigners good or bad but most of them can understand english. There's a lot of great people in the game and some are trolls and jerks but it's fun . I recommend this game for everybody! If you play LoL stop, unistall, and play dota 2. That game is canerous especially it's community has grown to filth I played since 2009 it was a great MOBA for many years until this game came out and perfected the orignal one(Warcraft III Mod). It's really hard at first I know that but give it a try and learn.

review: If you're jumping in this game alone, you're gonna have a bad time. DoTA2 is a team based game, if you're not playing it with a team mindset, you're wrong, and you're impression of the game will be wrong. The character select screen is incredibly daunting when you first start, and most of the characters are unique in their abilities, it takes many hours (days?) to even consider yourself a rookie in this game. After a week of playing nothing but 'Least Played' mode, you'll be pretty in the know of most of the characters, it's going to take watching youtube guide videos, experimenting, careful study of the tournament games and overall pure luck on who you get teamed up with (god help you if you're playing solo) to be able to win a game and even understand why you did. In short, what you need is; Trustworthy teammates, lots of free time, dedication, the ability to adapt well, and a looped playlist of 'Eye of The Tiger' and 'You're The Best'. Then maybe, you'll be considered a "nub" that won't get reported.

review: Gamenya bagus banget, grafik luar biasa dengan gameplay sama kayak dota 1. Nilai tambah disini karena steam yang menopang game dota 2, dimana keamanannya luar biasa ketat, namun jadi boomerang sendiri yang kadang dimana keamanannya malah sedikit "menggangu" player, karena tiap ada hal yg berhubungan sama security harus nunggu berapa hari Di Indonesia mungkin kurang ada wadah buat nopang player yang  game ini, mungkin lebih ke akses pembelian barang, dan lain-lain. Diharapkan steam bisa membantu player Indonesia yang ingin menyalurkan aktifitasnya agar menjadi lebih mudah didalam dota maupun steam Overall good banget!!

review: Really outstanding game. Definitely give it a try sometime. Outstanding how they managed to make such a big and difficult game `easy`, try to dont get confused and fight through it. Worth the time, practice by playing with friends, watching games on YouTube(I really like PurgeGamers) or just watch a random pub. All of that is really instructive and helps you become a better player. PS: Playing the tutorial really helps.

review: Dota 2 is a game played by ten players divided by two sides, the Dire and Radiant with 5 players each. There are over 100 heroes to choose from. There are three types of heroes: Strength, Agility and Intelligence. Strength heroes are more on physical abilities and tough to deal with. Agility heroes are more on damaging and ints are more on supports.

review: I began playing Dota 2 at a time when I thought "MOBA" games were the weakest of the game genres. I always thought it was weird to play a game like this and whenever I saw gameplay videos of Dota 2 - I had no idea what the heck was going on. It never occured to me though, that this game would have baited me in for more hours of playtime. When I first started Dota, there was some training missions I had to go through. These explained the basics pretty well to me and eventually, I thought I knew what I was doing. Also, I also thought there would've been some sort of story mode (Due to the way the training was presented). Unfortunately, there was none but I could see some potential for a story-like mode. Although during my first public matchup, I did feel like quiting because I really did have no idea what I was doing and my "teammates" were complaining about how bad I was TO THE OTHER TEAM (That's right; the other team/our enemies). Then they all began calling me a noob. The amount of insults I received were terrible, but eventually I had a few other friends play the game along with me and that's when things began to change. That's when Dota 2 became something I actually loved to play because of friends, and because my friends and I got better. It came to a point when we started to insult the enemy team whenever we trashed them. Everytime we do that, it would just end up with us having fun regardless of us winning or not. That's what Dota 2 is for me: having a good time with friends and having fun. I then tried LoL and I came to the conclusion: Dota 2 > LoL So since this game is free to play, I highly recommend it. It's free so I say, "Why not?". It's best played with people you know, after all- it is a team based game. There are more things to talk about in Dota, but if you want to know what they are, play the game. Experience it.

game-hours: 436.6
review: Wonderful game. Very entertaining and the atmosphere is a little more relaxed then the other popular mobas. The beauty of this game is that it tends to emphasize individual initiative more than your ability to emulate the latest guides. As cool as that is nothing really compares to the strong sense of nostalgia players of Dota 1 will feel while playing since the game barrows as heavily from the original as is legally possible. That said you absolutely have to play with at least two friends otherwise you're playing experience will go to hell very quickly 1 - No regionalization of servers - ae: Theres going to be a lot of psychotic chittering mic spam and people who think they speak English are just going to shriek at you with preposterous accents. Unless reliving you're favorite moments of Full Metal Jacket strikes you as being the epitome of strategic entertainment you'll want to queue with some friends. 2 - Self Imposed Dictators - ae: Everyone knows the self important team leader type. Some stranger you have never met, seen or heard of who feels that its perfectly acceptable for him to tell you what skills you're going to pick during ability draft ext. Unless you enjoy angry, nasally congested, petty and vindictive mic spam you'll want to grab some friends. 3 - Steam is still technically PG-7 - ae: Only the characters in your games are allowed to curse. Stating to another player "wow you sure suck at dota!" is a punishable offence. This issue is compounded by the fact that the ban system is automated. A player will automatically be banned based on the number of reports they accrue cross scaled by time they accrued them in. Fortunately I have managed to avoid any of the chat bans but some of my friends havent been so lucky... Consider the math. One in four people on the internet may be defective. Four reports within a 2 hour period may get you banned. You play three 40 minute games. How is that going to shake out for you in the long run? It may not happen to you and it hasnt happened to me but sooner or later you are going to get flagged and auto punished by the assbrains and this could compromise youre whole steam account. You dont have to be a victim of an injustice to speak against it and I believe flatly that automated oversight is as dangerous as no oversight at all. Dangerous and foolish business. So like I said, bring at least two friends with you or prepare for a pretty hellacious experience. Otherwise its very fun.

review: If you are new to PC gaming or RTS/MOBA games, DotA 2 will appear as impenetrable as a wall. The learning curve for this game is by far the worst element of MOBAs. However, those of you with some experience with RTS games or are willing to learn will find the teamplay experience of DotA 2 an enjoyable. Would recommend to anyone with a competent PC and drive to play competitively.

review: Dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably wont suit you if youre looking to play casually. Theres a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But once you start to learn its secrets, theres a wild and exciting variety of play here thats unmatched, even by its peers. Its a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that its completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isnt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. May the best team win. PS. Dont play with Russians

review: Defense of the Ancients 2. Probably the game that has sapped more time out of my life than anything else, for a good reason at least. This is the first MOBA I have played and by far the best. While this game can be so infuriating with its RNG heroes that I can blame every time I die, PA, Void, Troll, pretty much anything with inbuild crits/evasion/bash, even Sange, Halberd and SnY slow if you are really into blaming the RNG on your demise. So what's the appeal in a game, with a limited number of heroes, however it was 109 so that's quite a lot to call it limited, but it's the same concept every game, you and 4 russians must defeat 5 russians on the enemy team. Sorry for sterotypes, but the primary object is a 5 vs 5 game, it has transition phases, at the start is the Laning phase, the objective is to gain farm, and deny farm. Gank, and countergank, pull and stack. There is a lot to do and that just dictates the first 10 minutes of the game. Then teamplay, map awareness comes into play as the game continues. This addictive cycle will make you want to perfect your last hitting, your knowledge of the game, how to outplay your enemies and lead you to victory. You strive for victory every game. I don't exactly know how I came to spend so long on this game but I know for certain that it won't end anytime soon.

Really hope this does not become the norm for dota. Other than that, current meta is pretty stale with SF, sniper and jug in every game. Hope TI5 changes things up for the community. Side Note. Managed to learn fluent russian and tagalog in this 2 years. Who knew dota was a language simulator?

review: An interesting proposition. Unlike most games, this is the gift that keeps on giving. Over the lifetime of dota 2 many additions have been made, and many continue to come along. Dota 2 is based on an old warcraft mod, and on a weekly and monthly basis, valve continues to update and add features to the game. Aside from being a lucrative scene for competitive gamers, it also has a steep learning curve and endless combinations as far as team compisitons go. If you aren't the kind of person who likes to play versus other players, the game allows you to play cooperatively against bots. And to further add to the lifespan of the game, the developers release festive events every 3-5 months to add something extra for players to do. As the game is free to play, this game can potentially net you some gains in the form of the marketable items you recieve for playing.

review: Do you like MOBAs? Enjoy League of Legends or SMITE? Well this game is, of coruse, another MOBA. However it is also the ORIGINAL MOBA. One of the things you may love or hate about Dota is that there isnt really any sort on unfairness to new players beyond skill. If a person with 10,000 hours faces a player who has only 12 they have no different items, no different heroes, no different abilities. The veteran may have new aesthetic things but the only thing seperating them will be skill. If you're new to MOBAs I encourage you to try this one, they are very fun and are fortunately not pay to win.

review: "Welcome to Dota 2: You Suck" TL;DR : Amazing game, try it. I was never really the type of guy to play one game for prolonged periods of time, but there are exceptions. Dota 2 is one of them. I discovered this game through a friend, downloaded it, played it, immediately hated it, and everything about it. But not because it was a horrible game. I hated it because it was soul-crushingly cruel; coming from FPS games, I was tossed into the game with no idea on how to play passed last hitting. Even that, I couldn't do right. After about six hours of trying heroes, different lane combinations/strategies, and subsequently feeding, I essentially gave up on it. Three months later, I decided that I didn't give Dota the chance it deserved. I redownloaded it, studied up on guides, practiced for hours as one hero until I got it right, and I found that this game was much deeper than I had initially thought. I was a long-time FPS player, but I was familiar with League of Legends. In LoL, you're expected to push and harass; amass gold, gank and kill to win. Simple, right? So I thought the same should be done for Dota 2. Just push the lane until I win, that's how things are in League. I learned one thing after hours and hours of getting owned by Medium Co-Op bots: Dota 2 isn't LoL. Not even close. In LoL, it's basically a pushing contest with ganks thrown in. In Dota 2, I had to learn how to counter pick, orbwalk, gank, control creep waves, stack jungle camps, stack ancients with helm of the dominator, deny junglers EXP by placing wards in camps, harass without getting aggro, what heroes countered my heroes (all of them), which lanes are best for which heroes, learn when it's better to defend or trade towers, when to buy items like Hand of Midas. It's a daunting task for... anyone. To learn all of that at once would be nothing short of overwhelming. But you don't learn it all at once, you learn it through hours and hours of humiliation and practice. Then there are the heroes; I prefer Dota 2 heroes over LoL Champions. In LoL, they expect you to work for heroes or buy them right-out with real world money, the same for any cosmetic items you may want. Dota hands you all the heroes in the game for free, and any item you see in the shop can be earned (at random) through playing a match. The items are also tradeable. The champions in League were always so-so to me, I never really connected with them either because they looked cartoony to me or because they just simply didn't talk enough/have enough lines. Heroes in Dota are rather serious and usually have over a hundred lines each, which really lets you get a good feel for who they are. Note: I don't dislike LoL as I've played it myself, I just prefer Dota. Like I said before, I was a long-time FPS shooter before coming to Dota 2 (I still am, but I digress), and a part of why it was fun was because I had friends playing with me. Yeah, I get to talk to people I know while we kill random people online, that's fun. But it was just us going rogue and seeing who can kill more people than the other while we talk about mundane things. Dota 2 is different. My friends and I found that we *had* to rely on each other to win. We were given the opportunity to organize plans, tell each other what we were doing, if we needed a gank, ect. High fives went around the room whenever we won, and gaming with friends has never been more fun. Dota 2 is that rare type of game that doesn't hold your hand through it all; you don't just pick it up instantly. It demands your time and attention; it deserves it. Dota 2 has one of the steepest learning curves of any game, the steepest I've ever experienced. But that doesn't take away from how great the game is; even when you fail, it only feeds your desire to become better. You get to reading more guides, finding which heroes you play best with, getting rid of the ones you don't, learning of the strategies you could use, and learn how to talk with your team. Much more emphasis is placed on learning, practicing and communication than most games, but that only adds to the greatness. Dota 2 is needlessly cruel, but it may be the most fun you'll ever have. An amazing game, there's no reason why you aren't playing it. Give it a try, you won't be sorry when you come out of it.

review: This morning. I had the offer to either have sex or play Dota, I told her to wait until my game was done. Dota will make you turn down sex. You dont want an abandon and the possible Low priority hellish nightmare. Dont download this game. You'll say "Ill play one game and then go to bed" and then youll hear that spongebob voice say "9 hours later" and youll be like. Wtf where did my day go. Oh well I might as well stay up all day and play until tonight. Its a monster. A vicious circle. It awakens inside of you and makes you want to kick small children, beat your wife, masturbate and open every door in the house without washing your hands first. Save yourselves!@ You must look within! Have a life!

review: This game is extremely fun to play. Very team-based, but it still involves a lot of player skill. Don't be discouraged if you play your first match and die 20 times. This game has a very large learning curve, and you will become a good player with practice. I recommend playing a game with bots before you play against players. This gives you an idea of the mechanics of the game, as well as some of the heros' abilities. Overall, a very great game...and free!

It'll be hard for really long time to compete with veterans but it's an Esport game so that's what you should expect from games of this type. Also prepare for flaming from Russians. They think everyone know their language so they select all servers to 'communicate' with wider range of people.

review: A thoroughly intricate game with massive emphasis put on both skills and knowledge, it is not recommended for casual gamers or for those seeking for some "easy enjoyment". With over a hundred heroes with their own unique abilities and ways to specifically build and play said heroes, as well as their weaknesses and strengths when paired with other heroes, it is arguably comparative to dynamic chess, if not more complicated. Coupled with the iconic map as well as over a hundred items, there is no possible hope of having a sense of deja vu in this game. Of course, it entails an extremely steep learning curve but those who are willing to plough through the enourmous amounts of literature on the game and develop the necessary skills to make them competent will be greatly rewarded, albeit at the cost of their social lives (which has sadly happened to me). Of course, there is no end to learning in Dota. It is said that only 50% of the time is spent in the game. The rest is spent on reading up skills, builds, and other playstyles as well as watching videos of professionals duking it out with each other. Whether one derives enjoyment in self improvement through reading and watching is another matter. On the other hand, the infamous Dota community is a force to be reckoned with, as they are not so forgiving as communities of other games such as Starcraft. A piece of advice for newcomers-don't let negative comments put you off the game, everybody has to start somewhere.

review: Amazing gameplay yet with a huge learning curve. Definitely the best MOBA until this day. F2P, a fair game I'd say. There are 100+ heroes, and they're all balanced :) You can pay for hats/cosmetics, but they don't affect the game itself, but the game experience, as they only change the interface or your hero's outfit/animation/effect. "The workshop is strong with this one." -Yoda This game has a lot of attention, it is updated, fixed, balanced as fast as noticed necessary. There are also some cool events throughout the year. Englobes many different strategies and play styles that will widen your vision, clutch skills, teamwork and help you improve your prestidigitation. Requires training. If you want to play this game, you should be open-minded, willing to learn. You may play this for years and still be able to learn new stuff. All in all it's totally worth it. And yeah, we now have techies :D gg 10/10 Here's a good and detailed guide:

review: This is my review for one of my favorite games, Dota 2. Dota 2 is much like League of Legends, in the sense that it is a MOBA game, and the best MOBA out there. I have tried other MOBA's like LOL and Infinite Crisis, yet Dota 2 seems to prove its the best of them all. With over 100+ heros, Dota 2 is very diverse from other games where each hero has a great skill set and personality. Each hero serves a role in-game, and items are bought to your choosing or what best fits the hero. But the game is very balanced, because each skill and items can be countered by another skill or items. This makes each and every game unique and very stratigic based. After over 500+ hours in-game, I have come to love this game. You couldn't ask more from a free game, and it is very fun. Although it is free, the game does have a store where you can purchase items that change the appearance of your hero or HUD, to having the in-game voice somebody else, to making your own workshop content that could be put into game. Training for the game at first is very difficult, and alot to take in at first. But if you are persistant and play against bots to practice and better your skills, Dota 2 becomes one of the best games out there. Although the game is hard to understand at the start and the community is harsh on "noobs", with time this game is one of the best free games out there, and I highly recommend it.

review: This game has a lot of mechanics to it, be it controlling your character, managing other units at the same time. Game is hard to pick up, but worth learning the steep curve. If you've ever heard of League of Legends, this game is the hardcore mode of it. I would also confidently say that this game has a better community than League of Legends. Players are slightly more mature, and less hateful(?). I highly recommend this game to anybody that is looking for a game that has unlimited replay value, every game would be different, be it good games, or bad games. Sometimes you meet people who are rude, even though they did very badly in this game, sometimes you meet people that are actually doing what the team needs them to be doing.

review: When I first tried to play Dota 2 - around the same time it came out - I made the mistake of jumping right on in thinking I knew exactly what I was doing; obviously failing, I gave up and left about ten-minutes later, and throughout the course of a few months, I did this about five-times, because I wanted to understand what the big deal was about it, and why people found and still find this game so addictive. Up until recently, I hated it with a passion - not only for being killed over-and-over - but also for the sheer complexity of it overall, but, now I know, I wasn't taking the time to actually appreciate that complexity and realise that the learning curve was so full of depth, that if you set your mind to it, you can seriously enjoy it. Considering it's all based around one map, with the same game-mode every time, it's evident you'd think it'd get boring quickly - but you'd be wrong. Even though this is the case, there's so many different heroes, with different abilities, and different play-styles, it just makes it more enticing. It's also extremely strategic and teammates count for everything, which means you'll be working together and maybe even making some more friends. In conclusion: This game is worth every hour you're willing to invest into it, and if you enjoy learning, teamwork and have an addictive personality like me, then those hours are going to be endless.

review: A great game everyone should try, if they like League of Legends. Dota 2 is very similar to LoL in many ways, with the gameplay, shops, and graphics. Although, in LoL you have to buy items, and there is no way to trade or earn anything. Plus, in LoL you get skins. In Dota, you get sets, with individual pieces. You can mix and match to your heart's content, and get discounted items from the Steam Community Market. A must play game! 5 out of 5 stars! <3

In an effort to BALANCE heroes they completely destroyed my favorite hero Phantom Lancer to the point where he is almost unplayable. His new passive is useless, his new illusions useless, his new escape, ING USELESS. He didn't even need to be nerfed but apparently people buying gems or dust is too ing hard to understand. Meanwhile Drow and Axe remain near unchanged, Bane is OP with agh, and countless other heros remain the same. However they did nerf sniper, so thats nice. But I am still left wondering WHY PHANTOM LANCER, WHY OUT OF ALL PEOPLE WOULD YOU NERF HIM?!?!? I still recommend this game if you hate free time, yourself, anybody that doesn't speak English, the outside, and phantom lancer.

review: - Disclaimer - This review is for the Standard Edition of Batman: Arkham City, as of 08/08/2014 the review feature for said game has been disabled - This game is a bomb. I've never been deeply into the Batman franchise, never read any comics. Back in the day when it was on TV, "Batman - The Animated Series" gained my attention and never lost it. Batman:Arkham city is arguably the best, longest and most refined entry in this current series of games. It was thankfully developed by the Rocksteady studio under the guidance of Paul Dini, the main writer for the Animated Series. That whole thing plays like a Batman movie produced by Christopher Nolan. Talking about immersion. You will think you are batman. And that the events happening really occur TO YOU as the witnessing player. Stunning graphics, excellent sound design and a well rounded combat system give this game the edge it needs to turn you into a non lethal crime fighting combat machine. Comes with leaderboards,challenge maps and a multiplayer mode, nothing short of a single player campaign 30+ hours rich, set up in an open air prison this game shows, how deep the rabbit whole of human cruelty really goes. This is lore wise easyly one of the best games I've ever played in my whole life and I hope Rocksteady will soon deliver an Arkham City 2 after the letdown that was Arkham Origins. That what you get when you change a winning team, Eidos. If you like super heros, or punching based action games, or just good movies in general, pls do yourself a favour and buy this game. It'll be a sad story if you miss out on it.

review: Dota 2 has to be one of the most annoying, unlogical and stupid games of all time... but i still love it and play it almost every day. Bear in mind that i have only about 1000hrs on this game so my opinions and views are based only on the short time i have spent playing it (yes 1000hrs is not much game time at all) and i have only two bits of advice for some who is starting dota: 1. Stick at it, never give up, never give in. Comebacks are possible from almost any situation and although you will probably suck at first, only trying out the easiest of heroes - drow,riki,viper ect- soon you will become better, soon you will graduate from noob school and become novice level (like me), This happens at about 750hrs. 2. Dont rush for the same hero every time, even if you really like the hero dont do it. Picking every hero will teach you their abilities so you will know what each of them are capable of when you play with them or against them, so try randoming for the extra gold too. Do this until you have won a game as every hero or have played a hero atleast twice. Good luck and may Dendi be with you!

review: Real Time Strategy, micro one character, but strategize with bots, teammates, items, board features, and more! Replayability is like a physical sport, the game is different every time! One of the founders of the MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) genre! One of my favorites obviously!

review: This game, like most Moba games, is like an abusive partner, it will hurt you and make you feel awful so you tell yourself you will stop yourself and that you will put an end to the relationship but when you confront it it pulls you close and whispers in your ear while gently carressing your back that it is sorry for hurting you so you forgive it and the cycle continues. Great game

review: It's an amazing game - technically outstanding, showing all of Valve's usual polish and attention to detail, especially in the all-important multiplayer aspects. The continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. It's hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. It took me a long time to warm up to, but I'm helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. If you can spare the time - play it.

review: Dota 2 is a MOBA in which you don't need big bucks to be better than anyone else. A new player is just like an old player with the only differenece being the experience. The game is balanced to a very high degree and has a lot of tournements with stupidly large prize pools. The heroes are fun and unique, and the mechanics are great. In my opinion it is the best game in this genre so far.

review: This game, what can i say about it. It has a great selection of heroes, with an absolute perfect balance with each one. A excellent combat system that is as paramount as the original DEFENSE OF THE ANCIENT. A store that does not sell you items that will piss off the opponent. A map design that doesen't have those ing bushes where people can hide and jsut ing ambush you when you walk by like in LOL. And a ingame item system that can actually effect the outcome of the game. But what i hate about this game, i quite a big list. First, there is no surrender button, therefore if you know you are going to lose, you would need to sit there for twenty minutes getting killed over and over again till your ancient falls. Also the community surronding the game is somewhat of a , first there are the racist comments, then there are the spanish and the russians that can't even speak a word of english. But overall, this game I find, is quite good. Why don't you come down to the SEA servers, where everyone shuts up and plays the game

review: My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, "If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately." Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- "Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.

It's full of children, who never had a taste of Bill Gates lifestyle. The people who have had a taste of it will never set foot in the YMCA ever again. Ever. Unless, of course, they find that everyone is too good, and they leave to join the YMCA (Nothing against the YMCA, but Bill Gates' life is probably better).

I try to play at least one game a day and have been doing so for months and don't plan on stopping. Give the game a chance (more like 5) and I guarantee that you'll see why its the most played game on steam. be prepared to be dumbfounded as to why you were playing anything else. also a side note: the games free. steam is free. the only thing u have to lose from giving it a try is alil self respect in the beginning. but don't worry after one game where u actually do really good you'll feel like a million bucks.

review: Dota2 is the highly successful sequel to the WarCraft 3 custom map Defense of the Ancients. The original DotA was the parent of the MOBA genre that we enjoy today, and Dota2 has done an amazing job carrying on the legacy. If you were a fan of the original, or enjoy the current MOBA games on the market such as League of Legends, Heroes of Newerth, or Smite - Give Dota2 a chance. There are literally dozens of heroes to choose from, with multiple item builds for each hero. This can make the learning curve a little steep, but there is a decent tutorial system in place for helping new players learn. There is also an improved bot mode now, where you can practice against AI and hone your skills until you feel comfortable playing with other players. Ranked play adds a more competitive arena for players looking to improve and advance, and there is now a solo mid 1v1 mode to practice laning if you so choose. Dota2 is an ever evolving game, and growing into a prominent E-Sports arena. It isn't for everyone, and players that get frustrated easily might want to avoid it. The community can be a bit hostile towards newer players, but with some patience you can find great players and make friends that will help you through the process.

I skip out on breakfast trying to come up with new strategies to use in this stupid game. I go to class and get  grades because i'm thinking of good team comps to beat strangers that call my a  and try and impress my team who report me and tell me to uninstall. I go home and instead of doing something with my friends, if i had any, i play this ing game. As I am watching the stupid ing black volvo guy turn his head at me, i begin to think about my  life. I have no girlfriend, and I am still a virgin. I turn down requests to hang out with my real friends so I can gain imaginary points on this game. This game has ruined my ing life. There are so many characters and items and strategies. I ing love it. This is the most beautiful turd pile of a game I have ever played. 0/10 would recommend.

review: Wonderful game. Very entertaining and the atmosphere is a little more relaxed then the other popular mobas. The beauty of this game is that it tends to emphasize individual initiative more than your ability to emulate the latest guides. As cool as that is nothing really compares to the strong sense of nostalgia players of Dota 1 will feel while playing since the game barrows as heavily from the original as is legally possible. That said you absolutely have to play with at least two friends otherwise you're playing experience will go to hell very quickly 1 - No regionalization of servers - ae: Theres going to be a lot of psychotic chittering mic spam and people who think they speak English are just going to shriek at you with preposterous accents. Unless reliving you're favorite moments of Full Metal Jacket strikes you as being the epitome of strategic entertainment you'll want to queue with some friends. 2 - Self Imposed Dictators - ae: Everyone knows the self important team leader type. Some stranger you have never met, seen or heard of who feels that its perfectly acceptable for him to tell you what skills you're going to pick during ability draft ext. Unless you enjoy angry, nasally congested, petty and vindictive mic spam you'll want to grab some friends. 3 - Steam is still technically PG-7 - ae: Only the characters in your games are allowed to curse. Stating to another player "wow you sure suck at dota!" is a punishable offence. This issue is compounded by the fact that the ban system is automated. A player will automatically be banned based on the number of reports they accrue cross scaled by time they accrued them in. Fortunately I have managed to avoid any of the chat bans but some of my friends havent been so lucky... Consider the math. One in four people on the internet may be defective. Four reports within a 2 hour period may get you banned. You play three 40 minute games. How is that going to shake out for you in the long run? It may not happen to you and it hasnt happened to me but sooner or later you are going to get flagged and auto punished by the assbrains and this could compromise youre whole steam account. You dont have to be a victim of an injustice to speak against it and I believe flatly that automated oversight is as dangerous as no oversight at all. Dangerous and foolish business. So like I said, bring at least two friends with you or prepare for a pretty hellacious experience. Otherwise its very fun.

Theres a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But once you start to learn its secrets, theres a wild and exciting variety of play here thats unmatched, even by its peers. Its a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that its completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isnt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. May the best team win. PS. Dont play with Russians

review: Easily the most fascinating strategy games in years and easily the most exciting to watch (regular matches to tournament / championships) Bringing the most spectacular and vividly detailed strategies to players and viewers alike. One of the most addicting games ever made; and one you can never master as something can always be countered. While some people may be turned off by the first few games due to he learning curve; rest assured if you dip atleast 10 hours into learning how to really play the game and the character you chose to start playing with, you will soon be engulfed in an AAA package unlike any other game, which is why I give it a 10/10 - Many RTS games, RPG Games, MOBA's, Hybrids, all bring new innovative things to plate; or end up getting big by copying a formula near exact (such as LoL... -sigh- ) - DOTA 2 is the best "Action Real Time Role Playing Game" or "MOBA" (Name doesn't matter) but it's the best in its field and one of the best online centered titles you'll ever play.

review: Current meta sucks, next meta will probably suck just as well. This game is better off you recognizing every aspect of the game and getting used to the learning curve, play 600-2000 hours, get mad at it, and fanboy over professional teams. Fanboying and following professional teams and tournaments is the best way to go. Also the lore isn't half bad. TL;DR this game is better than League of ies

review: As a drop while playing Dota 2. Because Dota 2 is a free-to-play game, players do not receive free cards like most other games. Instead, a card drop becomes available for roughly every $9 USD spent on cosmetic items in the Dota 2 Store. If you have card drops available, they will appear automatically in your Steam inventory as long as your Dota 2 client is open. Cards drop approximately once every 15-60 minutes. From the Steam Community Market. By trading with another player. From a Booster Pack. Booster Packs are packets of several cards that drop randomly after you have forged one Dota 2 badge. Booster Packs can also be bought on the Market. Booster Packs drop more frequently for players with higher Steam Levels.

review: If you're a fan of MOBA games you'll probably enjoy this. Surely you might find it to be harder to begin playing with it if you're coming from League of Legends or some other MOBA game. The community is quite trash mostly, and if you're playing pub matches you'll be overrun by low level players that use pubstomp heroes and you'll most likely lose, unless they're so bad they're even bad at those heroes. It will take you a while to get onto some decent levels and decent pubs but it's worth it. Graphics are nice and somewhat toony, like TF2, and gameplay varies a lot depending on the teams, heroes and item builds you pick. It's free, so why not try it? All it's features are free, the only thing you might want to buy are aesthetics. EDIT: "Depression Simulator 2015" - This game taught me that everyone deserves the same amount of hate... oh and if it's Russians that are playing, I'd prefer Russian Roulette, thanks. At least you get to learn every single language except English. Nobody talks English in Dota 2, are you crazy?

review: The most challenging and engaging MOBA, warning to LoL players there is a steep learning curve and you need to unlearn a lot of habits. All attack animations are not designed to last hit, making it actually take skill. Meanwhile the game is all about skill, activatable items and always being able to comeback if you're diligent and knowledgable. Its about crushing defeat that sinks to your core, and triumphant victory that makes you yell to the skies!

review: Pretty much a boring version of League of Legends. Why League of Legends is better than this game: 1) League fo Legends is f2p. Dota 2 costs $30 2) League of Legends has a broader selection of playable characters 3) League of Legends has a nicer UI 4) League of Legends has a slightly smaller map for more intense and skilled battles 5) League of Legends is more popular on Twitch.tv and has more MLG pro gaming tournaments and such 6) No russians in League of Legends 7) Dota features a Pay-2-Win system in which you can buy exclusive items for each character such as armor and weapons. 8) Dota only has one map while League of Legends has several maps and game modes which you can play to your liking 9) Biggest problem with Dota: NO RANKING system. You can't see improvement through ladders and such, horrendous stats page, absolutely no ranking system other than levels which is also Pay-2-Win with XP boosts avaliable on the market 10) Very gimmicky crates dropped at the end of each game trying to sucker you into spending more money on keys 11) Extremely boring map, it's all dark and depressing. Makes me want to fall asleep. 12) Very low player population. Highest played game on Steam, but not even 1/3rd of League of Legends population due to the fact that this game isn't free to play and supports a Pay-2-Win model 13) This game suffers from a lack of updates, it seems to be just a cash cow for Valve 14) Matchmaking takes ridiculously long, it's actually suprising that the #1 game on Steam suffers from match-making this awful. Really shows how rarely this game is updated 15) Players can draw on the map disrupting each others experience and mic usage is also allowed which always brings griefers who like to spam the mic and ruin the game for everyone 16) You can teamkill your own creeps in this game ruining the game for your team and your enemy 17) There is no META anyone does anything, this causes a very chaotic enviorment which is very daunting a new player just trying to learn the ropes 18) This game is not free to play 19) This game uses a Pay-2-Win system with gimmicks involved like Keys trying to get you to spend money 20) The community is actually terrible with plenty of hackers and griefers ruining the game for everyone involved. PLAY THIS GAME AT YOUR OWN RISK

review: Dota2 is the highly successful sequel to the WarCraft 3 custom map Defense of the Ancients. The original DotA was the parent of the MOBA genre that we enjoy today, and Dota2 has done an amazing job carrying on the legacy. If you were a fan of the original, or enjoy the current MOBA games on the market such as League of Legends, Heroes of Newerth, or Smite - Give Dota2 a chance. There are literally dozens of heroes to choose from, with multiple item builds for each hero. This can make the learning curve a little steep, but there is a decent tutorial system in place for helping new players learn. There is also an improved bot mode now, where you can practice against AI and hone your skills until you feel comfortable playing with other players. Ranked play adds a more competitive arena for players looking to improve and advance, and there is now a solo mid 1v1 mode to practice laning if you so choose. Dota2 is an ever evolving game, and growing into a prominent E-Sports arena. It isn't for everyone, and players that get frustrated easily might want to avoid it. The community can be a bit hostile towards newer players, but with some patience you can find great players and make friends that will help you through the process.

review: Dota is the game that drains your soul and slowly your steam wallet by influencing items that slightly alter your character's look in game, not like you don't look at the bald spot on their head 24/7 anyway but still, you do it, slowly. It caused me to denounce every other game in my library, i can't help myself but play more of this cocaine lined work of art with a cashmere fitting. My muscle to fat ratio is shifting to the latter and i am currently drinking prune juice non-stop just to pass a pair of nail clippers i mistook as a cheeto, whose family was being pilled into my mouth for consumption between courier runs. someone... please help me other than that 10/10

review: Best game of its kind! Dota actually is a whole seperate gaming- category by its self, so DO NOT compare it with other moba's!!! it was the first and always will be because its not just a moba...moba is such an unfair tag... its much more than that!! But i have to warn you ! you might want to think twice before you try it out ! In order to play and start enjoying the game you must have tons of patience, strong will to learn and nerves of steel.. you will have to push yourself harder and harder to become better everyday because the game is literally hard to learn and impossible to master ! its learning curve is just insane. There are endless strategies -combo's -tricks-heroe's synergies and skill (that you need to develop in time) that will take you years of experience to be able to recognize them and understand them when you see them.. and even if you get to a point you think its high level there will still be new things to learn you didnt know before ....also keep in mind that its a game that teamwork is very very crucial...that's something that makes the game even harder because all members of your team have to have knowledge of the game and be mentaly stable :P that also means that sometimes you will lose games because of other people's failures and it can get very irritating...ofc there will be games that you will be the person that fails aswell..Good luck!

review: I think it's really fun, since it requires strategy and mind. Teamwork is possible, and sometimes people are really nice even if you're new to the game. I like it overall, since it doesn't really matter about one person all the time, but everyone's co-operation. I also loved the gameplay, as if I'm playing Warcraft or something. So if you like strategy and teamwork, I think I'll recommend it.

Great game I would recommend.

review: as you can tell from my game play hours i have had quite an....... epic?..... time playing this video gameb ased of off leage of legends "defend the ancients, please!" is an action adventure game starring jack black and jason statham as they and three less famous friends defend their ancients from evil jack black, evil jason statham and three less evil less famous friends this video game was clearly made in russia (but i dont know??) so theres a lot of rusians playing it but i can kinda see why because its quite a fun video ame id rate "defend the ancients, please!" a 7/11 which is my favourite japanese store which links to the reason that this game isnt a 11/11 which is that it wasnt made in japan how else am i going to get my bonner hard if there arent any hot anime babes well i guess that these american women would suffice but in all honesty anime girls and a few japanese musicians are the only attractive people on this westernised planet long live nippon

review: I love the game of DotA 2 is using proven strategies and a good team cohesiveness, and there pitted 2 teams each containing 5 players, which both have major headquarters called the Ancient and the first team to successfully destroy the Ancient opponent is the winner, There are 3 roads or paths (called 'lanes') which connects both the Ancient and forces ('creeps') that spawn or appear regularly in these pathways, fight with 'creeps' round opponent in the battle towards the opponent's headquarters. And I'd like again there are a lot of options at the beginning of the game due to the chosen heroes, each hero has 4 skills and a few more (active or passive) so it is not too complicated to play, i love dota <3

review: (Speaking from a past LoL player's perspective) This is the one game i play to death and im really good at as of now. This game will make you feel an array of emotions from rage to happiness and back again leaving for quite a ride. Bottom line, if youre gonna play this game, and i cant stress this enough, go in knowing what you're doing. If you dont, you will fail hard, so many people forget that. Got that? Good. The gameplay itself is typical of a MOBA, but LoL players beware, the courier system, gold loss on death, and other mechanics is going to warrant some getting used to. The community is relatively fine so long as you know what you're doing (the LoL trashers are few and relatively uneventful for me) and you are perfectly nice, the few s will come, but as the Bronies say, love and tolerate. The graphics are good, what else is there to say? Im not gonna do a whole paragraph on it, theyre fine. The gameplay is smooth and provides a decent amount of challenge and fun. Overall, this is a great game 10/10 (this is my first review).

review: Have been playing this game since quite a while now. Found myself coming back to it each day. Even if I did have better things to do, I preferred playing a match of DOTA 2. This game has everything that you can expect from a good MOBA game. Every game is a completely different experience. You are snowballing and pub stomping in one game and other game, you lose throne in 20 mins. Matches are highly unpredictible specially with the new updates that have made #comeback real. Winning a losing match is the ultimate satisfaction. Also, many people don't understand this but there is actually no -right- or -wrong- way to play a hero. Some ways make the hero stronger and some don't. It all comes down to personal preference and the scenario or kinds of enemies you're facing. Having said that, yes the game has a very steep learning curve. Takes a couple of hours to play a single hero properly and there are 110 heroes at the time of writing this review. Each with their own unique set of skills and item builds. There are 129 unique items in the game about 70 of these are built by combining the rest of the items. It DOES take a while to understand and learn what each item do and if its worth building it on a particular hero or not. Say, the hero Anti-Mage has a innate ability to "blink" on the battlefield so, crafting a blink dagger on him is a bit useless and waste of gold. Some items can further strengthen the strengths/abilities of heroes while some others can overcome their weaknesses. It will take a while to understand what items will be good on a hero and what will be bad. Now, the worst part of DoTA 2 -> The major player base/community. Almost every single person playing this game thinks of himself/herself as the biggest and the ultimate champion of DoTA 2. Its like, as if they were born with the innate ability to pwn on the DoTA 2 battlefield and learned everything about this game in their mothers' womb. If you are new, get ready to be yelled at. Being called noob a LOT. Being called different names, being abused a lot in languages you didn't know existed before DoTA 2 and last but not the least, hearing nasty things about your mom. And no, this is not an exhaggeration. Actually, it can get worse depending upon how badly you do in a game. If you are stomping, however, you will be getting a ton of friend requests and party requests. Sure, some people are just dumb and had all the flame coming as they just don't learn even after putting in thousands of hours in game. But, new players should be taught how to do it properly instead of being told to uninstall the game. The overall player base is much better on higher MMR (matchmaking rate) range but reaching there is a climb through a spiky-rocky cliff and takes quite a bit of effort and patience. Finishing off with some tips for new/potential DoTA 2 players if they are reading this review: 1# Don't go in with zero knowledge of game. Go watch some youtube videos first to understand the basics. Most videos by Purge are pretty helpful. 2# Take the game seriously. If you are not serious about winning, please don't play. DoTA 2 is a serious competitive game and you shouldn't spoil it for others. 3# Know your limits and don't try complex micro and/or heavy farm dependent heroes like chen, meepo in normal matchmaking. At least not untill you have practiced enough with your farming/micro skills and are confident about it. 4# Try supporting heroes and buy courier/wards. This will make the team appreciate you. If however, you can't ward properly, get ready to be flamed... 5# Last but not the least, try to have some fun and try communicating with your team (if they understand/speak your language). Overall a pretty solid MOBA game. Though I don't like a few mechanics, I don't even care. I have so much fun that I overlook all the bad things. And thats the sign of a great game. The game is contantly evolving and changing though with new heroes getting released now and then and gameplay patches that completely change the way some heroes play. And thanks to valve's ultimate money guzzler mind, the events and constant flow in of cosmetics can keep you hooked in. This game can never get boring. Just gather some friends and start playing now if you haven't done yet. Thats all folks. Game on...

I love how fluid the game is with all the heroes, items, and ever changing battle situations. I enjoy how fair the matchmaking system is and how this is a non pay to win game. No item you buy in store can give you an advantage over enemy heroes, besides looks. People will say some heroes are over powered, but in reality its just how the dice roll. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have

review: As someone who has played DotA Allstars for many years, when I first tried out Dota 2, I didn't really like it. I thought the graphics were way too different from Warcraft III's and I found it difficult to clearly spot units due to the color scheme. As well, the new shop/item system felt overwhelming, and the lack of command buttons (e.g. "Attack", "Stop") seemed odd, among other things. My first impression of Dota 2 was not favorable, and I didn't play it for a while. But, after some time, my friends started playing the game and I tagged along. I gradually got used to the changes made in Dota 2 and began enjoying the experience. I then came to appreciate what they had done with Dota 2; the new shop/item system was more efficient, the new courier system was convenient, the overall layout was optimized and more aesthetically pleasant, etc. Perhaps best of all, playing this game with your friends is so much easier than it is for DotA Allstars. If you have played DotA Allstars but not Dota 2, I suggest you give it a try. You'll probably end up altogether dropping the former for the latter, like I did. If you have not played either game, then you could try Dota 2 anyway, as it is free to play. Be forewarned that this kind of game may not be for you. The learning curve is steep - for some, it may take quite a while just to be able to play decently. However, if you do manage to climb the curve, Dota 2 can be an enjoyable game.

review: What is Dota 2? Dota 2 is the most fun, the most annoying, the most tearful and the most stressful game you will ever play. You get to experience being sweared at in a multitude of languages; it has taught how to manage my investments due to knowing when to report and when not to report. Dota also adds in event styled gamemodes; the latest being a full fledged Pay to Win; thank you Gaben 9/8 gr8 b8 m8.

review: DotA 2 can be a game for casual gamers or people looking to get more competive. There is a very wide variety of heroes to play (over 100) and they all have their own playstyle. This game is extremely fun after you get past the pretty steep learning curve. I must mention that this is a STRATEGY game, so if you only like FPS's then you might not like this. Once you start understanding the game more it is a LOT of fun. Please don't compare this game to LoL because both games were created differently and are meant to serve a different experience.

review: After playing Dota 2 almost 800 hours, I decided to give this game a bit of a review. Ok, basically Dota 2 is just defeating the enemy team. Your team consists of 5 mates and the enemy team consists of 5 mates. Of course you can abandon the game anytime you want to, but 5 mates is the basic. The map is divided into three different roads called 'lanes' and your team spreads up and fills those lanes. Usually it's 2 guys top lane, one mid, and two down. You can also pick a character from a group called as 'junglers'. In Dota 2 you pick a character. There are over a 100 possible choices, more to come during updates etc. Picking the right chatacter is the key to everything. If you happen to get a dream team, you are sure to win. In case it's a dream team, it requires the players also to know how to play the game. For example: Many people pick Riki, one of the most frustrating chars of the whole game AND they don't know how to play him right. During you develop your hero, you gain money and experience points. With money you buy different items, it depends of your chars' item build. With experience points you gain levels. By the time you reach lvl 11 early game with your op hero, you've already won the game. By the time you reach the max lvl, 25, with a bad hero, it basically ain't helping your team much. You make progress by destroying enemy towers. There are 3 towers on each lane + 2 extra towers protecting the main building, ancient. Behind the third towers, there are the barracks. If you take out one lane's barracks down, it makes your creeps do better on that lane. If you take down every barrack in the enemy base, it makes your creeps do 4x the original damage and it boosts their HP as well. Okay, that's the main view in the game. And now we'll get to read the gameplaying. Mostly in Dota 2 there's a war going on all the time. EU against russians, russians against americans and americans against russians. In almost every game, you'll get the chance to speak with a real russian. Mostly that person just writes any word wrong and makes you laugh at his/her grammar and it makes that person to become more angry. In almost every game you also get the chance to be called as a '' and you get to read the most known words in Dota 2: , report, feed, noob, report, w8. Those are one of the most known words in Dota 2. After a couple of weeks playing Dota 2 you'll see what I meant. Pros +Awesome gaming +The fun it has +Variety +No match repeats itself +Very detailed and well made game Cons -Everyone hates everyone -Extremely hard to learn -It makes you frustrated -It has an extremely high addiction risk That's basically Dota 2. Play, it's worth it! -T

review: So my friends dragged me into this game just over a year ago, and I can now say it's one of the the best things that has ever graced my computer screen. The game is challenging, has a beautiful environment, allows one to choose from a multitude of unique and diverse heroes, and most importantly, fun. The sense of teamwork that you receive is fantastic, and the knowledge that your co-operation with your teammates is winning the game is very rewarding. Of course it isn't perfect, but nothing is. And to be completely honest, the most amount of grief you will encounter is the ness of a certain few players. But that does not detract from the huge amounts of fun and challenges that Dota 2 offers. I highly recommend this game to anyone.

review: *warning* If you're a smoker: - Expect to finish more than 2 packs due to anger you're feeling If you love humans and social and genuine nice person: - Get ready to be punched in the face by reality (like some random guy making comments regarding your mother's anatomy or your family tree etc.). You can also forget about your social life since the comments you'll be making will be weird like "go get rekt by a sniper". As for the nice person part, "sayanora"... If you want to learn a second language: - Be ready to experience how rosetta stone would be like as a game (tho there's a bug atm, so you can only learn portugues, russian and spanish) If you don't have any bad addictions: - You'll definitely get one really really soon If you are a lively person: - Watch when this game drains your life away as well as you realise that you've learned at least 50 new ways to insult people. If you have no health problems: - Get ready for an updated new list If you think the real life is a struggle: - *smirk* you have no idea...

review: Amazing game heavily focused on cooperation and communication. Pros: *NOT P2W this game heavily benefits experience over money as spending money on the game will only give cosmetics and no advantage in matches what so ever. *Great community, Mostly the dota 2 community is hell upon earth as language barriers are all over the place. Even tho this is a problem the community in and of itself is amazing having alot of contributions daily and providing help for problems of all kinds. If you have the right frame of mind the community will always give you a hand. *Outstanding gameplay in general. After many hours of gameplay Ive come to realize that dota 2 has one of the best character pools in MOBAS and overall multiplayer games. From heros with strengths as the game goes on to heros wich destroy in the earlygame. Character variaty is there. *100% free. Ive already made a statement on P2W being non-existant. But I have to restate that Dota 2 is true to its F2P standards. Every single Hero (Character) Is free from the get-go. If you dont want to spend 1 cent on the game you can. Cons: *Servers. Even tho the server variaty is great there is problems with the servers itself. As server breakdowns make the game somewhat unfair as better ping with the right set of skills will mean a big difference between a win and a lose more with heros wich require apropiate timing or an apropiate combo(Strom Spirit for example) *Language barriers. As the game many times missjudges the ping of a player it might send players wich speak a specific language into a server wich has mostly players that speak another. Me being from southamerica and speaking english go mostly to US servers as Theres better ping. But as I do many other southamerican players go there too and language barriers start appering as an example the typical "Peruvian" wich plays misserably and ruins matches for US players. Overall Amazing I recommend to anyone whos willing to spend large ammounts of time on a game. And to all the MOBA lovers even tho its the hardest by far. Id give a 9.0/10. Great job Valve

But it can be picked up easily. Still getting to grips with the camera. And the lengthy matches means that you play for hours without realising it. This game probably will take up a lot of time in your life, so make sure you have many reasons to leave your computer screen.

The continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. It's hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. It took me a long time to warm up to, but I'm helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. If you can spare the time - play it.

review: Dota 2 promises to take the unique blend of online RTS and RPG action that has made Dota popular with tens of millions of gamers and expand upon it in every way. This is a competitive MOBA game of action and strategy, played both professionally and casually by millions of passionate fans worldwide. Players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes, forming two teams of five characters. Radiant heroes then battle their Dire counterparts to control a fantasy landscape, waging campaigns of cunning, stealth, and outright warfare. Put a few hundred hours into a game and you'll normally have its mechanics down pat. You may not be the greatest player ever, but you can usually expect to be at least competent and able to make a valuable contribution to your team's efforts. Sure, some teenager all hopped up on Mountain Dew and pubertal rage is still going to have faster reactions than you, but you'll get by. Until you pick up Dota 2. In Dota 2 you can play for a hundred hours and still be the most useless n00b to ever play the game, a let down to your team, an embarrassment to friends and family. It's a brutal game. But if you get into itand not everyone willit can make a full-on heroin addiction look like nothing more severe than a mild hankering.

review: Dota is either fun or infuriating once you figure out what to do. Dota destroys relationships with friends, makes you racist to nearly everyone that doesn't speak your language, makes you a terrible, intolerant person who insults people when barely provoked. If you're going to play dota, don't play it with good friends. Play with friends you don't mind losing. That'll either make you super close or hate eachother. Over 9000/10 get it now

review: Dota 2 is highly addictive in the respects that it's fast paced, strategic, and overall fun to play. To be honest, at first I couldn't get into the game though after I kept pushing myself to learn the heroes, items, mechanics, strats, etc. This as become one of my favorite game to play with friends. Every time I play a match it's different, it's always different. When other heroes are chosen, it changes the game entirely. The rules of the game change everytime you pick your hero and your enemies and team mates pick theirs. Every hero is over powered when leveled and given the right items. +Pros: Wide and ever growing pool of heroes, Wide ranges of team and lane combinations, Training grounds are very friendly to new players to the MOBA style of gaming or just to the game over all, Wide range of abilities active and passive, Casual and competitive game play from non-ranked to ranked, Keeps track of your MMR, Matches you with people around the same skill level as you or the head of your party, Some heroes have companion lines. -Cons: Dated textures on some heroes, Hard to get out of Low Priority once in Low Priority, Other regions get intertwined easily, Prefered language doesn't always mean you'll get with people who speak in a tongue you understand (English, Portuguise, Russian, German, Etc.), People tend to rage easily, Reports might be common to new players unfamiliar with multiplayer matches.

I try to play at least one game a day and have been doing so for months and don't plan on stopping. Give the game a chance (more like 5) and I guarantee that you'll see why its the most played game on steam. be prepared to be dumbfounded as to why you were playing anything else. also a side note: the games free. steam is free. the only thing u have to lose from giving it a try is alil self respect in the beginning. but don't worry after one game where u actually do really good you'll feel like a million bucks.

review: After playing over 1000 hours of this game, I would love to say that Valve have done an amazing job working with IceFrog to create a game that, although objectively the same each time, is engaging and extremely dynamic every time. Screams of joy and frustration will be heard when you play this game, maybe you will develop an unrelented hatred for the Russian people or simply call "Mid or Feed". All I can say is, I am glad I took the time to get past Dota's steep learning curve for it has been a rewarding experience that I am looking forward to continue for many months to come.

review: A blast from the past and a major landmark for competitive gaming. DOTA was originally a Warcraft III mod which immediately became a crowd favorite. The deep learning curve provides a true strategic experience and will keep you on your feet. With the enormous pool of different Heroes to pick from along with the collection of items that you can build, you can create multiple ways of approaching a situation/fight. This game is not easy to pick up, however, the basic mechanics can be quickly picked up/taught. With the revision backed by Valve, DOTA 2 is sparking up the esports scene once again. It is providing another source of life to a game that was part of the few that started the whole competitive scene overall. Although the game might seem "over-competitive", it is definitely a great game to have fun with a group of friends and can provide numerous amounts of fun and laughter. Games of the same genre/basic mechanics (MOBAs) are : League of Legends (LoL), and Heroes of Newerth (HoN).

review: If you love RTS and want to cool off from war hammer or StarCraft, why not play DOTA? You control 1 hero (at most 5 units.), a lot of depth, easy to learn hard to master and most important FUN AS HELL. In my opinion takes LOL by a long shot and the fact that ice frog and valve are behind this gives it credit alone. Ive been playing the DOTA 2 test and this is my conclusion; on the sound nice ambiance and very engaging battle music, on the graphics the environment needs a bit of work but the hero aesthetics are great and on the mechanics... well i think its too early to say but seems on the right track. All in all a great and (again in my opinion) a "must have game". Score: Visuals: 10/10 music\hero vocals: 10/10 Mechanics: 9.5/10 Overall: 10/10

review: I orginally played Dota 2 when it first came out having my friend play and tell me about it. I tried the tutorial which was an awful idea because the game's tutorial is, for the most part, useless. I recommend going straight into a Bot match with some friends who have already played the game that will be so much easier. Here are the pros and cons of this game. Pros: *Great, but hard gameplay. *Super Addictive *Great music, voice acting, graphics, and animations. *Unique characters. *Strategy based teamwork. *Occasional good teammates. *Gives you a list of items to get for you charcter such as Starting Items, Early Game, Core Items, and Situational Items. *Hella Charcters *Team creation and rosters. *A GIANT playerbase and I mean GIANT! Cons: *Occasional bad teammates. *Russians play on your own server. *Occasional feeders(One who gets killed on purpose) *Racism *Annoyance and anger when loosing. *Can, if you let it, ruin your day even your life no joke, although hasn't happened to me. *Unlike LoL(League of Legends) has all characters unlocked which can make it harder to chose and get used to characters. *One map which is fine but can turn some gamers off. I know this seems like a lot more cons than pros but this is really a good game definently if you have friends to play with. One more thing this game is not for casual gamers at all and you most likely will die a lot at first. Even if you don't think you'll like this game you should still try it. If you need help with it at first get a friend to help you play if not contact me and I can help.

review: Dota is either fun or infuriating once you figure out what to do. Dota destroys relationships with friends, makes you racist to nearly everyone that doesn't speak your language, makes you a terrible, intolerant person who insults people when barely provoked. If you're going to play dota, don't play it with good friends. Play with friends you don't mind losing. That'll either make you super close or hate eachother. Over 9000/10 get it now

review: DotA all-Stars was the one that started the MOBA gaming genre. Pretenders to the throne such as HoN or LoL were no match of what the mighty Valve have done, rebooting the mod into an award winning game. To me each hero has a unique feels to them which gives them there own stregths and weakness, some heros do feel overpowerd in some aspects, but if you have a good team with different heros with different roles, your team is bound to win. The things i find annoying in game are the ammount of people that always leave a game because of rage quit, these people need to learn a lesson or to about good sportsmanship. Another is languages, make sure you read up on your: -Russian -Spanish -Indonesian language books for the best experiacne, so you don't have to stop and type to your team "ENGLISH" Overall, this game is a great a game with balanced mechanics in all aspects of the game, im glad i waste 45 minutes per match to play a great game. 9.2/10

review: The best MOBA hands down. The lore of the heroes, the diversity and unique design of each hero, every aspect is well thought out. While some heroes are a bit overpowered, you can still counter them, and you can still win. The setting and soundtrack adds to the aspect of gameplay as well. This game crushes LoL, SMITE, and HoN in my opinion.

review: This is a game that surprised me. Most of the game is just clicking with the mouse, right click to do this, left click to do that. It did require a bit of effort getting used to it. But it can be picked up easily. Still getting to grips with the camera. And the lengthy matches means that you play for hours without realising it. This game probably will take up a lot of time in your life, so make sure you have many reasons to leave your computer screen.

review: Pretty much a boring version of League of Legends. Why League of Legends is better than this game: 1) League fo Legends is f2p. Dota 2 costs $30 2) League of Legends has a broader selection of playable characters 3) League of Legends has a nicer UI 4) League of Legends has a slightly smaller map for more intense and skilled battles 5) League of Legends is more popular on Twitch.tv and has more MLG pro gaming tournaments and such 6) No russians in League of Legends 7) Dota features a Pay-2-Win system in which you can buy exclusive items for each character such as armor and weapons. 8) Dota only has one map while League of Legends has several maps and game modes which you can play to your liking 9) Biggest problem with Dota: NO RANKING system. You can't see improvement through ladders and such, horrendous stats page, absolutely no ranking system other than levels which is also Pay-2-Win with XP boosts avaliable on the market 10) Very gimmicky crates dropped at the end of each game trying to sucker you into spending more money on keys 11) Extremely boring map, it's all dark and depressing. Makes me want to fall asleep. 12) Very low player population. Highest played game on Steam, but not even 1/3rd of League of Legends population due to the fact that this game isn't free to play and supports a Pay-2-Win model 13) This game suffers from a lack of updates, it seems to be just a cash cow for Valve 14) Matchmaking takes ridiculously long, it's actually suprising that the #1 game on Steam suffers from match-making this awful. Really shows how rarely this game is updated 15) Players can draw on the map disrupting each others experience and mic usage is also allowed which always brings griefers who like to spam the mic and ruin the game for everyone 16) You can teamkill your own creeps in this game ruining the game for your team and your enemy 17) There is no META anyone does anything, this causes a very chaotic enviorment which is very daunting a new player just trying to learn the ropes 18) This game is not free to play 19) This game uses a Pay-2-Win system with gimmicks involved like Keys trying to get you to spend money 20) The community is actually terrible with plenty of hackers and griefers ruining the game for everyone involved. PLAY THIS GAME AT YOUR OWN RISK

review: Dota 2 have been developed for the past 2 years since its closed beta on 2011 where invites are poured out to players on steam. I may not be of those lucky few that have gotten the invite but nevertheless, after i experienced in from a friend's account i must say Valve has successfully elevated the progenitor of the MOBA genre to the next level with improvements that can only be possible with more advanced game engines. I myself has been a DotA player in the past and seeing the sequel made but still having its core game play maintained brings a warm joy to my heart since the core mechanics of DotA like denying, creep stacking, or even juking has been successfully brought back to this game. Dota 2 still manages to bring the competitive atmosphere into players both new or veterans alike since the core mechanics are not changed and then i would like to mention the huge improvement the game has bought is the Shop system in game where we can just click on an item if we have the enough amount of money since it's pretty tad confusing if you are new to Dota 2 and you don't know what are the item builds for each particular hero since Dota 2 can be really challenging by mastering different item builds for different situations or the hero mechanics itself, a long and tedious journey awaits you but once you have mastered the mechanics then your satisfaction will be very high. Another major improvement is the tutorial system that Valve has implemented such as introducing Close Combat with Dragon Knight and Long Range Combat with Sniper and also Laning tutorials which can help new players to overcome their fear in laning against enemy heroes. Probably the newest addition is the Last hit training which shows players how to last hit a creep to gain more gold and experience, this is useful for new comers and veterans alike to hone their skills. The steam workshop system also works very well with the game where players can contribute their unique items made for heroes in game.These items can also be implemented in game through the community's help by up voting the particular item which is also a fair way for players to get their favorite cosmetic items from the workshop to be implemented in game. Me myself kept regularly browsing the workshop to see the ideas of the players around the world and it's amazing on how you can see a lot of "fresh" content from players around the world. However the community of Dota 2 maybe very harsh on new players since i have seen players that tends to be harsh to newcomers since they haven't mastered the core mechanics and flame them regularly. But don't take it to heart since there are also some good left in this community, you will come across gamers with patience and are willing to teach you to get better and even enemies that can cheer you up and joke around with you even though they are losing or winning the game. Overall i give the game a 9/10 for its reinvention of the titular DotA title and with new improvements such as customization options while still retaining the core mechanics, makes this game...a worthy sequel.

Therefore, I decided to sell them all and make a profit off of people weird enough to collect things that do not exist in reality. I made a good amount and bought a few games during a sale. I got free games for being bad at a game!

review: If riding around on a big hairy creature, bashing people with a hammer is your thing, Dota 2 has you covered. Sort of. Dota 2 offers a huge array of characters that enable players to take roles that are in their wheelhouse. Whether you like sneaking and ganking, smashing through the frontlines, or sitting back and supporting your team from a distance, there are characters that do all that and more. What immediately strikes me about Dota, to coin a hideously overused clich, is that it's easy to learn, but difficult to master. While the game is generally forgiving, the players are much less so. As with all multiplayer games, the experience of playing with others can be a bit of a mixed bag. The most important thing to remember about Dota 2 is this: it's not about winning, it's about losing stylishly to progressively more back-breaking, marrow-sucking odds.

review: My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.

review: Dota 2 is a moba and is the stand-alone sequel to Defense of the Ancients, mod for Warcraft III. This game is pretty funny to play with friends and it's a F2P, not P2W, which is awesome. The game comes with a really well done competitive system with a nice elo system. The prizes on the tournaments are quite high and since it's a F2P, not P2W, you can improve to the level where you go to tournaments. The community is not the best but it's totally not the worst. Russians, yes Russians, that's a main thing in this game even if you play in the Europe server/American server, apperently, even with their own server, they tend to come to other servers and most of them are kinda as[s]holes. Sometimes it can be a frustating game and a real pain in the as[s]. Rating 7.5/10 TL;DR Version + F2P + Not P2W + Funny to play with your friends + Nice competitive feeling + Good elo system + High prizes in tournaments - Russians everywhere, they tend to be as[s]holes and not speaking in english. - Frustating game when you're in a lose streak - Not that funny to play alone, imo SORRY FOR BAD ENGLANDINO, PLEZ DON'T COPI RAVIOLI PASTARINO

No hay muchas palabras para describirlo, salvo que tiene un modo de juego muy bueno, una cantidad de hroes muy grande, un despliege de tems muy extenso y cientos de horas asegurados. Yo, por mi parte, tengo una falta de tiempo increble, la verdad es que si pudiese pasarme el rato pegado a la computadora jugando, lo hara. Las partidas son muy extensas, pueden durar de 30 minutos hasta 2 horas... Todo depende siempre del equipo. Dota 2 tiene la capacidad de que, aunque slo tengas una torre en pie, an puedas dar vuelta al partido y ganar al otro equipo. Repito, todo depende siempre del equipo. Dota 2 es de esos juegos que, aunque no te guste el gnero del todo, te hace amarlo completamente, tiene eso de que aunque se te haga muy complicado, te entren muchas ganas de jugarlo hasta ser un jugador ms o menos 'pro'. Es un juego que realmente, vale la pena descargar y jugar.

Apart from that, at one point youll notice youve spent more time and money in a free to play game than in COD or another 60 dollars game , but youll say to yourself "Its fine , it was worth , now i have the best set ever" just to realise that there will be a better one coming up in 2 months. What can i say dota 2 is a great game , the community is sometimes horrible but youll learn to love it 10/10 IGN

review: When I played Dota Wc3 Mod for the first time I died as WindRUNNER and moved on to Hero Line Wars. Now that value has made Dota 2 I tried it again. The F2P model is very fair, almost too fair which lets in undesirables. The graphics are clean and crisp. The gameplay is what you expect from an RTS, lots of clicking and moving your unit around or, for you plebs out there, lack there of. There is a rating system that and that really is the worst. I have close to dial up internet and lag all game. My rating sucks because of this and the reason I am writing this is because I am waiting for a 100MB download aka 2 hours. All that said Icefairy has made heroine in video game form and its free /dance....zzzz doesnt work

It will hurt, you will feed, and everyone will yell at you, yet somehow you will still enjoy it. Just play this game! You will not regret it!

review: A combination of great game mechanics and compelling hero backstories make Dota 2 a cut above other Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas (MOBAs) such as League of Legend and Dota 1. Of particular interest to new and old players alike is the hero Mirana and her trademark w-button ability, sacred arrow, which when successfully deployed is often considered one of the most fatal not-ulti moves in the game. When not utilising this 360-damage 5-second stun, players may take solace in Mirana's other special abilities such as leap, a devastatingly evasive jump, starstorm, a powerful aoe magical damage dealer, and her notorious ultimate moonlight shadow which will render all heroes on Mirana's team invisible at the click of a button. Whilst Dota 2 does not necessarily revolve around the ever-popular hero Mirana at this time, many hope to one day see her in an online action/adventure of her very own.

review: My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.

review: It's an amazing game - technically outstanding, showing all of Valve's usual polish and attention to detail, especially in the all-important multiplayer aspects. The continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. It's hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. It took me a long time to warm up to, but I'm helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. If you can spare the time - play it.

Country Preference should be made so that there would be no complaints with Filipino players and other players that are noob alike. 3.Balance in the game should be random and should not be determined by your winnings which in some cases you will be paired with newbies that join MMR matches and looks for someone who can carry them. Win rate to win rate, and lose rate to lose rate. Good game enjoy the action.

review: Dota 2 is fun and addicting action real-time strategy(ARTS) game that you can sink countless hours into. However, this isn't the case from the beginning. The tutorial teaches players basic mechanics of the game, but it will not teach you how to survive in a real match. If you jump right in to a game with other players lacking personal experience, you will die constantly and likely find yourself demoralized. It's not fun. While this is true, if you really take your time with the game, slowly learning about heroes, items, and strategies, the game begins to open up. It becomes the addicting game I first mentioned, and you will love it; there are countless possibilities, and every match is different and interesting in its own way. You need to sink some time into it to get to this point, but luckily Valve helps ease you in with the aforementioned tutorial, as well as bot games and the ability to play against bots with other humans. As of the time of this writing, there are 110 playable heroes in Dota 2. Although the map is always the same, you will encounter different characters, combinations, and tactics every time you play. This is what I mean by "countless possibilities." There are characters for all kinds of playstyles; supports, carries(the powerful ones dealing out the damage), teamfighters, and more. It truly never gets old. Give Dota 2 a try and some of your time, and I assure you that you will not be dissapointed.

review: Do you like MOBAs? Enjoy League of Legends or SMITE? Well this game is, of coruse, another MOBA. However it is also the ORIGINAL MOBA. One of the things you may love or hate about Dota is that there isnt really any sort on unfairness to new players beyond skill. If a person with 10,000 hours faces a player who has only 12 they have no different items, no different heroes, no different abilities. The veteran may have new aesthetic things but the only thing seperating them will be skill. If you're new to MOBAs I encourage you to try this one, they are very fun and are fortunately not pay to win.

review: Dota 2 in a very strategic challenging game. I know a lot of people start playing Dota and get discouraged because of how brutal it is when you get started. Don't give up! Don't be afraid to ask players for help and watch videos, watch TONS of videos. Read guides and builds, and experiment with every hero in bot matches. Go to the Library in-game and read up on every hero and item. Don't skip the tutorials! They may seem boring or dry at first but they really, really useful. This game can be extremely fun, and so fulfilling when you play it. There will be games that your team gets stomped with a 74-16 game....don't worry about it. There will be other games where the entire game is tied and both team have the same amount of towers down and neither team can get ahead, and it reaches over an hour. When it does finally end, whether you won or lost, it won't matter because both teams realize it could have went either way and that is was a truly amazing game. It is moments like that when you are congratulating the other team on a good game, not just because it is expected of you, but because it really was a great game. This is why you need to stick it out in the beginning and keep on trying. More than likely you will start out with a 2-17-4 score, but that's ok! Because in no time you will have that game, the game where your team worked together amazing and your hero was a perfect counter to their entire team and you'll get that 44-6-12 game. As far as the gameplay is, Valve is very good about fixing the bugs. Most bugs are only on for a few days before a fix has come out. The game is very stable. The only problems I could have with Dota 2 are with the servers. There have been server issues and sometimes it causes you to have an abandon which wasn't fair, but non reversible. Also, there are issues if setting your language preference to English and you get paired with players who don't know any English, this can get frustrating. All in all, Dota 2 is well worth the hours put into it and the best part is it is completely free to play. You don't have to pay a dime for any content whatsoever. The only thing that costs money is to customize your experience while playing, including Cosmetics, HUDs, Loading Screens, etc.

review: This game is fun in many ways if you like mobas. There are over a 100 of heros that can fit your game style. There are also many items that you can use and strategize with. In the begining, it might be challenging, but you can overcome that by playing the training that Dota 2 has given you. Play a few games and you'll get a handle of things. Dota 2 is (in my opinion) the best moba game out there (now all the lol players are gonna yell at me). Lastly, the game has a very kind community (besides that one guy that you might play with every 20-50ish games). All in all, Dota 2 is a great game and should be played by all gamers who love mobas

review: Do you like brutally killing random dudes on the internet? Do you like ruining your friendships? Then DOTA 2 is the game for YOU ! This is one of those games at whitch you have to be good in order to enjoy. I can't exactly say it's fun even when you ARE good at it. But it is very satisfying nonetheless. It's very competitve, as it is expected from a MOBA. The only turn off that is clearly noticeable is the steep learning curve. During the first 100 or so hours you'll constatly get yelled at for being bad at the game. After the forst 100 hours, you'll feel right at home while playing dota with your friends. Oh yeah, one last thing, when you plan on starting your DOTA 2 journey, invite some of your firends to start along side you. Because I had a problematic situation when a friend of mine wanted to start playing DOTA 2. The only problem was every time I wanted to play with him, he would be forced to play against players of a much higher tier than him. Of course, this can be solved with smurf accounts (fake-ish low level accounts), but that basically means you will be switching between accounts every time some low level friend of yours wanted to play. So either start all over again, or wait for your friends until they get good enough to play along side you. Have fun !

review: Can be brutal for new people to MOBA's (this was my first MOBA), the game has a steep learning curve. I'd recommend actually watching some video's of gameplay first so you have a basic understanding of the game. If you can get through your first 20 - 30 games without smashing your PC than you'll probably be addicted, but that's a bit IF. I'd personally recommend that everyone try the game but can safely say that not everyone will like it.

review: Unless you can play this game or have the history of playing this kind of game, like for example dota 1 on warcraft, or if you have any friend to help you master this game, and have the intention to master this game, and prepared to get bullied, it is better for you to stay away from this game. For the people who just want to have some fun after busy days and play this game, but don't know or have less information about how to play this game, and the ethics on playing this game, they better avoid this game. A lot of people ruin other players time without the feeling of having fun, because of some reasons: 1. Teammates that can't play and make the team lose and 2. The people who likes to blame others and think they are the best.

review: Do you know the song "Love Story" by Taylor swift? If you do, I would sing that song to Dota everyday if it's a real girl, We were both young when I first played you, I close my eyes and the match starts I'm standing there, On the base on Dire's lane, See the creeps, see the team clash, arcanas, See you make your way through the towers and say "Silence!", Little did I know, That you picked Drow you were shooting arrows, And my captain said, "you play Invoker", And I was crying that I feed, begging you "Please don't report me", And I said "Roshan is dead, go get his aegis" I'll be farming, All there's left to do is run, You'll be the Carry and I'll be the support, Its a love story, baby just say yes~!

review: Welcome to Dota, a game where you will sacrifice everything for your teammates, only be flamed by afk Pudges and never-satisied Medusas until the end of the match. You will hear such insults and remarks as, "no items", "why u buy item instead of wards?", "why aren't you stacking?", "Y U NO HAVE TP INSTEAD OF WARDS/DUST?", "Y U NO DIE WITH ME?!", "u should read ur abilities noob because I get concerned when someone in unranked gameplay doesn't remember exactly how their ult was reworked last month", "omg I've never seen such a bad kda before", "ugh your all horrible just like my teammates the last 5-6 games", "JUST UNINSTALL THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT'LL MAKE YOU PLAY BETTER". All this while desperately attempting to save your hard carry's life, and die time and time again to the enemies' burst damage. It may be that a friendly soul will attempt to reason with them, but it will be to no avail. To those teammates you were nothing but a verbal punching bag in a long line of verbal punching bags; once they locked on, they became dead-set on flaming you (as mentioned previously) until the Very. End. Of. The. Match. Then as you go to Dotabuff, spirits low, you see the scrubs haven't even registered. And then you will see that Dota 2 has sent you a notification informing you that action has been taken against those flamers, all thanks to your reports. It is then you will realize that once more all is right with the world. 11/10 would recommend.

review: "I dont like MOBAs" this was my very first reaction when a buddy of mine was trying to convince me to play Dota2. At that moment I didn't want to but for the sake of friendship, I decided to give it a shot. At first, the game seemed hella confusing. The only thing I liked back then was the Main Menu music and how ironic the menu and heroes looked :P We played it through and through and ultimately there came a time when the confusion came to an end and that's when the addiction started. As of the game, it's a Strategy based MOBA game. Difficult to understand all at once but easy when broken into segments. You have to choose a hero from a pool of 100+ heroes. Each and every Hero is Unique in their own way, having different abilities/powers etc. Your main goal is to destroy the Opposition's Home Base Building "Ancient" in order to secure win. It sounds easy but  always hits the fan xD. You are given a shop, from where you can purchase items to upgrade your hero's abilities and attributes. My experience with this game sucked at the start, but turned opposite as of now. The Competetion is real hard. There's also a Leveling system for the Casual record along with a ranking system for competetive mode(Ranked Match) called "MMR" or Match Making Rating. Just like Counter Strike Global Offensive, there's a match making system, which helps each and every player of similar skillz to compete with each other. So, I'd say to download this game asap because I already regret for not playing it from the start :P Remember, I was one of those who said "Dota sucks" and now it's an integral part of my life. Above all, there's something calm about this game unlike CSGO xD It's always fun to play. Few kids.

review: Dear God. I can't stop thinking about this game. I really like it, and yet the toxic community actually makes me hesitant to play it. It's a miserable existence, let me tell you. It doesn't help that the matchmaking system is completely broken (I know I suck at the game. Why am I not getting matched against other people who suck? Instead I get matched against the same three man trilane three games in a row.) It also doesn't help that the language filter is really more of a suggestion. And yet, when everything is working...When you're playing with friends who all speak the same language and you're matched against a team of equal skill...The game is incredible. Strategies are complex, customization is deep (and cosmetic only,) heroes are varied. The game's true form is one of beauty. Or maybe I just have Stockholm syndrome. Would I recommend? Eeeehhh....The game: Yes. If you can find a way to keep the MM system / language suggestion system from giving you a heart attack and/or stroke, it's a lot of fun. If you can't, you'll die. PLAY IT IF YOU DARE.

It will teach you that no matter how hard you try, if the people around you screw up it will fall on you and you will be blamed for it. It will teach you that everyone expects to get the spotlight and leave you in the dark. It will teach you many, many things. It will also make you hate Russians. And... Well, just about anyone who doesn't speak your language. Your life will never be the same. You are not ready. Run while you still can. It's too late for me... 100/10 would play again.

review: This game is excellent for any students looking to brush up on Spanish, Portugese, and Russian obscenities and slang. The best cursing language software on the market. As an educator, I would highly recommend this for anyone looking to start a career as a sailor in a foreign navy. 9/10 Loses one point for inconsistencies in the spelling of certain curse words. Double check all the words online, and you'll be fine. Special Thanks: To the wonderful community of students from South America and Russia looking to teach others how to communicate their animosity in a new language.

review: Icefraud's next installment of Doto, made by volvo and cleverly titled Doto 2, combines good gramepray from Doto and the good gramphics from volvo's sauce engine to prove to be a great game. From the michael skills required to play meepo, to the intense consistancy of kotl smelling innocent people in lane and finally balsting them with horses, Icefraud proves to have great character design the Doto and Doto 2 alike.   _  Thanks, Volvo.

review: I looked up the wikipedia page on psychological abuse and DOTA fits it almost to the letter. 10/10 Emotional and mental abuse. This game will keep you from meeting social obligations. Enjoy meeting people from around the world as they all cuss at you in various languages, including Spanish and Russian. But that shouldn't really be a problem since team communication is almost nonexistent. If you play willingly play support you are 1/10 in the game almost always, even if they have support on their team they'll go semicarry at the minimum. Enjoy your stay, , Game is hard, noob, they gave diretide, trading keys, you forgot to ward again, dont buy boots first

review: Great MOBA. If you're into MOBAs like League of Legends, Smite, HoN, etc, then give this a try. It's free! And it's DAMN GOOD. First off, a warning: you're going to suck. Oh, you have some experience with MOBAs? Oh, in that case, you're going to suck and get pissed. Dota 2 has a pretty long learning curve. Loads of heroes to choose from and heaps of items to go along. The training system is a precious help and introduces you to the last hits, denies, shopping for items and combining items, allows you to play with a few noob-friendly (not easy and not weaker than the other ones, mind you, just not that complicated to master in the early stages of the game) heroes to get you to feel the game's pace. From then on, you still have a lot to learn. Everybody can use ALL heroes for free and there's no advantage anyone has over you except their own experience in the game. But there are plenty of heroes to go around and until you've played them all (or played against them) at least once, you'll be feeling like a noob when you face one for the first time. Dota 2 is rather unforgiving when it comes to carries. You die, you lose time, experience and GOLD. And you need GOLD to buy items to allow you to carry. Not that easy for supports either. Most of them do have the uppoer hand on some carries on the early stages of the game, but you need to know them in order to take advantage of that. Also, your abilities' damage doesn't really scale all that well to late game, where the carries start to shine. There are dozens of ward spots, jungling tricks and control points you need to master. Every game's different. Lanes are pretty unpredictable at Dota 2. You can have 2-1-2, but you can have a 1-1-3, a 1-2-2, or, if you have some jungler, you can have 1-1-1-2 os something like that. The game's pretty dynamic. Do check some guides and builds. They can help you in your first contacts with some heroes. But, hey... it's Dota 2. Everything's situational. Sure, there are a few core items on many heroes, but, all in all, it all depends on the game you're playing and a change can make ALL the difference. Again, if you're into MOBAs... Do try it. NOW!

review: Dota 2 is an excellent game, especially for a F2P. A lot of heros that are availble to everyone from the start. And the only thing you pay for in this game is coesmetic items or tickets to watch pro games. Any money spent on the game doesn't effect the outcome of the game other then how many more hours you're going play the hero you bought items for, lol. How ever there is a steep learning curve and even if you've played fora while you're constantly learning new things because Dota 2 is always changing.

review: This game is going to take control of you, the graphics are among the best in MOBAs. The community is, well, not as good as you would want it to be, but if you have friends you can play with, it doesn't matter as much. There are over 120 heroes to choose from and after 100+ hours you'll know all the things you need! Everything is available to you from the start so you can quickly master a few heroes and play on all pick if you want to, or play on single draft for additional challenge. There are also 8 gamemodes and a lot of events are coming out for nearly every festival eg. Christmas, Halloween etc. Overall, I recommend the game, it's great. If you want to learn the basics go play on bots for a while with a guide. Dota 2 gets a 9/10 from me just because of the community.

review: Dota 2 is a game about getting fat, and whoever is the fattest of them all wins. If your 5 man fat orgy gets fatter faster than the other growing pile of mass on the other side of the map, then when these two hideous blobs of lard collide you'll still have some fat to toss around at the enemy while they scream at each other for not being fat enough. On the other hand when you're both at the weigh in and the other team's got some bigger numbers to boast about, you'll find yourself being smothered, crushed by the fat; it betrays you! They pull you in, absorbing you into their ever growing blob as your teammates are yelling to stop feeding their mass. It becomes increasingly apparent that you are not the fattest of them all, and you start to wonder why you ever started playing Dota 2 in the first place...

review: In my opinion DOTA 2 is the best MOBA, being the offical succesor to DOTA and having a deep meta-game+mechanics that changes now and then. Valve game too so the quality is pretty much assured and the free to play model is just superb. All heroes unlocked no paywall, you don't have to pay for anything expect cosmetics and tournaments. Some tournaments are free to watch(MLG and International). It has some flaws including the community but that is an issue that cannot be fixed and I would recommend to everyone who wants to play a MOBA/is currently playing a MOBA. Almost perfect but with room for some improvements.

review: Felt like giving Dota 2 a try and like most other Moba games it's very addicting. I played a fair amount of the game as well as going through training. The heros were interesting and had a lot of diversity. Selecting the lane you preferring in hero select was a nice feature. That's the end of the good things I have to say about the game. Now for the bad. Still full of bugs. No good information on how to cancel auto buy resulting in odd issues with UI which you can't tell if it's a bug that prevents you from buying things and putting a large item icon on your screen. An insane amount of leavers during games. Then when you attempt to disconnect when it's safe, taking minutes for it to give you the disconnect screen. Region ques seem to be a joke. Always selected just the two North American ques and one in three matches getting multiple people who do not speak English. Pretty rediculus when this is supposed to be a game where you need to communicate with your team. This is also in addition to the very long que times. More time spent in que today then actually playing the game. This ultimately made me quit playing in digust. Summary- +Some great heros with unique abilities. +UI has great features when they work correctly. +Drop system that keeps you wanting to play. -Worst community I have ever had the displeasure of playing with. -Que times far too long. -Picking a region to play in doesn't seem to matter. -Though it's out of beta, still a large amount of bugs. -Training system needs some work.

review: I love DOTA 2. It has quickly become my most-played game on Steam and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of all there is to experience in it. Despite being limited to one map, the game still feels extremely large and always offers a brand new challenge with every match. With so many heroes to choose from, and so many crazy combinations for teams, I have a feeling that I'll still be learning the basics of this game for a long time coming. I can't write a DOTA review without mentioning the competitive aspect of the game. I'm a huge fan of esports, and have been following various scenes since 1997. I've watched the production values of these scenes increase slowly throughout the years to the point where there is enough media coverage and hype to reach nearly anyone. With DOTA2, I feel that things are taken to a whole new level. The in-game interface itself makes it very easy to view the latest big tournaments and watch them live from within the application WITH commentary. You can watch the games using a guided camera, or you can take control of the camera yourself and track your favorite player, all while the commentary is running in the background to give you constant updates of the action. It's phenomenal and it's another big reason why I'll be playing this game for years. In short, yes you should definitely give this game a try. No doubt about it.

Sure, there are a few core items on many heroes, but, all in all, it all depends on the game you're playing and a change can make ALL the difference. Again, if you're into MOBAs... Do try it. NOW!

review: Dota is a competitive game of action and strategy, played both professionally and casually by millions of passionate fans worldwide. Players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes, forming two teams of five players. Radiant heroes then battle their Dire counterparts to control a gorgeous fantasy landscape, waging campaigns of cunning, stealth, and outright warfare. Irresistibly colorful on the surface, Dota is a game of infinite depth and complexity. Every hero has an array of skills and abilities that combine with the skills of their allies in unexpected ways, to ensure that no game is ever remotely alike. This is one of the reasons that the Dota phenomenon has continued to grow. Originating as a fan-made Warcraft 3 modification, Dota was an instant underground hit. After coming to Valve, the original community developers have bridged the gap to a more inclusive audience, so that the rest of the world can experience the same core gameplay, but with the level of polish that only Valve can provide.

review: I looked up the wikipedia page on psychological abuse and DOTA fits it almost to the letter. 10/10 Emotional and mental abuse. This game will keep you from meeting social obligations. Enjoy meeting people from around the world as they all cuss at you in various languages, including Spanish and Russian. But that shouldn't really be a problem since team communication is almost nonexistent. If you play willingly play support you are 1/10 in the game almost always, even if they have support on their team they'll go semicarry at the minimum. Enjoy your stay, , Game is hard, noob, they gave diretide, trading keys, you forgot to ward again, dont buy boots first

review: If you can't afford to purchase cocaine to lighten up your weekend then DOTA 2 is the next best thing! Highly addictive and as equally life destroying as any drug, DOTA 2 will make you question your own sanity and send you on a spiralling quest about what the meaning of life actually is (answer could be DOTA 2). If you can't speak Russian then DOTA 2 will enable you to become fluent in the language but only if you put some effort in yourself. This means that holiday to Russia you've all been wanting will be like visiting home, rather than a foreign country. Learn great words like "" and "" and repeat them to your new friends! I've never felt more free than when I play DOTA 2, I'm sure my life span decreases every time I play it so what's not to love! Go buy it now for free and ruin your life! Play with friends so you can venture the darkness together! 11/10 must buy, very win.

review: Ahhh.... Dota 2. This game is severaly unbalanced since no matter how well you play, your team will always blame you for the loss. It is also insanely luck based because the team that gets most russians usually looses. A lot of functions in this game are completely broken as well. For example, even if you pick "English" in the language bar everyone still speaks Russian. Sometimes German or French, but never English. Playing this game I had a few mental breakdowns and smashed three windows in total. It sometimes feels like my life is fading away and I imagine life in prison with a really musculine in-mate would provide the same level of . To sum up, this is game is ing terrible. 10/10 would recommend.

review: Dota 2 is a game about getting fat, and whoever is the fattest of them all wins. If your 5 man fat orgy gets fatter faster than the other growing pile of mass on the other side of the map, then when these two hideous blobs of lard collide you'll still have some fat to toss around at the enemy while they scream at each other for not being fat enough. On the other hand when you're both at the weigh in and the other team's got some bigger numbers to boast about, you'll find yourself being smothered, crushed by the fat; it betrays you! They pull you in, absorbing you into their ever growing blob as your teammates are yelling to stop feeding their mass. It becomes increasingly apparent that you are not the fattest of them all, and you start to wonder why you ever started playing Dota 2 in the first place...

review: In my opinion DOTA 2 is the best MOBA, being the offical succesor to DOTA and having a deep meta-game+mechanics that changes now and then. Valve game too so the quality is pretty much assured and the free to play model is just superb. All heroes unlocked no paywall, you don't have to pay for anything expect cosmetics and tournaments. Some tournaments are free to watch(MLG and International). It has some flaws including the community but that is an issue that cannot be fixed and I would recommend to everyone who wants to play a MOBA/is currently playing a MOBA. Almost perfect but with room for some improvements.

review: Dota 2 is hard, but there's a huge reward for those who commit. On the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) Defense of the Ancients modification for Warcraft III, now transferred into Valve's Source engine. The game's punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but it's worth sticking the hours in: success in Dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details. If you're not aware of the basics of the burgeoning MOBA genre, two teams of five players spawn on corners of a map. Each team needs to work together with the goal of ultimately destroying a central structure--in Dota 2's case, the Ancient--in the opposing team's base. With most games lasting around the 40-minute mark, and occasionally edging past an hour, watching the enemy fortress dramatically crumble and sink to the ground feels like an exhilarating payoff. Aiding these two teams, named the Radiant and the Dire, are waves of AI assistants, called creeps. Batches of creeps spawn at 30-second intervals and charge merrily up the map's three pathways. In the clumps of remaining land lies a jungle, where numerous AI opponents spawn, offering lucrative benefits to players who take them on successfully. Finally, and in a bid to stop both teams from simply marching into one another's base, each team gets three powerful towers on each lane that easily shred through enemy players at the start of the game. Your individual ability to control and affect the rhythm of the game comes from how well you handle your hero. You mostly control a single unit in Dota 2, though there are exceptions: some heroes can summon controllable allies, such as bears, gargoyle babies, or wolves; one exceptionally versatile hero can split into three; and one item lets you take control of certain creeps. For each rule in Dota 2's impressive house-of-cards design, there's usually at least one character who completely ignores it, or finds a way around it via one of 130-odd items available from the in-match shop. For instance, try negating magic attacks with the black king bar, returning damage with the blade mail, or pounding out two ultimate abilities in quick succession with a refresher orb. The aim for most players is to accumulate as much gold and experience as possible, with income being delivered mostly by scoring the killing blow on enemy creeps and players. It's almost always easier to gang up on stray enemies as a group, which is why it's rarely a good idea to run about on your own. Then it's a case of splashing all your hard-earned money on some ultra-powerful items from the shop, while levelling up your base stats and abilities, and then clobbering the enemy team into submission via a few five-versus-five team fights. Rarely does it feel that simple, however. At the time of writing, 102 of the original Dota's 112 heroes have made their way into the sequel. Each hero has a handful of unique abilities and generally works best in a specific role, such as supporting other players as Omniknight, roaming around the map looking for opportunistic kills as Spirit Breaker, or evolving throughout the course of the game into an all-powerful vehicle of carnage and destruction as Phantom Assassin. There's only one map, unlike in many other MOBA titles, although Valve has not ruled out the addition of more over time, and has previously offered game-changing modes with seasonal events at Halloween and Christmas. But Dota 2's single sprawling map sets itself apart from the competition by being larger, more intricate, and packed with greater detail than the rest of the genre. Unlike in League of Legends, the jungle area is riddled with far more tangling pathways, the lanes feature additional shops selling exclusive items, and savvy players are given more opportunities to use the environment to hide, flee, and ambush their opponents. There are multiple layers of additional information that become increasingly relevant as you invest more time in the game. How do you effectively divide your forces? When should your team attempt to vanquish Roshan, the map's most powerful creep? What are runes? What's the significance of the fact that creeps get slightly stronger every seven and a half minutes? Often the game's dizzying scale is seen as off-putting or simply too complex, but the truth of Dota is that it can be entertaining as a new player to just sit down and let all those extraneous factors play out around you. Getting down to the brass tacks of the game with a group of like-minded friends is a lot of fun: start by buying your characters' recommended items, try your best not to get caught out of position, and get into the habit of buying observer wards. And watch out for Riki. As you'd expect from Valve, this is a beautifully presented game, with the Half-Life and Portal maker running victory laps around its competition in terms of UI, voice acting, and showing how to deftly add real personality to its characters. Only recently has the developer turned its attention to gently easing new players into the proceedings, however, and even now, mastering the basics feels like learning to swim by jumping in at the deep end. Efforts are being made to remedy this, though: right now there are a couple of tutorial levels, some well-designed AI bots, and a newbie playlist that restricts hero selection to just 20 of the most frequently picked characters. And with community-created hero guides now built directly into the game itself, Dota 2 is much easier to get started with than it has been in the past. Play a match every evening for a couple of weeks, and you start to see how Dota 2's wealth of disparate systems and mechanics combine into their own harmony, and you begin to understand how there are hundreds of elements that affect the game. Dota 2 is a tense war of accumulation and attrition. The biggest problem, which is coincidentally where the real excitement of the game lies, comes from struggling to process and interpret dozens upon dozens of mitigating circumstances while simultaneously trying to keep your cool. It is a complicated and exhausting game, and for the first few weeks, it's challenging just keeping up with the general rhythm of a match. But invest enough time into Dota 2, and you develop an almost unconscious ability to keep up with the game--performing actions such as sending the slightly fiddly in-game courier over to the faraway "secret" shop to get some rare items, for instance. After a couple of hundred hours of Dota 2, what once felt like spinning plates just happens automatically. Late-night Skype calls, drawn-out conversations down at the pub, and lost lunch breaks follow. Very few games can withstand so many emotionally charged discussions. When everything goes south, the psychological toll can be surprisingly intense, and this is very much a game with the power to both start and end close friendships. Dota 2 is an overwhelming, intoxicating, and emotionally dangerous game that can quite easily take over your entire gaming life. While Dota 2 has transferred the core of the original Dota into a cleaner, modern engine, the fact remains that losing is uniquely painful. Death in Dota 2 not only gives your opponent money, but robs you of some of your own and leaves you waiting up to a minute to respawn. By the time you've trudged back across the game's massive map--or spent money on a teleportation scroll--your opponent is now stronger and richer. Die two or three times in quick succession, which is easily done, and a match of Dota becomes a painful experience where you spend the next half hour getting bullied by an increasingly superior enemy. Other games in the genre have tried to mitigate this punishment, but Dota 2 positively revels in its complexities. The rich just get richer.

Each hero has a handful of unique abilities and generally works best in a specific role, such as supporting other players as Omniknight, roaming around the map looking for opportunistic kills as Spirit Breaker, or evolving throughout the course of the game into an all-powerful vehicle of carnage and destruction as Phantom Assassin. There's only one map, unlike in many other MOBA titles, although Valve has not ruled out the addition of more over time, and has previously offered game-changing modes with seasonal events at Halloween and Christmas. But Dota 2's single sprawling map sets itself apart from the competition by being larger, more intricate, and packed with greater detail than the rest of the genre. Unlike in League of Legends, the jungle area is riddled with far more tangling pathways, the lanes feature additional shops selling exclusive items, and savvy players are given more opportunities to use the environment to hide, flee, and ambush their opponents. There are multiple layers of additional information that become increasingly relevant as you invest more time in the game. How do you effectively divide your forces? When should your team attempt to vanquish Roshan, the map's most powerful creep? What are runes? What's the significance of the fact that creeps get slightly stronger every seven and a half minutes? Often the game's dizzying scale is seen as off-putting or simply too complex, but the truth of Dota is that it can be entertaining as a new player to just sit down and let all those extraneous factors play out around you. Getting down to the brass tacks of the game with a group of like-minded friends is a lot of fun: start by buying your characters' recommended items, try your best not to get caught out of position, and get into the habit of buying observer wards. And watch out for Riki. As you'd expect from Valve, this is a beautifully presented game, with the Half-Life and Portal maker running victory laps around its competition in terms of UI, voice acting, and showing how to deftly add real personality to its characters. Only recently has the developer turned its attention to gently easing new players into the proceedings, however, and even now, mastering the basics feels like learning to swim by jumping in at the deep end. Efforts are being made to remedy this, though: right now there are a couple of tutorial levels, some well-designed AI bots, and a newbie playlist that restricts hero selection to just 20 of the most frequently picked characters. And with community-created hero guides now built directly into the game itself, Dota 2 is much easier to get started with than it has been in the past. Play a match every evening for a couple of weeks, and you start to see how Dota 2's wealth of disparate systems and mechanics combine into their own harmony, and you begin to understand how there are hundreds of elements that affect the game. Dota 2 is a tense war of accumulation and attrition. The biggest problem, which is coincidentally where the real excitement of the game lies, comes from struggling to process and interpret dozens upon dozens of mitigating circumstances while simultaneously trying to keep your cool. It is a complicated and exhausting game, and for the first few weeks, it's challenging just keeping up with the general rhythm of a match. But invest enough time into Dota 2, and you develop an almost unconscious ability to keep up with the game--performing actions such as sending the slightly fiddly in-game courier over to the faraway "secret" shop to get some rare items, for instance. After a couple of hundred hours of Dota 2, what once felt like spinning plates just happens automatically. Late-night Skype calls, drawn-out conversations down at the pub, and lost lunch breaks follow. Very few games can withstand so many emotionally charged discussions. When everything goes south, the psychological toll can be surprisingly intense, and this is very much a game with the power to both start and end close friendships. Dota 2 is an overwhelming, intoxicating, and emotionally dangerous game that can quite easily take over your entire gaming life. While Dota 2 has transferred the core of the original Dota into a cleaner, modern engine, the fact remains that losing is uniquely painful. Death in Dota 2 not only gives your opponent money, but robs you of some of your own and leaves you waiting up to a minute to respawn. By the time you've trudged back across the game's massive map--or spent money on a teleportation scroll--your opponent is now stronger and richer. Die two or three times in quick succession, which is easily done, and a match of Dota becomes a painful experience where you spend the next half hour getting bullied by an increasingly superior enemy. Other games in the genre have tried to mitigate this punishment, but Dota 2 positively revels in its complexities. The rich just get richer.

review: So you look at this game's store page and you're like "This looks like a fun game." So you download it and start it up. So you play a few games against bots and have fun, a few more against bots but with real people on your team. You're thinking "Wow this is a real fun team building game!" But you aren't ready to be up against real people you think so after training for a month and getting over a hundred hours played you think you're ready. You put down your prefrences: US West Server, English speaking people only, and you hop into a game. After six minutes you find a game (finally!) and after loading into the game you see your teammates' names.   38, ,  , and  . "Well those aren't English at all" you think to yourself, Your enemies all have English names though. Anyway into the game you go, 3 of your teamates go middle, 1 goes bottom and you are at top, there is no courier by the way. The 3 at mid are arguing in some language you don't understand and the one at bottom is afk. Within 10 minutes your team's T1 and T2 towers are gone, the enemies' towers aren't touched also   has just abandoned for being afk and in a few short minutes the others will abandon leaving you to be killed multiple times. The people on the other team are saying "I feel bad for you son" and other such things. After you lose you try another game, thinking that this one will be different. It's not. you try again and again look for a game that you aren't matched with foreign speakers that are terrible or you win so quickly and easily it's boring. But you never do, and you can't quit now you're to deep in. You've caught the bug, can't stop playing, you are devoted to finding that one game that isn't a disapointment, will you ever find it though? probably not. all in all it's a good game 10/10 would reommend.

review: I love DOTA 2. It has quickly become my most-played game on Steam and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of all there is to experience in it. Despite being limited to one map, the game still feels extremely large and always offers a brand new challenge with every match. With so many heroes to choose from, and so many crazy combinations for teams, I have a feeling that I'll still be learning the basics of this game for a long time coming. I can't write a DOTA review without mentioning the competitive aspect of the game. I'm a huge fan of esports, and have been following various scenes since 1997. I've watched the production values of these scenes increase slowly throughout the years to the point where there is enough media coverage and hype to reach nearly anyone. With DOTA2, I feel that things are taken to a whole new level. The in-game interface itself makes it very easy to view the latest big tournaments and watch them live from within the application WITH commentary. You can watch the games using a guided camera, or you can take control of the camera yourself and track your favorite player, all while the commentary is running in the background to give you constant updates of the action. It's phenomenal and it's another big reason why I'll be playing this game for years. In short, yes you should definitely give this game a try. No doubt about it.

The way Valve makes money off the game are skins which are cosmetic items which are not required to be purchased and are only there for looks Overall I would definately recommend this to anyone as It is Free to play and doesn't have a pay to win model. Anyways pick it up when you can! 10/10

review: It was one of the first big free-to-play games, and one of the first big multiplayer online battle arenas, or MOBAs. But going on five years later, League of Legends still holds firm as an example of excellence. With its amazing variety of Champions, rewarding progression systems, and fast but intensely strategic team play, it easily hooked me and refused to let go. That addictiveness and competitive spirit, combined with a generous free-to-play approach and frequent updates from developer Riot Games, has created one of the biggest and liveliest gaming communities anywhere. Like most MOBAs, League of Legends main attraction is its five-on-five matches on its staple three-lane map. Called Summoner's Rift, this map is brightly and colorfully designed, and it creates a distinct playstyle with the way its dense brush allows you to conceal yourself and surprise enemies. I particularly love how the distinctive jungles on either side of the central river are filled with NPC monsters that give buffs to players who take a break from battle to go on the hunt  its a constant temptation to risk venturing into the other teams territory to attempt to steal their buffs. The choice between engaging the other team directly or attacking their resources allows for interesting strategies and depth beyond simply fighting until one Champion or turret is dead. Inside each team's base also lies an Inhibitor which, if destroyed, causes the opposing teams side to start spawning super minions. Its an extra strategic objective to target in the enemy base, and having one more building to take down often leads to exciting and game-ending team fights. From Ziggs, the bomb-loving little rat, to Jinx, the blue-pigtailed maniac, its electrifying to coordinate with your team to mow down your opponents and push lanes with Leagues Inside each team's base also lies an Inhibitor which, if destroyed, causes the opposing teams side to start spawning super minions. Its an extra strategic objective to target in the enemy base, and having one more building to take down often leads to exciting and game-ending team fights. As free-to-play games go, League of Legends is a model of generosity. Though it doesnt give everything away like Dota 2 does, it serves up a weekly rotating selection of 10 Champions for free, and you can purchase and play with any of the 117-character roster for a reasonable price of between two and eight dollars each. Yes, that adds up to a princely sum if you intend to buy every single character, but theres no need to buy more than you intend to actually play. The Champion rotation is a nice way to try before you buy, and helped me to pace myself by learning just a few characters at a time. You can also unlock every Champion at a satisfying rate without spending a penny, which is not only fulfilling, but it sets League apart from the type of free-to-play game that deliberately makes it impractical to play at a competitive level for no cost. Since many players opt for a completely free experience, its exciting when the roster changes and pushes the community to try out fresh characters and new strategies. If you want to go a step further, you can buy cosmetic skins for every character. They can be pricey, but each skin has tons of detail, and its impressive that most of them come with unique spell effects and animations. My Panda Annie skin, for example, changes the little pink-haired girl into a mini-geisha of sorts, and her ultimate ability calls down a panda version of her grizzly bear, Tibbers. (Yay, Tibbers!) In the opening minutes of a match, League's Champions distinguish themselves with lots of low-level area-of-effect abilities that make killing minions quick and easy. Unlike some other MOBAs, there's no way to attack your own minions to deprive your enemy the experience and gold, making it simpler to focus on other tasks, like getting last hits. The absence of those denial tactics definitely takes a competitive aspect away from League, but it's one that's often frustrating. I dont miss it. Relative to other MOBAs where management of special-ability juice (magic points, in this case) is key, I also enjoy how often abilities are available for use in League. Its awesome being able to constantly harass opponents with spells rather than having to worry about conserving them all for one crucial moment. But that doesnt mean abilities dont matter. Some of the strongest attacks are skill shots (projectiles requiring precise manual aim), and failing to hit your target can have catastrophic, game-changing consequences in team fights. From simple slows to huge Super Mega Death Rockets that travel across the whole map, snagging enemies with these moves while dodging theirs is a giddy thrill. The importance League of Legends places on these skill shots helps set its style of action apart. You dont lose any money when you die in League, making it easier to save up for new weapons and armor in the item shop. The item selection is decent, but most players always seem to rely on you to build your character using expected items, like The Bloodthirster or Rabadon's Deathcap. Straying from the recommended builds doesn't make you useless, but some of these might as well be called required items instead of recommended, considering their power. On the bright side, this means spending less time shopping and more time playing. Also, the recent addition of a variety of Support items, like The Frost Queens Claim and Talisman of Ascension which grant passive gold, are a good move in the right direction for diversifying builds. It might be easier to coordinate unusual item builds if League had built-in voice chat. Unless youve set up a TeamSpeak/Ventrilo/Mumble/Skype/etc call with your pre-arranged team before joining a game, the only ways to communicate are via text, which often goes unnoticed, or through four alerts to indicate danger, on my way, missing, or assist me. Nothing sucks more than watching a crucial surprise attack slip through my fingers because a teammate was too busy to see me pinging. At least when your team falls so hopelessly behind 20 minutes into a 40-ish minute match that four of five teammates agree its all over, the handy surrender option prevents you from wasting time fighting a losing battle. Even though you play on the same few maps with similar items, theres so much depth and strategy going on that no two matches of League of Legends ever feel the same. Its distinctive style encourages surprise attacks and frequent use of skill-shot powers, and its colorful art style makes everything pop on the screen. Learning how to make the most of its characters and to become an asset to a team is a long and challenging process, but once youve got it down, its incredibly satisfying to work together to destroy your enemies in this amazing MOBA.

review: dota (defense of the ancients ) is a action rts game, a great esports platform, a fun game to play if you just know the mechanics of this great game. 10 random players choose from a strong hero pool with different powers and the players have to cooperate with each other understand the extremities of the game. Leadership,Forgivness,Sacrifice and great strategy is required for the win or you end up losing and wasting an hour or two. The only drawback is a steep learning curve but when finally you learn this game you will just love this and play all day. It is also a great way to connect with players of the world a large community supports this, So a word of advice PLAY HARD DIE HARD GO PRO.

review: This game shouldn't be ignored if you're not a casual gamer. Just like every other valve game: Exelent! + Generous "Free to play" system + Extremly teambased game (Teamplay decides mostly the victory) + Every round is different = Very long playable + Customisation + Sound, music and voices + Epic feeling/atmosphere + Pro gaming orientated + Private matches + Bots are exactly following their difficulty (easy bots are easy, impossible bots are your nightmares) and are intelligent + Many characters, who are voiced to show that they have a personality and backstory. Every character is different to another. They react/express themselves with the kills, deaths, team mate characters, enemy characters (espicially Kunkka and Tidehunter, Clockwerk and Tinker, Crystal Maiden and Lina("You were adopted"), etc. ) + Roles (Carry, Support, Lane-Support, Disabler, Ganker, Nuker, Initiator, Jungler, Pusher, Roamer, Durable) +/- Steep learning curve: Depends if you like an intense game or not. - One map - One gamemode - Some players are not playing in their local server - Low on polygons Remember: The difficulty of this game is high and frustrating, but as soon as you mastered it, you'll be rewarded with great games.

review: I just want to start with, that this is one of the best games I've EVER played. The first RTS-esque game I ever touched, was Warcraft III. I remember playing it together locally with my big brother and a friend of ours. So my brother, fell for this game; League of Legends, too at the time I was a big fan of the musician with the name of Basshunter. So I had to try LoL too, it was free, what had I to loose? My interest for it. Right away. It wasn't as action-filled, or exciting like the games I played at that time; Minecraft and Call of Duty(sorry). So yeah, I was more the 'FPS-guy'. But about a year later, a friend of mine got a free BETA-copy of the game, Dota 2. He wasn't especially good at it, and probably ruined a game or two for his teammates, though it sure was fun! A other friend of mine got it from him, it was nothing special about it, but after all, they started to play together. A day, when a friend was over on a sleep-over, he had this bunch of copies of the game, so I asked him, might I have one? And he said yes, like it was obvious. Eventhough I only had watched the cinematic trailer(which was damn awesome) and listened to Basshunters song, it felt damn promising. And finally, my to already-playing mates, invited me to play a match. My first hero was Sven. I picked him for his looks, but he was a truly badass character, now Sven is my personal favorite, and best played hero. Well... I suppose the game didn't go so well, and I lost my hopes for it. But a month later, I was back in the track; and I enjoyed every single second of that match. The akward satisfication I felt inside when I was auto-attacking creeps. Now I play Dota 2 alot... ALOT. And I felt since September this year, I've felt that I've learned alot by watching pro-matches, professional players like Purge, and by playing the game in general. Being a pro-player is a target I really want to reach, which I think is worth going for. Dota 2 is a very fun and competetive game that has its up and downs, but is pure entertaintment.

review: Simulate the immagration crisis in the US with Valve continuation of the beloved series, DotA 2. Even when playing only in US servers you can still find yourself playing with people from all over the world. Experience aliens from Mexico, China, and Russia border hop into your game and be unable to function as a team due to the language barrier. Ever wanted to be called a  in 7 different languages, some youve never even heard of? Well now you can, try today!

review: This game is ok. Only 22 playable warriors, team death 8 v 8 is fun I guess, this is an okay FPS lots of animals but yeah, you guys should try it, This game is very similar to "Bakugan Battle Brawlers (Video Game)". Also this game has a guest character, the guest character is James Bond, TIP: don't use his knife, it got nerfed in the recent free expansion.

review: One of the most epic games ever made, a total improvement from the original dotA. Equipments and couriers are also replaceable with our own ones to serve as a "costume" to make different heroes look better, what is even better is the trade feature that is added to the game, allowing players to take part in steam trading and learn about it but also lets players search and trade for their own wanted items! Awesome game, great graphics, user friendly controls, its just awesome. Although one bad thing is recently the dota 2 network has been having problems, so it is quite hard to not be able to play my favourite game.... 9/10

review: I can not stress how bad this game is, no words can describe this crap that was put together by someone's five year old kid and said "hell, my kid smurt haha lul" and then valve secretly buys this game and "improves on it". Tell me, how in the world do you improve feces? Well, you don't, and valve will never know that because they released games like CS:GO, which is just a reskinned version of CS:S, also they added hat simulator aspects to get people addicted and shoving this  down your friend's throats. Will DOTA 2 ever have a downfall you say? Well, frankly it has, Russians are allowed everywhere, and Brazilians and Africans and spacemen, but why stop there? Why not add a reskin of a reskin? Oh wait, they have, and do... They even have different voiceovers. I can't stress how stupid the community is, everyone who has 3+ hours is already trying to find a simmilar, if not better game that looks like dota, for example League of Legends, which is a good game, if not great game, shunned by the DOTA 2 community as evil. Hell, I have seen DOTA 2 fans hate StarCraft 2 because it was a RTS game, it makes no god damn sense. I actually did like one thing about DOTA 2, and that was uninstalling it, I had so much fun, you guys should try it too! But really, this game is running on so much swag and yolo, it will be more hated than the... actually it is one of the most hated game aready, if you remove Halo and COD out of the way at least. -Trace PS: This game is bad, and you all should feel VERY bad!

review: Dota 2 is not for everyone. Don't get me wrong, this is personally a time consuming game. If you're planning on going to play a match before you go to bed in 10 minutes, you must be mistaken. This game has so much to offer to the players. They have their own market for you along with Team Fortress 2 type of things, but that's another review I have to write. Dota 2 has so many characters you can play as, it's mind blowing. 98, to be exact. This is a strategetic game that I think is a must-played game by all gamers if possible. This is an exact type of game some game companies should look at and see how much success they've had for the past few years. I am excited for the events they have been coming up with as if Frostivus, I know, it was canceled... again. I'd have to recommend this game to almost anyone who has games in their blood. I give Dota 2 a full on 9.5/10.

If you ever hope to enjoy this game you ll have endure the "great" community of perfectionists, learn using the various guides of the respective heroes but most importantly by experience (pretty much doing the same thing over and over until you re almost perfect). This way you re going to find out even with the increased difficulty of the game you ll be seeing yourself enjoy Dota 2. PS : Make sure you start playing with friends who played this game more than you do in order to advance a litle the learning phase.

review: This game wont make anyone bored... I have playing Dota 2 for almost 920 hours and i never get bored ~ even if it the same map and the same concept. this game combine strategy and team work and skills all at once, timing and knowledge of the items... players in lvl 1 can beat lvl 200 ~ everyone here is equal and all the heroes are free to play. i think this game is the best yet i found that i can still play it all the time and never get bored cuz everytime i try something new~ new hero ~ new strategy ~ new items ~ and every time its new party to play with and a new combination of heros that you can try to combine the skills with. Most of the people see a MOBA game and just wont start to play it cuz they see the gameplay looks from the top (watch the character from up) and they think the game sucks~ i think its what makes that game a good game... you be able to watch your back and looks out for your friends. There also the option the add mods from workshop and get the game more funny adn try new stuff. Also you can play with different mode like : "least played" or "all random" and its make the choices of the heros more fun to play and learn (and the game mode have alot of options). I recommend everyone to play dota 2 and more recommend to play with friends and talk while the game... just keep positive feelings and be happy when you play ~ its just a game XD

review: A freshly released new MOBA game thats currently the most played game on steam- Dota 2. A sequel to its great successor - Defense of the Ancients. A wide variety of dedicated server selection by regions will merely make a difference as the game is flooded with russians. Oh, you thought you had it bad at HoN or LoL? Prepare to rip your balls off when you realize that on US servers 3 of your teammates are from russia. PRIVET. While you rage at your teammates youll constantly have this feeling at the back of your head - if russians run from russian servers how bad is it there? Pretty god damn bad I assume. If you manage to team up with 4 of your friends the game is quite enjoyable. Wide variety of heroes will constantly keep you entertained aswell as interesting additions to the droppable item pool that allow stat tracking and changing appearances of heroes of your choice in game. A splendid graphics and physics engine makes Dota 2 currently the best game of its genre. 9/10.

Also you can play with different mode like : "least played" or "all random" and its make the choices of the heros more fun to play and learn (and the game mode have alot of options). I recommend everyone to play dota 2 and more recommend to play with friends and talk while the game... just keep positive feelings and be happy when you play ~ its just a game XD

review: PLUSES: + A lot of kinds of heroes + Very interesting game, if your teammates and enemies are normal people MINUSES: - There is only 1 map - Players with abusive nicknames (often russian,turkish and a few american players' nicknames) - I like Demigod more than DotA 2. Because, this game type used by Demigod at first time. - There are not achievements! Reason: Everyone speak about this game and I bored and tried this game.

review: A hard-to-master and challeging game this one. If you ever hope to enjoy this game you ll have endure the "great" community of perfectionists, learn using the various guides of the respective heroes but most importantly by experience (pretty much doing the same thing over and over until you re almost perfect). This way you re going to find out even with the increased difficulty of the game you ll be seeing yourself enjoy Dota 2. PS : Make sure you start playing with friends who played this game more than you do in order to advance a litle the learning phase.

review: I started playing Dota since i was 14. Dota is a team game, so team work is a must Dota has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you focus on it, learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday. I mostly playing supports in Dota. I learn playing support role from good guide but it just teaches you the basics. I have spent my time playing for 3000+ hours, and I realized, I have spent 3000+ hours of my life in a best game ever. After all, I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better.

Schnapp dir ein paar Freunde und spielt als Team. Sonst echt empfehlenswert! .................................................................................................................. Very good implementation of DotA mods. The best MOBA game far and wide. Prepare a lot of fun and depressing hours of gameplay. This is definitely not a game that you should play alone!

review: I started playing this game awhile ago, thinking it was a little fun game I could play from time to time. Turns out when you download Dota you agree to sell your soul to Satan and in exchange you get people who don't speak English on US servers, supports that either feed or don't support, and the worst of all, you have people that are actually good at the game (scary, right?). Of course I have friends to play this new game with. I hate all of them. I'll probably never get a job and will die of starvation because I play Dota "420/69 or in simpler terms 9/11" -me

review: Okay well about two years after my first review I thought it was a good time to revisit this. This is by far the best"free" game out there(I have spent too much money on tourney tickets and .) And any of you losers still playing League of Legends really need to take a step back and think about your life. Are you ever going to take off the training wheels and step up your game? Probably not, because you've become too used to "baby's first dota" and the thought of having access to all the heroes is too daunting and youd rather only have the small pool of "free" heroes to select from. Because you don't like having fun. And you like spending money on things that should have been free from the start. If you dont want to buy cosmetics or tourney tickets then all this game will cost you is your sanity and your faith in the human race. 11/10 would sacrifice firstborn to continue to play

review: If I want to give a review of this game in a nutshell, it would look like this: "The game is good, the community of players is bad, unforgiving and unwelcoming." First of all: if you don't want to play something, in which players become insulting-machines saying their favourite words "noob, feeder, report", then don't play this game, because you will turn into a nervous-wreck person in a short time, and will find yourself already punished just because you are a beginner, who just completed the tutorials. All of this because the players take this game bloody serious, and they can't play for fun, but only to get kills, and win the round. So I warned you: if you want to even try this game's pvp out, then you should have a lot of patience. (and with that, I mean A LOT) Now let's get into the game itself: Note: if you already played League of Legends, then you may think, that is all the same. Well, partly it's true, partly it isn't. Dota (2) and LoL may have the same goal, but they are actually very different in game mechanics, rules, and some other things too. Believe me, I've tried both games. /Note Unfortunately, the first DotA wasn't in my life, even tough I did play Warcraft 3. So yes, I still realized the changes for some heroes' look, and found some of them, who I liked to use in WC 3 (insert a short smile). Personally, I like this game. Even tough, I have an old pc, on which the graphics looks awkward (with missing textures even from the map), the game can be runned, and played well. The game sets on only one map, but with more than a hundred playable heroes, this only map can become re-playable for a very long time (I still would like to see more maps in the future). I don't really know, what more could I say about the game itself. Now did I say, that I like this game? Yes, I actually did, because itself is pretty good and spectacular. However, there is something, that makes me very disappointed: the player-community. And I don't want to say anything more about it, since I've already told a lot about it, in the beginning. I'll still recommend it, because the game isn't guilty to have that harrassing and unwelcoming community.

review: You think LoL is better? Get out, why? They're both MOBA's, don't compare them just because of that. LoL and DotA2 are both great games. (I've been playing LoL recently) Dota 2 (Defense of the Ancients 2) is a fantastic MOBA game where teamwork is highly recommended, you have your three lanes where you and your laning partner (unless you're middle, although you can duo-lane with IO or tri-laning) try to win the lane against the other team's laning heroes, this is what we call 'Early game' or the laning phase. Later on you will often roam around the map in order to help your allies get kills, usually after a few kills have been made and your team has nice farm (nice amount of gold/nice items), this is called 'Mid Game' And then beyond that point when you're near lvl18-25 is known as 'Late Game/End Game' where you will usually be close to destroying the enemy team's ancient. And then there's the classic "Base Race", that's when there are no towers or barracks defending the ancient on either team meaning its a race to end each others ancient first. Note: This is my first proper review and I did it half-heartedly as I just wanted to get back to the game itself. I want more people to like this. Here is music for you to listen to while you MOBA

Besides the fact that its free-to-play, getting your friends to play, (or making new friends) is key unless you want to be stuck with annoying players who kick you for being insolent. Anyways, the community is far from perfect, but it isn't downright horrible either. It is in my opinion, pretty decent to say the least. 11/10 stole my friend's life and my life.

review: I do not want to be a troll, but recently I have left behind LoL to start playing DOTA2, and I do not regret this decision, since it has more in-depth at every fight when compared to LoL. Sure the community seems a bit more toxic then LoL's but I can get used to it, since all the time I do not write in chat and mute the flamers and wannabe's. Playing with friends it's more fun then alone and more rewarding, especially the events or being in a team. One thing I do not like about the game is the cost of the skins and items for the events. They are way to pricey. But on the other hand there is always discounts at the shop. To mention that the graphics are amazing and optimized since it is running on the SOURCE engine. See you on the battlefield champion! PS: If you want to do SOLO rankings prepare to learn Russian and how to delete DOTA from Steam. Do that at your own risk but I strongly suggest playing with friends.

You can beat this game in 30 minutes to an hour, but a lot of people have over 1000 hours, they must really suck or something. Thankfully it's free, or else I wouldn't pay a single cent for this. And also I don't get why there are 107 characters. Why can't there just be one ultimate character and just play it through? And ultimately, why am I forced to learn Russian or Portuguese in order to understand half of this game? 10/10, would not place any wards again.

review: If you want a game where you can organize fights and win 100% of the time with strangers. This is not for you. Aside from the constant trash talk and a very long losing streak it is quite and enjoyable game. For the first hundred games you will probably the feeder or the one everyone wants to pass the blame on. But as you get past that you either play your role to win or lose. Want to learn some basic russian or perhaps some random language you never even heard of before. This is the game you komrad. Oh yes you can always report random people for absolutely no reason LOL!

review: What the  did you just ing say about me you ing noob? Ill have you know I have a 6K MMR main account, and Ive been involved in numerous secret ambushes on hard carries, and I have over 9000 confirmed ganks. I am trained in landing my skill-shots and Im the top CS'er of the entire China player-base. You are nothing to me but just another 2K MMR scrub. I will wipe you the  out with aggression the likes of which has never been seen before on this server, mark my ing words. You think you can get away with saying that  to me over the Internet? Think again, noob. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of pubstompers across the world and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare to get stack-sniped, feeder. The stack that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your Dota 2 life. Youre ing dead, kiddo. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my auto-attacks. Not only am I extensively trained in hardcore farm battles, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the ganking and pushing line-ups and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable  off the face of the server, you little noob. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your ing tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you  idiot. I will  fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre ing dead, kiddo.

review: Ok, a lot of "MLG PROS" and fanboys were butthurt at my original dota review, so here's my edit I guess. My main reason for hatred towards dota 2 is aside from it being Just another ing moba game Is this: Valve picked creating this game, over many, MANY others. Keep in mind Gabe Newell, and VALVE OVERALL. picked this game, over Stars of blood. They picked this game, over half life 3. They picked this game, over left 4 dead 3. And this is Just kinda spitballing BUT THEY PICKED THIS GAME, OVER MAYBE ING PORTAL AND TEAM FORTRESS 3. That's my honest reason on why I hate dota 2. It's Just a generic moba game when valve had TONS of other decisions. I expected more out of valve I expected more out of GABE NEWELL. When you FINALLY start working your fat  on said games instead of...this...I'll respect you again, but Even still, I will never forgive your ing decision.

review: An excellent alternative to Rosetta Stone. During your first 100 hours you can expect to learn how to communciate with and insult people in multiple different languages including - but not limited to - Russian (!!!!), Brazilian (CALA BOCAAAA), and multiple Chinese dialects (). If you enjoy playing games that rely heavily on communication with people who don't speak a word of English (noop) despite selecting US East (South America North) or US West (Russia East) as their prefered server then dota is the game for you. The learning curve is steep so make sure not to give up if you don't do well during your first few games. Improve quickly by selecting a hero by slamming your face into the keyboard, calling mid lane, and using all your spells to quickly kill the creep. Don't forget that you can buy kitty ears from the in-game store to make your favorite character look cuter and give the illusion that you are good at the game.

review: The game inappropriately titled 'Defence of the Ancients (two)'- you do not defend ancients, but participate in a deathmatch game similiar to Call of Duty- is a blight on gaming. After playing the game for two and a half years I feel as though a malignant tumor has spawned within my brain, and it is growing. Gaben 'Icefrog' Newell (the 'genius' of the game) is praised as a God amongst the community, however, 'he' is actually a Succubus, conspiring with the other succubi to obtain the blood of the virgins whom entertain themselves with the game. Nevertheless, the game does have several redeeming factors. Firstly, the game will allow you to expand your vocabularly as when controlling a hero, they speak in a bloviated manner - using large words as if they were free. Phrases such as "I am a beacon of knowledge blazing across a black sea of ignorance" and not to mention the hero lores. Here is an exert from the currently titled (undoubtly going to change again) Outworld Devour's lore: "Imprinted deep in the shining lattices of his intellect lies a resonant pattern akin to prophecy, a dark music implying that eventually some evil will wake out there, beyond the edges of creation, and turn its attention to our world." Like what the  does that mean? It doesn't matter though, as I have benefited from things such as this by implementing them into essays. Secondly, the game allows you to socialize with fellow autists, forming a kind of autist convention where everyone discusses memes such as "S A D B O Y S" and "KOTL, Giff me Mana." This imminently creates a circle-jerk of a large magnitute. This is great however as you get to see some  & Balls Anyway,  game.

The community sucks. Hard. if you convince a friend to play and don't want him to give up, you must play with him in private lobbies, practice with him, teach him how to play each role properly etc. My girlfriend tried to play, she gave up after being heavilly insulted 2 times in a row because she made some mistakes... If you don't have experience with this kind of game (I don't like the term MOBA, but, yeah, games like League of Legends or Heroes of Newearth) be warned though, you MUST practice, watch videos about each hero and know your role if you want to have some fun when playing online. But for me, it doesn't matter how much I practice, I always end up in the same team with angry boys who can't enjoy the game because you are not playing the way he likes, so, after some time, I discovered it was better to play against bots with my friends.

review: My mild mannered, canadian friend got angry enough to call someone a nig**r. A long time casual acquaintance completely freaked out at me when I swapped positions with him at an inopportune moment. People get angry with me when I pick my favorite hero (Phantom Assassin), because she is somewhat mediocre and not used very much in professional play. People get angry with me when I don't pick Phantom Assassin, because she's the hero I've played most and have the highest winrate with. More than half of my games feature someone who does not speak English, or is muted. Earlier today I played a game where my team captain drafted me Crystal Maiden, and was confused when I complained about her poor, crippled appendages. She takes like a second to raise her staff and fire a super slow snowball at someone, walks around agonizingly slowly, and turns at the speed of a small locomotive. When I try to explain that this bothers me to people, they react with a curious mixture of confusion and horror. This is the dota experience, and changing it is unthinkable. I introduced two of my better friends in real life to the game. I think that one of them was more despairing during a game we played, than when his last girlfriend split up with him. But still, they play.

review: Oh man, Dota 2. Don't get me wrong here at the negative review, hear me out first. I say with confidence that Dota 2 is an addicting MOBA game with great gameplay and fun. Then why the negative review you say? Well for one the community is scarcely better than Russia under Stalin. If you play on any server you must be 100% prepared for racism, s, jerks, and 12 year olds. Not only that, but even if you put your language preference as English, half the players you play with are obnoxious Peruvians. This does not make the game unplayable but can seriously piss you off. If you have played this game as long or longer than me you will understand this. Another bad thing is that I would willingly compare playing this game to a adrug addiction. You literally can't stop playing it when you start, and when life interrupts you, you will start to think Dota 2 is more important. THAT MY FRIENDS IS WHEN YOU QUIT THE GAME! I had to wean myself off of it for like weeks until I couldn't stand looking at the icon anymore, needless to say I uninstalled. MY ADVICE FOR NEW PLAYES: GET A FRIEND TO PLAY IT WITH YOU, AND DON'T BECOME ADDICTED! That is all

review: My mild mannered, canadian friend got angry enough to call someone a nig**r. A long time casual acquaintance completely freaked out at me when I swapped positions with him at an inopportune moment. People get angry with me when I pick my favorite hero (Phantom Assassin), because she is somewhat mediocre and not used very much in professional play. People get angry with me when I don't pick Phantom Assassin, because she's the hero I've played most and have the highest winrate with. More than half of my games feature someone who does not speak English, or is muted. Earlier today I played a game where my team captain drafted me Crystal Maiden, and was confused when I complained about her poor, crippled appendages. She takes like a second to raise her staff and fire a super slow snowball at someone, walks around agonizingly slowly, and turns at the speed of a small locomotive. When I try to explain that this bothers me to people, they react with a curious mixture of confusion and horror. This is the dota experience, and changing it is unthinkable. I introduced two of my better friends in real life to the game. I think that one of them was more despairing during a game we played, than when his last girlfriend split up with him. But still, they play.

review: I've been playing DOTA since DOTA 1 came up a decade ago. In DOTA 2, the game mechanic is quite balanced, every hero has its own strengths and weaknesses just like in the previous one. Definitely not a P2W kind of game. However, the solo MMR pairing is really awful. I dropped from 3k to 2k in just a week and forever stuck in this level no matter how hard I play. Here's a few suggestions that I could think of: -They should also consider hours of playing and K/D/A ratio instead of just MMR level to balance the pairing. -Players who got into low priority should get more severe punishment (e.g. longer period and add extra requirements to get away from low priority) so they would think twice before they trash-talk and not obidient. At this rate, a skill in par with TI players' is the only way to break out. Unfortunately, you need to play A LOT to get there. If you're really lucky, you could be paired with decent players, and that's a one big if. A casual gamer like me has no place in this game.

review: Dota 2 is a similar game to League of Legends, with some differences that make both of them unique, like how you can get couriers and have access to secret shops in dota while in LoL, there are summoner spells and masteries. However, this is a review about Dota and what the game is about, not a comparison about these 2 games. Dota is a MOBA game (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena), in which you are place in a team of 5 players to go against another team of 5 players with one main object, which is to obliterate the enemies towers, barracks, and finally, their ancient. All of you start at level 1 and all of you have to destroy anything in your path while trying to not have any casualties along the way, since the enemy who just killed you will gain lots of exp as well as some gold. As simple as it looks, it's not, as that there are many ways that your opponent can stop you from progressing, like the occasional ganks that happen from time to time. Aside from the basics of Dota, the game is really fun......unless there's that *sshole that'll keep calling you a noob or if there's that player that dies intentionally, but other then that, the graphics are good, controls are easy, and overall, the gameplay is great, so go on and download Dota and have fun.

review: riot first game launches their company straight to moon with they're fantastical sequal to legends of newerth to conquer the gaming industry . everyone go 5v5 n control a hero expect for meepo because he become not 1 not 2 not 3 but 4 except agh then not 1 not 2 not 3 not 4 but 5 hero . other than that there are many different forces involve to defend the ancient which is name of game but does not make sense because the aim of game is to destroy the ancient. maybe dota 2 stand for destroy of the ancient 2 because icefrog made mistake on warcraft 3. overall riot has done well to please every player imaginable to cannibal (naix) drunk ( pandaeren brewmaster) fem dom ( queen of pain ) alchemists ( alchemist ) samurai ( juggernaut)  ( night stalker ) uni professor ( rubick ) father of zyzz ( zeus ) ttrolls ( troll warlod) n many more. no discriminatio in this game because every race species continent is embraced to play destry the ancient. even in the game there is combo of riverr forest and dead land.if you came from neopets then i would strngly recommend to play this because yo can buy your own coureir and upgrade it with red bull. the community in dota 2 is very great too because eveyrone is always friendly teamwork leadership and forgiving. 10/10 would play again with rednecks

review: Well it was all fun and games until some douchecrap   ing mothershiiting spree decided to just steal the items and troll the game. Everything would've gone smoothly if Volvo would've added an option to get your items back from Russian 'conts'. Obviously, Gabe decided he is waaay too fat and a douche to add such feature so the game overall sucks. I would give it a 4 out of 900 and I wish it would burn in Gabe's . Thanks for reading my review and I hope you will appreciate the effort I put into writing it.

review: This is the worst game that I've ever played and I'm going to tell you why in this personal review. One of the many issues that I have with this game is that community, the community in this game is god damn awful, with people with a mindset of a child who hardly knows how to play this game, people who don't even speak english even though they set their preference to english, bad matchmaking system that partners me with the worst of the worst, people who troll on the team verbally and techincally set themselves up as a traitor, helping the enemy feed off of them and gain them bonuses gold and experiance to  our team. The community in most moba games like League of Legends, Heroes of Newerth, Dota 1, Dota 2, Smite, and other games contains the most vile, hateful, resentful people of them all, then your average call of duty game (hell, I sometimes think they are equal on the worst communities ever). Nobody dares to help a newbie out on problems, half of the people don't even speak english, some of them rather not to communicate to the team and point it out, most of the people tend to do that annoying ping spam over and over, everytime they die, everytime someone missed the kill, or refuse to help you out on a gank. Besides this community that is the worst among the worst, I have a few issues with this game, one of them is the lack of a feature in most games is the surrender button, to people to agree to end the match when we all know that the enemy completely stomped us. Without this, the enemy will continue to hamilitate us, added salt to the wounds, and more conflicts and issues come upon the team because of this. One good thing i like about this game is that the heroes are unique itself and not the same , and unlike league of legends, they are all free to play and don't require to spend cash to acquire a single character, so it's easier on the wallet and also easier upon me to try and see how well I can be on this character. The itemization takes some time to adjust and one another good thing is how the in-game build guides actually helps me out and don't require me to alt-tab each and everytime to see what I buy next and what I put that level up point into, and informed details about the ability, item, and why it's required for this particular character.

review: I've played this game since it was a mod for Warcraft, and I have to say, it's one of my favorite games. However, much like TF2, it has it's fair share of problems. For starters, this game has a stupidly high learning curve. There's no one true way to play any of the 100+ heroes, and it can get very frustrating very fast trying to find what you can easily work with for any of them with the gigantic selection of items. Other than Legion Commander, I still have yet to master any of the very small pool of heroes that I feel comfortable playing as, with my success {or lack there of, which is normally the case} depending largely on the skill level of the enemy team and my teammates. Which brings us to the next point. 90% of the people who play this game are stupid. Now, I don't claim to be good at this. I'm slightly above average at best. However, it's hard to play on anything outside of solo bot servers when you're constantly thrown in with stupid people, first timers, people who don't speak the server regions language, people who are only there to prance around in costumes, or don't want to follow simple orders/use common sense. Or any combination of the above. Meanwhile, you can rest assured that your opponents will almost always have their act together, and be an unstoppable force that you futiley try to at least hinder. Which is made even harder when your teammates insist on throwing themselves into unwinnable battles, further feeding them until the point where there's a 10+ level gap between you and the lowest leveled enemy. On the other hand, you might go up against a team that's super bad. As in, it's a game that lasts less than 20 minutes. In which case, you've learned nothing, and your time is wasted just as thoroughly as it would be against people out of your league. Or, on the occasion that you get teammates that know what they're doing, you can expect them to whine about your choice of hero, your starting items/abilities, your lane choice, or god forbid, your costume. At which point, 9/10 of these people will purposefully feed the enemy or go afk, and then either rage quit or stop when you've ceased your apparantly unforgivable behavior. Or they might report you to try and get you thrown into low priority {more on that below}, which is Dota's equivalent of hell {long connection times, and having to play with the worst of the worst}. And unlike TF2, you can't just drop out whenever you wish without taking a heavy penalty for doing so. So have fun being in matches where there will be almost no fun a majority of the time. Now, there is a report system, which in theory, is supposed to shoo away the vermin that don't need to be playing this in the first place. In practice, it's horribly broken, due to being automated. Doing amazingly good, but you're the odd man out in a Peruvian 4 stack that you've somehow managed to offend? Expect to have the low priority message pop up when you exit to the menu after the match. Or maybe you want to report that 0/25 Treant that refused to do his job, and started purposely dying to feed the enemy. The entire server could report him, but he could still easily slip through without getting lp. In all seriousness, it's down to luck if it does work when you want it to, and doesn't when it's being abused. Up next, hero balance. Thankfully, this isn't quite as bad as it could be, but there is still silliness here and there. Some heroes have one or two overpowered abilites, while others are all around unbalanced, and others still are in sore need of buffing. At the same time, some heroes are nicely balanced, but are easily outclassed by other heroes who can perform the same role, only much better and easier. Why pick Legion Commander and eventually outdamage the enemy team using skill, when you can pick Ursa and outdamage them from level 3 onwards and rarely have to press more than one button? Why pick Weaver and alternate between your 2 escapes when you can pick Storm Spirit and have an escape with no cooldown? Why pick Centaur Warrunner to be durable when you can pick Axe and not only be durable, but be so durable the lane gets locked down for your enemy? There's tons of examples like this. Also, you'll see some heroes almost every match, {Pudge, Sniper, Zeus, who all have skills that can be more or less mindlessly spammed/have low risk high reward playstyles.} but lots are seen either rarely, or rarely outside of comp play {Io, Meepo, Dark Seer, who all take some degree of skill/have high risk decent reward playstyles}. What it sadly boils down to is, why play a hero where you have more than 1 button to press and risk being overwhelmed but have a more rewarding experience, when you can pick a hero that more or less does the same thing, but with less complexity? As with TF2, Valve is slowly but surely turning this into another hat simulator. I played a ton of the original Dota, and I sure don't remember any customization, because that would have been silly. This game is hard enough without being distracted by someones super pimped out loadout, or worrying if you're going to get a nice drop {if any, only 2-3 people usually get drops at the end of the round}. The main problem with character customization though, is that much like TF2, it attracts half wits that only want to play the super easy classes and dress them up, then look down on everyone else who isn't wearing a 20c wolf hat. Yeah, take your little wolf hat into a ranked match. See how they like it. Also like TF2, Valve focuses more on cosmetic items than the game itself, which started off small, but in recent months has led to them: 1. Canceling popular gamemodes, in order to {in thier own words} 'focus more on cosmetic sets'. 2. Building entire gamemodes around expensive sets {although in fairness, said sets only enhanced the modes/tracked stats for them, but still...}, or just flatout making new modes pay to win {the Year Beast Brawl was p2w to the point that disgusting amounts of money trumped good old fashioned skill almost 100% of the time}. 3. Doing inane things like changing the perfectly fine models of heroes, and then using that as an excuse to make more money {Shadow Fiend's model was just fine, but then he got a redesign that looked like an angsty 12 year old made it, and a $35 cosmetic that looked like an even more angsty 10 year old designed it}. 4. Possibly the worst, outright ignoring critical server issues {as in, thousands of people having issues even launching the game critical} to focus on cosmetic item bugs. Overall, the game would be greatly improved if Valve would do the following things: 1. Mandatory region locking for everyone, keeping Americans in America, Russians in Russia etc etc, thus heavily cutting down on the amount of people not knowing a regions language. 2. A proper tutorial for new players. 3. Making the above tutorial mandatory, as well as making only solo bot matches possible until a certain player level is reached. 4. Heavy improvement on the report system, to prevent the constant abuse of it, and to make sure it works when it legitimately needs to be used. 5. Rather than adding new costumes every other week, finally adding the other heroes from the mod, along with some much needed balancing for all the heroes. As fun as this game is, I reccomend it to no one, other than someone willing to go through absolute misery to occasionally have fun.

review: NOTE : If you played DOTA 2 long enough then you must already know what im talking about. Great Game and require a lot of experience and knowledge to master. The strongest point about DOTA 2 is the teamwork witch is also the weak point at the same time. The matchmaking system is broken, In 9 out of 10 games you'll find yourself playing with zero communication between teammates and doesn't matter what language preference you choose, you will always end up playing with players that doesn't speak English except words like : "NOOB", "F**** You", "Mid Or Feed"... Also while playing in solo queue, you will find yourself frequently playing against 4,5 man party. This will defensively will make the game balanced as you can see :) The game is totally invaded by kids and noobs and there is no support from valve.

review: Well, I liked this game.... a long time ago, when you could play a normal game here and there. Nowadays, the only people you meet are russians, mexicans and other things that can hardly be described as human, as they do not seem posess human-like inteligence. The best part is. They do play on european servers/(mexicans tend to invade US), and wish to teach you their holy language, in which every sentence seems to beginn with " blyat"(dunno about the mexicans though, they might as well speak burrito). If you have low blood pressure and like the company of mentally chalaged people without the paper that would confirm this, feel free to download this game. Oh, almost forgot to mention, that each new patch uses to add new bugs and overpowered heroes get even more powerful over time. Bless lord Gaben and his minions for bringing us this gem. HL3 confirmed...

review: League of fLamers served no less as mere training for Dota 2, which holds in my opinion the state of Best MOBA/ARTS/ASSS (Call it however you want) around. No need to pay for heroes or power-ups. No need to grind levels to be able to jungle. No need to pay for cosmetics, I can earn them while playing. And I can learn Russian free of charge. The essence and magic of DotA combined with the powerful Source engine and wrapped up in an user-friendly package with Valve quality finition. Icing on the cake ? The only MobA around playable offline. And bots aren't exactly dummies.

review: Kinda sure that I don't have to introduce this game.... So, simply said, this game is BRILLIANT! Even a statisctics are proving it, Dota 2 is most played game every day on Steam... So if you like MOBA games, you're sick of LOL, HotS is too much simple and Smite is too new and different, then just download it and you'll see it by yourself.

review: O Ato de "feedar"  muito chato. O Sujeito, aquele que "feeda", transmite ondas ruim a tudo e a todos que dividem o chamado Time Radiant ou Time Dire. Ondas as quais, somente jogadores de Dota 2 / Moba / Multiplayer / Qualquer.fezes.q.envolva.outra.pessoa.alm.de.tu sabem explicar. Ao pblico, basta aprender o real significado do verbo "Feedar" e assim entender o que  ser, o que esto em questo, at ento. Miau,  isso ai!

If your answer to any of these question is "yes" do drugs but please dont dowload this game, it will consume you. You will dream with Dota, you will feel Dota and you will be Dota.

review: If i were stuck on a deserted island with internet access a computer, compfy chair and no money i wouldnt be bothered because i would have DOTA 2. This game bieng free is a must have for every person ever. DOTA 2 makes you feel things like the greatest joy but also the most painful form of agony. Each game can be either the best or worst 30-90 minutes of your life. I couldnt not buy the compendium and a few sets for no other reason than an inflated ego. The community is a mixmatch between people you would curse with all the bad luck and people you will like more than your grandmother. 11/10 best game EU and everywhere else. YOUR LIFE IS NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT DOTA 2 (join the guild Ninja Sex Party unless you suck)

review: A really fun and strategic game. Unlike any other moba games, this game is free- and not pay to win. You can choose any hero from the hero pool, which is around 100ish if I am not mistaken. This allow for more variety. There are many hero. Some are complex while some are beginner friendly. For example, I find Abaddon quite easy but effective to use, mainly because of its ultimate that acts like a heal shield. However I only have played this game for a really short time(14 hours) and I have yet to try all of the heroes. Among that I have tried is: Abbaddon, Sven, Dazzle, Slark and Venomancer. There are many types of heroes in the game. Carry, Nuker,disabler,iniator and many more. I like the variety this game offer- and also the factor of fun. Dota 2 also requires teamwork and patience, by only attacking the enemy tower without strategy is almost considered as suicide. There are also lane, which is divided to: Middle,Upper and bottom. Usually heroes are tasked to go to certain lane- to farm for gold and get items which are really game changing, especially if you use a carry. There are also a ancient which need to be destroyed to win the game. Also most payed items is merely cosmetic only. They make you heroes look cooler but doesn't give any advantage. There are also other cosmetic items such as Courier, Hud,ticket and keys that doesn't give any ingame advantages and merely cosmetic. Although the Dota 2 has some weakness, Dota 2 has given me a fun and epic experience. I will continue to play Dota 2 and hopefully this game will keep improving. Verdict: 9.5/10

At first it was to beat my friend in our number or wins race, but yesterday I spent over twelve hours straight just playing offline bots matches. If i could figure out why I love this game so much I would better understand myself as a person, but it seems as if it was not meant to be since I now have a couple of hours invested in this game and nothing has been revealed. In any case I will keep playing, I will keep seaching, in the hopes that one day my review can explain to my family why I never leave my computer.

review: This Coming from a League of Legends player : Pros : - Punishing Gameplay (can be consider con but it's more challanging this way) - Denying creeps - Couriers - You can stack jungle creeps - Bigger map means more fog of war (which mean you can juke more) - Teleportation scrolls - Aegis Of immortal - All Heroes are free - No Runes and Masteries - You can see what the enemies is picking, which mean you can counter them (can be con, because enemies will try to counterpicked you too) - Is more customizable with many cosmestics such as Hud, loading screens, announcer, etc - Have items drops - The invoker Cons : - You'll lose money when you die - No Recall, which means you have to walk back or buy a town portal scrolls - No jungle buffs like blue or red (can be pros) - Is easier to make mistakes here and harder to come back - No surrender vote (can be pros when you wreck your enemy and vice versa) - Most heroes' mana pool is fairly low and have a skill that cost high mana - No summoner's spells - Item doesn't boost your skill's damage (can be pros) League Of Legends and Dota 2 are both great games and are my favorite game of all time, with both are highly competitive and required a strong teamwork. Both game are free, so you can play as much as you like, so have fun and don't forget. SPIN 2 WIN

review: Heres the thing that makes life so interesting. The theory of evolution claims that only the strong shall survive. Maybe so...maybe so...But the theory of competition says just because their the strong doesn't mean they cant get their 's kicked. Thats right. See what every long shot, come from behind underdog will tell you is this. The other guy may in fact be the favorite, the odds maybe stacked against you, fair enough. But what the odds don't know is this isn't a math test. This is a completely different kind of test. One where PASSION has a funny way of trumping logic. So before you step up to the starting line, before the whistle blows, and the clock starts ticking. Just remember out here the results don't always add up. No matter what the stats may say, and the experts may think, and the commentators may have predicted, when the race is on all bets are off. Don't be surprised if someone decides to flip the script and take a pass on yelling uncle. And then suddenly as the old saying goes, WE GOT OURSELVES A GAME!

review: Dota 2 is a brilliant game; it takes teamwork and takes it to a whole new level. In Dota 2, you fight in 5 v 5 matches and if you don't play a part in your team, you will lose! There are many characters (a bit too many for my taste) and many customizable features. But these customizable features are like the hats in TF2; they don't do anything but they look cool. Speaking of TF2, the 'Sniper' character also makes various references to the Sniper class in TF2. If you like League of Legends or RTS games then this is for you. If you are COD fanboy who cannot play different games without declaring that they are '' then go and play some Starcraft 2 you trogladite. 8/10

review: just one more game.... I know this is the 5th time I said it! I don't really believe it anyway either! This is easily one of the best Free-to-Play games. It is NOT free-to-win or anything like that. Nothing you buy has ANY effect on the gameplay. You are essentially paying just to play dress-up with your characters (and you get those items for free through playing anyway!) It is a HUGE game, and you WILL SUCK HORRIBLY at first. Choose a fairly simple hero (probably a support first) and learn how they work before you switch heroes. WATCH THE PROS! There are some free games and tournaments to watch and learn how the game is played and they are actually FUN TO WATCH. The community is probably 40-60 between welcoming players and A$$holes. Make friends with the good ones and keep playing with them, or better yet play with some of your REAL friends and suck horribly together! After about 300-1000 hours of playing, you might only suck a bit, though you'll probably still suck pretty bad. By that point there's no turning back -- you will be a DOTA2 player for life! and it will be GLORIOUS! The only people I would NOT reccommend this to are: people with limited time (games average 25-45 mins and can go past an hour) people who get frustrated easily or let the griefers get to them (thin skin will do you in!) people who can't communicate or like to do things their own way -- this is THE TEAM GAME. Listen to your team to win, or listen to your team  you out.

review: Dota 2 is a sequel to the Defense of the Ancients (DotA) Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne mod., Developed by Valve Corporation, Designed by none other than IceFrog and distributed by Steam. I was a DotA player previously and shifted to DOTA 2 just before the The International Dota 2 Chamionship 2012, after I got beta invite from Steam. DotA players will love Dota 2 because of IceFrog and his concept and designs and its very similar to DotA but with added attractions and customization. If you have played DotA in your past you can very well know what the game is all about, but if you haven't, don't worry, DOTA 2 has got your back. You get training and how to play and all you need to know In-Game. Its a free to play game, but I think its about time to change that and make people buy this game just because its worth buying. So, what are you thinking? Just download the game and start playing. Make friends and teams online or ask your friends to join alongside yourself. Just Remmeber : Every player you come across in game is there to have fun and enjoy the game like yourself. So, please keep the gaming spirit alive and don't forget to enjoy and have fun. Hope you guys like my review and start playing this game soon. See you all in game.

review: This game has brought me some of everything over the past years, happyness, Joy, and tears. But most important of all a russian vocabulary. becasue of russians i cry myself to sleep every night, why must u pick a void and phantom assasain and then lane together. In russia heros have no roles. they go where they please, do what they want. But i along with the other african americans i nthe community (jamal and ray'shawn) i will not stand for russians. Obama wont step up, and whtie folk sure as hell wont step up so i now take matter into my own hands. How u may ask do i do this? simple, if u see a russian report if u smell a russian report, report them before they have time to say 1 word because that is the limit to there vocabulary,  such a small beutifull word, some may think it as a compliment, others as a insult but both are wrong.  has much more meaning than the word .  is a lifestyle. IF u dont live by  then u dont deserve to live according to russians. now it is up tous the fellow black men of the community to step the u p and put our big boy pants on for all thsoe reading this know u are not alone there are otehrs like u wanting to end  to end russia and i have created a a group to end it. we wil lgo by 1 word the 1 word that means so much more the .  cannot fight this word for it is  and  is it. This word has to much power to be destroyed and it is up to us to use it. AKYC. AKYC.AKYC. AKYC mutha fukas AKYC

review: Best way to become (and meet) a heartless and cruel individual who enjoys inflicting suffering upon others, specially if they are less skilled and experienced. In addition murdering innocent by-standers as well as trees seems to be the trend, while flaming teammates or opponents is another popular culture in the game. But at the end of it all this game is all about channeling your innner hatred and getting all your frustration out on those who dares to press the "Find Match" button in around the same time as you. All in all excellent gaming experience and obviously the best use of your time.

review: I never liked games like league of legends or smite, but Dota 2 is a whole new story. It is absolutely a great and addictive game to play. The character selection is massive compare to LOL. It is more complicated than League of Legends, so it will take more time learning the game. Some differences between the two games are: 1) couriers that bring you items instead of walking to base to get it 2) you have to buy Town scrolls to teleport back to base. 3) you can "deny" creeps. ( killing your own creeps so your opponent gets less gold and exp) 4) if you die, you lose gold and is harder to comeback from 5) in game voice chat 6) "pause" key to halt the game if you need something. ( anybody can unpause regardless of who paused it) Based off my experience in this game, i haven't encounter much "ragers". I get the occasional one here and there, but not as often as League of legends. Update: Ever since i started doing ranked matches, there have been more "ragers" and non-english speakers. It was frustrating at times, but I got over it. If you don't like the bad side of this game's community, i suggest getting friends to queue up with you. Don't have friends that play dota? Make new friends during your games. You'd be surprise at how nice some people are in games. Don't worry too much about the Haters. Let them hate, while you enjoy a good time playing dota. Online games will always have some haters, especially games that involves a lot of teamwork. Based off my experience in this game, i haven't encounter much "ragers". I get the occasional one here and there, but not as often as League of legends.

review: I've spent 435 hours in this game at the time of this review. That equates to roughly 18 days, or just over half a month. It is far and away my most played game on Steam (my next most played game is TF2 with 150-some hours), which doesn't even compare. This game is hard. Possibly the most complicated thing I've ever done in these 18 days is walking in front of NPC units as they walk across the map and stopping periodically so that they have to stop to - thereby allowing me to attack the enemy's units at a safer area relative to my side of the map. This game is more than just a game I play - I can also watch games from within the client, both from my friends and from professional DotA 2 teams. The International, a Valve-created tournament held in Seattle, will this year have a prizepool of over TEN MILLION dollars (mostly funded by the community). The hats and other accessories in this game are also spectacular - I sometimes wonder whether I'm playing a game where I viciously kill different creatures on a battlefield, or one where I play dress-up with oddly disfigured digital dolls. Although if you don't want to spend your days getting flamed you should probably pick up this game at the same time as four other friends. tl;dr - Community (at least in the metagame) is good. Valve is good. Game is great. Play with friends.

review: You want to make friends and have no real means to do so? Well look no more!Dota 2 is the latest social platform specialized in connecting you with others(mainly russians).No matter where you're from or on which server you play EU-West,East,Asia,US you will have the opportunity to make friends. The players and the community in general are extremely friendly and they will make you feel loved and appreciated. If you are a new player and do not play to the best of your ability, your team will always try to help you and encourage you do do better.They will use certain words to motivate you and let you know your well being means a lot to them. Honestly, I have almost 1000 hours in Dota 2 and I've spent at least 950 of them chatting with people.I even quit mIRC since Dota 2 was released.If you purchsed the compendium you have some visual emotes which the IRC didn't have.You don't have to use the plain, boring :) to show them you are smiling, you can use FACES THAT EXPRESS EMOTIONS INSIDE THE GAME.Talk about next-gen. Best social interaction platform ever since MSN messenger!Highly recommended!

Even If you choose English and a US server 9 times out of 10 your teamates will be speaking Spanish, Portuguese, or even Russian! So if you don't need to communicate with your teamates in a game then dota 2 is for you. REGION LOCK DOTA 2 VOLVO.

Great works like "" and "Courier Noob" among others taught. This is the kind of edutainment games I can get behind. Thanks, Valve. I hear the Spanish/Peruvian expansion pack is in the works.

review: Dota 2 is a game with insane replayability there are only a few game with such level of replayability, the matchmaking system is fine(even if ur matched with noobs ur supposed to make them win the game). the balance is fine even if it have flaws sometimes,most of the heroes have different gameplay and some of the have very fun abilities like hook,pounce,lighting ball.the art style of the game is good and the hero design is pretty good aswell, the graphics too. the game itself is just very fun and replayable but there are some flaws like server downtimes,your favorite hero getting nerfed to oblvion,@ssholes and crashes even tho they're super super rare and they're even rarer ingame tho the real main feature of dota 2 is that it makes you rage at your friends!!!! lis  .

review: can be lots of fun... or as equally frustrating. lots of time to play this game, as it builds over the length of time you invest into it. it all depends on how good your team plays together and how bad the other team does the same. no matter how good you are or your team... there could be just the perfect group of characters and teamwork on the other team and they just stomp you. or other maps where your whole team randoms their characters... and you win without really trying. argh. but i am still drawn towards this game like a moth to the flame. much to the moth's demise. and mine.

review: My friends tell me Dota 2 is hard to play just judging from watching me or other people play and yet they're playing WC3 Dota. After some time they decided to try it and to their surprise it was not as hard as they first thought. So, try playing Dota 2 instead of just watching other people play. Good luck and have fun!

game-hours: 20.4
review: It's a great game. I highly recommend it because of the amount of variety. It gives you over 50.. no.. over 100 combinations of characters and items to use in battle. In Dota 2 you rely both on strategy and strength, and in some cases, even teamwork. But there are some few drawbacks, for example, there's only 1 map and finding an online game in some regions takes several minutes. ( Or at least, that is my case ). But still, the design of characters, effects and models, compared to the ones from Dota 1, are fascinating. I really like the new heroes' look. Plus, it's not like you really have to pay for useful weapons and items. You can buy things in-game, in map shops to strengthen your hero, and even your team. I really give this game a HIGH ranking!

I like the Dragon Knight the best though to be honest. however, I do not feel like just sitting here on my computer for hours trying to defeat someone or the computer. They had that dota 2 international championship for 3 days for a reason people. I also rage quit. No I was just getting angry at how long the battle was taking and how annoying it was to keep on dying with the healing potion or tree healer items just healed me for a little bit like maybe just 5 hp at a time. It was still a good game to play.

This game requires you to have alot of patience and determination. Yes there is customization in this games and yes you have to buy the items. But u also get items each time when level( this is a for sure getting) and u also might get an item by chance after each game. U can also sell the items u get. In total this game is spectacular.

review: Dota2 is something more than a game. It is a test. But that let my comment put you off. What lays under this very intricate, complex game is and experience you won't get anywhere else. It raises the bar on teamwork in multiplayer games. Because without teamwork you'll surely fail. And that is something a lot of multiplayer games try and fail with the self appointed hero player trying to show off. Each member, including the NPC are important. The controls, the interface will be daunting and put most people off, like me for instance. Because the game itself is 'INSTENSE' from the get go! But once you get use to the heroes you can play as, the lingo and system, that instensity that put you off, will drive you. Dota2 is more than just a game, it's a sport. And with all sports, you can make a great hobby out of it. You can have great fun. Or you can go pro. Oh! And it's FREE!!! Give it a go and don't be put off.

review: I avoided MOBAs for so long, you know. I really did. Barring a short and entirely disagreeable experience with the original Defense of the Ancients map for Warcraft 3, and a brief stint playing Demigod (which I thoroughly enjoyed, all the while failing to notice it pretty much was Defense of the Ancients) I hadnt touched this genre at all. Heroes of Newerth? Nope. League of Legends? Nah. Dota 2? Good grief, no. There were plenty of reasons for this. First, my initial experience with Warcraft 3s Dota map really was that bad. Second, MOBA communities have a rather strong reputation for being full of complete cockhandles, and I dont deal well with destructive criticism. Third, Im not a huge fan of most pure multiplayer games; I tend to prefer playing solo where I can. It did not appear to be the game for me...

review: Dota 2 is a fantastic MOBA styled game. I have really built up my friends list while playing Dota 2. There are a few draw backs with the community sometimes being "not so welcoming." Also the language barrier is a big deal when playing with people out of your region. The game has a bit of a learnning curve, but once you are hooked, you can't log off.

review: Fantastic game. Much longer more intense games, better skill cap and actually requires teamwork and mana control. Oh and you don't get shitlords that scrap their way to 6 build because you actually lose gold if you are bad. Secondly, there aren't runes so everyone is equal at the start and you don't get shafted by picking the wrong runes or not owning some, Hereos are all free, items are cheaper and you can mix and match items from different sers as they go into slots and are cheaper. Finally you don't get summoner spells so people if they get caught, die. They don't flash away and you cant just run up and hit a tower without creeps due to backdoor protection, so rat dota takes skills.

review: I'm new to the moba genre. I once tried Heroes of Newerth, but my first match I got rediculed and ejected from the match for not knowing what was going on, haha. That was a few years ago. My friend recently got me to download League of Legends and give that a try with him. I've mostly been against the moba genre probably from my experience with HoN, but LoL was decent. I had fun. I decided to give Dota 2 a shot since it's a similar game but, in my opinion, better graphics and has Linux support so maybe I could get my brother to play it with me (he has now). I got to say, Dota 2 has sucked me in. The tutorial was very helpful for getting me to understand the genre as a whole better. I'm playing human vs human matches now and do decently well, sometimes being the carry for a team win. It feels to have a faster pace than LoL, which I like, and the learning curve while present, is not overwhelming. The heroes are very distinct and offer seemingly limitless playstyle opportunities.. I've been looking for a game to get "addicted" to for a long time, and although I never thought it would be a moba, Dota 2 has got me hooked. Update: Try to avoid mid-day play times. Lots of bad playing Russians on the U.S. servers during our day, and since they don't speak english, there's no communicating. They don't generally use in game forms of quick communicating either, such as pinging a location on a map. Also most seem to not grasp how to play a MOBA in general. Not sure why they don't stay on easy bot matches because they'll never help win a real match or higher difficulty bot match.

review: Been 10 Years! I feel like the play style and the heroes are the really enjoyable. Dota is never ending fixing balancing etc. However this is not a downside. As it is a growing game. Dota 2 is the best at his class. If you are a new player here is what you should know though; - Make sure you ignore flamers - Try to watch couple twitch streams in order to understand how pro's do it - Be polite in games, if someone is rude to you just ignore him - If you dont want to ignore make sure you do NOT respond them. Because talkin back to them in order to explain your thoughts will just make them insult you more. THEY WILL NOT UNDERSTAND %100 Guarenteed. If you mute everyone at start of the game you should have a wonderful experience! =)

If you are a fan of dota , you will be amaze by Dota2's features. But you need times to level up and item drops are a little something(maybe i'm greedy). However, this is a must-play.

review: An incredible amount of heroes and items combine to form some of the most versatile gameplay I've ever seen. The game is completely free-to-play, with cosmetics, which you'll receive randomly by simply playing, costing very little money. In fact, there are no pay-to-win features. The learning curve is pretty steep, so if you don't persevere through your first few hours, you might just write it off as boring or too hard.

All the matches seem like they're the same but they're not. It's a different game every match, with tactics and fun. 10/10. PS: There are Russians.

review: this game is similar to the super smash bros, but it diverges from that mold as it has a certain touch of sorrow and a solid connection with the concept of the human condition. These two factors truely make it a great game. Plus these as put in some flying- donkeys 9/10

review: First of all, there appears to be no need to ever buy this game. Someone with 10 copies of this will gift one to one of your friends, who will find his copy multiplied by 10, who can then give one to you. Now, should you actually play it? Sure - it's got unusuals and crates and all that jazz, so it's basically Team Fortress 2 for boring people. Be prepared for a steep learning curve, lots of abuse and a vocabulary full of words that will make your friends cringe. YOU GOT GANKED SON. Enjoy your 10 copies of this game.

review: I'm going to be very honest with you, I used to the hate Dota 2, I wanted to spilt it in half with my bair hands. But then I asked a friend recently, "I'm going to give this Dota 2 a try again, can you help me out" because I was getting really bored with the games I already played, over and over again. Then he taught me all the things that I didn't know about Dota 2. Back then before my friend helped me, I used to play as Draw Ranger or whatever her name is, and buy only a healing salve because I didn't know anything about the items. but then my friend started explaining what everything does, and to be honest, It started getting fun, I really enjoyed it. Dota 2 is one of those games where once you really know what you're doing, it gets fun. It has great Co-Op, muiltplayer, you can train with bots, there's basic training which I highly recommend doing, has competetive (ranked) matchs just like CS:GO, there's items that you can put on your Heroes to make them look cool. In conclustion, I highly recommend this game. Don't worry if you're sucking pretty hard at the start, trust me everyone does. But once you start learning the heroes, and pick your best hero, you start to get really good at it, and survive longer. Good luck finding local servers, there's lots of Russians out there playing this.

review: If youre looking for a reason to commit time to Dota 2  if youre actually reading this review for advice and a critical opinion, rather than to see what score Im going to give the most popular game on Steam  then, first up, thanks for being here. Second, I want you to consider what it means when two grown men accidentally lather each other in regenerative goop. Its gamings equivalent of holding a door open for somebody who is already reaching to hold the door open for you: a synchronicity of kindness that speaks to a deeper shared understanding of the situation both people are in. Dota is a game where you can say the words are you thinking what Im thinking? and be reliably assured that the person on the other end of your VoIP connection actually is. It might have the systems and bearing of a videogame, but Dota shares the social impetus of a sport. Its single environment isnt a map, its a pitch.

review: This game is not for people who have less than average control over keyboard and mouse. You would need prior experience with relatively complex games, strategic thinking and perseverence. The learning curve is steep and this game is very demanding for the new players, the community at large is unforgiving and brutal if you are making mistakes as the mistakes you make would affect everybody in your team causing your team to lose. You cannot quit mid-game and the game can go for a long time and the result may not be known till the very end. All this can easily put off many people, but those who pass this rite of passage would enjoy the same things that you hated as a newbie.

review: As the MOBA genre began to rise to the spotlight of the gaming community. I decided to give it a try. I first tried League of Legends, but was yelled at for being a noob and rage quitted. I thought this kind of behavior was counter-productive, because a gaming commmunity should be supportive of noobs....because even the gaming legends start as noobs as some point in their career. So I got frustrated, and didn't touch MOBA's for a while. However, I'm in deep love in Valve and everything they do, so when I heard about Dota, I got interested. When I completed the tutorial, and finally joined a game, everyone was helpful and willing to assist a noob to a very complicated and intricate genre. I still suck, as I play off a kind of beginner's intinct and not off of a knowledge of the game. However, Dota, with its compelling art style, helpful community, and a touch of Gaben, blew LoL out of the water for me.

review: Dota 2 is a masterpiece online Real Time Strategy MOBA game published by Valve. The official remake of the original Dota mod, Dota 2 brings over 100 original heroes from the original one. In DOTA 2, players are split into two teams (Radiant and Dire) in head to head PvP action, each consisting of up to five players. Players can choose participate in practice matches versus bots, engage in friendly matches with friends, or form a clan and compete against other teams. Dota 2 has almost all basics of the MOBA genre. Two teams of five players spawn on corners of a map, with several lanes connecting two bases. Two teams should cooperate with each other by the same goal of destroying opponents base which is named Ancient in Dota 2. Players should choose a hero to enter battle with. The AI creeps spawn every 30 second. Heroes will level up by kill enemys creeps and heroes. If players make the last hit of the enemy, they will get gold which players can then use to purchase items in main shop at home or secret shop. Each team has three powerful defensive towers on each lane. When you hero become more and more powerful, you can destroy all defensive towers and finally smash into other teams base to end the game easily.

review: I avoided MOBAs for so long, you know. I really did. Barring a short and entirely disagreeable experience with the original Defense of the Ancients map for Warcraft 3, and a brief stint playing Demigod (which I thoroughly enjoyed, all the while failing to notice it pretty much was Defense of the Ancients) I hadnt touched this genre at all. Heroes of Newerth? Nope. League of Legends? Nah. Dota 2? Good grief, no. There were plenty of reasons for this. First, my initial experience with Warcraft 3s Dota map really was that bad. Second, MOBA communities have a rather strong reputation for being full of complete cockhandles, and I dont deal well with destructive criticism. Third, Im not a huge fan of most pure multiplayer games; I tend to prefer playing solo where I can. It did not appear to be the game for me...

review: There are many reasons why Dota 2 is an excellent game. For starters, it is a free-to-play game where you may play friends, random, or bots online. There are so many items to use as you head into the game, and just as many custom armors and extensions for your hero(s). I recommend this game for it's excellent updates and imagination. I love this game. You will get hooked when you start playing.

review: Dota 2 is chess for people with a strategic and impatient disposition. It focuses on strategy, if you rush into it without proper thought and planning there is a very slim chance of success. But that does not make it slow paced, quite the opposite. Even if are mindlessly whacking away on some neutral creeps in the jungle you can feel the energy in the air. The only problem I have with it is the community. Entering you're first match is the quickest and most effective way of destroying your soul. The chat is almost always filled with the words "stupid noob" whenever you check it, and I'm not going to get in to the low-priority matches *makes gaging sound*. Apart from that, it is one of the best MOABS I have ever had the fortune to come across. Check Mate.

review: I highly recommend DotA 2, and for good reason. I've played a stupid amount of the game, to be honest, so I thought I might as well write about my opinions of it. Great Points: 1. Great replayability 2. Really fun with friends 3. Great joys when you pull off that amazing move 4. Really, really high skill ceiling 5. Over 105 heroes to play, most with a unique style of play accompanied with them 6. Huge amount of items to select from 7. The casual player has a spot in this, too, thanks to the new system! 8. Ranked Matchmaking vs. Non-Ranked matchmaking, and a punishment for abandoning Some down-points 1. The entry barrier: a. Its similar to a C b. Once you pass the bubble, its easy to get better, but passing the outer shell is the hard part. 2. Community a. A lot of the community is really annoying, mean, and sometimes downright cruel. I find that this is about 10-20% of the community, and I find one in every 3 games or so. b. These people usually try to play low-skill heroes and blame you for making mistakes even if the mistake is theirs, regardless of their status in the relationship. c. Sometimes language barriers make the game far less entertaining, with the majority of minority languages not being on the list for language preferences 3. The lopsided nature of the game a. Unless you find yourself being amazing, most games tip in the first five minutes and the team that tipped it either turns it around immediately or they lose, with only a few exceptions that lead to fantastic games. Now then, Ive gushed and ranted about the game enough, Ill go explain the basic concepts of Dota 2, if you plan to get in on the action but arent sure if it's worth your time yet. A. There are three lanes, considered either hardlane/offlane, mid, or safelane, and these differ where they are depending upon your faction. B. There are two factions in DotA  one is based in the upper right hand corner of the map, known as the Dire, and the other team is in the lower left hand corner of the map, known as the Radiant. C. After initial hero selection is finished, with one of the many gamemodes a. Random Draft (20 heroes, cycles between teams to pick heroes in groups of two/one at a time) b. All Pick (Everyone picks any hero they wish all at once) c. Captains Mode - A Captain selects heroes and bans heroes, taking turns with the opposing team) d. Captains Draft - 24 heroes, see Captains Mode for rest) e. All Random - Everyone gets a random hero, my personal favorite, especially for learning all the heroes all over again) f. Least Played - Every person picks from all the heroes, minus their 40 most played. Also good for learning, but not the best.) g. Limited Heroes  Everyone picks from a pool of heroes chosen by Valve which generally have a lower skill ceiling and are easier to play than regular heroes. Some people say this is best for learning, but I find that these heroes leave a bad impression of DotA, due to the cheap nature of some of the heroes. h. Single Draft  Everyone picks from three random heroes, one with an agility specialty, one with a strength specialty, and one with an intelligence specialty. i. Occasionally, special events happen from time to time during holidays, but those are ignored for the purpose of this review. D. After loading the game, you normally will either select a build you made yourself, or using the book icon in the top left hand corner of the screen, you can select a build someone else made that was reviewed by the community as either good or bad, and they can help eliminate the initial difficulty if youre new to this hero. E. Once the first minute or so is finished, creep waves begin to spawn. They consist of three melee creeps, and one ranged creep, which slowly increase in power throughout the game, until they hit a cap. Creeps run at normal speed in the hard-lane and the mid-lane, but faster in the safe-lane so that creeps end up towards the middle of the lane, as opposed to being lopsided. F. Towers defend major points in the waves, and award money for being killed. You can also earn money by being the person to get the last hit on creeps. G. Different people talk about different phases of the game, but essentially there are two different phases, with sub-phases in between, or inside. a. Laning Phase  A distribution of heroes goes to the different lanes to kill creeps, gain experience, and earn money. b. Team fight Phase  All the heroes go together to throw spells and attacks at each other. After that, its just a combination of a bunch of the events previously described  thats DotA in a nutshell. Now, why would you want to play a game that resets all your progress after you finish a match? Well, in my opinion, it means that nobody ever has a major advantage over another player, such as PvP in other online games with loot-driven systems. You can meet new people, make friends, and have a new experience every single game. With 106 heroes as of this patch, theres somewhere around 1.1e20s worth of possible matchups. Theres many roles to be played, and much fun to be had. Now, if Ive convinced you  Go play dota! And if I somehow didnt convince you, then go enjoy whatever game it is you play. And apologies for the formatting, steam review's lack of HTML formatting made it a little harder!

review: you should not expect to have fun your first day playing...but theres method to this madness. In short, Dota 2 is a deeply layered construct of systems, and to survive you need to understand every single one and how they interact with one another.Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. It's an achievement owed to uncompromising depth, a ridiculously generous free-to-play model, and the great features developer Valve has built up around it.

review: Started out playing DotA on the old WC3 engine and I played that for 7+ years before I shifted into Dota 2 with the beta. Dota 2 offers much more than the original WC3 version in terms of graphics and gameplay, as the old engine's hero and skill interactions were hampered by limitations (DotA Allstars was just a custom map). Cosmetics, tournaments, and streaming are all seamlessly integrated; and are constantly being improved at the behest of the community. The game is a bit hard to get into at first, but after you have the basics down, you'll play for an innumerable amount of time. Adding friends into the mix for crazy strategies and plays increases the replayability and enjoyment of the game to another level. One of the best games. EVER.

review: Everytime something is about to happen in real life, I always say to myself, GLHF (Good Luck, Have Fun). This game's community has helped me motivate myself in real life. If it wasn't for that acronym, I would be having more worries and stress over simple things. Two dota 2 games (not necessarily every day) a day is a good dosage of having fun and keeping up with your social life. I've been playing this game since it came out 2011 and that's where the 2000+hrs came. I won't say I didn't get hooked. I did, 'cause I had nothing to do in summers when I was still schooling, but now I'm a busy man and this is like where I vent my frustrations. 9/10. GL HF!

review: I've spent 435 hours in this game at the time of this review. That equates to roughly 18 days, or just over half a month. It is far and away my most played game on Steam (my next most played game is TF2 with 150-some hours), which doesn't even compare. This game is hard. Possibly the most complicated thing I've ever done in these 18 days is walking in front of NPC units as they walk across the map and stopping periodically so that they have to stop to - thereby allowing me to attack the enemy's units at a safer area relative to my side of the map. This game is more than just a game I play - I can also watch games from within the client, both from my friends and from professional DotA 2 teams. The International, a Valve-created tournament held in Seattle, will this year have a prizepool of over TEN MILLION dollars (mostly funded by the community). The hats and other accessories in this game are also spectacular - I sometimes wonder whether I'm playing a game where I viciously kill different creatures on a battlefield, or one where I play dress-up with oddly disfigured digital dolls. Although if you don't want to spend your days getting flamed you should probably pick up this game at the same time as four other friends. tl;dr - Community (at least in the metagame) is good. Valve is good. Game is great. Play with friends.

review: i totally recommend this game to anyone it is a great game and very addictive what i found was it was easy to learn and understand how to work the controls so any newcomer can play but also is very hard to keep you on the edge of your seat. i would change 2 things and many people will agree so if you are looking at this dota 2 makers ;) we would love for you to be able to let us zoom out so we can see more as it is a pain and really hard to keep eyes on your character without dying and also please make it so you can choose for the camera to follow your player so we dont have to do that but overall amazing game but they are the only cons. GREAT GAME

Intimidating in the beginning but you will quickly be calling everyone noobs and asking for everyone to report them for some random reason or another. Be prepared to beg for commendments to make you feel better at night, otherwise your flawless 1-27 run as Dark Seer will make you wish your parents never shacked up during that Greatful Dead concert.

review: Very simple and Very complicated at the same time. This game gives you opportunity to play special hero-character selected from huge list of heroes. Simple side of the game: - 2 opposite bases. To win you need to capture one. - 5 players Vs 5 players. Empty slot(s) to be played by GameBot. - Pick a hero, push Battle. Thats it. Complicated side of the game. - You need to know Hero you playing and how level him in details. - You need to have at least 1 nonBot friend playing with you to get Win or to resist at random games. - You need to know what duo of heroes is a good hero-combo and what duo is suck hero-combo. - You need to know when/where and what to buy. - You need to know how to read tha map, where to push, where to defend. How and when to do it right. - You need to know how to farm coins and exp fast to get advantage and buy things for yourself at later stage of round. You need to know all above for 100% to get good Win/Loose statictic. And yeah,,,be ready to read a lot of crap from "zombie" players, who lives in Dota 2 for years. For example, i've tryed to play normal match at my very first time and I've read a lot of new thigs abt myself. Even after passing through all training matches/tests and its your first Player vs Player match. Ignore all chat crap & Have fun!

review: I've just recently started playing Dota 2. My friends always said that it was addicting and I always thought otherwise. I mean, what can be so addicting about a game. I thought that killing and dying is never really that fun. Then I just kind of got bored and after 2 games I got hooked! I now understand how fun it is. Addicting even. The graphics are nice. The response of heroes are great. The skills are appropriate for each hero. I'm just glad that I opened up to Dota 2

review: Literally, a bad game. 2/10. 4 years since first released? Still beta, 2014. You selected english? Better learn 3 new languages. Team game? Farm it out. Updates? Only to release more hats. New heroes? Half-life 2 Ep 3. Metascore 90? Money, Cash. 18+? Children only. Free to play? Average IQ drops below 100. Gave first blood? Leave game. MMR? Clearly Balanced. Suggest legitimate opinion that would result in a win? Muted. Play better than most? Reported. Reported the person that fed on purpose? Have them on your team next game. Low Priority? For life. Only game to get legitimate reviews. You think the reviews are a joking? Play the game.

It's also really fustrating when you're the worst player of your team, oh the pressure they put on you is unfathomable. Really good game + it's free, so why not try it right? Ruined my life , so why not ruin yours ? Makes perfect sense !

review: This is a great game, the graphics are good, the sound atmospheric, the game play is clean and fun, and the heros are enjoyable and at some moments funny. However the game lacks in some area, some heros are far better then others when you play on a public server, i.e. (Sniper, Riki, and Bloodseeker) just to name a few, all these heros can be countered easily, but with an incompetant team they'll become gods on the battlefield, also the tutorial teaches bad habits i.e. (Only teaching you how to fight in the middle lane, poor hero selection, and no team building tutorial). Altogether this game is great, it is outstanding how open ended the battles can be, every game is different, and you're never left unsatisfied. I give this game a 9/10

review: If there is a F2P that I would encourage people to play pick up on steam, it would have to be Dota 2. The amount of time that you have to into this game is 100% worth. You might think that League of Legends would be a better option because it's easier to pick up and it's true. But, if you really want to be tested a MOBA game this would be it.

Something about the graphics is very visually appealing and unique. It's the best free to play game I've ever experienced. Though it may take dozens of hours to learn, players that grasp Dota 2s ideas will find a game thats almost endlessly enjoyable.Youll need knowledge, skill, and a smidge of spider-sense. Friends to learn with are a must, and dont be deceived by the lack of a pricetag: Dota 2 will cost you hundreds of hours.  Try it out now.., its free.. and badass!

review: This is a finely crafted game of a war between two sides, me vs everyone else. From the start of the game I am introduced to people from all around the world, who think that I am a "ing noob" and do not know another word of english beyond that. Even when playing with friends, they are immersed into the lore, and also call me a ing . The depth and immensity of the roleplaying experience is one for the ages. I would recommend this game to everyone who likes fantasy, roleplaying, action, and being yelled at in Russian.

review: Graphics: 10/10 Story: - Gameplay: 10/10 I dont know where to begin, I am near to 3k hours played, and intended to move on.. You must already saw how the game is played through videos or read it from somewhere, its MOBA. But, why 8 million people play same map, over and over, and never bored. Here comes the epic truth; yes, we play same map every game, but never played same game once in my life. The choices you made, the hero picks and item builds made it a whole different game. It also enables communication with different cultures, (very minor but it does) and improves your sense of team play. Its graphics are good and supported by poor graphic cards also. There is no story behind it, however there are character bio's in learn section of game. This game is highly recommended, but beware, once you are in, you are in. There is no exit! GL & HF

It's highly immersive gameplay and the small nuances every hero possess like the conversations that the heroes have once they interact with each other fills me with happiness and awe and I can't even begin to imagine the amount of effort that must have been put into Dota2 to make it what it is today. All in all, it is truly a brilliant game.

review: I warn you once. Start playing this game and you will get addicted. The synergy between smooth gameplay, competivity and the ability to costumize your hero's appearance is a dangerous swirl of digital pixels that keep you behind the screen of your computer. Every game is diffrent, and you need to adjust. Also, this game is great for beginners and proffesional players. Valve is adding multiple gamemodes as we speak, and keeps improving the balance, adding new heroes and so on. Don't forget to feed your cat. Dota will take over your life.

Other then that it serves as a wonderful way to learn several different languages, including Russian, russian, russian.. 10/10 recommend for everyone and their nan.

review: My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.

review: The game itself is something wonderful. I who have only started by playing Dota 2 and not any of the other forebears such as LoL, HoN or the original Dota, must say that i love this type of strategy game. The heroes are rather amazing to play with the vast variety and the dynamic gameplay is brilliant. Granted there are some problems with the amount of updates required that do screw up the gameplay at times, Dota 2 is by far one of the best games in my opinion.

review: Now i believe in love from the first sight!. This game blows your mind, it's really fun, competetive and a time spending solution. I really recommend such games, a jaw dropping MOBA to satisfy you. DOTA 2 is the god of MOBA, 100% Free: Everything is unlocked (Not like LoL) , you get drop and you can make money from it. I give it a 10/10 ^^ GET IT! :D

review: Dota 2 is a stragady game where you kill, earn money, and helps you think better. Dota 2 helps you on lots of things as well as thinking fast, ganking the right time, and doing a ability at the right time too.Dota will make you think faster and help you on your keyborad typeings like the abilitys, the moving camara, the mouse, and the speed and timeing of the abilitys. Dota 2 is a really competive game where you try to win with random people you might not know which is good so you can be with other people to do teamwork stuff. Trying dota will do lots of things to you so try it you might like it.

review: "When I first started DOTA2 I was a little overwhelmed, as my first ARTS/MOBA game it was pretty complicated. I soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying. Before I knew it, I was performing  and better. I stopped making silly  and  got vastly better at not  the enemy . For the  part, everyone I've met was very helpful and , there  the   however. As  - play DOTA2    ,  ,     .      !" Not my words, but still relevant. You tend to learn some Spanish and Russian due to the amount of people who speak those languages in the English queues. Good game, fast paced and intuitive, loads of fun. Valve makes sure that this game continues to grow within it's boundaries, by adding season-specific events and new cosmetics as often as possible.

One way is that I learned the new wonderful language of Russian, although the only word I know so far is , I'm sure it will help me get a job later in life. Just calling my would be boss a  in Russian would deffinatly increase my chances of getting said job.

review: Very balanced moba no doubt, very flexible with multiple mechanics. Community isnt 5 stars but could be much worse for my moba's experience, atleast low priority system works well. Easy and Hard Heros for all types of players, you will learn to all with time. Huge price Pools for serious tournaments, very competitive, each year we found out new tactics from the world top teams/ players. Adapt your item build to the situation (enemy and friendly teams) and to the time of the game, not a base build that everyone uses all the time in that hero. Try to abuse mechanics like force staff and BS ulti. "Skin" system is amazing because you can create custom sets and you can trade or itens with other players to avoid money wastes, but i recommend to go to trade life only if you know the market and how to deal with scammers. Overall if you this game is to much for you, go play LoL, simple as that plastic kid cup with a straw that cant use a f***ing glass, because they can "cut" then selfs with a "complex" glass. Riot you make me sick.

review: Dota 2 is not going to be for everyone due to the skill level needed as well as the tactics needed to play the game. People coming from League of Legends may have a hard time playing this game because of the different mechanics, so expect to do well just because your level 15 in LoL. This game is the original Dota in a more up to date form. Dota 2 is rising in the competitive arena as MLG is just taking it under its wing in the recent MLG Columbus Championship, as well as Dota 2 being played at Dreamhack Winter 2013 for the first time. If you want to play a competitive MOBA with a better community (imo) than LoL, then shoot for this game. It is the next step in terms of skills needed.

The continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. It's hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. It took me a long time to warm up to, but I'm helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. If you can spare the time - play it.

review: Dota 2 does many things right. With Free-2-play attitude, a vast selection of over 100 playable heroes and a massive fanbase, it's easy to see why Dota 2 is one of the fastest growing communities in gaming. However, not all is fine and dandy. The game punishes the slightest mistake with characters becoming unkillable and downright overpowered. Take for example Bloodseeker, if he gets even one kill he can dominate a game. New players are funneled into playing these easy or overpowered heroes making the game unenjoyable for the other players. While *t does happen, the game is still an enjoyable experience provided that the super-strong characters (that definently need a nerf) are kept under wraps by repeatedly killing them or the aren't selected in the game you're playing. I would recommend it just don't expect it to a breeze.

review: The learning curve is pretty steep. I'm pretty awful at this game, like lower than garbage. However, once you learn to ignore, the foul-mothed, often racist, and child-like flamers, good times are somewhat possible. I do actually enjoy this game though. Its probably stockholm syndrome or something now that I think about it.

review: First and foremost, this is a "Team" game, if you come in expecting to be the "star" maybe you should rethink your expectations about this game. One thing to take in account is that everyone has a role, and sometimes the ones that you less expect can be the most important ones. As an example, a game can be decided by who has the most map control, and in general support roles are the ones in charge of this. Supports play a very important, yet silent part in this game. Remember, it's a "Team" effort, if one fails, all the team fails. This game is awfully comptetitive, I would suggest you watch videos, and do research on all heroes before even starting a match. Know when to fight, when to flee, what role your heroe can take. Much of this game is learning what to do and when, after that, is practice, don;t expect to win them all. TL;DR version: This is a "TEAM" game, learn your spot on the team and stick together, awfully competitive experience yet very rewarding.

review: Involves a lot of muscle-usage from the right index and middle finger for some reason. And a lot of "A" and "S" keyboard pressing. Sometimes the occasional QWER. Also, sometimes the game requires a fluent Brazilian and/or Russian interpreter to get a full grasp of the game via communication. Ocasionally, people's ovens still catch on fire, forcing them to quit the game mid-way.

review: So damn addictive . It actually takes a lot of time to learn all the heroes and their gameplay , once you are done mastering a few heroes and start slaying your enimes , thats kinda the best feeling out there . Its a lot of fun to play the game along with a couple of buddies . Executing the wombo combos and walking all over your enemy , ah whats better to ask for , its got everything . The Ranked matchmaking is kinda dog  but you wil get used to it after gettin stompped a million times . Finally , i would like to say its one of the best games i have played so far and after playin the game for more than 2000 hrs , there is yet a lot more to learn . Thanks valve for making such an awesome game and spoiling gamers lives . :D peace .

review: To anyone actually bothering to read the review section for the most played game on Steam I would like to say this is a wonderful game with tons of replay and the possiblity to be both the best and worst game you have ever played. Now while the game is fun and (despite what many say) mostly balanced, as in any hero can be beaten through some means that aren't throwing you're entire team at them it also houses some of the worst interactions between players in any game period. Constant hate from anyone who has the ability (or lack there of) to type is common for many games when you commit even the slightest mistake in a game with a notorious learning curve. This will not stop you from playing if you can survive the horrible learning process as when you finally win a game after getting a double rampage you will never be able to stop regardless of how many slurs and racist comments are throw your way when you miss one stun. Overall this is a wonderful game provided you have the self confidence to survive your first few weeks but, remeber learn from the horrible comments you hear don't repeat them some may acutally have some good advice... emphasis on some.

review: Dota 2 is a great example on how to take a tired and true formula and update just enough of it to feel fresh while still retaining everything that made it fun,frustrating,choatic,absurd, and just insanely fun. I absoulutely recommend this game I havent stop playing since it's original iteration as a warcraft 3 frozen throne map mod to the juggernaut it has become. Without this game we would never have HoN, LoL, Infinite Crisis, and other Arts games that have come into existence. The game can be incredibly unforgiving, confusing and unbearingly difficult in the beggining, but patience and perserverance will pay off in huge dividends. Do yourself a favor and play because this is free to play Arts games done right!

review: Dota 2 is probly one of the games of all time but if your don't have a team this game can really be frustrating because you might need have a comeback but with pubes everone will just fight with each other or people will speak a different language and you can not work together. if you can deal with these probles you will find a very compex moba and fun game. (don,t play meepo)

An amazing game, and an amazing cure - all for the low, low price of $0, and possibly your sanity. Yes, that's right - you don't have to pay a single cent to play! So, what are you waiting for? Give this game a go, and change yourself today - both physiologically and psychologically.

review: I have tried Rosetta Stone, I have tried RocketLanguages, I have even tried Tell Me More, but all have been proven to be naught but a midsummer nightmare. None of those programs have helped my progression like Dota 2. Dota 2 has proven time and time again to have by far the most powder in it's shot when it comes to russian language proficiency. With it's massive array of russian tutors, who have taught me many useful words such as '' and 'xaxaxaxaxax', I can not comprehend how anyone would find anything better. I have a face now. 10/10 would gg ez again.

review: My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.

I who have only started by playing Dota 2 and not any of the other forebears such as LoL, HoN or the original Dota, must say that i love this type of strategy game. The heroes are rather amazing to play with the vast variety and the dynamic gameplay is brilliant. Granted there are some problems with the amount of updates required that do screw up the gameplay at times, Dota 2 is by far one of the best games in my opinion.

review: Such a strategic game filled with a lot of mysterious beauty from the four corners of the map, which indeed made it phenomenal and remarkable. You get to learn and experience a lot of things with friends and random strangers all over the continent you are situtuated, thus, enhancing your social development. The game requires a strategy to accomplish the goal and wise decision-makings for the welfare of your team which enhances your intellectual development and psychological development. The game could also possibly develop your emotional development as an axiom once said, "The more you get stronger, the more you get kinder." It only has one common goal and that is to destroy all defending towers of the opponents to possibly destroy their throne, but the beauty of it doesn't merely lie on accomplishing those, but also the clashes of your heroes in between small fights and the bond you had with the players that is. Its uniquely created and highly upgraded from its prerequisite, Defense of the Ancients (DotA) which made it a lot more catchy and addicting! From the doodads and props of the map, its terrains, its features, all of it is absolutely fascinating and intriguing! Makes you crave for more games every each other game. I just loved the game just as much as every DotA player do, so I made this review even though it's kinda nonsense just to test my knowledge of the game as well.

review: as the first moba i played and introduced me into the genre i have found since then other mobas (lol and hon) to pale in comparison in the difficulty level this is the hardest moba out there but is still very rewarding once you have mastered certain aspects of the game and does what many other game designers should be doing punish gamers for making the wrong decision you lose gold if you die and the enemy team might snowball and guess what that is your fualt but if you can blast through this punishing gameplay you can start the do the punishing yourself although i will say the community can be very bad and that there are some broken characters (e.g. huskar,templar assassin,spirit breaker and many more) and the russains are everywhere and they will not speak english unless they want something (vavle/ice frog please give the russains more servers or have a language lock) and since this game is unwinnable without teamplay and communication you should be able to speak to your teammates.

review: Dota 2 is one of my favourite games to date. Why? Im not sure. Is it the compelling nature to work as a team, the thrill of a victory of the satisfaction of a great gank? Either way, if my play time is to go by anything (And its only around a modest 200 hours) Dota 2 is an engaging and addictive game for anyone that likes teamwork and a tactical MOBA. The graphics are quite decent, the sound and character design are solid and the gameplay mechanics fluid. Best of all, its 100% free /w the addition of microtransactions to bling out your hero! However, it can be rage inducing when things arent going your way, which can be quite common. This usually takes form of players disconnecting or generally being a little stupid (Ie, running into pinch zones). But never fear, sometimes its all about getting the most enjoyable experience out of a loss you can get (That moment the most stupid death becomes the funniest thing youve seen all day!). To some, it might not be a comical death, and that is expected when (younger) players arent quite sure on whats happening, but they will soon learn (Hopefully). In addition, dota 2 is a free Russian speaking class... Overall, Dota 2 is a solid MOBA with great mechanics, a wonderful player base and glorious moments! 9/10 Would bang

review: So you decide you have no money and you come down to the Free2Play games and you see the game "DOTA 2". My first thought is where's "DOTA 1", but thats just me. Second thought being "why are 500k or more always on this game all the time" . So it must be the best game on the store, right? Well kinda, see it's one of the best F2P games but has some minor bugs in it. Alot of people play this game as I mentioned, meaning the servers sometime have lag due to overload. Also when you log into Dota 2 the volume in the music will jolt and lag to the point you cut the music off. By the way, League of Legends is for you if you hate learning complex controls and have no skill (sry), and Dota 2 is a very complex game that professionals make lots on winning matches and have high high skill. Don't get me wrong LoL has competitions but not the $ prize compared to Dota. When I play Dota 2 I fail to get above 5 kills in a 45min-1hr match, yes I'm a noob :/. My friend he gets over 30 kills on average cause he is epic at this game something I lack xD. (epicness) I DO like the game though but I'm not head-over-heels for it 8/10 (lag problems)

review: If you want to play Dota 2 you shouldn't learn how to play the game. You should instead learn how to speak russian. This will make the game a lot easier since 80% of the players only speak russian. This said i highly recommend Dota 2, it is addictive and satisfying and will enduce rage and possibly cost you your life. One last thing, always start the game with solo mid or feed this wil enduce respect among the russians population

review: Are you being tired of being good at any onlinegame you start playing? Are you feeling that after a few hours of playing you could join in a professional clan and take up against the world in that game? Are you looking for a challenge but you don't wanna play darksouls since its mostly singleplayer? Then dota 2 is just for you. Ask around your friends if they have a free key for this game. Every player gets over then dota 2- keys after playing for a certain time. Don't waste money on getting this if your friends inventories are flooded with free gamekeys with no additional value. If you're new to this moba genre, then get ready to open a can of whoop- I mean embarassment and shame. For the first 100 games you get to be a big noob who screws up your own teams strategies. At the start of the match you feel like your even with your teammates but in the endgame you're being blamed for failing your other teammates' possibilities to get better in this game a.k.a. rising up to the higher brackets matches. After them 100 matches you get to be just like the ones who blamed and reported you for playing bad. Soon you'll find yourself reporting every single gamer and writing long novels on the forums how "everyone in my teams sucks every time". The lesson, this game gives to you after all is, we are all the same. Bad gamers are only new to this game and good gamers have played every character over 20 times each. If you're interested in using good strategies and winning matches overpowered, you should be making a team with your friends and start playing together. Communication is the main key in dominating this game.

review: Well for starters, take a look at my total hours played. That should tell you how much I like this game. I honestly find the idea of a MOBA very appealing. Although there might be other games out there in the genre that (dare I say it) are better than DOTA 2, I still find DOTA 2 to be the one game I always go back too. The game mechanics are solid, the character balancing is always changing, adding new depths to the gameplay, and many of the players in DOTA are relatively laid back. Is DOTA 2 the best game in the world? Probably not. Is DOTA 2 the game I have spent 1000+ hours on and will probably spend another thousand on? Absolutely.

review: Really now who gives a  about other games when Dota 2 exists? There won't ever be a remotely as hardcore game as Dota 2. I don't understand why you people bother arguing or having discussions about any other game when there won't be a game as comparably good as Dota 2 for another 10-20 years. I'll put my credibility on the line here, and say that Dota 2 is the best game of all time. By "best game of all time", I refer to artistic and technical production, and gameplay design iteration (since Dota is arguably one of the most iterated upon computer game). From a technological rendering standpoint, it's visuals may not be king, but the art assets, overall art direction, and particle effects are the best that I have ever seen. The most excellently, tastefully produced art that I have ever seen in a game. The voice cast is the best I have ever heard, Dota 2 has Duke Nukem (Jon St. John), Cortana (Jen Taylor), Nathan Drake (Nolan North), the entire L4D cast, the entire Half-Life 2 cast, the entire Team Fortress 2 cast, and GlaDOS from Portal. Let's actually get down to the gameplay. No two games I have ever played have felt similar to the point of feeling rote. Each and every hero in Dota 2 is distinctly different from another, offering a uniquely encapsulated experience with well-defined goals for every single playable character in Dota. Because every hero feels so profoundly unique, every game that I play of Dota 2 feels fundamentally different in a way that League of Legends is not able to reproduce. I could go on, and on, but at this point I might as well just make a video essay. My only regret is that I never played Dota on Warcraft 3, because I wasn't really into gaming when I was younger. Now, I have some Dota 2 to play. Dota 2 is seriously a game I could play ad-inifnitum, and never get tired of. Why bother with any other game?

review: This game litterally ruined my life. I started playing dota awhile ago, thaught it was hard, but fun, so kept playing.... But now, Dota has taken everything away from me. Dota is my new life. I now don't get to go outside with my friends in the glorious sunlight. I no longer worry about grades at school. My dream is now to be Dendi. This game a has also brought out the dark side in me. Out of the over 800 hours i've been playing this game, at least 20% of me playing has been me screaming at my FREAKING TEAMATES BECAUSE ALL THEY DO IS FEED. This game has also made me extremely rasict to all non english speakers, especially: Peru, Brazil, every spanish speaking country, and Russia. Do I reccomend this game? HELL YEAH 100/10

review: I really want to review the game Gone Home but I don't own Gone Home. I own this. I have nothing to say about this. Gone Home is an incredibly misleading game. I went to that chick's house expecting to have to battle some 90's ghosts or like a serial killer living in this weirdly partitioned house. Instead I had to fight the most dangerous threat of all. Lesbians. I was not prepared to have the nightmare situations of your own daughter transforming into a lesbian under your roof and you being powerless to stop it. Truly a horrifying situation. After my third straight hour of pure terror hand delivered to me by the LBGT community I finally had to accept that this could happen to me as well. I too could be turned into a Lesbian as easily as this girl was. Lesbian ghosts can haunt and posses your family at any time. Thank you Gone Home for that new constant terror to be aware of. Also Dota is alright or whatever sometimes. I like BroodMother

review: this a game that i have play religiously for over 1600 hours, a game that i have litterally spent years playing. i have a love hae relationship with doto. if you can manage to get to a less toxic mmr lvl and play with competent team oriented players then you will abosolutely lover everything about it. everything is a learning experience and no matter how much you think you have mastered the game, you havent. it is definately worth your time aslong as you are willing to dedicate the rest of your life to it. its something it is hard to play casually and its hard to stop after one match.

review: At first, There is Warcraft 3: Frozen Throne released long time ago. The creator was Blizzard Entertainment, one day they got an idea to make simple-strategy-game-without-story-mode. They make a custom map called Defense of the Ancients, and then they rename it into DotA. The guy who created Dota is a legend, he was IceFrog, Blizzard Entertainment Video Game Designer and now he working for Valve and create Dota 2! And from there DOTA 2 WAS BORN! Dota 2 is a good MOBA game, the graphics was good and detailed, very different from Dota 1. They DO NOT copying it, some heroes Valve change the race, but the heroes is not different. BEST VALVE GAME!!! SECOND WAS TF2, AND THEN CS GO! I salute Valve for making this. Difference: Warlock: In Dota 1 he was an Orc, but now a human Storm Spirit: In Dota 1 he was a Panda, now a human or a spirit. And there are severals other heroes THE SPECIALITIES OF DOTA IS IT'S VERY FUN TO PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDSS!!! And then heroes are fun to play with. I RECOMMEND THIS FOR THOSE WHO PLAY DOTA 1 or STRATEGY GAMESS! But, I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS FOR THOSE WHO LIKE FPS AND TPS-LIKE GAMESS! 8.9/10 GOOD GAME VALVE!      Y

review: When you start playing Dota 2, you soon begin to realize that it's a black hole. The money in your steam wallet will slowly dwindle away, and you'll suddenly have 20 of the same item in your inventory and a receipt for hundreds of chests. Not even light can escape the black hole of Dota 2. Dota 2 is love, Dota 2 is life. 10/10 would recommend.

review: One of the best games in existance, but also one of the hardest. It isn't all about reaction timing or how many kills you get, but whether you can use your mind to outplay your opponent and kill the throne. If you persevere, you will get through the raging moments and be rewarded with a sense of accomplishment. But, there is always more to learn. The ability to work as a team is needed (obviously), but people underestimate what a team that supports eachother can really do. If you are up for the challenge then I strongly recommend this game. It isn't too much micro, depending on your hero, which there are 107 different ones to choose from.

review: Looking at the origins of this game and the fact that it's free, this is one of the most awesome games there is! Words are not enough to describe the true value of such a piece of art. Only bad side is what at least used to be in Left 4 Dead community as well: our Eastern neighbours. If they can't talk English, then their preferred language shouldn't be English! Am i right? Ooh, the echoes of agreement... They fill the air. Whatever the case, 5/5 purily, cause salami is strong in this one!

review: While it can take awhile to get the hang of this game, as it has a steep learning curve, it is extremely rewarding when it starts to click. It's a challenging game that is fun to play with friends. It's not always going to be sunshine and roses, but it will keep you playing due to the variety of heroes and people that you will meet. Also, what impresses me the most about this game is how balanced it is. There is absolutely no way for someone to purchase an item with real money that will gain them an advantage in the game. All of the items you can buy are purely cosmetic. And the heroes are all quite balanced, and can all be countered. Highly recommend this fun game! Don't be discouraged if it doesn't click right away, it'll get better. :)

review: It will consume your life entirely, setting you back at least one year, condition you to feel anger towards other cultures when you hear someone speaking a different language, and, cause you to spend a lot of money on making your heroes fancier. It won't let you have a relaxing game when you have down time, let you enjoy any other game ever again, nor let you feel good about yourself. You'll have dreams of going pro, you'll claim mmr doesn't matter, and then you'll realize you're a terrible 3k scrub.

review: Incredibly addicting. The gameplay itself is fun and engaging. It is played with a team of 5 characters with unique sets of skills and abilities versus another group. It is definitely a team effort to win the game. A single match would take about 40 to 60 minutes. Customization of some aspects of the game adds another spice to the in-game play. Characters costume sets, items, screensvers and skins and other DLC's which can be bought or traded at the Steam Market would keep the avid player own the characters. Over all the game is exciting and fun. I give it 10 out of 10.

Top with Bibb lettuce, sliced tomato, thick slices of leftover ham, a few dill pickle slices and sliced cheddar cheese. Spread whole-grain mustard on another slice of bread, then close the sandwich.

review: Dota 2 is a great game, at least for the FIRST COUPLE HOURS (yes in caps). The most terrible thing in this game is the community. They swear at you for no reason or for just some small mistakes that will not have a big effect on the entire match (i.e not denying a creep when playing a support. And that was only one creep). Or sometimes you get cussed by a person because of the person's own mistake (i.e A lvl 2 Faceless void rush to the enemy tower to chase an enemy hero with 40 HP left, and then the void dies while the chased doesn't. The void curse at Rubick, his/her laning partner for not giving a heal) it's like messed up. Or sometimes you can also find people being racist. I personally stop playing public matches for like 4 month and I only play againts bots (because they don't curse at you). In a month period (perhaps), maybe i'll just stop playing Dota. Unless some miracle or something unexpected happen. And the chance for those event to happen is like 0.01% I definitely don't recommend this game (I myself actually regret dowloading this)

review: 7/10 Dota 2. A bit over-rated, and extremely over-hyped during it's release. If you've never had the privilege of getting sucked into a MOBA game for an over-extended period of time. Take your chances with this free-to-play, Valve-owned, cash-cow giant. And if I may recommend the best MOBA...it's Heroes of Newerth.

review: Excellent game. A real free to play where no one has any advantages over another. The learning curve is steep as there are many heroes to choose from and knowledge of them is essential to perform well, but the in-game tutorial and matchmaking allows for a gradual progression based on your performance. The online resources are amazing: guides for build and strategy, stream of pro player almost every day on various website (joindota, twitch, etc.) and looking at them play helps improve your own gameplay. It's an intricate game full of detaisl which you discover game after game. It might be easier to learn the game with friends!

review: Approaching 2100 hours played...wow. While I do completely agree with the reviews that talk about how bad the community is, I have to say my experience of Dota on the whole has been very enjoyable. The mute option is great, I insta-mute anyone talking crap. Admittedly Dota has an incredibly high learning curve, and you will often find high level players playing on "noob" accounts so even the early matches for new players can be brutal. If you can push through the first couple of hundred hours of games ;) and ignore the torrent of expletives thrown your way when you let the team down!; you will find Dota 2 to be a: competitive, intense, challenging, and completely engaging experience.

review: After playing at least 50 games of Dota, grasping the basic mechanics and understanding the ablities of about 75% of the over 100 heroes I came to an stunning revelation. The one map isn't just a map, it's a playing field. Dota 2 is more of a sport then any other video game I've played. Each heroe is unique and has a unique playstyle with varying abilities. The graphics look great and the stylized champions each have their own unique lines and looks, some even talk to each other as you play. In Dota 2 each team of 5 starts on either the Radiant (bottom left) or Dire (top right) bases, each base has a giant structure called an ancient with the goal being to destroy the opposing teams ancient. The base splits off into three lanes that converge with their opposing counterparts. Each lane is guarded by three towers divided along the lane. Little units called creeps spawn at the bases and move along the lane to fight each other to the death. Between each lane is a jungle populated by neutral creeps. Killing creeps gives you gold and experience, experience is used to level up your character and gold is used to purchase items. The goal is to use a combination of your hero's abilities, the abilities of your teammates as well as your items to acheive victory. Now what turns a lot of people off from this game is that it has one of the hardest difficulty curves of any game I've played (save for dark souls). You will lose, a lot, when you first start playing. The valve tutorials help you grasp some of the basic concepts and playing vs bots can also help with that, but it's nothing compared to fighting other players on the field. My advice is to get out there and play some games, and if you get stuck there are tons of guides out there to help you find strategies to deal with some of the harded aspects of the game. Most importantly don't worry if you don't understand it at first, after a while the game clicks and it all makes sense. Find a group of friends to play and learn together. It may be intimidating but if you give it a chance Dota 2 is one of the most fulfilling and fun games I've ever played.

review: The most true "Free" to play game I know. As far as moba's are concerned none match Dota 2 in terms of how deep a game it is. The drawbacks however are it's terrible community and trust me, it only gets worse when you meet more experienced players. I'd even go as far to say it's worse than the xbox live community and thats saying something.

review: Since I am the master of Dota 2 and embody the very essence of a gaming god, I feel I am qualified, if not overly adequate to take up the position of rating a game as highly acclaimed as Dota 2, Defense of the Aliens 2. Although many gam3r nerds think that Dota 2 isn't the best game, that's just simply not true. I strongly disagree with the sentiments of these subpar gamers and I advise that you convert them to Dota 2 as quickly as possible. So, many of your friends might be playing tf2, cod of duty, battlefield, WoW, or some other weeaboo garbage, and they may be thinking that those are the best games the world has to offer. "LOL, WRONG!", you should exclaim with great, pompous disbelief. As your friends look at you, confused as to why you are making a scene in the middle of a chinese restaurant, you will know, oh yes you will know that Dota 2 is the best game in the world.

review: For those who have played a MOBA game, I recommend Dota 2. However its not fully perfect yet. Language wise it is a mess. Even if you pick English as your choice. You will get games with Russians, Brazilians, Mexicans, and etc from time to time and there is really nothing you can do about until it is fixed. Game play wise its a bit slower pace then Heroes of Newerth, but much faster then League of Legends and equally as competitive.

And some characters are all over powered and take no skill to use them. They give you no demonstration on attacks and it takes forever to use all the characters. I would say if you wanna play this go play League of Legends. I would rate that a 9/10. The people are more friendly and you use teamwork in it.

I dont understand why i cant use flash and why my support keeps taking my kill. I played as the courier hero and he didnt do any damage, I got so mad I got up from my computer, turned it off and then proceeded to drop out of school and quit my job as a tradie and go back to artschool to follow my dream of sucking so much  i wouldn't have to think of dota in my life ever again. 10/10

review: Dota 2 is many things to many people: it's a great way to kill an afternoon with friends; it's a spectator sport platform with its own item-betting scene; it's a hobby; it's a profession, and a way to make a living. It isn't perfect and likely never will be, as each update tends to fix bugs and introduce new ones, and the tutorial could certainly use some work. However, with zero cost to play and one of the highest skill ceilings of any game I've ever encountered, Dota 2 is a modern multiplayer masterpiece.

review: Trial by fire. Straight up. You're going to learn exceptions to the rule by being killed by them, and it's going to happen a lot. Dota is the most brutal learning curve of any game I've ever played. Sometimes in a well-done fashion, sometimes not. There are few games where I can honestly say that at 300 hours you have barely any true idea what you're doing. Amazingly complex game! Tons of fun, especially with friends. Not a casually oriented game at all, but enormously entertaining to play and watch. No grind, no microtransactions that affect gameplay in any way. No outside advantages, no premade skills. Everything happens in game and you need to be quick on your feet. Try it out! Just be warned that properly trying it out will take hundreds of hours. Relax, you're doing fine.

review: A long time ago somewhere in Dallas, Texas: A man by the name of Henk Holl had this idea about men wearing masks and beating the  out of each other and having even bigger men wrasslin' on top of these smaller men to see who could push down their towers first. Well Gabe Newell swooped in on his Gabearang and quickly crushed (both figuratively and literally) Henk's deep-rooted desire for a good ol' fashion woopin'. And three quarters of his spine. So what we're left with is a game called DOTA 2, which many believe started as the name of DONUT 2, as Gabe was hungry that day and wanted 2 extra donuts, but many misheard him and thought he said DOTA 2.

review: Dota is a great cooperation game that has the goal to destroy the opposing team's ancient to win. However it has many game modes that are fun to play. It may be the same map all the time but it never gets boring. This game also has many systems so new players can get used to it quite fast. However this game has disadvantages as well like bad lobbys because of communication shortages ( european guys who can't speak english, guys who are selfish and just care to win so they just don't care about communication or they may even play with friends in the lobby but they are using the Skype exuse all the time and they are so bored to press a single button so everyone in the team can communicate). Basically the only negative is that there is quite often communication problems among the teams and that some players do care about victory but just play one-man army style , picking their tank character and just do kills and show off.) One big advantage is that the game has no cheats in any lobby. It may have huge disadvantages but the correct lobby and the gameplay can cover the disadvantages often , so i would say that it is a very good game to play that can never get boring even if it's free.

review: "Dota 2" is the spiritual sequel to the Warcraft III custom map, Defense of the Ancients. I would describe it as a modern 5v5 version of chess that requires fast thinking and twitch reflexes. The game has a steep learning curve which may scare away casual players who are looking for a more "mainstream" experience (LoL) but the learning is part of the fun because it never stops, the are more than a hundred heroes to choose from and the experience evolves with every patch. The game is completely free to play but you may purchase cosmetic items for your favorite heroes from the Dota store or the community market.

review: The MOBA genre is slowly becoming vast and many not so good games are being published, but I assure you this is a great game. However if you are new to the game you must struggle because there are many people transitioning into MOBA's and you may be paired with people who disconnect, like to verbally harrass, but once you get pass level 10 the community slowly turns better. The community is similar to many other MOBA communities, meaning it can be very toxic at times (use the mute button). The game itself is very fun and entertaining especially with friends, grasping items, heros, and skills can be challenging but it is just a proccess of time. If you are patient and willing to play the game it will get funner and funner (till you try to climb ladder and paired with non english speakers). I would give this game a solid 9/10. I like the game so much I wasted 100+ dollars on chest, take it as a lesson don't buy chest, the only winner in that is lord gabe.

review: It's an amazing game - technically outstanding, showing all of Valve's usual polish and attention to detail, especially in the all-important multiplayer aspects. The continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. It's hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. It took me a long time to warm up to, but I'm helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. If you can spare the time - play it.

For short this game is 10/10.

review: This is my humble opinion on the game Dota 2, not something you have to agree or argue with! I am playing Dota 2 since 2012/13 and it's still an awesome game. Valve always brings fresh air in the game by patching new heroes and such. For me it's one of the best made games ever because of the big community it's influence on the developers (helping them to fix/add/change things), the gameplay and the teamworkmechanics. You can play how and with whom you want. It's a great game for young and old which always be there without getting boring. I want to list the pros and cons which may help making ones opinion about Dota 2. Pros: - always Patched (fixes/changes/heroes/items, etc.) - not monotonous (always room for creativity) - free (may be the biggest point) - teamplayorientated - large active community - fun (that's what a game is all about) Cons: - difficult to get pretty good/decent player - always glitches, bugs (doesn't affect gamingexperience though) - broken mmr system - high chance of getting addicted (i know what i am talking about :D)

review: Uh Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed Now to make it 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings. Nah great game, highly recomended

review: Best MOBA in my opinion. Although the game is not fully done yet, but it is alive due to great updates almost every day. The balance between heroes is very good, skill matters also. But the game vs real players, not bots, is very hard on my opinion and needs to be balanced, so professional players will not play with newbies. I recommend it to everyone, who like MOBA games and good graphics, friendly interface and cooperating.
game-hours: 2078.4
review: Great game! The learning curve is however very steep, and you will probably end up losing a lot of your first games (as you get flamed by your teammates). But as you get better, you'll quite enjoy it. By far the best MOBA experience you can have.

review: I find Dota 2 is a tale of 2 completely different stories. The gameplay is extremely fun, challenging and each game is fresh. However, the community, like almost all MOBAs, is can be terrible, especially for newer players. This is largely due to the fact that the Dota 2 community, as a whole, has an insatiable desire to win. This desire far outweighs common sense, and therefore temper tantrums can flare regularly. The solution? Play with friends. If one does not have friends, I find playing bot games can be fairly enjoyable, as a win is almost guaranteed. Both of these solutions are not perfect, but can allow new players a way to learn and enjoy the game a lot more. I would recommend this to gamers interested in a new type of challenge, and those with friends. You will likely find that you will sink a ton of hours into the game. +Polished gameplay +Blend of strategy and action +Each game is fresh and exciting +Fun with friends -Terrible teammates, trolls or otherwise (the struggle can be real)

review: The adventure from the WC3 DOTA 1 to Heroes of Newerth to DOTA 2 was an interesting trek. I stopped playing DOTA 1 around the time Batrider was added, stopped playing HoN when Midas was added, and am still playing DOTA 2 to this day. I recall in DOTA 1 when everyone used wc3banlist with auto refreshing slots and autobanning over 100ms players. People never warded, sentries were hardly used and everyone was pretty bad overall. It was a  load of fun however, particularily because so many people I knew were engrossed in DOTA and played nothing else. (Except CS 1.6) Techies remote mining Roshan, feeding your carries with gold (WC3 share gold feature), Phantom Assassin's evasion made her basically invisible minus her shadow... the list goes on. Heroes of Newerth was a title that I hadn't heard of until my friend mentioned it and I got to use his BETA account, shortly after it was launched for $20. Amazing, all the DOTA heroes and items, but with a few new additions every so often. The graphics were much better than DOTA 1 and everything sounded badass. (Portal Key sound is still engrained in my mind.) The problem was that it eventually went F2P with "freemium" features like paid heroes to compete with League of Legends and the DOTA 2 official "open beta" launch. Now we have DOTA 2. Crisp graphics, Valve supremacy, Gaben. Cosmetic only purchasables, very functional UI, solid framerates on any mid-range gaming PC, Valve supremacy, Gaben. I'm just listing the stuff I like. Mirana, smoothness of heroes turning (Suck it, League), Active Items (Suck it again, League), and Valve supremacy. Gaben. Gabe up writing this review because I'm at work and a bunch of customers are here.

review: Hello Guys! Just a short review of this game: There are literally 3 main facts to describe this game: it is amazing, exciting and supplies you with lot of fun! I never played a game that requires more skill, teamplay, and strategy at once than Dota 2. Playing Dota is accompanied by a non-stopable learning curve; that means you get better over the whole time. Bit by bit you gain experience, how to play your hero effectively, how to communicate with your team mates to defeat the enemies! And that it is! Teamwork is the main proceeding in that game! And for this reasons it makes such a big fun! In the average a battle is 45 minutes long. One battle demands your full attention, as well as concentration: Choose the right character, fight well and cooparate with your mates! Try it out, i totally recommend that amazing game!

review: The game is just brilliant, but the community is awful. For example im playing Ursa and 1 other guy Sniper, the other 3 guys are just standing in base and waiting for the game to end. And they are calling me noob because the enemy team is jumping on me 4vs1 so I can't defeat them all. And at the end of the game (we lost) these guys are calling gg and easy.. for nothing, they didn't do anything but to just feed and staying in base. I really like the game but the trollers/kids is making it really tough...

review: Dota 2 is incredibly fun, although it may not seem so when you're sitting through that awfully slow paced tutorial, and your first few games may seem overwhelming. Tough it out, it's worth it. Once you learn to play a hero or two and you know a couple items to go with those heroes, you'll do fine. Dota will show you that the only thing you were missing in your life is being screamed at by people in russian/porteguese despite you already make it clear that you only speak english. Pro Tip: No, playing on US servers does not solve this problem, apparently every russian/portuguese speaking person decided to play on US servers despite the awful ping and they don't know the mainstream language here.

review: DOTA 2 adds a great deal of complexity to the MOBA genre. Its balance tenet is: "Everything goes." There is no character that is underpowered; in fact, they're all overpowered in their own way. The game places a great burden of knowledge over whoever tries it out. Be sure to stick to Co-op games for starters. The tutorial may prepare you slightly, but the game as a whole is a lot more complex than other MOBAs on the market. Oh, and the saying "It ain't over till it's over" applies here. You can't be sure you're winning until the Radiant/Dire goes down. Lots of rooms for comebacks in here, but the game is far more snowbally than other MOBAs.

review: Dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably wont suit you if youre looking to play casually. Theres a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But once you start to learn its secrets, theres a wild and exciting variety of play here thats unmatched, even by its peers. Its a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that its completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isnt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. May the best team win.

review: This game will soon become extremely predictable. Let's say you have all the necessary components to make a team and then you have one rando on your team that hasn't picked yet. All you need is a support to make it complete, well guess what?! He is going to pick Pudge and win you the game. Don't worry jajajaja is a good sign. If you don't know what that means you will soon know. Good luck out there kid.

review: O Ato de "feedar"  muito chato. O Sujeito, aquele que "feeda", transmite ondas ruim a tudo e a todos que dividem o chamado Time Radiant ou Time Dire. Ondas as quais, somente jogadores de Dota 2 / Moba / Multiplayer / Qualquer.fezes.q.envolva.outra.pessoa.alm.de.tu sabem explicar. Ao pblico, basta aprender o real significado do verbo "Feedar" e assim entender o que  ser, o que esto em questo, at ento. Miau,  isso ai!

review: This is by far the best game to come from the original DoTA on Warcraft 3. I was disappointed by both LON and HON and after a hiatus of refusing to try anything else I saw this on the free games section and not expecting much installed it. First of all the graphics are wonderful, amazing considering the games free. The game play is almost identical that of DoTA on Warcraft 3 but everything is much smoother and not held back the game platform limition of the original DoTA. The online problems associated with the original game (people leaving etc) is much less as you are rewarded to stay and finish games, but allowed to leave if you have someone who rage quits. The best part in my opinion is how there are the same heroes that I grew to love and hate and learned to play with. There's a ton more to say but honestly in my opinion. This is how DoTA was meant to be and I need never search for another DoTA WC3 Alternative. I thank the developers for this game full heartedly and hope the best for their careers.

review: 1,587 hours on record for a reason. This game is more competitive and less childish than my previous game and train wreck of a dota-like accectable choice League of Legends. Yes the Dota 2 community is rough but that is how it has been since DotA on WC3. Harder than usual to walk into and get going at first because of the vast knowledge of the game but replays can easily fix that in a day. Overall great game and once again,  league of legends.

review: The game is great, except that the game rapidly snowballs into an unwinnable position if you get off to a bad start, and they brutally punish you if you leave before the game is over. Even if it's the 20 minute mark, your team has died 40 times, and your opponents are all untouched, you just have to pretend you're still playing until your opponents decide to end it. Which they'll often hesitate to do, opting instead to spend 30+ more minutes taunting and toying with you.

review: As you begin to play this game,you're given a tutorial on how the gameplay works. As you finish completing the tutorial you would have options to either play with bots or with online players. There is a wide variety of modes to choose from. All of the heroes are unlocked from the start so you don't have to unlock them one by one like any other MOBA game. Each heroes have their own specific roles so choose wisely and don't anyhow go whatever you feel like. There is no in-game money in this game and you earned different rewards as you play many matches. There is a lore for you to read for each character if you're interested. However these game have a steep leaning curve and those who are new to MOBA genre will struggle how the gameplay system work. It require a lot of tactics & teamwork in order to win a match........that is if your partner will listen to you cause a lot of player i found will quickly rage at you if you make a minor issue while some other just rage quit because they felt like they cannot make a comeback. A lot of heroes are memorable mainly because sometimes you would see those heroes interact with one another depending if they are rival or allied.

review: There is only one word that can describe this game: Amazing! DoTA is the ultimate MOBA experience offering a large variety of well balanced heroes, suitable for any kind of player. Every match has different teams that require different tactics to defeat. I like it how Valve isn't greedy, as every cosmetic item in the game can be obtained by simply playing it. Actually, the best items in the game can be obtained like this, considering that the shop offerst mostly Uncommon items, that are available for a limited period. The only thing I dislike about this game is that sometimes people take it too seriously and forget to enjoy it. If you liked this review then feel free to give me free stuff.

review: From an avid League player, it's a bit hard to get into and understand at first. But once you get your main role going and start to learn the hero's you can play it can get pretty fun. Until you meet Viper... /rage about one of his passives is a slow every auto attack Compared to League it has a lot less skill shots and more lock on's. However there is still a lot of skill to be had at this game, not runes or masteries, denying, and losing some gold upon death. Just make sure you don't spam your spells. Your mana pool is very low and mana regen is little to nothing early game. A very different game with not a lot to compare to, but they're both equally fun in their own way.

review: Looking to cut yourself off from the real world? Life getting too boring for you? Or are you just simply finding for a way to throw your dull life away? Look no further, this game is the game for you. This game promises you hours of fun on end. You fight in a team to claim victory over the enemy team's Ancient, hence the title "Defence of the Ancients". Some heroes are easily grasped, making it easy for beginners to learn the basics. Once you start getting the hang of things and master the basics, there are a hundred other heroes to learn and master. Personally, this game has ruined my life. With about 400 hours of gameplay, my grades have dropped, I have no time to hang out with friends anymore, my family hates me because I'm always in my room, you name it, I'm probably there right now. But I've never been happier in my life. Girlfriend? Sorry, I don't know what that is.

review: The most frustrating game of all time. This game will give you the feeling success, failure and regret. While at the same time, it will fuel the furious need to take another game, in hope that the teammates that you will play with, will have a higher intelligence quotient than the average programmed bots. In all, you will end up with doubt, begin to play as bad as the newbeginners, and end up in matchmaking unfairness. I recommend this game highly, if you have BDSM fetish or if you would like to play a multiplayer game in order to experience in-game injustice. And remember, no matter how bad a game was, always write a "gg wp", because it is really that great.

review: This was awsome! It seemed we were on a weaker balance but with nice tactics and good timing of pushing and defending we were able to take out the game. Players are somehow a bit too extravagant on using this sensitive word "Noob" when they believe the other player failed to comply of what he had wished. However, blaming comes naturally in a game for winning and losing. At least no other bad words came out. It was a good one generally. Cheers,

review: Dota 2 is a game that is made due to the amount of  flooding League of Legends. It is an autistic turn based game where the main goal is to run out of cards fastest. There are many "Champs" or as Dota 2 likes to call them "Heroes." Other than the fact that it is pay to win it is run on the Half-Life engine which is really amazing seems though the game developers were monkeys. There are some side quests you can do like stealing children and selling drugs my main "Hero" is a Ork Warrior I am lvl 69. Do i reccomend this game you may ask well it depends whether or not you want HIV/AIDS

Dota 2 is more difficult than LOL, LOL is for kids who want kill everything and destroy everything, but dota is more strategic and just it is more about how can you plan assaults, how you can farming...) Dota is about cooperate, but LOL is also about that, than why play dota? Play it if you want challenge and a lots of hour of fun. It's amyzing guys play it! :-)

review: The remake of a popular mod that Valve eventually bought.... like CS or TF2. But that doesn't matter. What matters is that it's a full game of that map that you loved to play on WC3. Better graphics, smoother gameplay, easier matchmaking and items that customize your hero appearance, potrait even spell animations(that actually require money but you can get it by playing). As for gameplay it's much smoother that WC3 and has gorgeos graphics because it runs on a modified source engine. Easier to play, even easier to pick up for new players. And you'll play with people of your skill level. Items are easier to build. Heroes are very well balanced. There is no hero that excells in every area. And no single match is the same. Every match different strategy different heroes and different enemies. Only downside that i really care about is the community. People does not know how to put their language preferences on their native language or the language that they actually speak. Every game you have that 1 or 2 guys that doesn't understand anything you say. Or a bunch of russians that'll rage over every single small mistake you make. SEA NA EUwest EUeast servers are all full of Russians. Russians are everywhere except for the Russian server. And while i'll admit that there are some good Russians who speak english and actually communicates with their team and not yell  BLYAT through their mic, but they're not that common. Overall good game, very well balanced. I give Dota 2 9/10. Recommended game but beware of the russians..........or pinoys.........or brazillians(or so i've heard).

review: Originally a Warcraft 3 mod, this highly influential arena style game has inspired many spin offs including the acclaimed League of Legends. Unlike League of Legends however, you can control all 112 heroes when you buy the game, and there is no "pay to win" features at all; all bonus items are purely cosmetic and for fun. The community can even create content that can be acquired in game! The only shortcoming to DotA is that it will be a little more difficult to pick up compared to League of Legends. Given the chance however, DotA2 will prove to be a much more balanced and skill-oriented experience, with meaningful item and ability selection and a more dynamic gold farming game which both provide superior short and long term strategic gameplay. Try the one that started it all, you won't be disappointed!

review: If you're not used to playing MOBA games this will be a difficult game to get into and if you try playing it you most likely will have no ing clue what you're doing. Dota 2 is by far the best MOBA game in my opinion and will always be a whole league above LoL and others. You can get bored of this game but trust me in time you will be back. 10/10 best time consumer out there, would waste time again.

It has frequent meaningful updates and it's the most balanced MOBA I've played, not to mention the graphics are good and it's engine is very tweak-able, meaning you're going to be able to play the game on older systems, it runs on Linux too.

review: Dota 2 is a masterpiece of competitive gaming. Endlessly replayable due to its incredible depth, the game truly never gets old. Continuous support ensures that the game never gets stale, with a constantly changing meta. Dota 2 has a steep learning curve, but once you find your way, there is no other game like it. Few games are as painful to lose, but inversely, as satisfying to win, as Dota 2. Unparalled strategic and mechanical depth ensure that no player will ever be as good as they can be in any one game, yet it is incredibly satisfying to strive for perfection through continued play. Strategy is deeply involved before you even "begin" the game, with hero selection, all the way through to the end of the match. Certain heroes work particularly well against others, are weak to others, and coordinate exceptionally with others. This is due to the array of unique abilities that each hero possesses, and the role they fill on their team. Once the game begins, players must coordinate with their team members in order to play most effectively. This is done in combat, as well as in what item purchases players decide to make. Strategy is extensively involved in item purchases, combat, and positioning. Players must constantly react to the game in order to play effectively, and since no game is ever the same, the experience is always different, making each game a fresh experience, and one that I will continue to enjoy for as long as I can foresee.

review: I've tried out every MOBA, but I always come back to this one. It is hard at first but usually if you stay away from matchmaking and stick with co-op bots people will generally help you. Once you start learning how to farm effectively and deny the game starts getting a lot more fun, but like most people say no matter what you do there will always be Russians in a few of your games. Sometimes they will be nice and friendly but usually I wind up muting them. Won't change my love for this game though.

review: Defense of the Ancients 2 - known more colloquially as DotA 2 - is a masterpiece of modern video game design. Harkening back to the age-old StarCraft 1 custom map Aeon of Strife, DotA 2 nearly perfects the elements introduce in that original mod. The mechanics and gameplay are ageless, simple in their implementation and flawless in their execution. Everything about Dota 2 is a triumph of engineering - the individual Heroes have fantastic character designs, both thematically and mechanically, and the game is perfectly balanced around its seemingly lack of scaling and at times stagnant nature. It is a game where Levels and Planning take precedent over Gold Advantage and Items, and teamwork is a union - a celebration, even - of independent player skill. This variety of complex mechanics, themes, and interactions that coalesce into a truly unique experience. I recall the time I forgot to Ward bot rune, and when mid lost Illusion to a Pudge from top lane, I was only blamed four times, as opposed to dozens in other, similar competing games. This unparalelled level of community benevolence and powerful inclination towards skillful play make DotA 2 the best game on the market, if not all of Human History. Four hundred years from now, when the Paragon Hyperscholars are uploading DigiEdu to the modbrains of the Neo Bourgeoisie, Dota 2 will forever be imbedded in the SiliconCortex as the zenith of PreHuman ingenuity. 0/10 it sucks

review: A very fun game with a ridiculously good f2p model. (Basically, you can get any item you want through random drops, or from trading with other players.) It is a very complicated game however, much harder than it's counterpart League of Legends. Pros -Many heroes -All heroes are unlocked at the start -Very precise balancing -A lot of different strategies and ideas -Very large community (most popular game on Steam) -Very little issues, even on my barely-gaming rig Cons -complicated, and it takes a while to learn all the mechanics -tutorial can be a little vague or dense -One player can ruin a whole game (Inherent of all games in this genre) -Extremely hostile or crude community -Lacks any form on region lock, and the report system is barely functional This game functions very well, and truly deserves it's crown of the most popular game on steam. Long live Dota! 4.5/5 9/10

review: After years of waiting, fans of the League of Legends franchise have finally gotten what they've been waiting for: League of Legends 3: The Fall of Demacia. In this thrilling conclusion to the loved League of Legends trilogy, Riot Games have yet again shaken the MOBA genre to its core. In this game, the player returns to playing in three dimensions, rather than two like in League of Legends 2. Throughout the game, Riot has expertly woven in FPS and RPG segments that add a change of pace to the player's adventure. As League of Legends 3: The fall of Demacia has simply too many new features to be covered in my lowly review, I highly recommend that the reader purchases this game. I give this game a 11.5/12.

review: I need lvl 3 steam profile, so I desided to make this review. Dota is compeletely competitive game, it builds on fun of playing with other players. Valve tried hard to make this game easy to learn, and they suceeded in many ways, but it's still hard to master. It is really nice experience to play it with your friends, but you should think twice, does it worth to spent all your spare time to one game, just to learn its basics? And later on, it will consume you compeltely.

review: Dota 2, or Defense of the Ancients 2 is a great free to play game, keeping real to the original mod of warcraft 3. Many people don't know the origins but this title began as a game-mod for warcraft 3. It was so intuitive and successful that it spawned an entire multiplayer online battle arena (or MOBA) genre. Basically, it is a game created, maintained, funded, promoted and played solely by gamers. To know that this formula has lead it into a limelight of success is a warm feeling to anyone involved. The support this game has received has been phenomenal, though the concept is fairly simple. Dota 2 is a professional game experience, much like a game of baseball or football. The stage is set in an online computer regulated fantasy battlefield arena which makes the action more interesting and the gameplay more fair. Players join together in groups of five to take on opponents casually with public matchmaking or by forming professional competitive teams. Each player picks from a rooster of 100+ heroes each with unique abilities and statistics. Players then battle on a field of war, where the two npc armies release waves of troops to engage each other. This is where the game refines itself, though the stage does not change each battle is unique and requires great concentration and mastery to defeat your enemy. To become successful does require a certain level of prowess, so it is recommended new players begin by trying out a couple hundred public matchmaking games. You might think I'm joking, but that is just the start of the journey. As you become more successful your rankings will increase, making you more attractive for recruiters. Unless you already have a team formed and have had previous competitive experience, you might not be immediately ready for high level gameplay. Do not be discouraged, however! The game is great about teaming you up with players of your own skill level. Because the game is team based by nature, it is natural to meet new friends online to play with. It is important to be courteous and not overly rude, because your reputation spreads. If you are friendly and assist your team-mates, they may grant you after battle accolades or want to become your friend. If you are rude and flaming, your team-mates will work against you or sometimes quit altogether. In your early stages it is important to be open and respectful. If you're not sure what to do don't be afraid to ask. The game features an awesome built in microphone system, so if you own the hardware talking to your opponents is as easy as a click. As you complete more battles you earn more rewards, experience, accolades and friends. Rewards include special items and equipment for your heroes. Special effects and modifications to the user interface and stage design. Custom load screens, custom courier graphics, custom animations and plenty of exclusives which can be bought and sold on the steam market! Probably the only downfall here is the high intensity and length these games operate on. It is not unusual for a good game to take hours to complete. Sometimes it can be really heart pounding when you have a close game and both teams are equally matched. The minions flood the screen and team battles clash on, eventually leading a single team to victory. Though the game lacks a lot of what a traditional game is expected to have it is still a full experience. Dota 2 has come a long way and its ambition as a flagship for competitive gamers is something to respect. Its an awesome experience to be part of. Having the full support of steam and by having content designed by the player base, we see a role for anyone who is not successful with the sometimes overly competitive aspect. Much of the reason the original defense of the ancients was successful was because the community had such a large input into the designs of the game. Often the developers recruited within the games player base or other well known modders to help design their masterpiece. Today's Dota 2 sees even larger support, having systems in place to collect almost all 3d model submissions. When new heroes are designed players are both testers and developers of expansion content. This experience makes you feel in touch with the game. Ultimately however, this game is for the players. Battles are tough and the more experienced you become the more difficult opponents you will become matched with. There comes a point where being matched against a fully microphoned team is going to become common. Because I have played this game for so long and know a lot about it, I am not immediately put off by this. However, be warned prolonged exposure to Dota 2 is definitely not a casual experience. Though I always recommend one conduct themselves in the best manor for an optimum experience, you will encounter those who do not agree with these principles. Dota 2 has become a source of income for some, so it is important to those individuals to never lose. If you dont really care if you win or lose and are just looking for a quick way to pass the time, this game can provide you and a group of friend tons of fun. If you are looking to follow the road of success, prepare for a difficult journey. I definitely recommend Dota 2 for all gamers that would call themselves competitive. It is simple, sleek and sexy. Highly appealing and easy to pick up. Best of all, free and highly compatible and supported. Link directly up to your steam account and find out which of your friends play already. You might be surprised! Spending money in this game almost always results in only ascetic changes. This game is definitely not a pay to win game! In fact, one might even generate your own steam dollars by selling the items won from this game! Download it today!

review: When you launch this game the first time, you'll be overwhelmed. You have to play at least 100 hours to be able to tell if you even really like the game or not, and the whole time you'll be ragged on and put down by a harsh, unforgiving community. But, if you pull through, you'll find yourself immersed in a rich, complex contest of strategy and skill. 10/10 will consume your life.

review: I started playing dota long ago and my life became progressively worse. I gained weight rapidly, I began isolating myself from social interactions and the little interactions I did participate in - I was very rude and racist towards anyone who even looked at me. Then I quit because reasons. Then my life started improving. I lost most of the weight I gained, I was dating, I got a nice job and I excelled in all my university classes. Then Dota2 came out. I was given a beta key and it sat in my steam inventory for many months taunting me. It's red glow symbolizing some deep-seated temptation that made me think of nefarious djinns of stories long forgotten. So inviting and so beautiful. But I knew it's secrets and I knew what those secrets did to me. But sadly even the strongest and tallest mountain will eventually fall and crumble to the gentle peppering of rain. After the five-hundreth (im lying, it was like 3 probs) demand that I start playing, my willpower gave in and fell into the blackness once again. I could feel some etheral blackness grasp its fingers around my still-recovering mind. As the game finished installed and I pressed that 'Play Now' button, I realized that I just jumped off the bridge that I was so very carefully constructing ever since quitting the first DOTA. Everything came rushing back to me. One game became ten and ten games became one-thousand. My girlfriend when I began again has left me already and I feel nothing but pity for her because she only wants me to leave the one I trulty love. I'm gaining weight again but whatever, I dont even care . i remember liek when my friend was like, "wanna come party after exams?" and i was like no  that lol i have an ih to do i skipped some exams tho cuz i didnt rly have much time to study cuz ti3 was hapepning and i wanted to watch enough games so i wuldnt be mad that i msised it. but i had to quit cuz im failing university and its gettin 2 expensive 2 live in campus. otherwise 10/10 good game i have 700 hours logged into dota2 and im still casual as

review: The game is easy. All you do is load up and select which server you want to play on, Brazil or Russia. WARNING This game makes you incredibly racist against any person who has any connection whatsoever to Russia, The Phillipines, or Brazil. Other than that it's a great way to ruin your life forever. But once you start playing you won't care anymore. 10/10 would play again.

Victories are as gratifying as defeats are frustrating. Beware of the community, they can get bitter very quickly when a mistake is made. On the other hand, when you do well they may congratulate you. All the best of luck. You'll need it against me.

review: loads of fun, lot to learn; Dota 2 offer you an addiction you cannot find in other games. from denying enemy's farm to split pushing lanes in order to take down enemy's tower, the amount of elements to learn in this game is so many that you cannot help yourself to get hooked (pun intended) and never get tired by the fascinating world of Dota 2. this game offers various gameplay strategy which makes you hardly getting bored of playing Dota 2; you can play as a carry(hitter) to farm fancy weapons and wreck the enemy to their core or you can also play as a support to assist the progress of your team mate's carry(s) and protect them from dying or you can also be a pusher to easily take down enemy's tower and path your way to win with fast paced fashion. the possibility seems to be limitless with Dota 2.

review: Don't get me wrong Dota 2 is a great game, however when you start playing this game you will be beaten with cludgels the size of The empire state. As you play somewhat 20 hours of it you start to figure out how ot actually play. It is heavily rewarding and enables you to enjoy yourself alot more. It takes skill and intelligence to play well and you always learn new things. There are so many phases of skill you go through, this being said as you get constantly better you change in the way you play, you think faster and your reaction time decreases. Its one of those things you do not realise unless you review how you have played. Also i recommend not playing this list of heroes as they require no skill to play and are exceptionally over powered: Sniper ..... his ult is op aswell as his range. Ursa ..... applies fury swipes to target (increases damage done to target after every consecutive hit) Drow ranger ..... Slows you like seriously 50% slow on hit of a maxed out frost arrow. Riki ..... Permenant invis, you get used to being safe while invis but beware if someone actually knows how to play dota they will buy wards or a gem of true sight and then you will be useless Viper .... slows you even more than drow axe .... just is generally op Don't play them as you feel amazing when you do well with them then again they take no skill to play, should be nerfed. League of Losers is easier than dota but less rewarding! One of the best games on steam.

The balance is really good for a competitive game. The workshop system is genius. Easily one of my favorite games. Oh? Did I forget something? Yes, I belive I did. The community! The most imortant thing? Maby. I like the community, or atleast I have almost no issues with it. There are mixed feelings about it. I do have one issue though and it is that there are some (a whole lot of them) russians that play in all regions and refuse to speak the language that is suited for the region they are playing on. For example they join the EU West region and refuse to speak english. They only speak russian! Despite the fact that there is a russian region! I could     about this but that      cyk. No one likes a  . Feels      .  ,    ,     .  ? ?  ?!

review: To this day, when I first get started on playing DOTO, I'd never imagine how wonderful life experience that could be. Seriously. I was just an avarage guy doing avarage life activities, but something changed, thanks to our beloved and handsome Gabe and his company, Volvo, these guys had no ideia when they decided to get into contact with Icefraud in order to make this marvelous sequel of League of Lesbians called EL GRANDE DOTO 2, even though I'm just getting started, this is not a talk to praise the game itself, instead, I want to thanks the community (especially Russians, these s, without them I would never have learnt how to squat <3) you guys are wonderful, always being cheerful and positive, in fact, it makes my mind blow when I acknowledge there are still hope left in this world. Even though I don't play this vidya game for months now, I want to tell you  to keep it up and never ever change your behave. Regards, your most frustrated dota player.

Duke Nukem Forever is better than this. ing Big Rigs has a higher level of entertainment value than this overrated pile of garbage. I honestly don't want to invest any part of my life to learning how to play better because I hate it so much. If you like to troll people this is a great game to do it. People will get on your  and trash talk you the INSTANT you do anything that they don't like. Best thing is to just lone wolf it and troll a team if they dog you, and they will. Terrible game, terrible people. Vile existence of software. Humanity lost with 9 million people that log into this. Please skip this and play something better in your life. There is so many other games out there that are cheap and just make life better. May Jesus have mercy on your souls.

The range of heros is a good amount, not too many that it would be impossible for someone from the team of 5 for there to be an unused hero. The one thing that lets the game down is new players. Now im not saying new players are all bad and should stop playing the game. I think we (experienced players) need to help them, maybe have an academy option of some sort meaning new players are able to be coached by experienced players before they enter match making. This is what I did when I began playing the game a few years ago and something I have done in turn teaching new players. That would be my only advice to new players learn from experienced team mates. If your friendly and dont ignore what they tell you they wont get angry.

review: At first I didn't think I would like this style of game. I was mostly into FPS and MMO's for the last few years. Basically I had a bunch of friends that played Dota 2, and they begged me to play. Needless to say, after a few weeks, I was hooked. After learning the ropes and getting to know the charaters and items better, I grew more and more into the game. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fierce PVP experience. Valve has done a great job with Dota 2 and I look forward to playing it for a long time to come.

review: What makes this game awesome is that each game is never the same. With such a large selection of heroes, items and straregies, it continues to keep you on your toes. Dota 2 is all about team work and finding combinations that will work well together and there is nothing like that feeling you get when your team pulls of an amazing combo move that wipes out all your enemies. Don't take the game to likely either as the scales may turn at anytime which makes for even more fun.

review: Well, I used not to enjoy MOBA's at all, the first MOBA I tried it was Dota 2 because (Valve games are always awesome, every single one of them) but because also, I heard good things about it, so for beginers in this kind of game it's really hard to learn the basics, but once you learn you just want to play more and more and always try different heroes, tatics and such. So all the time I spent on it, it was well worth it. The only problem is that begginers tend to have a really bad matchmaking stats, and you find leavers, etc etc. But for people who are on the same level as me or better, it's great. So why not give it a try?:)

review: This game improved so much since it was released on the beta. There are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as DOTA 1. I know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in DOTA 2 and I think it will help new comers. I know some people who play LOL might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. Its like comparing COD and Battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, I think bot of them are good) Give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. I think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. Try it out, its free and badass!

review: Dota 2 is one of the biggest moba on market, so when it comes to a big player it has some pros and cons. First of all i've played many "Free to play" games but this one must say is a real FREE TO PLAY. In many others games u can spend some real cash on boosters which are giving u advantage on the battlefield but in Dota you "wasting" all your money only on a hero's appearance. Of course u can buy a boost here which will give u more experience from the match BUT THIS ONLY INCREASES your cosmetic items loot. Also forgot to mention that every item from the shop can be looted via match rewards. Second of all Dota 2 was my first moba type game, i was never interested in mobas, never played mobas until i decided to try dota when it was in beta. Even in beta game was "newbie-friendly". First i've played matches vs bots (all diff) then moved to matches vs bots in coop with other players. And then i was ready for the BIG ONE. Later Valve added a nice tutorial for new players to moba games. But anyway most of new people dont care about this, i've checked this on playin on new steam account which queded me with low level of dota 2 (not low level of skill) players and i've met some pretty interesting people right there like carry wisp etc. FInally i must get to the biggest con of Dota 2. For me European player the biggest CON of dota 2 are russians (no im not a racist). Ok to get things smooth i not saying Russia country is all made of bunch of morons but this game really makes me think like this. Russians are the biggest and worst plague of DOTA 2 community. In my all match history which i've played something around 2.5k matches russians were active in like 75% of this number. In 1% of this matches i have met russians who can speak english and can even teamplay the rest of them are non speaking english, selfish players who will always play solo and when you gonna lost game then "its raining ". Dota 2 forum is filled with posts that russians are crashin this game but Valve dont even bother to do something with this. Ending i must say Dota 2 is a solid, newbie-friendly game with some comunnity problems. I absolutely commend this game to all moba fans and not only them.

review: i like the whole game itself (dota 2) because we all know that we started as noobs on dota 1. here, we can practice and learn much faster than the previous game. the game will guide you throughout it's contents. but the only problem in this game is that there are thousands of players from around the world that do not know how to respect other people.

review: One of the best multiplayer online battle arena game; its gameplay focuses on combat in a three-dimensional environment, presented from an oblique high-angle perspective. What I liked on this game is that this is played in discrete matches involving two five-player teams, each of which occupies a stronghold at a corner of the map. Each stronghold contains a building called the "Ancient", which the opposite team must destroy to win the match. Each player controls a "Hero" character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory.

review: I am an omnivorous gamer (or was), that not only includes pc games but also most indoor games. I dont miss any computer game that passes through my way. And one day Dota came in front of me. I started playing Dota with sky high expectations because of its review and recommendation from my friends who play Dota, and I was surprised, because there is no review no depiction and absolutely no trailer or game play clip that can actually show u the true face, the real picture of brilliance and the utterly satisfying awesomeness of Dota, U have to play it to know it. This is the ultimate gaming experience. I felt like all the games I played through my life were actually meant to lead me to Dota. Now I play no game but Dota, and I am pretty sure that I am going to spend a considerably unbelievable amount of my time with it. In the free to play documentary someone said that Dota is a combination of chess and soccer. I liked the phrase but I want to redesign the phrase: Dota is the combination of chess, monopoly, football, martial arts, poker etc and all the computer games u have ever played. And these things in a form of an ultimate team sport. Playing Dota is mostly about knowledge, skill, economy, team spirit, synchronization of your brain with your hands, judgment, anticipation and many many things that I dont know yet. Go Dota if u think of yourself as a true and passionate gamer.

GREAT GAME

review: Way way WAY more depth than League Of legend (LoL), steeper learning curve, higher skill cap and alot more balancing / fair play. Has some similarities to HoN but overall feels like a really different game. I love both but Dota 2 feels more competitive and has a bit more interesting heroes + the balancing is better (except Riki). I would recommend this game if youre into something that requires you to actually think and use your brain unlike LoL. I personally prefer HoN out of all the Moba's but that might just be cause I started with it, Dota 2 comes close as second. 9/10

review: The game itself, is fun, graphics are interesting gameplay mechanics are simple and easy to understand at low skill levels, but complicated and take a lot of time to figure out at harder ones, the game was overaly enjoyable, but the complexivity of items and the gery of players make it.... meh. I don't know a lot about dota 2 ,but this is the imppresion I got from all the time I have played. If a friend of mine hadn't told me the real name I would think DoTA would stand for Den of Tryhard hats. Of course, I haven't played much, but this is the imppresion I got when I started: Overaly enjoyable, but unless you have enough friends for a full team avalble at all times, don't bother.

review: DotA 2 is a MOBA game which is the so called sequel to the Warcraft III mod DotA. Surprising both old and new players alike as to how good it is compared to others or to it's predecessor. DotA 2 is a game which is utterly repetitive, who am I kidding? Same map, same items, same heroes every single time but I never got bored or got sick of it, more like this is the reason I play it so much, to be better at the same map, using the same items and heroes at every other fight. (I play it weekly for about 8 hours, yeah 8 is my favorite #) All in all a great MOBA game, maybe the best. Better graphics than its competitors and definitely more balanced in terms of both heroes and items.

review: hello
game-hours: 1173.9
review: Dota 2 is a very extensive and deep game but this depth and complexity in my opinion means a great ceiling of fun. I really enjoy this game. You can play as an oblivious person with your oblivious friends and derp around the game and have lots of fun trying to bash each others heads in while trying to break that coveted ancient, but be warned; if you enjoy this game you might want to try playing online. Playing online is a different experience ENTIRELY. Team work becomes so much much oh ever so much much so muchly much much more crucial than before (Dr.Suess reference XD) If you are still playing with your group of friends though at this point that should help a lot. But like many people (myself included) you will be in games where you are alone amongst 4 strangers All of whom have their own agenda seemingly (it is not ALWAYS like this.) you will try your best to help your team win but it will inevitably end in a couple of your teammates being head-strong idiots who fed the other team (let the other team kill them to many times) then the fed team is big bad and bulky, then you lose. There are games where you and your team will work together and you will DESTROY!!! that will not always be the case so enjoy it when it happens and get over it when it doesn't. If you plan on being great at this game be prepared to spend hours researching what the items do; all of the recipes, heroe's skills (especially ultimates), and watch games of people who are good (I reccomend Purge he's on YouTube.) If all this seems overwhelming it's because this game can be CRAZY overwhelming however it has potential to be CRAZY fun! The bottom line is what you put into this game is what you will get out of it; at the time of this review i have 270+ hours in-game and I still feel relatively noobish; I have been having fun this whole time however. So if you don't feel like putting away crazy amounts of time into a game then i suggest you get 1-9 friends who also don't know how DOTA works to get this game and just play private games together and have a BLAST because it is quite a lot of fun. A little about me. I played DOTA 1 the Warcraft III mod as a late-comer with 1 other friend game after game and we derped PLENTY But through those games I learned about the stats and recipes of about 90% of the items in the game, giving me a pretty sizable advantage. I could have made this review about ten times longer but then it would have been a guide... (it already kind of is) 10/10 by the way this game is great!

review: Seriously, I've gone from paying Heroes of Newrth to League of Legends to Dota and the only game I've stuck to playing constantly out of the three is Dota. I find it easier than HoN but more challenging than League. I have no major glitches like I did when I played League and I love all the heroes that can be played. I've gotten quite a few of my friends to either pick Dota 2 back up or to start playing it. Like any other game you run into a few rude players but otherwise the community is great. I highy recommend this to anyone looking for a game to play like League or HoN!

review: This is an excellent game. For Warcraft 3 lovers, who have played the original DOTA, this will blow you away. There have been a lot of improvements to the overall gameplay, balancing, item modification, hero selection, and overall purpose to the game. For players new to DOTA, not only is this game free to play, (with some purchasable items in game that have no effect on the outcome of the game, just cosmetics), but it is very easily learned, a lot of fun, and it is a game that can be played in about 45 minute intervals. The DOTA Profile is also a great feature, leveling you up as you gain experience so you can be matched with players that are relatively the same skill level you are. It also includes some fun information, like who your most successful heroes were, your win/loss record, and items that you want to feature. Coaching/Spectating is a great new feature from the original DOTA Warcraft 3 Map, because you can have experienced players come in and watch you play, coaching you. You can set it to where you can only listen to that person and no one else, providing personalized instruction. Hero Build/ Item Build is awesome, you can literally create customized builds for your heroes that can be used through the entire steam community. If you're learning a hero you've never played, selecting a community build is a great way to learn. There are many other features, and many other reasons to give the game a try. Whether your an old hat at DOTA, or looking for a change of pace, this game is for you.

review: As someone who had never played the original Dota for Warcraft 3 and had only played League of Legends prior to the release of Dota 2, I can safely say it's worth the switch. The game was a little daunting at first to get learn but Valve offer plenty of ways to learn, such as their tutorial system or bot match, even better now they added the in-game user guide menu which makes everything so much easier. There is a huge selection of heroes to pick from, each unique and fun to play including roles I wouldn't normally touch such as support, I honestly don't mind it in this game because it's fun. Every aspect of this game seems to be done really well, and it doesn't seem like Valve is stopping on the updates anytime soon. The only negative thing I can say about this game is the community, but theses days if you play online you can expect that in any game.

review: A must play for anyone. From a large pool of unique heroes you play as one who possesses unique abilities to be used in tandem with the rest of your team in order to out-maneuver the opposing team. My first MOBA was LoL, and I have permanently made the switch to Dota 2 after weighing the pros and cons, and have never looked back. With the talented people at Valve continuing to produce and develop this game, I am absolutely certain this will be a revered classic for many years to come.

review: This game is play much by myself, but I feel it lacks in abillites and champion roles in the sense that it really doesn't have much varity in how you build your champ/hero as a build can work in just about every situtation. This my seem like a major nark on the game, but I'd say its rather good besides that one part. It has good graphics and a fairly good champ/hero pool. I would say try this out if you're content on not play LoL and games like this, but if you're open to the Moba lifestyle try LoL first honestly. 3.5 out of 5 stars for gameplay. 4.5 out of 5 stars for Pc controls

review: Two teams of five fight across three lanes. Three specific types of shop sell sixty different magical items. There are more than a hundred characters to play, and an unknown quantity still to come. Eight types of specific role that you can play as part of your team. Its safe to say that Dota 2 is a game of numbers. Despite Valves best efforts to ease players in gently, Dota 2 is an inherently overwhelming game. The first few hours of this MOBA are relentlessly bemusing, but after that the difficulty curve becomes smoother - giving you a tangible sense of how youll get better. Each match tends to last somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour, offering vast amounts of entertainment if youve got the time. Lengthy games can cause frustration when things arent going well, however, which is the main source of Dota 2s rep for breeding a virulent strain of internet . Losing isnt frustrating if youre learning something new, and getting to know every character will take roughly 100 hours. Its also worth mentioning that you really get to know them - the vocal work and animations are superb, giving Dota 2 some of the best character design in gaming. Over the next 50 hours it becomes clear that Dota 2s complexity isnt pointless PC-RPG-posturing. Every character, skill, and item serves a purpose. Its a pleasant surprise to find that its depth doesnt damage the clarity of the design. Gold buys you items and XP levels characters up, but in contrast to the messy fashion in which the RPG genre has incrementally evolved, Dota 2s purity shines. Whilst too impenetrable to entice non-savvy spectators, theres no doubting the games quality as an E-sport. Youll need knowledge, skill, and a smidge of spider-sense. Friends to learn with are a must, and dont be deceived by the lack of a pricetag: Dota 2 will cost you hundreds of hours.

review: Dota 2 has easily become the best MOBA out at the moment, fast paced action with a mixture of easy to learn characters and hard to master ones aswell, constant updates with great game modes. If your looking for a MOBA thats easy to get into this is the game for you.

review: It is the best of games, it is the worst of games. There hasn't be a game in recent years that is equally likely to make you swear at the screen and idiotic teammates, as it is to make you smile and laugh when stuff goes well. I guarantee every game will produce emotion, even if some of those are better left unfelt. Just don't punish the hardware you're playing on, it's not to blame. And the first couple dozen games you play, you will hate it. And your team will hate you. And you'll be told to delete dota and kill yourself. And because you're persistent and don't take crap from random morons on the internet, you will ignore them and get better at the game purely out of spite. It's a great game. Let the other player's hatered fuel your desire to improve, and you will get better.

review: If youre looking for a reason to commit time to Dota 2  if youre actually reading this review for advice and a critical opinion, rather than to see what score Im going to give the most popular game on Steam  then, first up, thanks for being here. Second, I want you to consider what it means when two grown men accidentally lather each other in regenerative goop. Its gamings equivalent of holding a door open for somebody who is already reaching to hold the door open for you: a synchronicity of kindness that speaks to a deeper shared understanding of the situation both people are in. Dota is a game where you can say the words are you thinking what Im thinking? and be reliably assured that the person on the other end of your VoIP connection actually is. It might have the systems and bearing of a videogame, but Dota shares the social impetus of a sport. Its single environment isnt a map, its a pitch.

review: I played league of legends for 2 years before finally switching to Dota 2. It is better in basically every way. Huge learning curve (I'm still a total noob after 250+ games) but almost always fun. The amount of possible plays you can make with various heroes/items is basically infinite. The best PvP game in many years.

review: This game.... where do i even start. this game has consumed, no, devoured into its abyss more than a thousand hours of my life. That's like watching you're favorite tv show (without ads) for close to 3000 episodes. I would rather kill myself rather than watch 3000 episodes of tv. After all these countless hours exploring the gaping void of what seems to be, as some would call, fun, in dota 2, i have learned a few things: 1. if someone picks void, lycan or naga, leave immidiately. Do not pass go, do not collect 200 gold. 2. Do not attempt to understand russia, russian people, culture, or anything associated with the words , blyat, id inahui, etc. 3. This game will destroy your ing life Still better than LoL dan outa dan - John wins

review: I made a recommendation for DotA 2 a while back, but that was when I was awful at the game. Now, that I am not awful, I can accurately explain why this is one of the greatest games I have ever played. (Good = +, Neutral = o, Bad = -) + Over 100 Unique Heroes, and, the roster is still growing! + Thousands of items to fully customize your Heroes + So many Heroes, that there is a great chance you will find your favorite one. + Hilarious announcers. o Some people of the community are asshats + So many ways to make your playstyle unique with in-game items. + Many online modes that will keep you busy + Extremely time consuming to level up, so, a level 30 isn't something you see often. Until recently of course, they had an update which make's it extremely easy to level up from 1-10. Which I dislike, I feel as if we earlier players deserve compensation, but it's not that big of a deal. + Everytime you level up, you have the chance to unlock rarer items. + Everytime you level up, you get awarded an item. + Items can be found just by playing ranked/pub matches. + Portal Pack/Stanley Parable Pack + Game is updated constantly, fixing bugs, and adding new content. + ABSOLUTELY FREE! o Addicting, which in turn will make you spend your money on in-game content. Which is of course your fault and in no way the game's fault, but it's still like a hypnotic spell. + Absolutely beautiful visuals. + Very strategic gameplay. + Great soundtrack. o Getting started can be a pain, unless you have the time, or a friend to help you. + Doesn't publish your losses, which can occassionally ruin troll's. + Even if you win or lose a match, Battle Points are handed out equally, and drop rate is the same for everybody, so, losing really isn't too much of a big deal. But, as of recent, big Battle Point Booster's are around, I have a friend who is level 7 but only has 10 game's played, I remember when I was level 7, I had around 100 game's played... it's quite annoying. + Valve allows users to create items for the game, and if your item is picked, you will get payed by Valve, and your item will be put in the game. + Matches you with people your level, so you won't be fighting a level 55. + Even if you don't notice, after playing this game, you will gradually get much better, sadly, you won't be able to notice in ranked/pub matches, since you get matched with people your level. Play this for a while, and fight one of your new friends, you will surprise yourself. + Warcraft inspired Heroes, which is incredible, since I was a big fan of Warcraft. If you don't like games that involve competing, or you easily rage quit, this isn't the game for you. But, if you're fine with rage quits, and difficult opponents, you will love this game, it's fun, and, even after 600+ hours of playing, I am still doing things I have never done before... DotA 2 Deserves 10 Kats all over it's pretty little Ancient... out of 10

review: This game improved so much since it was released on the beta. There are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as DOTA 1. I know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in DOTA 2 and I think it will help new comers. I know some people who play LOL might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. Its like comparing COD and Battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, I think bot of them are good) Give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. I think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. Try it out, its free and badass!

review: DOTA 2 is a great game. It's very tactical. You've the choice of over dozens of heroes. Everybody will find his own special one, for every different playstyle. It's free to play and the ingame shop is absolutly fair and you need no items from this shop. All items are pure cosmetic. If you want to play this game for free, you have to know a person with free copies of this game. The alternative is to buy this game in the steam store. If you buy this game, you'll get some special items for the game. But join a steam group for dota to find guys with free copies.

review: Dota 2 is, in my eyes, the best game ever made. If it weren't for the overbearing ignorance of the people that play this game, that thrive only on making others angry with said ignorance. This game could have been so much more. That being said, I recommend you get a few of your friends together to play with you. If you can get a group of 3-5 people to play this with. There is no better game. Win or lose, my friends and I have a blast every game. Showing off our skilled plays and laughing at each others blunders. Unfortunately if you are a lone gamer, you will end up with that same type of person in your group often. That one guy that can't play to have fun. His idea of fun is to have the whole team verbally abusing someone for a single mistake for an entire hour long game. That being said, I would give this game a 9/10. The one point deduction due to the MOBA community being a bunch of *ssholes.

review: The Good: Fun, Addicting, Strategic, Teamwork, Dominating, Pub Stomping, Competitive Play, Daily Tournaments and Non Advantage giving item shop (Cosmetic Only). The Bad: Match Making in the skill level bracket can seem to be a bit broken at times. One bad player can ruin the match. Players that disconnect and abandon in 5 minutes. occaisonal 3-5 Minute wait on a match. Other Thoughts: I love DOTA 2 in the strategic gameplay. After all it is a MOBA and a strategy game at best so it requires A LOT of patience and A LOT of good timing, skill, and also great efficient teamwork. Thank you Valve for bringing us such an amazing game!

review: Addicting game, I learned a lot about myself and my family playing it. It's funny how small the world is, everyone know my mom and some people even had relationships with her! I hope it was before my father married them. Anyway, that does not matter anymore, after I found out I was gay ( to be precise), my father kicked me out of the house. It's ok, apparently I was adopted when I was younger so I will take this time to move to Russia and find my family. Hope to play again when I get back, who knows what else can I learn!

review: Probably my most played game ever and surely 1 of the best (if not THE best). Very addicting, great gameplay, competitive game too (with ranking), hard to learn and hard to master :), and...FREE. If you're not looking to play over 100 hours don't even start playing it because by then you'll probably not even know half of the heroes and items. would give it 98/100 ( why not 100? Often long queuing)

review: DOTA > LOL

review: Dota 2 can be tough to get into depending on personal play style, which heroes you start off trying -- took me about a week to find my primary due to the boatloads of heroes available -- and the skill of those you get paired with when you're not playing with friends. It is so very worth it, though. When you're playing a hero you're comfortable with alongside a few good allies even a loss can be exhilaratingly fun as you force your enemy to earn their victory. And of course winning certainly isn't half bad, either. While the nuances of the heroes and whom plays best against whom and where may take a while to sort out, however, the base game is simple to learn. --Runs great even on a laptop. --All heroes playable from the start with new ones added all the time. --Multiple game types provide variety. Tired of the standard "all pick"? Try randomly assigned heroes. Or give "least played" mode a whirl and watch the mayhem play out as you and nine other people all try to play heroes that you don't have the first clue how to use. Prepare to see lots of "oops" and "oh, so THAT's what that does". And "sorry". So, so much "sorry". --Great graphics (especially for the genre). --Music, sound effects and voices get high marks. --Paid items have no effect on gameplay beyond the purely cosmetic. --Pretty much anything that you can buy can be earned for free (at random) from simply playing the game or can be trade for with other players. --Custom huds and announcers can be bought, randomly received after games or traded for to tailor the look and sound of your game to your tastes. What's more, they're shared during matches; If one person in the match owns a given hud or announcer then EVERY person in the match will have access to it for that game. It's not unusual to see nearly a dozen available during a game. --Special holiday game types are always a lot of fun and the developers aren't afraid to really shake things up for them, even adding new ingame items and altering hero abilities. Of course standard matches are still available during these times. --Updates, while very frequent, are usually so small that they rarely take longer than five minutes at most to complete.

review: First, you will suck and your teammates will let you know. Then, after a few levels, your teammates will suck, and you will let them know. But somehow you manage to keep having fun and play another 30 hours of the game. Then, nobody on your team speaks English. If they do, they report you. 10/10
game-hours: 1414.1
review: I recommend this game because you really need some skills like Teamplay / Lasthitting / Denying etc. It's a very enjoyable game which you can play with friends. The trading system can also be very nice there. This game often calls out many updates, so if you're wondering if this game has events then well ofcourse! For those who haven't played it yet and really need a new game, try this one. (Games usually take 30+ minutes.)

review: All around a really good game. It places you on a team of 5v5 heros to fight for your so called ancients. Last team with their ancients alive, after 30-40 mins (average game) wins. And the trophy you get for winning is saying ''SUCK IT'' to the other team. To say it short and simple Dota is a must ''try'' alot of people do not like these kind of games beacause of their diffeculties. Which is ing true, this game can be unforgiving and one can go on what feels like the biggest loosing streak since ever. If I where to copmplain about anything then it would be the russians. I know that russians are 70% of the Dota community, but for gads sake and name. Have their regions locked to their own servers. 1. They dont know english (vey welll or not at all) which pissses me off when they delibretly chose the West EU servers. 2. They are greeedy as . Other than that I will say good luck if you want to try this game out. PS. Dont rage its just a stupid game ^^

review: The extent of the game is just enormous! Every game even with exactly same 10 heroes is different every time. Ofcourse community judging by in-game experience of 4000h is quite discouraging and offensive but which games' isn't? Over the years of evolution and growth of players in Dota 2 i've noticed that even people from all around a world can work together as a team, sometimes even without any marks, pings or words. Ofcourse there will be dissagreenment with players cause it's competetivity that keeps hatred directing to anyone alse but yourself. I can say that people should pay ABIT more attention to people in your team or at least watch a replay of your own game when you lost or won with quite a bad score. Examine your mistakes rather then blame others and you'll find the interest and pleasure that i found n this game. Best regards to Valve, don't promise something you're planing to make on exact date. Better notify us with a word AROUND on updates' and changes' dates ;) 9/10

review: As you might know DOTA 2 is a MOBA game, but despite the others games I think DOTA is better. You may ask ''why ?'' , the answer is simple : you can customise Heroes for free and as you want, you can choose your favourite HUD and Announcer.Now about graphics,they are really good even in low quality and imagine if in low quality are that good think how good they can be at high quality.Dota has a darker concept for the Heroes.And at last the gameplay,well,most of MOBA players are saying that is harder.I found it really easy once you learn the items and how that Hero is supposed to go.Maybe I found it easier because is a more strategic game than the other games.I can say only this except Dota 2 I've played 4 other Mobas and the most I've enjoyed is Dota 2. I don't force you to play and like this game ,but I hope you will try at least to play a while and enjoy your play. Good luck & have fun !

However, it is still playable and addictive with loads of characters and item combinations across teams each game is different and lasts about 30-40 mins. It started as a Warcraft 3 mod so expect some familiar concepts. It is going to be free to play at some point so when it is I would at least give it a go You can also buy cosmetic items but nothing to give an advantage over the moaning cheapskates ;-)

If you are willing to study the inerworkings of the game it can be even more fun. you'll also meet lots of new freinds! ^_^ and on top of ALL THAT it's FREE.

review: Dota 2 in a Nutshell: Quits game cause of personal buisness (put in low tier matchmaking) Team is reporting you for no reason (put in low tier matchmaking) Doesnt want to commend player for doing nothing (put in low tier matchmaking) So in Conclusion 10/10 would dota again,24/7 low tier matchmaking #420W33dEVVVRRYDuy

review: Wasn't sure what to think about this game when alex introduced it to me. I found it hard to believe that there were league and championships dedicated to play this let alone the hype behind it, though that could be my doupts due to it's link with blizzard. It's very fun and here Valve are just laughing at the bank with the game as people loved the origonal so much. In this case, you might as well just give your money to valve, it's making that much. Very fun RPG, yet hard to explain. You get to pick a character, level him/her/it up and the objective is to destroy the enemy base. Each base creates small creatures called "creeps" and you gain gold for xp by killing creeps and destroying towers. In this case the creeps are red-shirts, running into battle and no real loss when they die. You can download it for free, spectator a match and see what you think. what do you have to lose?

review: Dota 2 is one of the single most genius games I have ever played. It might not be as adrenaline-fuelling as a top FPS, or as popular as other games on the market at the moment, but it is simply brilliant. Dota 2 uses all of your tactical mind, and takes huge amount of skill to outwit your opponents. Best free game on the market.

review: After playing quite a bit of League of Legends, I decided to finally give DOTA 2 a fair shake, and... well, I think I like it. There are some frustrations in transitioning from LoL's mechanics, especially when it comes to Tower/creep aggro (very different strategy than LoL) and overall champion strength, but the more I stick with it, the easier it is to avoid blindly falling prey to these things. I like that all the champions are free, with the ability to pay for non-effective, aesthetic customizations, not to mention the integration with Steam Workshop, to potentially get your own mods in the game. I still favor LoL, but there is a lot to like here, and I look forward to spending more time learning the depths of this game.

review: I play LoL and DotA 2. It's like being in two different relationships. LoL takes me to all the nice resturants, gets me all the expensive jewelry, and even vaction weekends with her parents. DotA lures me over at 3 am telling me 'you're the only one for me honey,' only to be the same old bi**hy s**t who whips me around. But i still let DotA f*** me anyways, because in a sort of twisted way i secretly like it. She's wild in bed, and i like it when she pegs me with her high heel and drops a digit.

review: Nobody cares that no matter what server and language you select there will always be a Russian in your team that speaks his own language and fails hard. Just give them hates and they will be happy with their game loses.... Also, apart from this bad matchmaking that makes you lose 10 games in a row while playing good, the game features an unitard mute system that helps the Russians mute you for an entire week, just because you speak English in an English preference game. There is not a single game without at least one Russian talking sh!t in his f#cked-up language, no matter which server are you playing on. The percentage of deserved punishments of all the players getting punished by the auto punish report system must be less than 10%. How reports are planned to be used in Dota2: -This guy intentionally ruins the game for the other players, REPORT. -This guy flames and insults other players and is very unpleasant to play with, REPORT. How reports are ACTUALLY used in Dota2: -This guy doesn't play this hero the way i do, lol, he is noob, REPORT. -This guy doesn't know russian language, REPORT  BLYAD. -This guy told me what to do, i dont like him, REPORT. -This guy died for first blood, what a feeder, REPORT. -This guy just killed me, i dont like him, REPORT. A while ago developers added "ranked" matchmaking to Dota 2. I've been waiting 2 years for this moment, hoping that when ranked is here it would separate bad players from good players and i would finally get to play with some players that are on my level. COMPLETE OPPOSITE! That so called "ranked" matchmaking is so much worse than the regular bad matchmaking. First of all, this is not even a real ranked system. It has no ranks. Skill is "measured" in numbers. Second - i don't even know why they add a ranked system anyway when it matches people that are rank 4000+ with people that are rank 3500. They couldnt even get it to match ranks close to one another. They even removed the solo que option, so basically you go solo, you play with other solos vs a stacked party enemy, and if thats not enough - the solo teammates you get are 10 times worse than the ones you used to get in normal matchmaking. Getting matched with all kinds of noobs, trolls and sh!t. Playing this game solo is worse than aids and cancer combined! The community is so good that when you disconnect in a game, where you play very good and your team is winning, the enemy team starts unpausing the game for you to get the abandon just that so they can increase their chance of winning or leave the game.

You dont have to spend money or points to obtain all the heroes and such, every gameplay aspect is available to you 1 second into game. Very comptetitive game that gets you hooked hours on end. ITS FREE. Though DotA 2 is in itself new and though the game is not the first of its kind. It is the original that all other major of its kind are based off of. With testing and balancing going back as far as WC3: RoC days. a must have game for any player. If you haven't tried it yet now is the time

review: When you first start to play Dota 2, it becomes kind of annoying to figure out how to play and what to do. After a few matches, you get frustrated and stop, mostly because of the long game times. You come back to it after 2 or 3 days, and you know what the game is about and have a brief idea on how to play it. After some games, its not as frustrating than when you first started. You continue to play for some weeks afterwards, and decide to abandon a match, due to whatever may be the reason - lag, bad hero, didn't win, etc. You realise that there is a low-priority pool, and have to play in it for 2-4 matches. You get annoyed again when you see that you don't receive points to level up due to low-priority. Nevertheless, you finish your matches and continue. In one match, you get abused for doing a wrong move, or just playing badly, and get annoyed once again from the other player. This continues for some time. By 1 -2 months, you start playing a lot better and aren't as afraid to chat to your team - and if necessary, the other team. After more time, you seem to be great at it, but then you lose the nest 10 games. Anger hits you, from the losses of game after game after game, and suddenly you win. You are now a great Dota player, with all the skills required to play perfectly - well at least almost perfectly, apart from the mishaps every now and then. One of the best games I've played.

review: If you want to play a moba game other then League of Legends, then you should wait no longer. Dota 2 is an excellent moba game with alot of exciting events. Unlike League of Legends you can play every hero in Dota 2 without paying for it. You don't have to buy any hero. You can collect cosmetic items for your hero in Dota 2. You are eligible to find items after you finished a game. You can find items like chests, couriers, hero gear/weapons and much more. There is also a ingame shop where you can buy cosmetic items, but this is optional.

I cant describe how happy I am with the move. Dota 2 is by far the best of it's kind. Scratch League, Scratch Hon, Scratch and of them other copy cat wannabes and make the switch today. Updates all the time, new models all the time, the orginal FroG who created this presents is in lead with valve. There's no reason not to switch. Stop being a follower and become a leader!

review: Hearing about this back when I was still in highschool playing DotA made me very excited. Immediately signing up for the beta. It took longer than one may expect to get a beta key. I got in around the time Invoker was released which is actually perfect timing since I was still honing my skills with him. For a gamer who spent a lot of time in the first game, It wasn't too hard getting into this game. The feeling is there, the looks of the heroes are very similar which is good since going too far from the original concept might be a bad idea. I have invested a lot of time in this since the day I got my beta key. There are two things that worries me first being that the cosmetics shop might get too fancy for a game like this. I fear the day that we get to see them selling a panda outfit for Pudge or a candy cane for Rylai. The last thing is Valve implementing game changing items like a +STR hat or an outfit that makes you invisible to the enemy team for a short amount of time. We'll see.

review: It was when I got rejected when I started playing DotA Allstars in Warcraft III, I was hooked to it. I spent 12 - 14 hours playing it every day. I started to get bored by it and day after day, I didn't feel like playing anymore. When Dota 2 was announced, I wanted to get the beta key... but I didn't, and since I didn't feel like playing the original, I spent maybe a year without it. A friend gave me a key to Dota 2, I installed it and played it once, it was my first time getting wrecked so bad that I didn't have the urge to play another game It was then someone broke my heart, I have never been so down in my life. I took so many antidepressants and peer to peer meetings, but nothing works. One day, that same friend who gave me the key, invited me to play. We won and suddenly I felt better. I played and I played a lot. And every game made me feel better about myself and my perspective in life. Dota 2 was there for me when life was too twisted, when reality was too painful to bear. No matter how much I got rejected and how many times I felt alone, Dota was there, to make me happy and make me feel better. Good things has to come to an end so that better things can start, that was when I met her. She fixed the hole in my heart and stitched up the wreckage of the past. For weeks, I played Dota less and less. Right now, I gave all my stuff to my friend that gave me the beta key, a gift of gratitude if you will. So long Dota and thanks for being there for me when I was down and when I want to escape reality 10/10

And don't even get me started on the level of competition in this GEM OF A ING FREE TO PLAY GAME, does a grand prize pool of a little over 2 MILLION* MEAN ANYTHING TO ANYONE? Thanks a lot Valve for making me feel guilty, I ain't worthy to play this. Oh and thanks Blizzard! You'll always be top tier. *And now with the International 4 the prize pool is over 9 million.

I stopped playing this game recently but my interests to it have drwan me back. With the game becoming bigger and bigger its setting a new margain for the guys behind dota 2 but i feel what the community wants incorporated in the game willl be seen even though i feel the game is spot on for a moba( even though i havent played hero of the storms yet :p), but in other words nothing is better then F2P so go and try this game you will not regret it!

game-hours: 1829.6
review: This game is not for people who have less than average control over keyboard and mouse. You would need prior experience with relatively complex games, strategic thinking and perseverence. The learning curve is steep and this game is very demanding for the new players, the community at large is unforgiving and brutal if you are making mistakes as the mistakes you make would affect everybody in your team causing your team to lose. You cannot quit mid-game and the game can go for a long time and the result may not be known till the very end. All this can easily put off many people, but those who pass this rite of passage would enjoy the same things that you hated as a newbie.

review: As the MOBA genre began to rise to the spotlight of the gaming community. I decided to give it a try. I first tried League of Legends, but was yelled at for being a noob and rage quitted. I thought this kind of behavior was counter-productive, because a gaming commmunity should be supportive of noobs....because even the gaming legends start as noobs as some point in their career. So I got frustrated, and didn't touch MOBA's for a while. However, I'm in deep love in Valve and everything they do, so when I heard about Dota, I got interested. When I completed the tutorial, and finally joined a game, everyone was helpful and willing to assist a noob to a very complicated and intricate genre. I still suck, as I play off a kind of beginner's intinct and not off of a knowledge of the game. However, Dota, with its compelling art style, helpful community, and a touch of Gaben, blew LoL out of the water for me.

review: Awesome game, but has a very huge learning curve. Which means you have to play a lot of games just to learn the ropes. If you are looking for campaigns or binge campaign mode gaming, this game is not for you. If you are looking for FPS games that end in 10 mins, this game is also not for you. If you are looking for 30 mins - 1 hour real time strategy game, this game is for you.

review: A challenging blend of cunning, reflexes, counter-picking, and obsessive arguments over roles, this game will require every inch of anger-management and intelligence you have to succeed. Don't be fooled by the price tag: this game is only free when it comes to material currency. The true cost of this game is your pride, self-esteem, desire to actually go outside, and your respect for foreigners. A nice bonus though is that at least you can use this game to practice speaking Russian or Spanish (and occasionally Portuguese) if you play in the US servers. Now for the good points. This game has an absurdly steep difficulty curve, but that's half the fun of the game; playing different heroes and finding out which playstyle suits you reveals a lot about who you are as a person and can make you realize that you're either a complete  who only ever picks  heroes that only require a single right-click to kill someone or heroes that actually require some skill and strategy to play. If you fit into the latter category, then you earn my full respect. If you fit into the former category, then you'll probably have even more fun than I do at this game because you will give zero  when you insta-pick Sniper (I suffer from severe guilt whenever I choose a carry (except Anti Mage. Anti Mage gives zero s). So overall this game has ruined my life, turned me into an insociable recluse, removed my will to do any kind of work whatsoever, and sapped up every hour of my free time. 12/10 would  es with.

review: This kind of games is not my cup of tea, in spite of that i like DOTA more and more. Why? Game is not about stupid clicking, how i thought, but if you want to win, you have to strategize and combine special abilities of 5 unique heroes. So if you are not a team player, the game is not for you. The graphics is really nice, but there are some negatives too. The tutorial is very tacky and discourages players from playing more than helps them. The game is very hard and chaotic for newbies. But if you understand to the game a bit, you'll have a great fun. Mainly with a couple of friends. Moreover the game is free to play, so the conclusion is that I recommend DOTA 2.

review: Dota is one of the few games that makes you a complete racist. The amount of people preventing legitamate communication beyond pings and the chat wheel will make you hate russians beyond your imagination. Looking past language differences, the game is beautiful, there is ulimited replay value, it's great to play with friends, and will take many hours of your life.

review: Dota 2 is the official sequel to the highly popular mod for Blizzard's Warcraft III, Defense of the Ancients. A mod that has been worked on by many, and therefore it was hard to determind where the rights belong. A lot of legal hocus pocus were going on between Blizzard and Valve last year, and it ended to valve's favor. The Dota name and franchise is now legally a part of Valve, probably thanks to the sneaky acquisition of IceFrog the year before.

review: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. At first it will seem fun, then you realize you suck at it, but you keep going anyway. "I'll get better" you'll say. "The more I play the more I learn" you tell yourself as you buy boots as your first item. Before you know it, you are playing this game everyday, every free hour you have, it'll be all you can think about. As you look into your iventory, Steam has sent you yet another 6 invites, they are like a cancer, ever growing, each invite you send away generates another 4. Your life has become Dota2 now, and there's no turning back. Great for improving your Russian swearing skills though.

I tell everyone who plays this game to take moderatly long breaks (10-15 minute) in between games. For what this game has in store will make you a slave to it's raw glory. It is fun, I will admit that, but nothing more. On the weekends I sit at my computer endlessly until about 2am then I go to sleep, the entire weekend please have a life don't play dota. -themail AKA the mail man

review: On 2003 a mod for starcraft called "Aeon of Strife" was released. It didn't get the popularity dota had but we all started in something. Then on 2005 a mod by guinsoo in warcraft 3 came and it blew our minds away. Because of it's popularity it made a new genre called MOBA. After the success of this genre many made other titles to rip it off and make a money making game but none came close to "DOTA 2" it had the same mechanics, hero everything you loved from the DOTA franchise. Just be warned that when you play this game you might lose your soul. HAVE FUN !_! "Anyone can be good at DOTA but no one can ever Master it."

review: Once apon a time......... in a soupy galaxy far far away, there was a soup who wanted to become the soup of all soup's, after much deliberations(and a bowl of soup, go figure*, cannabalism?*) our young soup warrior strod apon the dota2 battle grounds(rev.2.30.4321.1234) detemined to carve out him some destiny, like a boss. As soup warrior strutted onto the battlefield/map like a G and cast his eyes about, he came eye to eye, face to face and gaze to gaze with his long standing arch enemy: SOUP SPOON! (dun dun DUNNNN) soup became enraged saying: AWE HELL NO! and immediately casted his stun: noodles of slippery footing while screaming: GET REKT NERD!!! He then unleashed his ult:scalding burn of tounge with tremendous fury while screaming: CRY MORE  YOUR TEARS ARE SO DELICIOUS!!! and just as it seemed that soup would claim victory as his own, soup spoon countered with his salty crackers of dominance spell, allowing him to escape into the jungle where he proceeded to.......... jungle(go figure) all the while swearing to return to soup warrrior and sh!t in his cereal! even if he had to do it one-spoonful-at-a-time!!!!! and so began the epic battle.......who will you chose to fight with like a boss while screaming: GET REKT NERD? DOTA2: spanning oceans and bringing together countless amounts of forgin language speaking imbelciles for 30-50 minutes of stupidity and bickering , enjoy!

review: What can i say about Dota 2 that hasnt been said before, It is one of the most mechanically complex games you could possibly find around. It has a extremely high skill ceiling and takes a lot of effort from you to learn and not be a burden on your team. You will get hate from the community until you become capable and if you do decide to dive in prepare yourself for some harsh words until you settle in but compering this game to league of legends like most others do, It is more complex and fulfilling then league will ever be but its not for the faint of heart. But if you do stick with it and a few mates it will be hands down one of the best times you could ever have.

review: After just having spent my 1000th hour playing this game, I believe I can speak about this game from some experience. This is without a doubt the best MOBA style game available. It isn't pay to win like some competitors, and the options to spend money are only small personal taste enhancers. It's a fun game, although daunting at first. If you've never tried it, you should really give it a shot.

review: Dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably wont suit you if youre looking to play casually. Theres a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But once you start to learn its secrets, theres a wild and exciting variety of play here thats unmatched, even by its peers. Its a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that its completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isnt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. May the best team win.

review: Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game and the stand-alone sequel to the Defense of the Ancients (DotA) mod. Developed by Valve Corporation, the game was officially released on July 9, 2013 as a free-to-play title for Microsoft Windows, concluding a beta testing phase that began in 2011. OS X and Linux versions of Dota 2 were released on July 18, 2013. In most regions, Dota 2 is exclusively available through Valve's content delivery platform, Steam. Each match of Dota 2 is independent and involves two teams, both containing five players and each occupying a stronghold at either end of the map. Located in each stronghold is a building called the "Ancient"; to win, a team must destroy the enemy's Ancient. Each player controls a "Hero" character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory.

review: It's like having an abusive girlfriend. You'll get yelled at, stomped on, and smacked around so much you'll cry yourself to sleep every night. But every once in a great while, she'll give you a peck on the cheek and a tiny little tickle. You'll feel the greatest sense of worth and acomplishment you've ever experienced, until the beatings continue a few moments later. You know you're being beaten and bloodied every minute you spend with her, but you can't bring yourself to leave her. And you never will. 10/10

review: Dota is one of my most played game. If you are familiar to MOBA (Multiplayer online battle arena) Dota is a game for you , it is difficult compare to LoL (League of Legends) no doubt on that . Its a true "play to win" game , purchasable items have no affect in gameplay they are only cosmetic for appearance only . All hero are unlocked unlike LoL you got to pay to unlock or play for hours or days to unlock a single champion . Dota matchmaking "Ranked Match Making" is quite broken. People gets quite frustrated if someone feed's or does some kind of mistake . I know it is quite a reasonable reason , as i did too . You wasted your life 40 min and some random people destroyed the match for you and other's . As goes for gameplay Dota is hard and takes time to learn it is a game for people who are patients . Heroes are quite balanced there are some cool events too like Diretide . its a fun game to play with friends and gets quite annoying too when people does stupid mistakes . There are people who likes to teach noob's like Purge one of my idol in dota 2 scene . New players should check out his guide "Welcome to dota you suck" . My overall rating for dota2 gonna be 9/10 . there are some problem with match making or just my bad luck ? .

review: I HIGHLY reccomend this VERY popular game. It is a 5 v 5 battle game where you try to destroy the enemies base while waves of creatures from your team and the other team come. You have to do destroy buildings that attack you along the way to their base, the whole time leveling up your character with new skills and buying items from the shop, each one having a different abillity. With thousands, maybe millions of ways for you to make your character, and with over 100 different characters to choose from, no two games are ever the same. And that's the best part; you do everything you did all over again, while trying to improve your strategy. Unless you want to try a new character. The only downfall of this game is the learning curve. The tutorials that are in the game are okay at teaching you the basic mechanics of the game, there are tons of guides online that help you get a true understanding of the game. There are also reccomended builds for each character, helping you get a better understanding of each character. Once you have that, you are set to go. Hop in a normal game, and pick any of the limited characters selection, and enjoy! After all, while a game can be serious it's still a game, so have fun! I hope to see you sometime soon in a match!

review: As a Dota 2 fan and an avid player of LoL, I can say that the debate between which is better is moot. They are completely different playstyles and both have their own merits that make each game extremely addictive and enjoyable. Dota 2 is exactly what us Dota fans wanted it to be since back in the WC3 days. The community and the developers have made gameplay near perfection and the rest of the game system just keeps getting better as it evolves. I highlly recommend this game and there's no reason not to try it out, it's free!

review: Much better than LOL in so many ways for example the item system in DOTA is way better than the skin system in LOL because you don't have to play in order to get some nice items and in LOL u will have to invest money in order to get skins, so that's a big reason why i love this game more than LOL. Another reason is that i love graphics and since the graphics in dota are really sexy i find this a better game already (xD). But without comparing i really love the game because its so strategic and fun in many ways and i'm addicted to it. I think this game will atleast give me a couple 100 to maybe a 1000 hours of fun! So if you're thinking about downloading the game.. just click that green button already C;

review: Dota 2 is an official sequel to the mega-popular Warcraft 3 mod: Defense of the Ancients. For those of you who don't know what that is, it's an extremely competitive Action RTS where you control a single hero unit. You and your team of 4 other players must destroy your enemies' towers, eventually leading to the ultimate objective: a massive building called the Ancient, while also defending your own (That's why it's called DEFENSE of the ANCIENTS). Before you can expect to be strong enough to knock down enemy towers, you need to level up and aquire gold, which you get by killing these AI controlled soldiers, called creeps, that spawn at regular intervals. You need to land the killing blow (last hit) on the creep in order to get any gold from it, which is much harder than it sounds. You need precise timing and knowledge of your hero's unique attack animation in order to be able to get any gold. If you get no gold, then you can't get any items to make your hero stronger. Each hero has their own unique look, unique personality, unique skill set (ranging from super simple to super complicated), unique strengths and weaknesses, and their own unique playstle. It's the player's job to know how to best itemize and control their hero in order to best serve their team. Your hero can be a mage that has powerful spells, a disabler that is great at stunning or otherwise locking down the enemy team, a support that is best at helping other team members, a carry that is great at putting out high damage-per-second with their powerful right clicks, or any combination of the 4. I'm gonna level with you right here. This game is deep. This game is complicated. This game is HARD. It doesn't have a steep learning curve; it has a learning CLIFF. You will likely have next to no idea what you're doing when you first start. You will lose games, but the more you play, the more you will learn, and the more fun you will have. If you don't enjoy games that harshly punish mistakes, you won't get far in this. However, if you like games that reward smart strategy and skillfull play, or if you like deep and super-competitive games with a lot of personality, then Dota 2 could be exactly what you're looking for. Play it (Unless you suck...)

review: When I launched this game first time, I thought: "Wow, this game is pretty good!". You know, I've played shooters my whole life, and DotA was such a "breath of fresh air" for me. I liked it so mush first time. My friend tought me to play it, and everything was awesome, until i started to realize that i'm turning into crazy racist that hates every not-english-speaking-gamer, that hates each of nine players on the map, and it scared me. That's my story. So, let's see the review. Do not play this game! First time you may think, that DotA is awesome game which improve teamplay and etc, but this is wrong. It makes you turn into racist and children-hater. Each of nine players on the map always tell you that they ed your mom, if you play not that good. DotA has the worst game-community in the world. I don't recommend this game. Do not play it. It spends all your time, all your money and worsen your relations with people. Do you really want it?

review: I've fully switched over to Dota 2 from playing League of Legends for 6 years. I have to say I never spent a dime on League, and have only been playing Dota 2 for three weeks and spent roughly $50. Although it is quite different when compared to LoL, in terms of difficulty, I say it's much more fun playing Unfair bots with friends. The community is also great.

review: You know your ed when your teamate goes 0 and 4 in the first five minutes and keeps yelling ''brutos'' to which i had no understanding. Now instead of greating my teamates I look for spanish names and rage in the all chat saying ''ing Mexicans.'' Someonething that I could never understand was why they don't play on the Mexican or Latin American servers. This game has ruined friendships and created a community thats greets you with ''Go yourself.'' Overall this game is a hole in which you can waste countless hours of raging and yelling at my friends or getting yelled at. Avoid this game it's harder than squeezing that one dingleberry out your . Avoid all MOBAs because I have learned from experience. I played League of Legends and Latin American people or anyone who speaks Spanish gets matchmade with you and they ruin the game for you. You will become an anger person. If you want to become an angry unhappy person who comes home and plans to make spanish speaking people extinct from the planet. This ing game will make you ing  a dinosaur because you are still a virgin because you have sunk so many hours into it.

review: I wanted to make a funny review but i think its time to mention this argument. If you checked this review to compare Dota to LoL or to HoN or to see which one is better, please staph. or not because that is the point of this review. i would like to make an honest review based on opinions and things on the game itself. Wow guys stop comparing this games and to see which one is better to play honestly they are all great MOBA games this games are all free to play ( im not sure in HoN but its free on garena) and have very competitive and cooperative game play and they all share the same goal to destroy that huge shiny thing in the enemy base. Now i would like to talk about the difference on all 3 of this games I will not side on any of this games i will just set aside the major differences but focusing more on Dota 2, this is a dota 2 review after all. Comparing this game to the other two, Dota lets you experience all of the heroes available unlike the other 2 you need to unlock heroes but they have a weekly rotation of heroes. All 3 games got micro transactions for cosmetics - etc. Being the newest to date, Dota 2 is also the best looking. Now, i talked to some of my pals and they said that Dota is rather "slow-phased" than the League, and its true. League of legends is a fast phased game but Dota 2 is a bit bigger so to say. and not just big because of the map, big because of various reasons like bringing stacks of TP or town portal scrolls with you, enabling teleportation to not just towers but friendly structures, unlike LoL you have a free trip back to base using this recall skill. and the fights or clashes are generally slower in dota 2. In my opinion LoL matches feel more faster than Dota 2 matches Now in HoN, or Heroes of Newerth is more common with Dota 2 than LoL HoN even features items and heroes aside from there names are pretty much the same. but the matches are relatively faster. And if you are comparing this games based on graphics.......really? are you playing the game because this game have much better graphics, quality than the other one? well it is true that graphics is a part of the game but it matters only which gameplay you wish to really enjoy. I hope this review helped you readers and Thank you. Now go feed or be fed.

review: Theres an adage that the Dota 2 community often quotes when someone identifies themselves as a new player. Welcome to Dota 2! They say, with open arms, before concluding with, You suck. They're not wrong: for the first dozen hours or so, you'll be bombarded with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. But if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. It's an achievement owed to uncompromising depth, a ridiculously generous free-to-play model, and the great features developer Valve has built up around it. Valve's artists deserve praise for a crisp and readable style that, after some practice, makes it possible to tell what's going on even in a massive brawl where both teams Dota 2 July 9. 2013 Dota 2 promises to take the unique blend of online RTS and RPG action that has made Dota popular with tens of millions of gamers and expand upon it in every way.  Much More Phill Cameron Says Easier-to-learn MOBAs Super Monday Night Combat Awesomenauts League of Legends of five colorful fantasy characters collide and cast spells at once. However, credit for the intimidatingly complex design of Dota 2 belongs to the original Defense of the Ancients mod (known as DOTA) for Warcraft III, which kicked off the MOBA genre. Valve (after hiring on DOTA's key developers) has copied that formula almost to the letter, and as a result Dota 2 has become notorious even among its MOBA peers for its difficulty  and thats totally justified. Its a double-edged sword that leads to both a terrifying introduction and a world-class competitive game at the highest levels. As such, you should not expect to have fun your first day playing... or even your first week. That sounds like a cardinal sin of gaming, but theres method to this madness. In short, Dota 2 is a deeply layered construct of systems, and to survive you need to understand every single one and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and gold theyd get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of complex abilities like Bloodseekers Rupture (which deals huge damage with every step you take) is a big barrier to entry. Even figuring out which of the 102 heroes (and counting) fits you best is a time-consuming challenge. Initially, youre thrown into the deep end to flounder, trying out any hero that makes the slightest bit of sense. The selection is bewildering: playing as Riki with his permanent invisibility from level 6 on is an obvious choice, as it's hard to kill what you can't see. Drow Ranger, perhaps, with her obscene damage the instant she unlocks her "ultimate" ability at level 6, and her slowing Ice Arrows that enable both escapes and setting up a kill. On the more complex end of the spectrum you have choices like the armour-manipulating Templar Assassin, or the incredibly mobile Storm Spirit, who can dart around the battlefield and avoid damage by simply not being in the wrong place at the wrong time. On top of that there are well over 100 items to choose from within each game, each with their own ways of manipulating and enhancing your stats and suite of active abilities. Your learning has just begun when you've settled on what roles, heroes, and builds suit you best  you also have to adapt based on what other players choose. If the other team plays a Riki, you need to compensate with an emphasis on detection. Go up against Bloodseeker and his hideously powerful Rupture will force you to carry around a Town Portal Scroll to get home in a hurry. To grasp the subtleties of how heroes interact and fight you have to do more homework on the different kinds of damage and how theyre mitigated; how to prevent one type of spell from affecting you, and when you use that countermeasure; how the different kinds of aggro work, and when you need to manipulate them; the timers (which aren't made visible), and how to optimise your play around them. Even after all that, to avoid being caught at a disadvantage you must be taught the nuanced techniques that can make or break games, which Dota 2 seems to almost belligerently hide from new players. Tricks like pulling a group of neutral monsters out of their home so that a new group can spawn to effectively double the rewards are never hinted at. This forced me to read and educate my outside of Dota 2, which had the positive effect of introducing me to the player community and making me feel like a part of it. It's almost like an oral tradition that binds together a tribe. This is a balancing system that could only exist in a game where everybody has access to all heroes, and Valve wisely obliges. All of Dota 2, including its growing cast of 102 characters, is available from the moment you complete the all-too-brief tutorial. And that delicate system can only survive if the items for sale have zero effect on gameplay. Again, Valve has come through. Only cosmetic enhancements, almost all of which are created by the community and held to a very high standard, and tournament goodies (such as tickets for viewing live events) are for sale. Theres not a single paid advantage that could have the slightest impact on the in-game balance, and thats an amazing situation unrivalled among Dota 2s closest competition. Pretty much everything I've praised Dota 2 for, outside of being totally free, is taken directly from the outstanding original mod. Where Valve has taken initiative to make Dota 2 a significantly better experience is in everything surrounding it, including improving the pre-game matchmaking interface, supporting the community of professional and avid players, and even allowing artists to create and sell cosmetic items on the Dota 2 store. Perhaps most important are the steps Valve has taken toward taming the hyper-competitive community. Besides matchmaking, guilds, and a wide variety of different game modes, the things that Valve hasnt done are just as noticeable than the things it has. For example, theres no concede button to throw in the towel on a losing match, and though you earn a matchmaking rank to ensure you're placed competitively, it's not visible to other players. If withholding those features seems like a bad idea on the surface, their sacrifice was not in vain  it prevents irritable players from dropping out of a match at the first sign of defeat, or when they're teamed up with people whose stats don't meet their exacting standards  a real frustration in other MOBAs. LIkewise, Valve recognized that less is more when it comes to unlockables. Theres no progression outside of the game that will have the slightest mechanical effect inside of it. Without artificial goals to aim for, the matches are left with a strong and refreshing sense of fairness and purity, where everything that can influence success or failure is right there on the battlefield and in your head. In my personal experience, Valves ideas work. I've played for over 1,000 hours, and my encounters with people unwilling to act decently towards their fellow players have become increasingly rare over the course of Dota 2s development. It has never been more friendly than it is now  though thats a relative comparison. Even with these enhancements, the best way to play Dota 2 will always be with a team of four friends. IGN-

review: A 6 or 7 line review just won't do this game justice. Dota 2's learning curve is pretty steep but once you learn the basics, which can take 5 to 15 matches, it's rewarding experience that's all about teamwork and playing your role correctly. Dota 2's social features are cutting edge and designed for great casual, hardcore and competitive play. The controls are tight and responsive while dedicated servers on multiple locations allow for almost no noticeable latency. It's free to play but people won't use their wallets for tactical advantage because all items are purely cosmetic. Really impressive game and my personal Game of the Year 2013.

review: It is an amazing game but there are two very negative points about it. One of them, and the most prominant one, is the lack of optimization for the mac version. The mac version, simply put, sucks. It does not do justice that this version is so incredibly buggy on the OSX operating system. Plus, when moving the camera on the top part of the display when in full screen on OSX, the game glitches as it is invoking the status bar.

review: Dota 2 can be a fun experience with an easy to follow tutorial you can be playing with the pro's quite soon just make sure to grab some buddies as cultral and language distances can sometimes fualt teamwork but that is expected of any online team game with a huge veriaty of characters dota 2 has a play style for anyone form as simple as being a melee hero to a ranged hero to being the one who starts the fight or the one who runs away everyone is caterd for. but as any game it has issues some characters are ruined by others and sometimes not intentionaly antimage was made of getting rid of mana characters but some characters uttrely destroy others due to how unfiar they are forcing people to play something that they don't want to play in order to try and balance the game out this can make characters pointless despite you playing to the best of your ability some how riki will stab you in the corner before you have even realised what game you are playing so in short we NEED CHARACTER BALENCING and NERFING in order to be able to play this game on equal footing with everyone else so we all have a fighting chance and arent trying to sometimes compiete wit our own team for farm or kills but if you can look past this the game is enjoyable and is great with friends i strongly recommed captins mode as it ts the highest chance of getting in a balenced game with captins from each team banning 5 heros and picking 5 heros for your team allowing new exiting stratergies to be formed without the useual broken or game ruining characters jumping on your face. i hope you found this helpful .

review: Kinda good game but if you are not playing in the US servers then you will have mostly worse games, well... depending on your matchmaking level Some community members dont know how to select languages that they accually speak, for example: I only choose english language, then some Russian people choose Russian language+English language> accept game> start arguing with people that say: please dont matchmake in english language if you can't accually speak English. Valve should fix this by making some language quiz that you have to do before you can even start queueing Anyways, i love this game, cheers!

review: Dota 2 is most importantly a free game, so the only thing you lose by trying it is time and some bandwidth. Dota 2 not only is a game, but is the best language learning tool. I learned fluent Russian, Portugese, and Spanish in only a few games! It's better and cheaper than Rosetta Stone, and uses fun games to teach! I reccomend this to everyone. Edit: It's dangerous to go alone, take this.

review: The best MOBA of all time. The history behind this game is, well, insane. Icefrog, the mysterious legend. League of Legends sprouting basically from the first version. The teams in the eSports scene. Dota 2 Lounge, for commited betters of eSports Dota 2 teams. Trading cards. Enjoying the hours upon hours spent with friends met just dominating every match that you can. The thrill of playing new heroes and somehow feeling as if the same map is always filled with new challenges. This is a game that you just can't debate about. This is probably the best game I have played besides Counter Strike. Another winner for Valve.

review: A dynamic system to entertain the mind, train your brain/memory, enjoy great pvp and develop leadership, teamwork, foresight, calculation and prediction skills. A varied cast of characters each with their own skill set and a wide range of items to help with customization of the way you want to play. An interesting community ranging from great, co-operative players and impressive enemies, to the lowest gamer quality which require you to develop patience and restraint. If you consider picking this game up, remember, there is a high learning curve, therefore you must be prepared to fall and rise again in the never-ending battle between the Dire and the Radiant.

review: I never liked games like league of legends or smite, but Dota 2 is a whole new story. It is absolutely a great and addictive game to play. The character selection is massive compare to LOL. It is more complicated than League of Legends, so it will take more time learning the game. Some differences between the two games are: 1) couriers that bring you items instead of walking to base to get it 2) you have to buy Town scrolls to teleport back to base. 3) you can "deny" creeps. ( killing your own creeps so your opponent gets less gold and exp) 4) if you die, you lose gold and is harder to comeback from 5) in game voice chat 6) "pause" key to halt the game if you need something. ( anybody can unpause regardless of who paused it) Based off my experience in this game, i haven't encounter much "ragers". I get the occasional one here and there, but not as often as League of legends. Update: Ever since i started doing ranked matches, there have been more "ragers" and non-english speakers. It was frustrating at times, but I got over it. If you don't like the bad side of this game's community, i suggest getting friends to queue up with you. Don't have friends that play dota? Make new friends during your games. You'd be surprise at how nice some people are in games. Don't worry too much about the Haters. Let them hate, while you enjoy a good time playing dota. Online games will always have some haters, especially games that involves a lot of teamwork. Based off my experience in this game, i haven't encounter much "ragers". I get the occasional one here and there, but not as often as League of legends.

review: Honestly there is a massive learning curve for the new players, but Valve is constantly adding features to make the game and its concepts as accessible to the public as possible. The fact that it is free leaves it all up to the player to decide whether the game is for them; nothing is stopping you from trying it out. But for those who are already into this genre of gaming, I'm not going to sugarcoat our community, there are positives and negatives to every aspect of social interaction in this game. You prefer what you prefer, but the game is stellar for me.

review: Before March I didn't know much about Dota 2, I heard about it and that was all. And then that day came when in March I launched Dota 2 for the very first time. I was excited, didn't know much what to expect and was kinda looking forward to finally play it. Now at this point I must also say that a had a friend who usually plays MOBA and RPG games and was trying to persuade me to start playing Dota 2 with him and was always saying him maybe next time. Well fast forward 2-3 months I got an Invite to Dota 2 Beta. I said lets at least try it and we will see. Together with me was that friend( on skype) and then I accepted my first match. I was hyped, the screen showed simple but kinda cool logo of Dota2 and then the hero screen came, I didn't know much and hero list was big so I clicked on Random hero and I got Timber. Even though I had my friend with me I sucked bad... hehe I sucked really bad and feed for like 7 games straight. My friend who was my coach those first games really helped me and with the help of him and tutorial videos on youtube I started to familiarize myself to Dota and for those first games even though I was really bad I was starting to get to know the basics of the game. And yea even though I sucked those first game I was enjoying myself :D It didn't bother me if someone called me a noob as long I was enjoying myself. Games went I was starting to play more like the game wanted me. I played a lot of game since then and i'm still enjoying myself when I have with me people who actually knows we need a support and we can't always have 4 carries :D It's true game is a little bit hard and you need to have someone with you who knows dota or you need to at least watch those tutorials on youtube. but when you learn this things game really opens up and you're set to play :D I also really like cosmetic items and the way the dota allows people to create some great looking items and hopefully put them into the game. Pro scene is also great, I watched TI 2013 and I saw my favorite team win :D Games sometimes turn really crazy and that's the charm of dota. This game is really great when you get to know things. So new players don't lose hope, watch some tutorials, play safe and you should be set. I rate this game 9/10.

review: So. Many. Heroes.... But the tutorial helps. Suggest you take Dragon Knight, Skeleton King or Drow Ranger and play vs bots a few times. Learn what items to buy. Learn to run away constantly. You should never die! You should rarely even get hit by the creeps (the army of monsters that endlessly comes out of the enemy base). Your job is to level up quickly and efficiently so you're ready to face the enemy heroes when they hit 6th or so and come to murder you. When you graduate to real players, everything you've learned about enemy hero behavior from the bots goes out the window but hopefully you've learned to play your heroes pretty well by now. This game is a blast with friends vs bots or real people if you and your friends are accomplished. The community used to be pretty nasty/unforgiving but they have improved and the developers have made such a beautiful interface/tutorial system it's very inviting now. Highly recommend for anyone.

review: Dota 2 Is Very Fun and Free, I Give You The Positive & Negative POSITIVE - Its Very Fun, You Have a Wide Selection of Characters, Tons of Items & Weapons, The Combinations to Create a Weapon or Item Is Outstanding, It Has Pratice Matches, You Also Gain Battle Points After You Win, It Makes You Think and Addicting.... NEGATIVE - There Is Only 1 Stage You Can Play, You Are Forced to Play Online With Ungrateful People, and You Have to Pay for Items & Weapons With Your Real Money When You Are at the Menu Screen...... Would I Recommend This Game, YES

review: Dota 2 is brought to us at a time when the dominating MOBA (League of Legends) thrives and beats it in numbers of users etc. But Dota 2 brings variety to the table as it is a very pretty game with different mechanics and gameplay, if you do play League of Legends this is probably the next best thing and shouldn't be left in the shadow, when released the game will be played maybe not as much a League of Legends but there is definatley a strong community which willl show on release. I am happy to be part of the beta as it refreshing to play but a can be hard to master!

review: What is Dota 2? Well, I've gone at length describing the title before, but I felt like doing something different this time considering the reviews are actually going public. Dota 2 is the ultimate soul of the AoS genre mixed with good old trial and error, along with down right sadistic requirements. DotA is by far and large the game I've spent the most time playing, clocking in thousands of hours over the years. Dota 2, while receiving less of my time, is also in the same boat, as it's basically the same game with an identity crisis, having problems deciding whether it wants to be a carbon port of the original or put into a septic tank and mixed with Barbie dress up mechanics. What is Dota 2? Well, it is a game of you and 9 (+) other poor sods being put into a world of relentless battles in order to defend that giant structure in your base like that's supposed to make sense. The game is entirely multiplayer driven, and there're those 4 other players on your team that you have to deal with on the regular basis, whose vocabulary consist mostly of "", "hue" and "sodding Russians". Team work, knowledge and strong mechanics are what you need to be successful at this game, and the game gives you bugger all but (in)expensive pixel hats as consolations prize for wasting the majority of your teenage years controlling video game characters. I don't mention any names because the game has sod all story and the lore is compiled of a twelve year old boy's power fantasy who has been reading too much of Lovecraft to mess the lore up but not enough to tie it all together. That said, the game is certainly worth your time, god forbid it being actually productive. Its very core concept builds up the true vision of the original: a straight forward walk towards frustration, filled with toxicity, lack of a sense of progression and any rewarding experiences except for playing the game itself. It is an absorbing, glorious and tight game tied into strategy and clutch decision makings, the qualities seriously lacking from the modern gaming industry. Furthermore, the game is completely free to play, and while its developer's release line ups resemble that of a clothing store, these frisks in no way interrupt the core game experiences nor do they hamper the fairness of the game in any way. The philosophy is clear and it is great: you come in the game the same as everyone else, the only winning point is your team's collective effort. Outside of the gameplay itself, the spectator and competitive aspects are built in and are great. I would even go as far as calling it the best in the business right now. Of course, as someone who cannot take a look at the 'professional' farce as anything but a cheap laugh on a cold winter night when I'm at home staring at my monitor screen hoping to stop procrastinating, it doesn't affect me a whole lot. Do not get me wrong, there are plenty of people in the scene that I like and respect, but the whole notion never seemed particularly interesting to me, especially for a game like this. Outside of this and the aforementioned clothing line, there's the giant learning curve that hits in the face of every player picking up this title for a quick bite. It is unforgiving in the sense of feeling like having a drill shoved down your throat while trying to juggle a pair of knives and a baseball bat. Have fun.

review: Fact: Dota 2 ruins lives. I'm writing this in the hope that others can learn from my mistakes. I used to be a respectable human being like yourself, until I started on Dota. Now I play 4 hours+ a night and spend most of my income on capes for a night elf archer. It all started one afternoon when I was happily playing Skyrim. I was sent a message and an invite to the beta of Dota, or 'Defense of the Ancients (see? I don't even know where Sweeden is on the map yet I know what that stands for!) For anonymitys sake let's call this person 'Mark.' Now Mark seemed like the decent sort, well dressed and spoken with a healthy spring in his step, not the kind you would expect to pray on the weak. He told me that him and a group of others were gonna try it and that it was all perfectly safe. The first time seemed fun and before long I was playing every night. Now some people had warned me about the dangers of becoming addicted but well, you never really think it will happen to you do you? But it creeps up on you, slowly at first, maybe one HUD skin here, a courier there but it doesn't stop at that. Soon you need a full set to get the same thrill that a random drop would have previously given you. You start hanging around the dis-reputable parts of the internet trading in seedy back ally's with Russians just to complete the clothing set of a character you don't even play as. It's no way to live... Unfortunatly it's too late for me. But please, who ever you might be, Stay. Away. From. Dota! --- Above was a message from 'James' a recovering dota addict who works with young people to help them with their addiction. If you have been affected by Dota, feel free to call the anonymous MOBA addicts helpline: 0800 11 22 33.

review: Highly addictive MOBA based off Warcraft 3 and massively updated by Valve. The game play is very well tuned with balance updates pretty regularly. The patches are worth looking forward and the free-to-play model is brilliant. That said, this game has one of the worst gaming communities I have ever been a part of. Utterly shocking behaviour almost every game by at least one player. This game painfully needs a ban list to avoid being with these people more than once. Bring friends for the best experience.

review: for me it is like a daily routine to play and compete against players across the world. not just we share our views but also our intellects collide on the same battlefield to determine the wave of glory for teams playing each round. sometimes we win but we loose which really makes to see deep in our hearts where we need the fear to be controlled and our reflexes on time through the game any time any place. at last it made us a way better than we happen to be in our previous game. understanding and reasoning the events of game is the most key factor if u really need to make best out of your effort. this game really changed us more than just one way.

review: Dota 2 is a very complex game, so if you want to play it you have to invest a lot of time, but dont give up. My experice with this game is pretty long (since Warcraft 3 TFT) and i think if you want to play a game like this play Dota 2 and not LoL (little sister of Dota) or similar games. One big disadvantage of the game is that its super hard to learn how to play. But i play this game often and i like how Icefrog maked a very very good sequel what he created as a "Funmap" of Warcraft 3 So if you want a game that require skill, team play and a good overview its the best game on the market.

The only problem is because of it's too awesomeness, unexpected number of new bloods come into this games which makes the game a bit laggy occassionally, nevertheless, they can come up with a solution. Kudos volvo and your partners in making this game. Not to mention the Dota 1 in blizzard ^^.

review: Dota 2 is very much better than Legend of League in many ways. It was able to host tournament, associated with Steam, friends, etc. It's just that it's an unique game or even more special. It give me more efforts to continue playing because it's too fun. Able to practice with bots for private EVEN able to invite your friends to practice with bots. Have a team to create like guild or clan. Have different rules for the game or to create game. Always meet different players with different personality that might be interesting to know what different human made of. Build teamwork, communicate, and stuff like that. Oh and it have so many characters to use and it have different items for character like skins or others. Background changes. HUD skins. Everything it have. Ever if you need something, it's always there (; PLAY DOTA 2!

Yes the Dota 2 community is rough but that is how it has been since DotA on WC3. Harder than usual to walk into and get going at first because of the vast knowledge of the game but replays can easily fix that in a day. Overall great game and once again,  league of legends.

review: The latest effort in making a full-fledged game out of a Warcraft III mod. DOTA 2 places you and up to 9 other people in an arena like environment where a never ending war between good and evil is taking place. After choosing around 100 heroes (with more coming) and dozens upon dozens of items to help give your hero the edge, the game does not stop giving you something to strive for, whether it be mastering the latest hero release, or finding the perfect build for your role of choice. Install as soon as humanly possible.

Anyone can pickup the game and learn the basics, the item formulas and dig in with more seasoned players to keep learning. This game is an endles variaty of possibilities. Even though there is just one map, the hero / item combinations are ludicrously flexible and variad to have a very different experience each time you play. Oh, and the best part of this game, is with no doubt all the focus on teamplay and cooperation, game finder and team building tools (even with live coaching!) This is freakin awesom!

review: With the amount of fans of the original DoTA (Defense Of The Ancients) I can say you will have around 1-2 mins of waiting time which is not as bad as the CSGO waiting time which takes close to 20-25 mins.DOTA is a MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) its a mixed of RTS but you only use 1 Hero.If you are a fan of fast paced strategic RTS-like gameplay then i would highly recommend this game.If you are really want to start of this game i would suggest learning the curves by playing with bots before playing Online with other players.The community for the game is around the level of being really good to being really bad,meaning some people are just really big s while there are also really awesome players to play with..I would also suggest playing with some friends and play in a party..its alot better..I hope you guys the best :) I would give this game a thumbs up!

Plus, the items suggestion are not always applicable. Each item has its role..and against different enemy. Overall, the game is for those with a little imagination. As for the graphics.. pretty much outstanding.. always getting improved.

Also, you can watch other people's games, which has 10 times the quality of Twitch, but still sucks because it lacks the power of Twitch chat. Kappa There are only three rules. 1. Do not die 2. Song name is always Darude -Sandstorm 3. There is no third rule. Download it.

review: One of the most addicting but also challenging online games I've ever played. If you can find a friend that is experienced with Dota 2 to help you get started, take advantage and learn this game. Once you become at least an above average noob and learn how to play and make decisions on your own, you will love Dota 2.

review: Dota 2 A game where a total of 10 players, divided into groups of 5 play and try to outwit or outplay the opposing team. Communication is a must, rather than individual and technical skill in higher play. Practice makes perfect in this game. Also has good traders in the market

review: Dota 2 is a game that is made due to the amount of  flooding League of Legends. It is an autistic turn based game where the main goal is to run out of cards fastest. There are many "Champs" or as Dota 2 likes to call them "Heroes." Other than the fact that it is pay to win it is run on the Half-Life engine which is really amazing seems though the game developers were monkeys. There are some side quests you can do like stealing children and selling drugs my main "Hero" is a Ork Warrior I am lvl 69. Do i reccomend this game you may ask well it depends whether or not you want HIV/AIDS

review: Game has turned to crap, needs work to make it better but valve dont seem to listen, there low prority  needs the axe, people with internet issues or so forth get punished for impatient people not waiting on reconnect, no surrender option so need to wait whole length of game for the same result while you wait for s to destroy everything long after you have already claimed gg and asked them to finish quick, random draft picking need altering, Radiant pick 1st, then 2 picks dire then need to go 1 pick, 1 pick to make it more even otherwise you have it pick onesided still, some characters are still way to overpowered, i could keep going on but its just making me hate this game even more

review: Start playing today, a game were you spend most of your time saying, "What the ing hell?" But thats not all, start from now on to understand what real racism means, not only will you hate the Russians, but soon you'll hate yourself too? Why? Because when you play it, you'll realise. Oh you think thats it? NO There is more. This game will not only make you hate everyone else in the world, but it will also make you - Anti social - Actually racist - Rage (More often) - Be a gigantic  fag. In other words, this game is f**king Awesome. But thats not all just to Dota, because in the end, it all concludes to one point. Welcome to dota, Now GTFO.

review: Dota 2 is hard, but there's a huge reward for those who commit. On the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) Defense of the Ancients modification for Warcraft III, now transferred into Valve's Source engine. The game's punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but it's worth sticking the hours in: success in Dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.

review: If your willing to learn and go in knowing your going to have to take the time to get better due to its steep learning curve dota 2 i an amazingly satisfying and addictive game guarranteed to have you comming back for more. i would recomend going in with a mentor but if not the game has modes implemented into it to help newer players get to gerips with the game., also with the ability to create bot and games only for you and freinds you should have no trouble learning the game. with a large variety of heroes to pick from all available as soon as you enter the game there is thousands of hours of gameplay waiting for you in what is the most fair ree to play model in a gae ever purchasing only items for heroes for bragging rights and no stat benefit their is no reason for anyone that owns steam to not pick up and try DOTA 2 for themselves.

review: Dota 2 is the most addictive and fun to play games from valve since team fortress 2. Dota 2 is a competitive and rewarding game which can overcome other MOBA games. Dota 2 has reached all my expectations and more. I honestly cannot think of any downside to the game. Characters are well built, the sound effects and soundtrack is amazing, the characters comments is the best of all the games of the same kind. It's said Dota has a high learning curve which is true, many usually give up within the first 5 hours of game play due to the difficulty and usually turn to games like HON and LOL. To all those Dota 1 players I am glad to say that everything is exactly the same item wise and character skills, this makes it easier to quickly get used to it. In the beginning you might find the game a bit confusing and accidentally keep clicking the old short-cuts for your ulti since Dota 2 adopted the Q W E R format, but once you get used to the new interface you will just feel the awesomeness that once let you get hooked to Dota. Most of the Dota players started to play LOL waiting for the release of Dota 2 if you are one of those then it will take you a longer time to get used to last hits and the range of the characters but when you do, it will all be worth it, so don't give up. Plus the game is going to be Free 2 play what more do you need :).

review: Definitely recommended. I've spent countless hours lost in the pixels of the Dota world, moving along 3 lanes, through lush jungles, a long river and the pit of big , humongous and sweet-deprived keeper of the Aegis. It's great to play with friends and to rib each other constantly, but also extremely rewarding playing with random strangers in pubs. Your own individual skill, micro prowess and language prose come second to your abilities to communicate effectively with teammates and also co-operation as well as co-ordination. Game and map awareness comes after many a pub-thrashing received, but it all adds up to the experience garnered. Also, you get to learn many languages of the world by its most basic form, and the form I truly feel is the right way to go about learning a language, curse words and the way they laugh. Always a good time =D

review: The best MOBA game in the world
game-hours: 934.6
review: DOTA 2 is easily the best MOBA in existence and possibly one of the best games ever made, yet it's also one of the most unforgiving. It's hard, the learning curve is steep, and it takes a lot of time and practice to become proficient at each role and with different heroes. However, if you can become anything more than mediocre with a few heroes, it's one of the most rewarding gaming experiences you'll ever have. Those are the good parts. The bad part is this game has the worst community of players I've ever seen, hands down and it's not even close. Imagine if you-know-who's /b/ board was a video game, then throw in every ignorant and racist teenage troll, mixed with a huge chunk of Russians and Spanish kids who can't speak English - that would put you somewhere in the realm of this game's player base. You cannot play this game unless you have a thick skin, and I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who hasn't been around "the online gaming community" for a long period of time. This game can and will get worse than anything you've seen or heard on Xbox Live. Having said all that, Valve is making some smart moves lately in their attempt to clean up and weed out the worst of the worst. They have "punishment pools" you get banished to for acting like an idiot and for players who can't stay connected for 40 mins at a time. There is a report feature that works and gets people muted for days on end, and in general the game is a lot "cleaner" than it was during beta and early release when I started playing.

review: If you're a fan of MOBAs or are just looking for a new style of game you should check this game out. It's similar to League of Legends (but please don't try to compare the two on chats because it causes arguments). I play this a lot and I quite enjoy it. I feel its a little better with friends, but you can play it alone just fine, find a match and choose your hero and wreck some Riki s.

review: Icefrog and Valve's brainchild, a mix of the classic DotA-Allstars map we all know and love backed by Valve's awesome Source engine. This game will get you hooked in a couple of sessions, where each game is intensely packed with strategy and action. I guarantee you'll keep coming back for more! with it's steep learning curve it will take you hours on end to fully grasp what the game is all about, and that's what makes it so addictive, but once you learn the tools of the trade it's going to be worth it.

review: This game is definately worth the price: FREE. The community is friendly and willing to teach if you're new to the genre. If you've played any RTS game in the past ten years, you'll be able to figure this game out pretty easily. With around 100 heroes and counting, this game has a great deal of variety and will always be challenging. Unlike many free to play games, this game's micro-transaction model is aesthetic only. There are no huge powerups or big weapons or purchases of in-game currency that will give the payer an edge over others. This game is very much the antithesis of the "pay-to-win" model.

review: A long time ago somewhere in Dallas, Texas: A man by the name of Henk Holl had this idea about men wearing masks and beating the  out of each other and having even bigger men wrasslin' on top of these smaller men to see who could push down their towers first. Well Gabe Newell swooped in on his Gabearang and quickly crushed (both figuratively and literally) Henk's deep-rooted desire for a good ol' fashion woopin'. And three quarters of his spine. So what we're left with is a game called DOTA 2, which many believe started as the name of DONUT 2, as Gabe was hungry that day and wanted 2 extra donuts, but many misheard him and thought he said DOTA 2.

You also have to get pass the "noob 'insert player name here'" rants. Good bit of players will speak Russian, Spanish, and Portuguese. You might have a chance to understand them but in the end only having your face yelled at for misunderstanding an order from the AUTO-CAPTAIN; which is the spoiled kid who you hate.

review: One needs to be somewhat fond of Moba games to really like DotA 2, but if you do, this game is for you. Now that it's free it is just extra awesome. The graphics are great and the gameplay is awesome. No game is the same. A warning though: New players will be scolded for dying and the learning curve is pretty harsh. But once you understand the game pretty well it becomes one of the most awesome games you'll ever play.

review: Such a strategic game filled with a lot of mysterious beauty from the four corners of the map, which indeed made it phenomenal and remarkable. You get to learn and experience a lot of things with friends and random strangers all over the continent you are situtuated, thus, enhancing your social development. The game requires a strategy to accomplish the goal and wise decision-makings for the welfare of your team which enhances your intellectual development and psychological development. The game could also possibly develop your emotional development as an axiom once said, "The more you get stronger, the more you get kinder." It only has one common goal and that is to destroy all defending towers of the opponents to possibly destroy their throne, but the beauty of it doesn't merely lie on accomplishing those, but also the clashes of your heroes in between small fights and the bond you had with the players that is. Its uniquely created and highly upgraded from its prerequisite, Defense of the Ancients (DotA) which made it a lot more catchy and addicting! From the doodads and props of the map, its terrains, its features, all of it is absolutely fascinating and intriguing! Makes you crave for more games every each other game. I just loved the game just as much as every DotA player do, so I made this review even though it's kinda nonsense just to test my knowledge of the game as well.

Choose your CHAMPION from a growing list of CHAMPS, each with their own set of overpowered abilities, level up , buy items and advance towards the enemy in order to destroy their base and fish in a fountain for the final 5minutes. all the while creating new friendships with your foreign bretheren who may give you endearing names such as  and noob. You are accompanied on your journey of keyboard rage by an ever lasting team of minions who will valiantly kamikaze themselves into enemy towers and heroes, whilst carrying with them a sack of gold which you must pillage from them once they have become bloody and battered enough to feel the merciful blow from their champion overlords. Once the battlefield is strewn with enough bloody carcasses of slain minions and foes you will become strong enough to destroy your enemies ancient building and most likely be rewarded with an epic treasure chest. And remember, if you're having fun playing dota2, you're playing it wrong!

review: If a good movie costs about $20 bucks for a few hours of enjoyment and you feel its money well spent, than don't hesitate to install Dota 2. It's free and I've logged more hours than I would like to admit. I have had the game since it was in early beta and I continue to play it on a daily basis. If you like games that require teamwork and skill such as Counter Strike, and you want something thats not a FPS than get this game. 10/10

Every element inside the game also brilliant: Dynamic day and night, dynamic fog of war, etc. Each heroes is unlocked free and we can buy cosmetic item and no item increase heroes power inside the game and it make the game balance. Each hero also have his own rules and gameplay. nice. very recommended. ^^

review: Excellent game. After playing the first (and best) DOTA, LoL, HoN and a few other MOBAs, I found this one to be the best. Not only is it the incredible graphics, intense gameplay or the classic feel of old DOTA, but the online gameplay is incredible. The only problem I had with this game was the amount of updates and the fact that other countries choose to play where they will not be best, such as Russians playing in the South African server, not that I am complaining, that is just my opinion. PROs: - Excellent Gameplay - Great graphics - Classic feel - Simple use - Kept old DOTA's characters, gameplay and items CONS: - Not a great matchmaking system - 5-10minutes inbetween matches - Too many updates - Updates are too large All Round: A great game which I have been addicted to for the past month.

review: The waiting times are atrocious due to the lack of a server browser. The community seems to consist of only people who take the game too seriously or people who are so inept they don't even know what wards are. The camera doesn't zoom out far enough. The artstyle is boring. There's only one map. Actual player involvement feels minimal. It's an "e-sport". It's rife with griefing potential. It's boring.

review: Dota 2 is very much better than Legend of League in many ways. It was able to host tournament, associated with Steam, friends, etc. It's just that it's an unique game or even more special. It give me more efforts to continue playing because it's too fun. Able to practice with bots for private EVEN able to invite your friends to practice with bots. Have a team to create like guild or clan. Have different rules for the game or to create game. Always meet different players with different personality that might be interesting to know what different human made of. Build teamwork, communicate, and stuff like that. Oh and it have so many characters to use and it have different items for character like skins or others. Background changes. HUD skins. Everything it have. Ever if you need something, it's always there (; PLAY DOTA 2!

review: Learn how to swear in Russian and several other languages in the very diverse and tolerant gaming community that Dota 2 posseses. You will learn how to pick fault with minute aspects of another persons play style just because they have annoyed you in chat, and repeatedly chant 'report pls' against somebody who doesnt help you solo the whole enemy team. You will be suprised by the proportions of Russian-speaking-only people living in in Western Europe and North America. This game nurtures a hate of Russian and generally non-English speaking people and enables you to make racist and bigoted comments to people you bear no prejudice against what-so-ever. So addictive. Must play!

game-hours: 1150.3
review: Dota 2 has got the be the world greatest game. And it's free! On top of it being free it also doesn't follow the 'Free to play but Pay to win' kind of thinking, but instead follows the team fortress 'Free to play and pay to look better'. This game is all about skill and teamwork, so there's no possibities of cheating or getting smashed by those who empty their banks into this game as that's not at all how it works. You also can practise against bots with bots, or online against bots of a range of difficulties. This is great for begginers to actually figure out how to play, find a hero that's best for them and understand the whole workings of the game. Even if you're not new it is still a magnificent feature for strategy practise and to play with heroes you've never played before to see what they're like without getting killed a lot by those online. The games community is great, with minor exceptions. And is an easy way to learn other languages as people from all over the world play. only bad side is for begginers it's a big learning curve, loads of heroes to choose from with all different attributes, abilities and styles, plus the shop. But at least you have vs bots to practise so it doesn't matter.

review: I was really suprised at how polished and well done this game is, the gameplay is perfectly balanced while the technological aspect of the game is just astounding and I specially love the voice-acting in this game, for example if you say "lol" or "ty" your hero will actually laugh or say "thank you"

review: DOTA 2 has a really steep learning curve if you aren't familiar with other tower defense style games, which is discouraging initially. However it becomes very addicting once you've learned the vast system of items and characters that give the game great depth and replay value. I highly recommend playing cooperatively with experienced friends as it is a very team oriented play scenario and it will help you find your niche. There are so many characters and ways to play each of them that there is somebody for every personality. One drawback is that there is only one map, which gets monotonous. It is a very well devised map, however! Share

game-hours: 3398.2
review: The game is fun. There is no doubt about that. It is fun and frustrating at the same time. You have to work as a team. You and you alone aren't going to decide the outcome of a match. Unfortunately, it seems to have most of the same trappings as Valve's other F2P game, Team Fortress 2. The items introduced into the game have little to no quality control. Thankfully, we have yet to see items that affect the stats of the characters themselves. Dota 2 is one of the best MOBAs in the genre, but far from the most popular. Dota 2 allows you to play all of the heroes that the game offers without spending antyhing, but similar games only allow you to play a small, rotation free hero pool. You must then purchase the each hero individuall with in-game currency or real money. Dota 2 is far better in this sense. Dota 2 also seems to be a bit more high-level than other games in the same genre. This can be both good and bad as it allows for you to reach a higher skill ceiling, but it can be discouraging to new players. The community can be vile and the punishments for "leaving" a game are strict. If you have connection problems or have other commitments that won't allow you to spend updwards of an hour at the computer, I don't think that this is something you could enjoy. Since it is free, I'd recommend you pick it up and give it a try. I will update this review to be more in-depth at a later time.

review: Wow these other top reviews lol. You will play against or with people who don't speak english but for the most part they are ok, minus the yelling in the mic. This may be the single most addictive game I've ever played and I just think that if you don't at least try it for a few rounds you're missing out. Easily the best free game available on STEAM and by far the most complex. Easy to learn hard to master anyone? Just focus on last hitting creeps and you will be fine. :)

review: this game is so great. Needed the combination of strategy, teamworks, skills, and solo ability. it's make the game so interesting. Besides that the hero pool is so many and every heroes have different skills that we must understand and mastered before we use a hero. Knowledge is important to play this game not only righ clicking the enemy but also using your intelegent for make enemy's team down without cause losing the teammates.

review: Each match of Dota 2 is independent and involves two teams, both containing five players and each occupying a stronghold at either end of the map. Located in each stronghold is a building called the "Ancient"; to win, a team must destroy the enemy's Ancient. Each player controls a "Hero" character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory. Overall, this game is a very intense and full of war occurrences, spell caster, magic and physical damage, even the absolutely stunning built-up for every each heroes. This game, Dota 2, is the best multi-player game available on the market yet...!

review: Don't get me wrong Dota 2 is a great game, however when you start playing this game you will be beaten with cludgels the size of The empire state. As you play somewhat 20 hours of it you start to figure out how ot actually play. It is heavily rewarding and enables you to enjoy yourself alot more. It takes skill and intelligence to play well and you always learn new things. There are so many phases of skill you go through, this being said as you get constantly better you change in the way you play, you think faster and your reaction time decreases. Its one of those things you do not realise unless you review how you have played. Also i recommend not playing this list of heroes as they require no skill to play and are exceptionally over powered: Sniper ..... his ult is op aswell as his range. Ursa ..... applies fury swipes to target (increases damage done to target after every consecutive hit) Drow ranger ..... Slows you like seriously 50% slow on hit of a maxed out frost arrow. Riki ..... Permenant invis, you get used to being safe while invis but beware if someone actually knows how to play dota they will buy wards or a gem of true sight and then you will be useless Viper .... slows you even more than drow axe .... just is generally op Don't play them as you feel amazing when you do well with them then again they take no skill to play, should be nerfed. League of Losers is easier than dota but less rewarding! One of the best games on steam.

Dota 2 is really free-to-play, the items in the store are cosmetic only, and every game starts on a level playing field. If you play any Dota-likes but haven't played this yet, you definitely should!

review: Dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably wont suit you if youre looking to play casually. Theres a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But once you start to learn its secrets, theres a wild and exciting variety of play here thats unmatched, even by its peers. Its a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that its completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isnt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. May the best team win.

review: Dota 2 is a fun and energetic game. There is a diverse roster of heroes to choose from that each have there own unique abilities so you'll never get bored. You can buy character sets, announcers, HUD skins, couriers, and loading screens to customize the way you want your game to look. It is difficult when you are new to it, but you'll eventually get the hang of it. I recommend this game to almost anyone in the steam community, and the good thing is....its FREE!!!

review: Dota 2 is a bad game and it sucks really. The players are mostly noob. Dota 2 depends on the strength of heroes not on the skills of the ones who played it. Even the matchamaking system is imbalanced. Everytime I play Dota 2 it's like my team is 40% and the enemy is 60%. Which is really imbalance. Also Dota 2 has a very bad impact based on item cosmetics. Here in our "poor" country this became a huge issue. I hope they ban Dota 2 in the Philippines

review: If you are new to MOBAs.... go to league of legends to get your foot in the waters, because this game is hardcore and complex. put in simple this is HIGH RISK/ HIGH REWARD. fail 2 or three times, the match favors the other team. there will be frustrating moments, but after you past the learning curve, this game is very addicting. only watch the pro plays on youtube after you already get a feel of what dota is about, and you will be amazed at the things the pro players are able to pull off.

review: Blatant chinese rip-off of the all-time classic: League of Legends. They added a bunch of homogay pixie mechanics to seem DEEP and to attract casuals who want to feel cool. They also copied a bunch of champions and ruined them completely. Ashe is now blue or purple or something, Malphite turned into a non-manly moeblob, and Alistar became some gay midget ninja who is always ing invisible and won't leave me alone and keeps throwing pink smoke at me. HOLY  STOP STABBING ME. Buuut, despite its flaws, it's a decent game. I'll stop being buttflustered once I can start carrying people like I can in the original superior game.

review: This game improved so much since it was released on the beta. There are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as DOTA 1. I know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in DOTA 2 and I think it will help new comers. I know some people who play LOL might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. Its like comparing COD and Battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, I think bot of them are good) Give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. I think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. Try it out, its free and badass!

review: At first, I was completely unaware of how I should've played this game. But thanks to the community, I learned a few crucial steps to becoming a good player. I'd like to share the steps I've learned with the rest of the community. Step 1: During my first game, people told me that playing on an English version was a terrible idea, and they recommended me to go make it Russian. That increased how well I understood the game by tenfolds. Step 2: Always buy Mask of Madness and Divine Rapier. My team told me that these two items would make me win every game I played. Although it took me a bit of time to farm the Divine Rapier, the Mask of Madness made me attack super fast that I didn't need any other item. The Divine Rapier also made me hit very hard. If your team doesn't approve of this, they're just jealous that they didn't think of this build. Remember, the more rapiers, the better. Step 3: The last step is to pick these few heros if you're starting out: Meepo: His Ultimate ability is to make more meepos. More meepos=More fun. Chen: Even though he's labeled as a support, just go for the typical MoM Divine Rapier build on him. Works every time. Invoker: His Q, W and E give Strength, Agility and Intelligence respectively. His R is useless, so don't even both with it. All you need is the stats. And those are just a few of many helpful tips on how to become a good player in dota! I hope this review helped!

review: Start playing today, a game were you spend most of your time saying, "What the ing hell?" But thats not all, start from now on to understand what real racism means, not only will you hate the Russians, but soon you'll hate yourself too? Why? Because when you play it, you'll realise. Oh you think thats it? NO There is more. This game will not only make you hate everyone else in the world, but it will also make you - Anti social - Actually racist - Rage (More often) - Be a gigantic  fag. In other words, this game is f**king Awesome. But thats not all just to Dota, because in the end, it all concludes to one point. Welcome to dota, Now GTFO.

review: Dota 2 is hard, but there's a huge reward for those who commit. On the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) Defense of the Ancients modification for Warcraft III, now transferred into Valve's Source engine. The game's punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but it's worth sticking the hours in: success in Dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.

Whilst the same basic story line might not be so captivating second time round it packs some great new sub plots and some hilariouse new characters. There was never a dull moment. I would recomend Portal 2 to anyone who enjoyed the the first Portal AKA everyone who has every played Portal! Thankyou valve for such an enthralling sequal.

review: A good twist on a MMO mostly focused on strategy. This game is playable by a wide range of players due to it's different playing style for each character. Whether you are a supporter role for a team or the leader or the pusher. All of them offer unique gameplay styles. The objective though rather simple is rather hard to achieve in fact and can lead you to racking your brains to think of the best way to destroy the enemies base. This game forges camarderie among players as each player in the team have to work with each other and support each other with the different skillsets they each have. I strongly recommend you trying this game for a classic game twisted into something fresh and renewed, it's worth a try and most certainly will find a playing style in there to suit you.

review: Do you smoke crack cocaine? Have you ever considered smoking crack cocaine? Do you enjoy long hours spent inside and alone? If any of these questions resonate with you, then perhaps DOTA2 is the game for you. The game has an extremely high skill cap and takes years to begin understanding the fundamental concepts and mechanics. The competitive play is intense and rewarding. If you plan on having any additonal hobbies, vocational activities, or love interests. Please consider severing all ties before installing. You wil hurt the ones you love.

review: What can I say? After 1000 hours I still feel unwelcome in the obnoxious community and still get absolutely stomped, but I just cannot put this masterpiece down. Defense of the Ancients was a pioneer of the Moba genre and it's sequel remains a strong contender with the likes of Smite and League of Legends. Dota 2 offers a pool of over 100 absolutely free heroes and both a casual and competitive approach. However you choose to play the game you'll be met with an array of toxic, cussing and hateful individuals who will trash talk and rage at you for the simplest mistake. A thick skin is necessary to obtain full enjoyment out of Dota 2. Ignoring the savage community, Dota 2 has perhaps the most engaging, entertaing and satisfying gameplay ever. It feels amazing to initiate a succesful teamfight or to just win a close game. Most heroes are balanced meaning most victories are owed to the skills of the players, however a keen sense of mechanics knowledge is mandatory due to the game's reliance on different damage types and various other integral factors. Whilst it can be difficult as a new player, persistence and resilience can introduce you to many hours of fun. For the best possible experience, playing with friends will both save you from hateful people and allow you to synergise your strategies. Dota 2 is free, so you have nothing to lose from buying it except maybe your social life.

But once you get the basics, it's completely worth it. The game is like chess with a team. The hero you choose has a few skills, and determines what you bring to the table. Then, for the next 15-35 minutes, and you and your team working together to beat up the other team. Play the tutorial. Personally, I played it just to learn how to watch the live-steams!

review: The original Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, became an entire game considered to be a multiplayer masterpiece. It has inspired an entire genre of games from League of Legends to Smite. Dota 2 can be experienced and enjoyed at multiple levels of one's time. The heavier you invest in this game, the more your reward would be.

There's also the chance to take on the mighty roshan, witch will drop a buff that will help you conquer your opponents throughout the game!

review: Over 300 hours of yelling in my mic a mix of Russian, Spanish and English. -------Actual Review------- (Work in progress) Background of game: DOTA originated as a warcraft 3 mod, which can still be played. Then Valve took this game, re-masterd it, and made it one of the biggest MOBAs (But still only has a fraction of LOL's player base). The Good: -Valve's got lots of money, and so does the player base. This causes some darn large prize-pools, which are also contributed to by the players. The Bad: -Addictive as hell. -About 1/10 players speak a different language and don't care to learn english. Examples include: Russian, Spanish, and Portuguese. Other Problems: -Warcaft DOTA had a lot of heroes which were ported into DOTA 2, causing a lot of copyright problems between Blizzard and Valve. Gameplay: First games should be with bots, and maybe after 10 games you should start playing with people. If you don't know what to buy, valve gives you suggestions based on your hero in the buy-menu. If looking for a guide, you can find one in the top right.

review: These games with their graphics stuck in the 90s and some of the most boring gameplay imaginable should really stop being made. The story doesn't exist, the gameplay consists of doing the same thing every single time you play on the whole one map that the game has and doing the whole one strategy that works on it which 90% of the time is clicking back and forth doing absolutely nothing, and almost everything in it is a rip off of more popular franchises in other forms of media who aren't charming throwbacks or references, but just stupid and uninspired instead like the rest of this game. This is literally a game made with no effort or love simply to make money on the new popularity of e-sports after seeing the other heap of crap that's the exact same with a different title doing so well at that. When the best character in your game is a disgusting giant spider, and the worst is Lina Inverse, you've done something wrong.

review: The best way to have fun and laugh with friends and/or the best way to become racist and/or just hate people. Until you learn how to play, you will get the sweetest beating from russians probably, but as you play along you will be part of the hate community, eventually, My advice as any other who played the first DotA, learn with BOT matches the heroes, afterwards go in the vs players match section. You might get shouted and screamed at and called noob if you screw the match up. If you experience such things, do not worry, you are on the right way of being addicted to it as the rest ofthe "crew". Have fun & Good luck! PS: there are girls that play the game, most of the time you will hear them on the voice chat ;)

review: Dota2 lets you pick what servers you want to play in, but no matter what your playing with russians or hispanics. They will yell at you in broken english or in their home laungage, they well call you "noob" becuase its one of the only words they know. If you play dota2 you will grow to hate anyone that can't speak english. 11/10, Would play again

review: A unique and epic follow-up to the old and infamous DotA, that not only lives up to a really long-built reputation, but surpasses its predecessor in every possible way. Riskier, faster, stronger, more rewarding, frustrating at times, but funnier nonetheless. And maybe what tends to be in the eyes of the gamer a flaw and a massive drawback, might perhaps and personally be the game's greatest characteristic that will only keep reinventing itself viciously in terms of endless gaming; it's very hard to learn, considering that after taking years for one to accustom themselves in every dirty, tricky and veteran way of DOTA 2, they might have a long way ahead in order to truly master it. But, can this really happen? -

review: If you're going to spend any time playing either this and/or League of Legends, this is a far more interesting use of your time. Here are a list of pros and cons: Pros: -Heroes have integrity and character -Hats -Carries don't build the same things as each other -There is no designated "jungler" role -Game mechanics don't change to accommodate bad players -Game mechanics don't change to accommodate immature players -volvo -Holiday themed game modes in which you can obtain hats -Game mechanics don't change to accommodate whiny players -Hat trading -gaben -Victories are highly satisfying -The game is highly cerebral -Half-Life 3 confirmed -Also, hats Cons: -The matchmaking system is suspicious -Russians not playing on the Russian servers As you can see, the pros clearly outweigh the cons. By this metric, you should most definitely play this hat simulator, I mean, game.

review: The best is when your team has a bad game and the guy with aspergers (DOTA requires at least 1 per team at all times - kind of like when you play intramural soccer and you have to have 2 girls on the field at all times or you forfeit) starts complaining that everyone on the team is anything from a "scrub" to a "f@#!ing f@#%ot" who should "uninstall" and "kill themselves". Of course this happens after they call mid within .46 seconds of the game starting and they have pinged the map at least 1.6 million times. It helps that there is an 80% chance that you will play a hero you are completely unfamiliar with, since there are 1.4 billion of them. My favorite is when you get a hero that you have never played before and their abilities require you to do complex math. Much enjoy. Such amazing. CAN'T. GET. ENOUGH.

review: At the moment, I have a whooping 1000+ hours spent on Dota 2. Dota 2 itself is the stand alone placement after DotA, a WC3 Custom Map, which has been getting reworked with a new graphic and engine, that can support future updates to the game. In total, Dota 2 is very addicting, with it's system of Free to Play, with no buff for premium player, because the only thing you can buy in game is just cosmectics, so Users with cash will not own you like in the other F2P model game. So, Dota 2 is really worth it, and hopefully it will be upgraded into betterment in the future, as well as become the best E-sports in the world.

And there are 108 different heroes to choose from. My favourite is sniper. If you love this game then join my group, Ninja Skilled Ronins, or read my guide (and rate up), sniper (tips and builds).

Americans flame like water kissing burning oil play worse than your standard Igor playing "MID OR FEED !" And you start to miss your best Ally/Enemy who doesnt even remotely speak your language. the random russian guy shouting BLYAT in his potato microphone while hearing the worst Techno you ever heard in the background. 10/10 for making me hate this game so much, but still making me come back after everytime.

review: Dota 2 is one of those games that gets better every time I play it. Even though it's played on the same map every time, every game is still different one way or another. There are over 100 heroes to play as, which makes the game incredibly complex. I've put about 100 hours in to Dota 2, and I still have no idea what half of them do. Some focus on healing, others focus on beating the crap out of everything. It's a fun and frustrating game, but mostly fun. It has a giant learning curve, so prepare to put alot of time into this one. The game is excellent. (9/10 or 90%)

review: Dota will most likely sap away your life! I have been playing it for well over a decade (from when DOTA was a WC3 map) and still enjoy the competitive forum above anything else to be played on PC. The learning curve can be quite rough, especially if you jump right into the deep end competing against well experienced players. Having said that; if that is the worst thing I could find to say about it and then considering all the fantastic ideas that are being implemented to make this incredible game more beginner friendly I'm pretty much saying nothing bad at all. Just that this game is well worth the time spent getting to know the basics and then honing one's skills. Great game!!!

review: This game is just too great, and I may as well put it in my top ten games. The gameplay is always changing and there is such a variety of characters, it has something new in each and every match. The events like Diretide and Frostivus are great fun for a bit as well. The only downside is the poor interaction between players which usually includes foul language, and sadly i do partake in it. Still a great game. 9.5/10

review: The bringer of peace. The face of torment. The destroyer of worlds. DotA 2 is a strong game due to it's ability to command different levels of skill. But such as a game can yield a high skill ceiling, such a thing can also lead to several downfalls. DotA has a tendancy to bring out the worst in some folk that might otherwise be pleasant enough outside of the game's clutches. Toxicity in mobas, however, is not in DotA alone, nor only in mobas themselves. As any game goes, the people you face will ultimately vary and it's up to you as the player on who you should focus on and how you should adequately respond. Focusing on the warmer characters and ignoring those who aren't will produce a better gaming experience for all involved and create better teamwork, and that's important in a team-based game. That aside DotA 2 has fantastic gameplay and, if you're willing to put in the time, you will gain more from the experience. It's free. It's accessable. It's certainly worth a try.

review: If you're just a mere casual player looking for something to that you can use to kill time, then turn back now as Dota 2 is not the game for you. Dota 2 is unrivaled when it comes to balance, and competiveness. You will seldom come across a video game that requires as much cooperation and teammork, and let's not forget thlat is also unrivaled for being brutally unforgiving. New comers will undoubtly struggle, and the learning curve will sure drive away many new players but those who prevail will have experience one of the greatest possible experiences they will come across in gaming. Dota 2 is all about tactics and strategy. Everything you do or purchase from the in-game shop will have a significant effect on the outcome of the game, for good or worse. It is also where creativity with unconvential hero drafts or unorthodox item builds can either make you or break you, this is what makes Dota 2 so great. Getting into every aspect and detail into the game would require more than just a few paragraphs as this game is so immese and in-depth. I am writing this review almost with under 2,000 hours of gameplay under my belt, and I am not ashamed to say I am no master or expert, to the contrary actually I am just an average Dota 2 gamer who still questions himself, will I ever stop playing this game? Will Dota 2 ever get boring and old? I doubt it.

Unless you have 400 hours to spend on this game i wouldnt bother, because even with around 400 hours you will still be a fairly rank amateur.

review: Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game and the stand-alone sequel to the Defense of the Ancients (DotA) mod. Developed by Valve Corporation, the game was officially released on July 9, 2013 as a free-to-play title for Microsoft Windows, concluding a beta testing phase that began in 2011. OS X and Linux versions of Dota 2 were released on July 18, 2013. In most regions, Dota 2 is exclusively available through Valve's content delivery platform, Steam. Each match of Dota 2 is independent and involves two teams, both containing five players and each occupying a stronghold at either end of the map. Located in each stronghold is a building called the "Ancient"; to win, a team must destroy the enemy's Ancient. Each player controls a "Hero" character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory. Development of Dota 2 began in 2009, with the hiring of DotA developer "IceFrog" to serve as the sequel's lead designer. Dota 2 was praised by video game critics, who lauded it for remaining faithful to its predecessor while also increasing the level of production quality, as well as for its engaging and rewarding gameplay experience. However, Dota 2 was criticized as having a steep learning curve and inhospitable community. The game has become the most played on Steam, with daily peaks of over 700,000 concurrent players.[5]

review: Of course I would recomend this game. It is the standard for team based multiplayers. Everything about it is very well refined. This game is very challenging, and its learning curve is steep. Do not play this if you are looking for something easy. I can also say that without friends this game is not very fun. The best way to play this game is with a full 5 player team of all people you know well in real life. Communication is key. A well earned victory with your friends in this game hoever is the most satisfying victory that you will experience in a videogame. And that is the trade off. It is so difficult and one win is won on a road paved with hundreds of failures, but when you do win... Its everything :) If I were to critique anything about this game it would be that there isn't a 3v3 game mode. I feel like it would be a boon to the game to have a shorter game type that requires less players to play. This would allow for more fun in those times that you cant afford to put a lot of time into it.

I can only recommend this game since it have made me nothing but racist towards Russians and Peruvains (non english speakers in general) and ever since I started playing Dota I haven't been able to pronounce a common scandinavian name, Magnus (Pronounced Mavnus) as mag-nus and it's really ing weird since I know people with that name. Oh yea, also there was a lot of  going on between the 12 year olds in League, the russians in Dota and the whole "more depth in dota and it's harder" but the depth is really ing hard to see when you're stuck in the trench and blinded by a Riki smoke screen with no dust or supports to your aid.

review: Awesome visual!!! Great Audio (soundfx, music, voice of character) LOVE it!! Dota2 is a high risk game, in addition to depend on our efforts in carrying out the decision, the mood was also very influential until the end of the game. If got the victory we will get an incredible mood, whereas if you lose, we will move to the bed as soon as possible lol xD I think this is not just a game, it's a lifestyle, art and culture, Of course to sharpening intelligence in making decisions.

review: I have spent more time with DoTa2 than any other videogame. Having logged over 1.5k hours, I can say with confidence that DoTa2 is the most rewarding game that I have ever played. DoTa offers a sense of community and acomplishment unlike any other game. Long 5v5 battles force players to communicate deeply - and winning these long battles makes the hard work even more rewarding. Although the MOBA genre in general has a VERY steep learning curve, once immersed in the world, it's hard to break out. DoTa2 is something of a magical videogame and amazing community packed into one F2P experience. Thanks valve.

review: I would like to say some things to Valve. You see Valve you changed alot of things in Dota 2 , and there are some cool things and bad things . The good things are;Bounty Rune,The New Model for Shadow Fiend,and the Fountains. Now the bad thing is that you changed a s*** lot of things which are bad . For example;Riki,Bloodseeker,Techies,the Map,e.t.c. But the most bad thing you did wrong is changing the map! Why? I will tell you why Valve . Now in Dota 2 there are many Ganking Heroes in the game like; Pudge with his Hook, Sand King with his ulti+Blink Dagger, e.t.c.... My best friend deleted Dota 2 because of this , and according to my chart , many Dota 2 gamers have deleted Dota 2 for GOOD. Think about what I said Valve. Commend me , Add me , and Like this comment . This is Za Afro and I love you all! P.S valve theres one more thing I would like to say to you , i love you too (NO HOMO GUYS) goodbye!

review: Before trying out Dota 2, I did not really like MOBA overall. Until my friends persisted that I tried and I was glad I made that choice. Dota 2 is a great game that really requires teamwork(like every MOBA), but it just has this special feel that makes this f2p game a must play. It has awesome graphics and smooth mechanics and one should definitely not miss out on this game.

review: Dota 2 is by far the hardest to learn game I have ever played. However, it is one of the most fun. If you're new to Dota, and you want to get better, you have three options: 1. Practice bot games over and over using a ton of guides and such until you can consistantly beat unfair bots no problem. 2. Play a ton of games with more experienced friends (this way is the most fun). Make sure that they're close friends, because they will teach you, but if you don't listen to them and keep dying or buying bad items or whatever, they'll hate playing with you. So listen to your teachers! 3. Play games on your own and try your best, and end up being yelled at by four different people at the same time (9 if you're lucky). But if you get through the learning phase, this game becomes amazing. It's an awesome strategic game to play with friends. You'll win some and you'll lose some, but it's free and fun, so what the heck.

If you want to play it solo however, be prepared for an abysmal time.

review: Dota 2 is a game that started back in War Craft 3 as a mod but ended up it's own game because it was such a great idea. The competitive scene has plenty of content if you are interested in that (would recommend Beyond The Summit for ProDota stuff) and playing the game is thrilling. The learning curve is massive and very very brutal but once you start to climb, you realize that you aren't the only one and after having clocked in over 1000 hours i feel i still have room to improve and that makes this game worth playing even longer to see what your limits are. If you played Dota 2 a while ago and quit playing i don't recommend this game because it has changed substantially in the 6.82 Balance Patch basically turning our beloved Dota 2 into Dota 3. But, of course if it doesn't bother you that the game has been shaken to the foundations or you are new i definitely recommend this game to you because it is immensely fun and you can poor endless hours into it and still get pwnd like a noob by a fed bloodseeker T-T Good Luck and Have fun with this game, i highly recommend it to you dear reader and i thank you for listening to my opinion. Oh yeah, and remember: It's just a game and people will try to aggravate you, just mute them ;) - Me :D

review: This game.... where do i even start. this game has consumed, no, devoured into its abyss more than a thousand hours of my life. That's like watching you're favorite tv show (without ads) for close to 3000 episodes. I would rather kill myself rather than watch 3000 episodes of tv. After all these countless hours exploring the gaping void of what seems to be, as some would call, fun, in dota 2, i have learned a few things: 1. if someone picks void, lycan or naga, leave immidiately. Do not pass go, do not collect 200 gold. 2. Do not attempt to understand russia, russian people, culture, or anything associated with the words , blyat, id inahui, etc. 3. This game will destroy your ing life Still better than LoL dan outa dan - John wins

review: I made a recommendation for DotA 2 a while back, but that was when I was awful at the game. Now, that I am not awful, I can accurately explain why this is one of the greatest games I have ever played. (Good = +, Neutral = o, Bad = -) + Over 100 Unique Heroes, and, the roster is still growing! + Thousands of items to fully customize your Heroes + So many Heroes, that there is a great chance you will find your favorite one. + Hilarious announcers. o Some people of the community are asshats + So many ways to make your playstyle unique with in-game items. + Many online modes that will keep you busy + Extremely time consuming to level up, so, a level 30 isn't something you see often. Until recently of course, they had an update which make's it extremely easy to level up from 1-10. Which I dislike, I feel as if we earlier players deserve compensation, but it's not that big of a deal. + Everytime you level up, you have the chance to unlock rarer items. + Everytime you level up, you get awarded an item. + Items can be found just by playing ranked/pub matches. + Portal Pack/Stanley Parable Pack + Game is updated constantly, fixing bugs, and adding new content. + ABSOLUTELY FREE! o Addicting, which in turn will make you spend your money on in-game content. Which is of course your fault and in no way the game's fault, but it's still like a hypnotic spell. + Absolutely beautiful visuals. + Very strategic gameplay. + Great soundtrack. o Getting started can be a pain, unless you have the time, or a friend to help you. + Doesn't publish your losses, which can occassionally ruin troll's. + Even if you win or lose a match, Battle Points are handed out equally, and drop rate is the same for everybody, so, losing really isn't too much of a big deal. But, as of recent, big Battle Point Booster's are around, I have a friend who is level 7 but only has 10 game's played, I remember when I was level 7, I had around 100 game's played... it's quite annoying. + Valve allows users to create items for the game, and if your item is picked, you will get payed by Valve, and your item will be put in the game. + Matches you with people your level, so you won't be fighting a level 55. + Even if you don't notice, after playing this game, you will gradually get much better, sadly, you won't be able to notice in ranked/pub matches, since you get matched with people your level. Play this for a while, and fight one of your new friends, you will surprise yourself. + Warcraft inspired Heroes, which is incredible, since I was a big fan of Warcraft. If you don't like games that involve competing, or you easily rage quit, this isn't the game for you. But, if you're fine with rage quits, and difficult opponents, you will love this game, it's fun, and, even after 600+ hours of playing, I am still doing things I have never done before... DotA 2 Deserves 10 Kats all over it's pretty little Ancient... out of 10

review: Dota 2 is a very extensive and deep game but this depth and complexity in my opinion means a great ceiling of fun. I really enjoy this game. You can play as an oblivious person with your oblivious friends and derp around the game and have lots of fun trying to bash each others heads in while trying to break that coveted ancient, but be warned; if you enjoy this game you might want to try playing online. Playing online is a different experience ENTIRELY. Team work becomes so much much oh ever so much much so muchly much much more crucial than before (Dr.Suess reference XD) If you are still playing with your group of friends though at this point that should help a lot. But like many people (myself included) you will be in games where you are alone amongst 4 strangers All of whom have their own agenda seemingly (it is not ALWAYS like this.) you will try your best to help your team win but it will inevitably end in a couple of your teammates being head-strong idiots who fed the other team (let the other team kill them to many times) then the fed team is big bad and bulky, then you lose. There are games where you and your team will work together and you will DESTROY!!! that will not always be the case so enjoy it when it happens and get over it when it doesn't. If you plan on being great at this game be prepared to spend hours researching what the items do; all of the recipes, heroe's skills (especially ultimates), and watch games of people who are good (I reccomend Purge he's on YouTube.) If all this seems overwhelming it's because this game can be CRAZY overwhelming however it has potential to be CRAZY fun! The bottom line is what you put into this game is what you will get out of it; at the time of this review i have 270+ hours in-game and I still feel relatively noobish; I have been having fun this whole time however. So if you don't feel like putting away crazy amounts of time into a game then i suggest you get 1-9 friends who also don't know how DOTA works to get this game and just play private games together and have a BLAST because it is quite a lot of fun. A little about me. I played DOTA 1 the Warcraft III mod as a late-comer with 1 other friend game after game and we derped PLENTY But through those games I learned about the stats and recipes of about 90% of the items in the game, giving me a pretty sizable advantage. I could have made this review about ten times longer but then it would have been a guide... (it already kind of is) 10/10 by the way this game is great!

Recomended to play Dota 2 along with your friends instead of playing it by your own because the fun will be greater if you play it with your friends, but that doesn't mean you cant play it by yourself :) Overall, good graphics, good gameplay, good community (well sometimes you will find these  player who only blame others and do nothing actually to help the team), but the server sometimes do causes lag.

review: Wasn't sure what to think about this game when alex introduced it to me. I found it hard to believe that there were league and championships dedicated to play this let alone the hype behind it, though that could be my doupts due to it's link with blizzard. It's very fun and here Valve are just laughing at the bank with the game as people loved the origonal so much. In this case, you might as well just give your money to valve, it's making that much. Very fun RPG, yet hard to explain. You get to pick a character, level him/her/it up and the objective is to destroy the enemy base. Each base creates small creatures called "creeps" and you gain gold for xp by killing creeps and destroying towers. In this case the creeps are red-shirts, running into battle and no real loss when they die. You can download it for free, spectator a match and see what you think. what do you have to lose?

It's quite hard for starter, but if you try to practice or play with friends, that's good enough. So much items, and everything have different stats and effects. This game is maximum 5 on 5, no much more (except for spectators and coaches). You also can fight or team up with friends on lobby, or you can make party and invite them to play real match with them (team), so much cool items. I recommend you to play this game, it's really fun and addicting for me :D P.S: No OP hero is made here, every hero is balanced

review: Dota 2 is popular free-to-play game by Valve. Its fanbase is huge, with an average of 500,000 players online at any one time (and nearly 8 million players monthly), and growing. The game has team-oriented gameplay, a large number of uniques heroes, and exciting tournaments with ludicrous USD$10 million prize pools. Dota 2 has something to offer to most gamers, from those who prefer strategy and tactics, to those who like aggressive twitchy action, and even those who enjoy agriculture.

review: Simply the best AROUND! On second note. This game is great, you'll hardly get bored of it. The graphics are ok and the artstyle is intresting. Gameplay and mechanics are great. The balance is really good for a competitive game. The workshop system is genius. Easily one of my favorite games. Oh? Did I forget something? Yes, I belive I did. The community! The most imortant thing? Maby. I like the community, or atleast I have almost no issues with it. There are mixed feelings about it. I do have one issue though and it is that there are some (a whole lot of them) russians that play in all regions and refuse to speak the language that is suited for the region they are playing on. For example they join the EU West region and refuse to speak english. They only speak russian! Despite the fact that there is a russian region! I could     about this but that      cyk. No one likes a  . Feels      .  ,    ,     .  ? ?  ?!

review: "We Are The Champions" I've paid my dues Time after time. I've done my sentence But committed no crime. And bad mistakes  I've made a few. I've had my share of sand kicked in my face But I've come through. (And I need just go on and on, and on, and on) We are the champions, my friends, And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end. We are the champions. We are the champions. No time for losers 'Cause we are the champions of the world. I've taken my bows And my curtain calls You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it I thank you all But it's been no bed of roses, No pleasure cruise. I consider it a challenge before the whole human race And I ain't gonna lose. (And I need just go on and on, and on, and on) We are the champions, my friends, And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end. We are the champions. We are the champions. No time for losers 'Cause we are the champions of the world. We are the champions, my friends, And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end. We are the champions. We are the champions. No time for losers 'Cause we are the champions.

review: Honestly there is a massive learning curve for the new players, but Valve is constantly adding features to make the game and its concepts as accessible to the public as possible. The fact that it is free leaves it all up to the player to decide whether the game is for them; nothing is stopping you from trying it out. But for those who are already into this genre of gaming, I'm not going to sugarcoat our community, there are positives and negatives to every aspect of social interaction in this game. You prefer what you prefer, but the game is stellar for me.

game-hours: 1972.8
review: Never has a game enfuriated me so much, yet have me coming back so often. This game is rage induced crack straight to my brain via right mouse click. It has made me hate any language that isnt English, and has reduced my people skills to racial slurs and swears. Matches run from 30-75 minutes, and are filled with dissapointment, anger, and russians. All heroes need nerfs followed by a proportional buff. Rat doto isn't strategy; it's a way of life. Rage as towers fall, and teammates feed, and all you can do is stand there helpless with your iron branch, a tango, and that ward the support planted in your own fountain, for some reason. Your ancient falls, and you throw your dog out the window, punch yourself in the balls, then sit down and queue for another match. Would do it all again.

It has frequent meaningful updates and it's the most balanced MOBA I've played, not to mention the graphics are good and it's engine is very tweak-able, meaning you're going to be able to play the game on older systems, it runs on Linux too.

review: Dota 2 is a masterpiece of competitive gaming. Endlessly replayable due to its incredible depth, the game truly never gets old. Continuous support ensures that the game never gets stale, with a constantly changing meta. Dota 2 has a steep learning curve, but once you find your way, there is no other game like it. Few games are as painful to lose, but inversely, as satisfying to win, as Dota 2. Unparalled strategic and mechanical depth ensure that no player will ever be as good as they can be in any one game, yet it is incredibly satisfying to strive for perfection through continued play. Strategy is deeply involved before you even "begin" the game, with hero selection, all the way through to the end of the match. Certain heroes work particularly well against others, are weak to others, and coordinate exceptionally with others. This is due to the array of unique abilities that each hero possesses, and the role they fill on their team. Once the game begins, players must coordinate with their team members in order to play most effectively. This is done in combat, as well as in what item purchases players decide to make. Strategy is extensively involved in item purchases, combat, and positioning. Players must constantly react to the game in order to play effectively, and since no game is ever the same, the experience is always different, making each game a fresh experience, and one that I will continue to enjoy for as long as I can foresee.

review: Dota is a game that can not be described in a few words, nor can it be mastered in a few hours. You will find yourself playing dota to learn it in the first 200hrs and then you will keep playing it because you just cant get enough. One would think that 200 hours is crazy but trust me and try this game out and you will find yourself over 1k hours on it just like me, who in all honesty started out as the biggest noob in dota, maybe I still am but you just can't stop playing this game. I give it a 9/10. 9 because sometimes the community will get you mad and make you not wanting t play for a while... just a while. :)

review: Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game and the stand-alone sequel to the Defense of the Ancients (DotA) mod. Developed by Valve Corporation, the game was officially released on July 9, 2013 as a free-to-play title for Microsoft Windows, concluding a beta testing phase that began in 2011. OS X and Linux versions of Dota 2 were released on July 18, 2013. In most regions, Dota 2 is exclusively available through Valve's content delivery platform, Steam. Each match of Dota 2 is independent and involves two teams, both containing five players and each occupying a stronghold at either end of the map. Located in each stronghold is a building called the "Ancient"; to win, a team must destroy the enemy's Ancient. Each player controls a "Hero" character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory.

review: Where can i begin? I always check up on the steam store to see what new games are out, hell i even purchase new games if they look good enough (110 games in my library). But the truth is, after about 30 minutes of my new game. i pretty much end up back on DOTA 2. i sure dont have as many hours on this game as some. and thats because i only recently got into DOTA, but from the 150 games or so that i have played. heres what i can tell you. 1) Prepare for Verbal Abuse, Russians, Un Co-Operative Individials, And people that Intentionally make your team lose the game. 2) Prepare to also encounter awesome people! i have made many friendships on DOTA 2, and every so often you will find the most awesome people on your team. 3) PREPARE FOR NEW CONTENT! the wonderful developers of DOTA 2 never fail to provide awesome new content for the game. As an Avid TF2 and CS:GO Cosmetic item trader, i can tell you. DOTA 2 has the best range of cosmetics. And trading these various in game items not only gives me something to do. But has also inroduced me to people with similar interests and others who enjoy trading. Overall i believe DOTA 2 is a well polished, Brilliant game. and i will no doubt be Recommending it to everyone i kniw

review: Nobody cares that no matter what server and language you select there will always be a Russian in your team that speaks his own language and fails hard. Just give them hates and they will be happy with their game loses.... Also, apart from this bad matchmaking that makes you lose 10 games in a row while playing good, the game features an unitard mute system that helps the Russians mute you for an entire week, just because you speak English in an English preference game. There is not a single game without at least one Russian talking sh!t in his f#cked-up language, no matter which server are you playing on. The percentage of deserved punishments of all the players getting punished by the auto punish report system must be less than 10%. How reports are planned to be used in Dota2: -This guy intentionally ruins the game for the other players, REPORT. -This guy flames and insults other players and is very unpleasant to play with, REPORT. How reports are ACTUALLY used in Dota2: -This guy doesn't play this hero the way i do, lol, he is noob, REPORT. -This guy doesn't know russian language, REPORT  BLYAD. -This guy told me what to do, i dont like him, REPORT. -This guy died for first blood, what a feeder, REPORT. -This guy just killed me, i dont like him, REPORT. A while ago developers added "ranked" matchmaking to Dota 2. I've been waiting 2 years for this moment, hoping that when ranked is here it would separate bad players from good players and i would finally get to play with some players that are on my level. COMPLETE OPPOSITE! That so called "ranked" matchmaking is so much worse than the regular bad matchmaking. First of all, this is not even a real ranked system. It has no ranks. Skill is "measured" in numbers. Second - i don't even know why they add a ranked system anyway when it matches people that are rank 4000+ with people that are rank 3500. They couldnt even get it to match ranks close to one another. They even removed the solo que option, so basically you go solo, you play with other solos vs a stacked party enemy, and if thats not enough - the solo teammates you get are 10 times worse than the ones you used to get in normal matchmaking. Getting matched with all kinds of noobs, trolls and sh!t. Playing this game solo is worse than aids and cancer combined! The community is so good that when you disconnect in a game, where you play very good and your team is winning, the enemy team starts unpausing the game for you to get the abandon just that so they can increase their chance of winning or leave the game.

review: This is a game that is relatively straight-forward play, but takes a long time to master. The community is , especially if your a n00b, but if u play well with others, or just play well in general, you'll have a blast. Also, you can't be stupid and play this game well. You need a sense of cause and effect, and a sense of strategy. I would suggest playing with bots for a while, then once you've got the hang of things, public matches is a good idea.

review: This game has taught me so much things that ill never forget : 1- The only good russians are always on the enemy side. 2- That the whole dota community would defend ukraine against russia. 3- That Brazilians dont only suck in football, but in DotA2 too. 4- In low priority games, your whole team is always full of hard carries. 5- That excuse in which a feeder blames "lag" is overused. 6- "Oh 2 russians in my team ? GG WP" every single time. Good game, taught me how to swear in russian !

review: When you first start to play Dota 2, it becomes kind of annoying to figure out how to play and what to do. After a few matches, you get frustrated and stop, mostly because of the long game times. You come back to it after 2 or 3 days, and you know what the game is about and have a brief idea on how to play it. After some games, its not as frustrating than when you first started. You continue to play for some weeks afterwards, and decide to abandon a match, due to whatever may be the reason - lag, bad hero, didn't win, etc. You realise that there is a low-priority pool, and have to play in it for 2-4 matches. You get annoyed again when you see that you don't receive points to level up due to low-priority. Nevertheless, you finish your matches and continue. In one match, you get abused for doing a wrong move, or just playing badly, and get annoyed once again from the other player. This continues for some time. By 1 -2 months, you start playing a lot better and aren't as afraid to chat to your team - and if necessary, the other team. After more time, you seem to be great at it, but then you lose the nest 10 games. Anger hits you, from the losses of game after game after game, and suddenly you win. You are now a great Dota player, with all the skills required to play perfectly - well at least almost perfectly, apart from the mishaps every now and then. One of the best games I've played.

review: If you want to play a moba game other then League of Legends, then you should wait no longer. Dota 2 is an excellent moba game with alot of exciting events. Unlike League of Legends you can play every hero in Dota 2 without paying for it. You don't have to buy any hero. You can collect cosmetic items for your hero in Dota 2. You are eligible to find items after you finished a game. You can find items like chests, couriers, hero gear/weapons and much more. There is also a ingame shop where you can buy cosmetic items, but this is optional.

review: I started playing Heroes of Newerth and i enjoyed it very much! Alot of my competitive friends left and went to play Dota. i eventually ended up doing so too. I cant describe how happy I am with the move. Dota 2 is by far the best of it's kind. Scratch League, Scratch Hon, Scratch and of them other copy cat wannabes and make the switch today. Updates all the time, new models all the time, the orginal FroG who created this presents is in lead with valve. There's no reason not to switch. Stop being a follower and become a leader!

review: Hearing about this back when I was still in highschool playing DotA made me very excited. Immediately signing up for the beta. It took longer than one may expect to get a beta key. I got in around the time Invoker was released which is actually perfect timing since I was still honing my skills with him. For a gamer who spent a lot of time in the first game, It wasn't too hard getting into this game. The feeling is there, the looks of the heroes are very similar which is good since going too far from the original concept might be a bad idea. I have invested a lot of time in this since the day I got my beta key. There are two things that worries me first being that the cosmetics shop might get too fancy for a game like this. I fear the day that we get to see them selling a panda outfit for Pudge or a candy cane for Rylai. The last thing is Valve implementing game changing items like a +STR hat or an outfit that makes you invisible to the enemy team for a short amount of time. We'll see.

review: If you want a game that is different every time you play it that it never bores you to death after 2 campaigns like those COD stuffs, then this is the game for you. This game is hard, it needs teamwork, it needs brains, skills, execution, etc that there's an art to it. Currently the game with highest e-sport prize, this game will make you ignore girlfriend, and a whole lot of things. One of the best game ever created because of its replayability, yes you're gonna waste hours, months, and years on this game and never master it because it is just that hard, and it always changes, the meta, the enemy, the people you play with. This game evolves with you and you evolve with, provided that you're not an  who can't listen to people and won't notice your mistake. I put this game among my top best of the best game ever created. It's just the stuff that makes you want to hone your skill and sense, more and more and more and more. This game is your new girlfriend or at least your mistress. Play it!

review: It was when I got rejected when I started playing DotA Allstars in Warcraft III, I was hooked to it. I spent 12 - 14 hours playing it every day. I started to get bored by it and day after day, I didn't feel like playing anymore. When Dota 2 was announced, I wanted to get the beta key... but I didn't, and since I didn't feel like playing the original, I spent maybe a year without it. A friend gave me a key to Dota 2, I installed it and played it once, it was my first time getting wrecked so bad that I didn't have the urge to play another game It was then someone broke my heart, I have never been so down in my life. I took so many antidepressants and peer to peer meetings, but nothing works. One day, that same friend who gave me the key, invited me to play. We won and suddenly I felt better. I played and I played a lot. And every game made me feel better about myself and my perspective in life. Dota 2 was there for me when life was too twisted, when reality was too painful to bear. No matter how much I got rejected and how many times I felt alone, Dota was there, to make me happy and make me feel better. Good things has to come to an end so that better things can start, that was when I met her. She fixed the hole in my heart and stitched up the wreckage of the past. For weeks, I played Dota less and less. Right now, I gave all my stuff to my friend that gave me the beta key, a gift of gratitude if you will. So long Dota and thanks for being there for me when I was down and when I want to escape reality 10/10

Sure, it takes a long time to figure out what each hero does and what counters what, but once you get to that point it becomes a fantastic game to play with friends. It really shows how well you can adapt to certain situations or communicate with your team to be effective and win the game.

review: Pls optimize DotA 2 for slower computers as ultrabooks(for examle acer Aspire s3 with hd 3000|4000, mcbook air), netbooks and computers with old stuff. Can you minimise the number of polygons in models for slow computers? P.S. I want to play DotA 2 on my tablet PC with out FPS reduction.

review: Really entertaining game with tons of characters. You might run into your average player who was spoiled when growing up and whines when no one listen to his commands. You also have to get pass the "noob 'insert player name here'" rants. Good bit of players will speak Russian, Spanish, and Portuguese. You might have a chance to understand them but in the end only having your face yelled at for misunderstanding an order from the AUTO-CAPTAIN; which is the spoiled kid who you hate.

review: One needs to be somewhat fond of Moba games to really like DotA 2, but if you do, this game is for you. Now that it's free it is just extra awesome. The graphics are great and the gameplay is awesome. No game is the same. A warning though: New players will be scolded for dying and the learning curve is pretty harsh. But once you understand the game pretty well it becomes one of the most awesome games you'll ever play.

review: This is an excellent game. For Warcraft 3 lovers, who have played the original DOTA, this will blow you away. There have been a lot of improvements to the overall gameplay, balancing, item modification, hero selection, and overall purpose to the game. For players new to DOTA, not only is this game free to play, (with some purchasable items in game that have no effect on the outcome of the game, just cosmetics), but it is very easily learned, a lot of fun, and it is a game that can be played in about 45 minute intervals. The DOTA Profile is also a great feature, leveling you up as you gain experience so you can be matched with players that are relatively the same skill level you are. It also includes some fun information, like who your most successful heroes were, your win/loss record, and items that you want to feature. Coaching/Spectating is a great new feature from the original DOTA Warcraft 3 Map, because you can have experienced players come in and watch you play, coaching you. You can set it to where you can only listen to that person and no one else, providing personalized instruction. Hero Build/ Item Build is awesome, you can literally create customized builds for your heroes that can be used through the entire steam community. If you're learning a hero you've never played, selecting a community build is a great way to learn. There are many other features, and many other reasons to give the game a try. Whether your an old hat at DOTA, or looking for a change of pace, this game is for you.

review: When I first played the game, I was confused and didnt understand the strategy behind MOBAs. Frustrated, I quit the game for a year. But I came back to try again, I learned from my mistakes and took in some advice, along with watching a few videos on the basics of the game. Once I had a grasp of it and knew what I was doing I began to enjoy the game MUCH MUCH more. The game has great Lore, simple controls, and an easy-to-use shop. This game is also truly F2P, yes, you can buy items from the market that use actual real-world money, but these items are PURELY cosmetic, and do not give you an advantage whatsoever. Most of these cosmetic items can be earned by simply playing the game, which in my opinion makes it truly F2P. This game also has excellent Steam integration, with free guides to help you learn the game. In short, this is a fantastic game that I intend to spend many more hours playing. I fully recommend this title to gamers of all skill levels.

review: Dota 2 is a game about social criticism. There are many different valuable classes needed to survive the coming battles, but of course, everyone is tempted to just opt for the top 1%. If there is indeed a working class, it will nearly starve, barely able to afford even basic necessities like boots, in order to sustain the greed of the upper class. There is, of course, a middle class, which is basically just failing to keep up with the upper class while scared  to end up like the lower class. All of this is happening in the vanguard of a great big war that is allegedly happening because the two factions like different tree colors, but it's really to make more money to buy more stuff that allows you to wage more war to make more money. The emulated class system is supported by severe language barriers and the game does a good job of making you hate even your closest friends, eventually. 10/10.

From a large pool of unique heroes you play as one who possesses unique abilities to be used in tandem with the rest of your team in order to out-maneuver the opposing team. My first MOBA was LoL, and I have permanently made the switch to Dota 2 after weighing the pros and cons, and have never looked back. With the talented people at Valve continuing to produce and develop this game, I am absolutely certain this will be a revered classic for many years to come.

This my seem like a major nark on the game, but I'd say its rather good besides that one part. It has good graphics and a fairly good champ/hero pool. I would say try this out if you're content on not play LoL and games like this, but if you're open to the Moba lifestyle try LoL first honestly. 3.5 out of 5 stars for gameplay. 4.5 out of 5 stars for Pc controls

review: With dota i've spent almost half of my life. When i was 14 i started with warcraft 3, it was amazing :) Then few years later, friends dragged me to dota. Since that time i never really stoped playing. Few years ago Valve announced its own dota game in cooperation with icefrog. A lot of my mates were sceptical (because of previous attempts for "new dota" - LoL and HoN - were ultimate failure to them). I wasn't, because of icefrog. Since the very beginning i believed in icefrog and in valve and just few weeks after first international i got my own betakey and started to play it. From the very beggining i was so excited about this. Icefrog kept EVERYTHING same, just upgraded things that needed upgrade (graphics, some key mechanics which were limited by warcraft). Ive spent over 10 000 hours in dota2 (dont get confused by hours count on this account ive got a lot of "smurfs") and countless hours in dota overall. Ive met hundreds of amazing people on offline tournaments just because of dota. Countless of amazing people online. For almost decade this game was part of my life and i gotta say THANK YOU ICEFROG AND VALVE AND EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THIS. Dota 4ever <3

review: Two teams of five fight across three lanes. Three specific types of shop sell sixty different magical items. There are more than a hundred characters to play, and an unknown quantity still to come. Eight types of specific role that you can play as part of your team. Its safe to say that Dota 2 is a game of numbers. Despite Valves best efforts to ease players in gently, Dota 2 is an inherently overwhelming game. The first few hours of this MOBA are relentlessly bemusing, but after that the difficulty curve becomes smoother - giving you a tangible sense of how youll get better. Each match tends to last somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour, offering vast amounts of entertainment if youve got the time. Lengthy games can cause frustration when things arent going well, however, which is the main source of Dota 2s rep for breeding a virulent strain of internet . Losing isnt frustrating if youre learning something new, and getting to know every character will take roughly 100 hours. Its also worth mentioning that you really get to know them - the vocal work and animations are superb, giving Dota 2 some of the best character design in gaming. Over the next 50 hours it becomes clear that Dota 2s complexity isnt pointless PC-RPG-posturing. Every character, skill, and item serves a purpose. Its a pleasant surprise to find that its depth doesnt damage the clarity of the design. Gold buys you items and XP levels characters up, but in contrast to the messy fashion in which the RPG genre has incrementally evolved, Dota 2s purity shines. Whilst too impenetrable to entice non-savvy spectators, theres no doubting the games quality as an E-sport. Youll need knowledge, skill, and a smidge of spider-sense. Friends to learn with are a must, and dont be deceived by the lack of a pricetag: Dota 2 will cost you hundreds of hours.

review: This game has given me sleepless nights. I tend to play a hero and learn about its skills and practice on how to master the appropriate strategy. Sometimes I fail because I let my guard down but it is still part of the game. The online concept of Dota 2 is better since I get a chance to play with everybody. The All Hero Challenge is the best feature I think since I have to play all characters to complete the cycle. Please fix all bugs on this challenge so we may be able to proceed and enjoy the game.

review: Normally I would reccomend this game as I have played it for a long time. However it is now simply unplayable. Screen constantly freezes and crashes even when using a high end pc and updated drivers. I have researched how to fix this problem and I have literally tried everything and nothing helps. A lot of people experience this problem online and the Valve tech support is nonexistent and useless. For more than a year I tried to give this game a chance as I used to love playing it, but with lack of consideration towards a great number players including myself I feel it is a waste of money and time until it is fixed. Here is a link to my thread and another related to this issue on the developer page. Please Valve pay attention to your players and actually fix your product.

review: 7/10 - Game and community are great. If you are a newbie, play against bots. Commmunity isn't noob friendly :( It became a huge turn off for me. The learning curve, compared to LoL, is steep and you'll be spending a lot of time learning the many champions in the game as well as game dynamics. Give it a shot, you may end up enjoying it!

I liked how this isn't a pay to win game, you can get items to make your person look better or cooler. But the items don't have any benifet so everyone can play the same people at anytime, and dota 2 is a fair fight. In short I love Dota 2

game-hours: 2453.4
review: So, with nearly 1200 hours on record, I feel like I should share my thoughts. First and foremost, this game will make your family love you less. Your mom, significant other, child, pet etc will need you for something and your response will be, "I can't pause this". You will be accused of putting video games before loved ones because they don't understand that if you retreat to the fountain to kiss your kid goodnight, all of your Russian teammates will yell at and report you. They'll treat you so badly for having a family that the whole match will be ruined and you'll start to hate DOTA. Your family cannot understand that. At its core, DOTA is a team game made up of three kinds of people. People that want to play as a team, Peruvians and Russians. The server you select has no bearing on which of these types you will meet. If you play Captain's Mode or Captain's Draft, you typically avoid the latter two types, but the game is very competitive and unfriendly for new players. Basically, you have to learn to play with idiots. You'll turn into a racist, you'll yell at someone in a language they don't understand, you'll be blamed when your  teammate runs into a 1v5 fight and loses because you should've been there. Eventually, you will become comfortable with a few characters and decide to explore Ranked games or Captain's Mode. You'll be paired with people that speak your language. Games, tactics, and plans will come together. You'll make friends. You'll start to queue together on a nightly basis. You'll form a team. You won't be great, but you'll have fun.... tons of fun. As long as you didn't need that family we talked about earlier. DOTA 2 is an emotional roller coaster that will transform you into a racist and require Zoloft. 10/10

review: I enjoyed most of the time playing the game, but most people play it for being competative, where as I just try to play it for fun. I would personaly recomend it. The only annoying part would be people from foriegn countries for some reason decide to connect to your area server. Ex: russian connecting to U.S. Server or a person who decides that they want to connect to a server halfway across the world. Though I like it when there is a coopertive team who are there just to have fun.

review: Most people on steam have probably heard the name of this game countless times now. So let me give you a short and simple review on it. Get it. Now that that's out of the way try and use the tips I am about to give you so you can get he best possible experience that this game has to offer. Dota 2 has a steep learning curve meaning you can't just jump in there and expect to know what you are doing. When you first launch the game as of recently you are taught how to play through the tutorial the game has to offer. Actually pay attention to this or it will bite you in the  when you are actually playing. Once you get that over with you're probably going to say to yourself "Ok I think I get what I am doing, let me play online matchmaking" Here's one simple answer for you; NO. Dota 2 requires a team effort, and what I mean by a team effort is that if 1 person does something it will affect the team. If 1 person does bad, the team will take the toll of that 1 person. So if you are going straight into matchmaking with almost no experience, you are most likely going to die a lot, get yelled at, close the game, and never come back. Trust me I should know because that was my first experience with Dota 2. Now what I do recommend you do is either practice by yourself or with friends in an offline bot match. That way if you do bad you don't feel bad for perhaps costing the team the game. Not only is this better, as you keep playing you will learn more and more about the game. Try and find someone that is experienced to help you understand the game and help you progress in skill for it. Once you feel that you are more knowledgeable about the game you can go ahead and do perhaps coop bot and then onto the traditional matchmaking where it is 5v5 team fights. Dota 2 is one my favorite games to date. The fact that I have this gem another chance makes me lucky. Try to follow the tips I provided in this recommendation and I guarantee you that you will not be dissappointed with Dota 2.

review: An evolution of the Defense of the Ancients (a spin off from Warcraft 3). It has the signiture and feel of its predicesor with a much added kick in graphics and almost everything else. The game tries its best to branch out from its older version and I must say, it is succeding with every step it makes. The biggest thing though which separates it greatly from the the old DOTA is the market place and the punishment system, which punishes players for leaving the game unfinished and for being rude to other players. It is this system which separates and cements this game into something of a higher level. The only downside is that you need a gaming computer with high end specs in order to enjoy the game 100 percent. While most first world country won't have any problems with this, players living in third world countries might have an unfair disadvantage when playing online. Overall, the game raises the bar for other games out there in this genre.

review: This game is amazing. It's like crack, but more addictive. The honest truth is that like many MOBA's it takes a little getting used to. If you play bots, or have a friend that will help you through the learning phase, its learning curve isn't that bad. I recommend this to anyone who likes having one game that makes them unreasonably happy, and the very next game makes them suicidal. 10/10 I will play this til they make DotA 3.

review: DOTA > LOL

review: Dota 2 can be tough to get into depending on personal play style, which heroes you start off trying -- took me about a week to find my primary due to the boatloads of heroes available -- and the skill of those you get paired with when you're not playing with friends. It is so very worth it, though. When you're playing a hero you're comfortable with alongside a few good allies even a loss can be exhilaratingly fun as you force your enemy to earn their victory. And of course winning certainly isn't half bad, either. While the nuances of the heroes and whom plays best against whom and where may take a while to sort out, however, the base game is simple to learn. --Runs great even on a laptop. --All heroes playable from the start with new ones added all the time. --Multiple game types provide variety. Tired of the standard "all pick"? Try randomly assigned heroes. Or give "least played" mode a whirl and watch the mayhem play out as you and nine other people all try to play heroes that you don't have the first clue how to use. Prepare to see lots of "oops" and "oh, so THAT's what that does". And "sorry". So, so much "sorry". --Great graphics (especially for the genre). --Music, sound effects and voices get high marks. --Paid items have no effect on gameplay beyond the purely cosmetic. --Pretty much anything that you can buy can be earned for free (at random) from simply playing the game or can be trade for with other players. --Custom huds and announcers can be bought, randomly received after games or traded for to tailor the look and sound of your game to your tastes. What's more, they're shared during matches; If one person in the match owns a given hud or announcer then EVERY person in the match will have access to it for that game. It's not unusual to see nearly a dozen available during a game. --Special holiday game types are always a lot of fun and the developers aren't afraid to really shake things up for them, even adding new ingame items and altering hero abilities. Of course standard matches are still available during these times. --Updates, while very frequent, are usually so small that they rarely take longer than five minutes at most to complete.

review: DOTA 2 was my first introduction to the MOBA genre and I have to say it can be very addicting. Games like Starcraft scared me away from 4X RTS games because of the level of micro-management it requiremed, so I was a bit hesitant to play this game. DOTA 2 however has little to no micro-management depending on the heroes you choose. It provides a wide variety of different play styles for different player preferences. Later I heard about Heroes of Newerth and League of Legends, so I thought I'd try them out. I played a couple games of LOL and knew that it just didn't provide the depth of gameplay I got playing DOTA 2. I quickly uninstalled it. Heroes of Newerth provides the same depth I would say, but the experience just didn't feel as smooth as DOTA 2. Maybe it had something to do with the pacing of the game. After uninstalling HoN, I've never looked back. DOTA 2 is here to stay. I highly recommend playing this game. It's quite fun if you spend a little time to get into it. My advice is to take it slow, learn how to play, and expect to fail a lot in the beginning. Remember, you can't get better at DOTA 2, you can only suck less.

But DOTA is more than that, it is an expierence, momments get insanly tense and make you want to scream in rage, or they will make you so happy you want to jump through the screen and hug that other players. DOTA leads to the most hilaries and rage inducing expierences you will have.

review: What point is there in recommending a free to play game? An interested reader can now simply download the game and dispense with the opinions of stranger. Of course, Dota 2 is not the only game that is free to play, and the genre is rather notorious for its steep learning curve, so this recommendation is intended to answer a a slightly different question: is it worth the time? Largely, yes, but maybe it's better to consider some of the features that might turn the curious player into a fan of the game or not. The process of learning can be rewarding in and of itself. Valve has put a lot of work into breaking down the learning curve into managable pieces, though it is by no means complete. Perhaps the best analogy is with chess: The tutorials and bots will teach you the mechanics of the game, but this only accounts for a very small part of what we generally consider 'knowing chess/Dota'. Of course, much like in Chess, the community has provided guidance and past games to study and consider on the path to mastery. Furthermore, in the relatively brief period of time I have played the game, there have been substantial changes to heroes and the map itself, meaning that the game continues to provide rewards for thinking on your feet instead of rote memorization. This is not to say that certain 'core builds' are irrelevant (they're important, and you can set them up as presets in the game itself or simply use someone else's), only that there are great rewards to be found in understanding *why* those builds are important. For what it is worth, I have found the guides produced by Purge to be a great introduction to thinking about the game, and his conduct during games (usually) serves as a model that the community would do well to follow. Which brings me to the first major stumbling point of Dota. Despite tremendous efforts on Valve's part to keep the toxic elements of the Dota community to a minimum: you will play with extremely unpleasant people who will not make the game fun. There are number of ways this can happen. People can simply have terrible attitudes and do their best to make you feel awful. Put them on mute immediately. But once you get past the initial stages of learning, you'll develop a certain sophistication for play style. I cannot think of a game that has teamwork as a more essential component to it. Games played with strangers are not assured to have the expected level of cohesion and, at low skill levels such as mine, the chances of the mythical 'ideal game of Dota' are vanishingly small. The problem is that this is simply not a matter of 'other people.' You will ruin games for people through not being prepared, or having an off day. You may also find yourself becoming short tempered, or hostile to your teammates due to the frustration of the game. It is uncomfortable to admit how many chat messages have been started in anger, only to be shortly abandoned after a moment's reflection. This could explain the challenge of the Dota community's attitude, but, whatever the causes, it is a factor that an aspiring player will need to deal with. There will be a point where the bots cease to be fun to play against. At that point you will begin playing with people. At that point you will have lots of bad games for reasons of attitude, team composition, or all of the above. *BUT* the games that are good pay off so much more than all those challenges combined and magnified. Even in the dregs of pub games, to hit that magical team that just clicks without needing to be told the basics, or doesn't go for selfish picks in hero selection, is an absolute joy that anyone should get to experience at least once before throwing in the towel. There are incremental rewards as well: being able to view some of your old replays and see how far you've come. Supporting so well that weak carry was still able to snowball and win. Even the realization that, by instinct, you made a tactical decision that meant the difference between an escape or a death, all these things put a little wind in the sails and motivate continued time in the game. Finally, being a Dota player has opened me up into new avenues of entertainment that I simply didn't appreciate before. With events such as The International I can see this game played at the highest skill levels. I finally have a toe hold into being able to appreciate the interest in eSports. More importantly, as a player of the game, I can appreicate the skill in those games to a much greater degree than any other spectator sport. Despite the vast gulf of knowledge and talent between myself (and most players) and professionals, I feel like playing Dota gives me a better understanding of the decisions and plays that are being made in high skilled games, than a better knowledge of skating or puck handling would give me of a professional hockey game. The dynamics of the skill levels are entirely different, but Dota 2 will always have the same mechanics for everyone and the same map, meaning you have the exact same resources (human capital aside) at your disposal as the pros do. In essence, this is only a game I could recommend to someone who was willing to put in the time, tough out the hard times (and there will be hard times. I write this during a time where I'm particularily frustrated with the game and partly to answer the question why I bother for *myself*), and who genuinely finds enjoyment in the process of learning. There is absolutely no shame in not wanting to take up a game that asks this kind of commitment, and the claims of how 'hardcore' a gamer is usually boil down to an individual trying to assert their preferences over the greater population. If you don't have the time, if you don't feel particularily thick skinned, if you don't like the idea of 'working' at a game, then I do not recommend Dota 2. But for those who find value in the journey, fire up the download and start playing.

review: Dota 2 is a low pace MOBAs at the beginning of the game, and progresses on to a faster pace haveing you know that you can get killed by a riki at anytime. There are many charaters of dota 2. Over 75 acutally, then these 75 are split into three groups. Intelligent(s), Strengh(s),and Aglilty(s). You can either pick top lane, middle lane, or bottom lane. top lane is know as the hard lane aka try not to day at all lane. middle is a fast lane that you fight for (your lane) but you can a exp/gold adventage, then bottem lane. You then have the easy lane to get away from a gank or can pull a camp and have the enemy closer to your tower. overall i think i can give the game a 9.5 out of 10

review: Pros: With 100ish heroes and a massive range of items this game will keep you playing for hours trying to discover the best combination of items for each hero, the best combinations of complimentary heroes for a team and to uncover stacks of aesthetic items to win. There are different game types to allow for practice with bots, ranked matches for more skilled players and tournaments for full teams who wish to compete. When you get a good team the atmosphere is really good and victories feel like a real achievement. As well as the standard game types there are often updates to bring players seasonal game types such as Frostivus around Christmas. It has a simple interface which makes controlling your character and communicating with other players easy without compromising control of either when multitasking. As for graphics, you can play the game on a very standard computer at low graphics without losing any of the experience and at high graphics it is visually pleasing but just as good. Unlike many other multiplayer games you can only buy aesthetic items from the shop using real world money. This prevents people with stacks of cash boosting themselves to become the best players based on cash and not skill (a common complaint in MMORPGs and other platforms). Cons: As with any massively multiplayer game there are many cons, these mostly revolve around the players. When finding a match you are given the option to set a language preference so you can speak with people who understand you. This function is next to useless. I have played over 300 matches and I'd say only about 100 of those were with a team of people who spoke English well enough (when specifying English in the language preference) to lay out or understand complex tactics. There are designated keys for simple commands to try and overcome the language barrier but this is often not enough for skilled players. Next is the reporting function. While you only receive a penalty for multiple reports, it is often the case that petty people will report you for winning games or simply for killing them. As far as I know these reports are not checked by moderators or not to a high standard because I've been perfectly polite and ended up being thrown in the sin bin (Low priority matchmaking) for having a winning streak. The matchmaking system is highly frustrating, it is not based on skill (some say this is a good thing... but it REALLY isn't) so if you have one bad person on your team it brings the entire team down. The servers are always crashing in some way, shape or form which can continue for days. Finally, there are a great number and variety of people who play DOTA. I'd like to say that most of these people are good natured but I have very often experienced people making comments of a nationalist, racist, biggoted, childish (etc) nature towards other players. Everything from "go and kill yourself" to "I had your Mum last night". It's a keyboard warrior dominated world to say the least. Conclusion: It's a really good game worth hours of fun and defintely worth downloading because it's free (can't complain too much about game/server faults with it being free as they do get fixed). BUT the community are mostly unforgiving, cruel and will flame you if you're not up to par (that's if you can understand what they're saying). If you're unable to ignore people when they're being vicious then get real life friends to join you. Otherwise avoid like the plague as the frustration will give you an aneurism.

review: Dota 2 is a MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) title developed by Valve and Icefrog, the creator of the original Warcraft III mod from which this game was based. Dota plays like a RTS (real time strategy) that pits two teams of five players against each other: each player can choose from a large pool of playable heroes, each with his/her own primary stat, role and gameplay. A match of Dota 2 revolves around both destroying all the enemy buildings, exspecially the huge and sturdy ancient in the very end of each base, and killing off non playable units and other players in order to gain experience to acquire new abilities or improve the ones already gained or the stats and gold to buy powerful pieces of equipment in order to make the various heroes even more deadly Dota 2 is a rather complex videogame: being a successful player involves around having a good knowledge of the various heroes abilities, how to react quickly to various events and how to plan ahead in order not to give the enemy team too much of an advantage. Each match is rather unique and unpredictable, with comebacks being very rare, but possible nevertheless Dota 2 is rather infamous for its playerbase, which is arguably the most rude, angry and elitist wannabe I've ever seen. Expect the other players to quickly point out your mistakes, sput insults and menaces at you for percived errors and get upset at you for not following what each team mate believe you should do at any given second of the match. It's also worth mentioning that the in-game report system that Valve designed in order to isolate the most unbereable members of the community rarely works, and it's instead used by rude players in order to silence or just plain sabotage other players they disagree with. Another great issue is that, while Dota 2 features language specific servers, most players won't join the proper servers, but will instead opt to join all the servers available and get mad at other people if they don't speak their native language. Russians players have become quite infamous for such practice If you can manage to stand tall of all the abuse described above, Dota 2 can reveal itself to be quite the interesting experience and generally a good multiplayer game to play

But other than the occasional russian death threats you will find yourself in one of the worst game communities in the world. Which happens to be in one of the most adicting and entertaining games of all time.
