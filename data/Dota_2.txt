review: Dota 2, where do I start. This game has ruined my social life, I spend every day on this game, training, waiting, and drinking through my mountain dew, to one day become the greatest. My father said to me, "Son, you will never be dondo." I said to my father, "Dad, I mid, or I feed." My dad dropped to the ground in tears, screaming at the all mighty gabe newell, begging for his son back, but it was too late, I was already back on dota, at mid, blaming my team for sucking This game is why I wake up, Why I masturbate, why I decide that masturbating while playing is a good idea. Thank you for such an amazing game, without this game I would have nothing to get mad at when I am rock solid.

review: When I first started DOTA2 I was a little overwhelmed, as my first ARTS/MOBA game it was pretty complicated. I soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying. Before I knew it, I was performing  and better. I stopped making silly  and  got vastly better at not  the enemy . For the  part, everyone I've met was very helpful and , there  the   however. As  - play DOTA2    ,  ,     .      !

review: I originally played Dota when it was merely a UMS on WC3, so take this review for what it's worth. Dota 2 is an addictive experience; however, this game also draws a player base from the bottom of society. If that statement is an insufficient description of the game, continue reading. This game is not for the casual gamer, this game is for those who have the capability to log in hundreds of hours into a game. If you play this game, I can attest that there will be times you love it and times you just want to break your monitor with your keyboard. I have a few hundred hours into the game and no matter how long you play, no matter what you do, you will encounter someone who will complain about something you're doing poorly or not doing correctly and it may ruin the gameplay for you. I can only recommend this game if you have thick skin or you have friends to play with. So here are what I consider the pros and cons of the game: Pros -This is a very intricate strategy based game that relies heavily on teamwork and timing. -Free to play with optional cosmetic costs. -Gameplay always varies due to each individual hero selection. This, in effect, increases replayability tremendously. -Wonderful voice actors with interesting dialogue choices by the developer. -Winning matches in this game often triggers the release of dopamine in the reward center in your brain creating the desire to play more. This in effect causes players to really want to win and may be the trigger of many cons of the game. Cons -This game has a steep learning curve, believe me, there is way more to this game than you might think at first glance. Unlike hero customization in League of legends, not all heroes are created equal and not all ward placements are either. It can be a little intimidating to think that your team is already at a disadvantage from the hero selection, but thus is DOTA. -Secondary to the steep learning curve, games tend to be won or lost by the actions of an individual on either team. This can be ameliorated by steam implementing some sort of "fundamentals of gameplay" video instead of the current lackadaisical tutorial they have. Suffice to say, many new players do not understand that every time their hero is killed by the opposing team, the player loses gold and the other team gains gold. This doubles the impact that each individual has for gameplay. -Unlike other video game developers, Steam does not region lock. This brings about an unforeseen consequence where individuals from any country can join any server despite having a language preference. You can imagine how difficult it is to create a coordinated cohesive team push when there's a Russian only speaker, Spanish only speaker and a Portuguese only speaker on the US WEST server. -Blame is a word that is thrown around in this game like the word inequality is thrown around in America. Unfortunately, this is by far the worst aspect of the game. The game community has very little to no interaction prior to gameplay or thereafter and there is no review conversation on what an individual can do to improve in the future. More often than not, an individual will oversimplify the ongoing team loss to 1 action by 1 individual because of time constraints and heated emotions. -There is no team forfeit vote option in game and often you are sitting there for 10-20 minutes as the other team wastes your time despite securing a victory much earlier. This review is from personal experience and your gameplay may vary. Of course, if you do meet someone ingame who is a decent person, be sure to commend them at the end of the match for their ingame courtesy. Final Rating: -Game 9/10 -Game community 3/10

Sorry in advance There once was a man named zeus His team put him mid on the loose He could totally  But had no escape and so he got ganked like a moose One time Pugna I tried to play But forgot that there is no way To get more than five health Without massive wealth And bounty hunter stuck his peepee in my bum over and over and over and I cried Sometimes if there is a dragon You need to purchase a dagon And then you go ZAP And all 'cross the map People made the excuse they were laggin' Nyx nyxnyx nyx nyxnyx nyx Nyxnyx nyx nyxnyx nyx nyx nyx Nyx nyx nyx nyx Nyx nyx nyx nyx nyx Nyxnyx nyx nyxnyx nyx nyx nyx There once was a brave little feller Who wanted to be the best speller But he was russian And people are 's So now he lives in a cellar There once was a brave little a bear Who smoked into Roshan's lair So hard he tried But he got bashed and died And now his team is giving him the glare If you play dota beware Because it's sometimes a pit of dispair Advice you will heed But your teem will still feed And then you will switch to solitair So I just wasted a solid 25 minutes making jenky limericks about dota...

review: I've always wanted to go to Russia. To learn the culture, eat and drink and see the sights. But I cannot do that, as it is expensive and I'm busy doing my uni work. But then I found Dota 2. This free learning course teaches you all about Russians and their culture. I can even speak decent Russian! However, these Russian people can get quite angry and annoying. They often shout the phrase "" and bring you to the depths of insanity. I got forced to drink my sorrows away during the beginning of the course, but it was worth it in the end. If you don't have the time and money to travel to Russia, I'd suggest you pick up Dota 2. A fantastic learning resource. 8/10

Whisk flour, salt, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Add vegetable shortening and work into flour mixture using a pastry cutter until it resembles coarse crumbs. 2. Form a well in the middle of flour mixture and mix in hot water. Work flour and water mixture together with a fork and transfer to a cutting board. 3.

review: There is fine line between bravery and stupidity - Juggernaut. Going into DotA 2 is crossing this line. You've got to be brave to even consider playing it in the first place. If you stay here longer than 2 hours, then I'm sorry but you're stupid. So am I. Because this game, as enraging it can be, is also really enjoyable experience. If you want to be constantly surprised by game, developers and other players, and there is inner drive of self-improvement in you it's game for you. Even if, at the end of the day, you suspect yourself of masochistic tendencies, just try it.

review: Dota 2 is sequel to critically acclaimed hat trading sim, Team Fortress 2. What Valve has managed to do with hats is astounding. They've improved upon everything that the original had to offer, and then they kicked it up a notch. Imagine a world where everyone and every thing has a hat. Now imagine that you can become THAT hat. You are the weapon, you are the bullet, you are the sword edge. That's immersion on a new level. Never before has an experience been this good. I recommend this to anyone who has ever, or will ever dream of hat, hats, or hat accesories. If you haven't yet, you need to experience this. Go do it. Now. 11/10 Hats, it's alright.

I especially enjoy it when super awesome pro players stream the games to twitch and say that their 5 viewers are laughing at me. Classic banter. Every now and then I'll give back some playful jabs but I'm not very imaginative. My favourite lines are "i'll wear your skin kunt" and "your whorsish mother will taste your  blood tonight stain" Classic banter

review: Dota 2 is quickly becoming the most played game on Steam, and for good reason. The blend of well-balanced multiplayer, infinite replayability, gorgeous aesthetics, and the time and care Valve has put in to support the community is a recipe for perfection. I simply cannot reccomend Dota 2 enough. The game boasts a roster of over a hundred heroes, and each one feels unique and well-designed. In any given match, you take control of a singular hero, and victory or defeat hinges not only on how well you play that hero, but how also on how well you synergize with your five person team. Unfortunately, the barrier of entry is high. Quite a lot of research, preparation, and knowledge is required to be sucessful, and it can be frustrating losing repeatedly. However, tutorials are available to guide new players, and the time spent learning only adds to the satisfaction of landing a five-man Black Hole or pulling off that perfect Blink-Poof combo. Spectacularly enough, the battlefield is not the only area where the game shines. Dota TV is an in-game spectator mode that allows the option to watch professional teams play in tournaments, including the multi-million dollar International that Valve hosts on a yearly basis. And all of this for free. There are cosmetic items that can be used to customize your favorite hero, however nothing availble changes gameplay in any way. They are mostly designed by members of the community and can be purchased or recieved randomly while playing. Content patches and new heroes are being added all the time. Dota 2 will continue to grow for years, hopefully continuing to find new players interested in a fast-paced online multiplayer experience that is equal parts exhilirating and engaging.

LoL has childish names like Blue Team, Red Team, Minions, Turrets and Inhibitors. Not to mention all the champion names are like that too. Its targeted at 4-9 year olds that recently quit runescape and want a DirectX9 game because their computer is too wooden. These days, easy games attracts NOOBS. Many LoL players used to play Dota but they got wrecked too hard, so they just play LoL, therefore the all the worlds worst gamers are addicted to this no brainer game. Same reason goes why Dota TI players OWN in ranked LoL, but LoL Worlds players cannot even survive in unranked Dota. The gap for the skill requirements for these 2 games is simply uncomparable. Simply amazing how Riot earns millions of $$$$$$$ yet still can't keep their servers functioning. The time it takes to download and install Dota2 is about the same as the time to update LoL. Its true that its a selfish company created for REVENUE ONLY. WTF is $10 for a NAME CHANGE? WTF is $20 for a server transfer? I ALMOST FEEL SORRY FOR LOL PLAYERS GETTING THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY STOLEN BY A TRASH COMPANY THAT EMPLOYS STAFF THAT USES THEIR SERVERS TO TOAST MARSHMELLOWS

review: great game if you hate having fun. the anti-fun levels of this game are the highest i've ever seen. if you like having fun or being happy, stay well away. this is a game made for people who like having their bum smacked by a girl and being told to enjoy it. the voice acting is pretty good as well. -- EDIT: by special request, i'm going to tell you how to find little nuggets of fun in this game that will improve your gameplay experience if you decide to try this game. -ignore your grumpy teammates and use your abilities and items when you want to. -stay away from tryhard meganerd modes like captains* and play fun gamemodes like diretide. -if you see any weird letters like  or that one that looks like a 6, MUTE everybody on both teams and stay on the lookout for opportunities to have fun. -never queue for matchmaking without a good friend. things that are NOT fun and you SHOULD NOT do if you like fun -buy wards when you have no spare money -pick dumb heroes with lots of buttons like chen -listen to grumpy teammates i hope this has helped you to get more fun out of valve's Dota 2. please mark this review as helpful if it has helped.

review: I guess I have to review this game because I've banked so many hours into it. I'll keep it brief. Dota 2 is probably the most frustrating game ever created. Your team will let you down constantly, the enemy team will consistently pick the heroes you hate playing against the most, you will never get the hat drops you want, and your own mind and body will frequently betray you and make you contend with the fact that you are not nearly as good as you think you are (or, more likely, force you to live in a fantasy dream world where you are as good as you think you are and just blame your teammates some more). It'll turn you into a monster and destroy your life. It'll murder your loved ones and feed them to you. But you'll play it anyway. You'll ragequit and uninstall and stare at your library of games as the creeping realization sweeps over you that you not playing Dota 2 will not effect the universe in even the smallest way, will have no conceivable effect on anything. You will be filled with a sudden dread that nothing you do matters and life has no meaning. Basically the same feeling you get when you play Dota 2. And Dota 2 will be your only distraction from this dessicated husk of a life. So the next day you'll find yourself drawn back into it like a moth to a flame, staving off the moment when you'll have to face your demons for as long as you can. You will probably die alone some day and nobody will remember how high your MMR was or your sunstrike accuracy. So what are you waiting for, you worthless peons?! Get out there and dance! DANCE FOR THE PUPPETMASTER GABE! GO EARN YOUR HATS, YOU CRAVEN MONGRELS! 0/10 would not recommend to anyone but can't stop playing and won't be able to stop you either.

review: Support died because trying to save carry. Carry: "Please no feed, support." Carry: "0/7 lol, noob" Neither they know, support stunned the enemies for their kill, slow them, silence them. All for them. Support is the guy who is behind the carry, doing stuffs. Without a support, where will be the courrier and the wards be? Support is love, support is life.

review: At first I thought this game was pretty good, but that was until the first time I was called a "feeder". Dota 2 is basically a game based around teamwork, except the community only does three things. 1. Call each other f*gs and berate one another for slightly foolish decisions. 2. Do solo farm and try to win the match by themselves (which never works, ESPECIALLY if they are playing against a team of 5 players in a party, also known as a five stack.) 3. Make fun of, and ruin everything for, new players. If you want to learn how to play Dota 2, you either need a really good guide, or a good friend who has more than 500 hours into the game. The tutorial just teaches you the basics. No, you can't learn by yourself by playing matchmaking with random people. All you'll learn from the other players is that you suck because you're new and don't understand any of the tactics, and that the best course of action would be to uninstall. There's also the fact that some people create new Steam accounts so they can be matched up against newbies and annihilate everyone. Also, this game stole all my friends. We used to play other games, now they play nothing other than Dota 2 and one of them has spent $40 in the game... ON SKINS! COSMETIC ITEMS THAT ADD NOTHING TO THE GAMEPLAY! YOU CAN BUY SOME OF THE BEST GAMES ON STEAM FOR LESS, I REPEATE, LESS THAN $40! AND THEN HE TOLD ME HE ONLY PLAYS DOTA BECAUSE HE CAN'T AFFORD ANY GAMES ON STEAM!!! So there. Terrible community, steals your friends, incredibly addictive if let it be. Don't touch this game. I spent way too much time hating myself while playing this. Never again. EDIT: 172 people read this review. Wow. Also, I have to say, I think the in-game tutorials are better than the actual game, because the actual game has only one map, unlike the tutorials. I know this is pretty standard for MOBA games, but for me this contributes greatly to actually ruining variety and fun in the gameplay. It's just all the same tactics over and over on the same map. This doesn't only mean less variety, but it also means that veterans will know the game just that much better. On another note, this game is like the opposite of everything I like about TF2. Unbalanced classes (According to Google, every Dota hero/champion/class/whatever the hell is overpowered), only A SINGLE MAP, relies too much on teamwork when it's hard to find online (whereas TF2 benefits from teamwork, but still, it's not the key to winning a game, and it's much easier to achieve teamwork, because TF2 doesn't rely NEARLY as hard on your early-game. The early-game in Dota literally either makes or breaks the whole game for you, setting the outcome of the match in stone almost literally during the first ten minutes of the game.), and also, a horrible community. Not saying TF2's community is good, but hell, it's miles above Dota. Don't really know why I am comparing this game to TF2, maybe because Valve made both games, but still, just wanted to throw out there some actual criticisms about the game itself and not the community. Now, some people have been telling me "Pfft, just block the trash talkers". That doesn't change anything. They're still horrible at teamwork, which, like I said, is the entire point of the game. And if you block them, you can't coordinate with them. Basically, it's not only a bad game for new players because you suck, it's also a bad game for new players because everyone else sucks. Except for Koreans, whenever you see one in a game, bam, you already know his team has won. Overall, I think Dota, nay, the whole MOBA genre, has great potential, but it's just too bad I've yet to see any game in the genre actually achieve to fulfill it.

review: Dota 2 is a very highly skilled game, don't expect to walk in and expect you being very good. You are going to die alot and probably yell at your team mates but that's just the nature of this game. Dota 2 takes place in an arena where you will fight to destory the enemies Anicent if you destory it; you win. The Ancient is protected by 11 stuctures called towers that protect it. Each of these towers are found in each of the three lanes bottom, middle and top. You take control of a unit that is a hero, many of them are diverse and have a lot of pros and cons such as Crystal Maiden who is really good at locking down heros early game with her stun but she is also the slowest hero in the game. You are accompanied by 4 other players including yourself to fight against another 5 players. You need to push lanes to be able to destory the enemy towers in each lane but the catch is the enemy team is doing the same thing, so you need to not only push to your victory but to stop the enemy team from pushing aswell. There is 107 heros in Dota 2 out of the 112 heroes that are in the Warcraft III. They are categorised into 3 groups. Strenght, which are usually the tanky guys. Agility, most carries are found in this category and Intelligence which most of the supports are usually found. All these heroes have different skill levels, such as Invoker who is an intelligence hero with 14 spells. He is able to create spells with 4 of his spells, creating the other 10. He is able to create tornados which disable enemies, meteors which looks epic and burns enemies that stand in front of it. Just an all round crazy hero. Viper is arguably the easiest hero which as 2 passive spells (Passive spells are spells that work all the time, you don't need to activate them) and 2 other spells which are targetable. You can customise your Dota experience with annoucer packs which change the voice of the annoucer which include Glados and the narrator from the Stanley Parable. You can change your HUD to different themes. The game allows you to buy tickets where you can support tournments, some of these tournments allowing you to directly contribute to the prize pool. Most of the time it is 25%. In 2014, The International is a annual tournment created by Valve for Dota 2. In 2014, the prize pool for this tournment became 10.9M dollars. First place got 5M dollars! If you are into ESports then this game will be up your ally. Dota 2 is a hard game, but if you look in the right places you are able to learn a lot, if you aren't sure you want to play this game, you can PM me and I can teach you how to play. I honestly don't mind.

review: This is yet another new release by the company "MOBA" (you may know this company from their popular games such as League of Legends, Dead island Epidemic and Dawngate). This is a very slow paced first person shooter set in the age after the 3rd great war in which humanity has been set back in the ages where magic was still okay to use, in this game you play as an ex soldier trying to defeat the main communist overlord "sniper" who threatens america as we know it. The single player aspect of this game is probably the best experience you'll have in this game as the online is currently dead, the developers stopped updating this game after league of legends was confirmed to be more balanced and a hell of a lot better. They did however unlock a new game mode called "Compendium" in which you simulate reading a book and collect trading cards. I'll give this game 3 meepos out of 5, it's okay but the fact that you're required to be able to speak russian to get this game really lets it down.

review: First twenty hours playing this game, got called NOOB for so many times that i went down to my basement and cried daily Second twenty hours playing this game, joined others and called the new guy 'NOOB' to avoid being called 'NOOB' Third twenty hours playing this, I finally got the courage to call others 'NOOB' all by myself Fourth twenty hours playing this game, I finally became mature enough to stop with all the NOOB bs and started to give advice to the other players from atop my mighty throne Overall, DOTA 2 is an addictive, competitive MMO whose community precedes its reputation, almost everyone is downright selfish, everyone only wants more kills to sate their hunger for commendations, which they even beg for. The trick to enjoying it though ? start playing with friends or people you know, make a plan, help your teammates, and CHOOSE A SUPPORT IF YOU SEE THERE ARE NONE ! and reach level 13 and you can play ranked matches, where the people are not much friendlier but will at least help you out. EDIT: oh and always remember to uncheck 'Russia' when selecting servers why ? no reason, just thought i should say that ^^ GODLIKE GAME ! someone kill it (you will get this reference after playing the game)

review: DOTA 2 is the best in the MOBA class. I've played LoL, DOTA and some lesser known MOBAs and DOTA 2 is by far the best. In addition, it is F2P which is amazing. Unlike LoL or HoN which require you to use a rotating hero list until you buy your own with real money or accumulate enough in-game currency to buy a single hero, DOTA 2 immediately gives you access to its entire library of heroes, for free. The only paid content are cosmetical items that do not change gameplay. Graphics are great. Gameplay is great. Crashes are very minimal. ITS FREE.

review: Dota 2 is the semi-sequel/remake/re-release/evolution of the long-running WarCraft 3 mod Defense of the Ancients, which in itself was based on a custom map for StarCraft called Aeons of Strife. After the release of the original Dota map in 2003, the WarCraft 3 community began producing a long line of Dota spin-offs, sequels and mods (just as Eul, Dota's creator, had used AoS as inspiration for Dota itself), which culminated in the release of DotA: Allstars by Steve "Guinsoo" Feak. Allstars would become the most dominant and consistently updated version of all the Dota maps and mods. In 2005, Guinsoo passed the torch to the enigmatic IceFrog, who has been supporting, updating, and shaping Dota ever since. His changes have been the most significant, the most popular (the mod grew more during his time than ever before), and arguably have benefited and enriched Dota as a whole. By 2010, DotA: Allstars became simply DotA, and IceFrog was showing no signs of stopping. Later that year, Dota 2 was formally announced (with its development spear-headed by both IceFrog and Eul, both of its most important "authors"; its past and present, alike), entered a semi-closed beta in late 2011, and was finally officially released in mid-2013... and the rest is history. History lessons aside, Dota 2 is a game of uncompromising depth and complexity. Though its gameplay intricacies can appear opaque, arbitrary and incomprehensible at first sight, the way these expansive game mechanics interact with one another when exposed to the element of player imperfection is truly remarkable: over a hundred heroes, each with at least four spell-based abilities and all capable of using up to six magical items, from a massive arsenal of over a hundred. Games can last anywhere from 25 to 55 minutes, and possibly far more! Dota's metagame is constantly shifting, and as of writing the game and mod are at total parity through version 6.80, released earlier this year. On top of that, it is completely free to play, with no features locked out to any players whatsoever. Not even cosmetic items, which form the backbone of the game's vast micro-transaction-based economy: these items are freely distributed by Valve to all players through level-based gift drops and random-chance item drops. Free game updates alter the game balance significantly, while introducing new seasonal game modes, and far more. And that's not even scratching the surface of the game's competitive scene, with its many tournaments, its constantly evolving teams and its own storylines, all leading up to the annual Valve-organized grand championship: The International. It may be incredibly difficult and frustrating at first, but given time, patience, simple memory and a keen mind, anyone can ultimately come to see Dota as perhaps the most enjoyable, enthralling and captivating game experience ever conceived. Oh, and it's

review: the game itself is good, had a lot of fun. But the problem with this game is that u are too much dependable on the people u get with you in matchmaking. Apparantly you have too much people who want to play carry, and then fail at it, what results in a waste of time. It usually starts already a hero selection. People don't communicate, only play what they want to play and usually lacks of teamplay when the game is busy. Too bad, because the game itself is good, the community is for 80% flamers, egotrippers, wannabe carry players, very rude

review: Valve is afraid some fat kid might commit suicide for being called a noob. And with this horribly broken matchmaking I see no sane reason to play this game anytime soon. And because Icefrog and the his devs ignorance about the EU servers turning to s'hit because of russians, who select english on purpose because their own servers on East is unbrearable with the horrible people who mostly feed and rage in their games, talking smack all the time. Now don't misunderstand, this is a great game with huge potential. But the truth of it is it's rotten from the bad matchmaking and somewhat horrid and lack of brain community. Main reasons not to play this game goes undisputed as follows: 1# Russians ruining games, talking russian when they clearly selected english as the preferred language. In case anyone hasn't noticed dota is a team game. 2# Solo queue has been removed(this means that you can be matched against an enemy 5 stack when you are playing alone) 3# No real community Q&A support from developers, and complete ignorance on the game dev forum, mods deleting posts that's not deemed "worthy" even though there is issues surrounding the topics. 4# Ranked is viritually a joke in comparison to normal MM, the only difference is a number for self gratification purposes, It viritually means nothing when most MMR's you are still playing with complete '. 5# Broken Solo-Queue. At times, matches you whether you are alone or 2 players playing together, you will often or not(depending on your luck) you will be matched with an enemy full 5 man team communicating in game, while your team is just 2+2+1 or just all solo players. This creates a huge disadvantage at the start of the match. Now Valve, has it ever occured to you in the small strains left of what corporate moral fiber you have that you should fix Dota 2's blatant community issues? Is this really how you get out of your responsibilities by ignoring and deleting users expressing concern in a non-inflammatory way? It's shameful considering how much of a profit you're making on it. At least you'd have the dignity to give us something back no? I've personally almost quit this game two times because I can't handle the community and players I am matched with constantly, they don't speak my language, share my mindset or my skill level the least, except an actual good match on some occations. Which leaves me with a horrible experience most of the time.

It's a incredibly deep game which intergrates complex gameplay and mechanics, its a very popular game when you notice the international competitive scene. however be warned that this game has a steep learning curve and I still consider myself a casual gamer type for this game and as most multiplayer game, you will encounter abrasive players in the community which could ruin the experience, though that can bes fixed by muting or reporting the player(s).

review: Dota 2 is one of if not the most frustrating and aggravating game ever created. Your teammates will cater the enemy team, not back you up, and refuse to call missings or place wards. The enemy team will always pick combos or  heroes that will make you want to immediately leave the game while your teammates pick 4 carrys after you randomed Phantom Assassin and tell you to buy the wards. Every other game you will get a Russian Pudge picker that feeds 3 kills mid in 5 minutes and immediately ruins all the work you've done last hitting every creep and harassing the enemy out of lane. You'll rage and call "GG" early and trash talk your teammates but you'll still keep playing in hope that the game will turn around. As things start to finally look good, you get bashed 5 times in a row by a faceless void or the Ogre Magi will get a 4x multi-cast on you 2 times in a row while the Nature's prophet is pushing your top barracks. But after all the rage inducing pain, you keep playing. You suffer through it for the chance of that amazing, satisfying comeback even though you're 20,000 gold behind the enemy team. Only to have your dreams crushed when the enemy team finally kills your ancient. But you still keep playing due to the feeling you get when you get that rampage that allows you to push to victory. Even so, after the game you'll still rage because of the common chest you get as a reward for your 60 minutes of pain and suffering. When you finally get that mythical you've always wanted, valve will come out with an event that lowers the price and makes it almost worthless. It's a drug that once hooked to, is almost impossible to break. You almost don't even realize you're raging and forget that you're telling your best friend how much of a feeding  he is and how this lost game is because of him when you're the one who has 1 kill and 13 deaths. You keep playing in hope that you'll get good enough where you'll be able to play with Dendi or the other pros and you know that'll most likely never happen but you keep playing in hope of it happening one day. I would not wish this addiction on my worst enemy. But I can't stop you, nor can I stop playing myself.

review: I have been a gamer for my whole life, but I never really put a ton of time into any one game. In the early 2000s, when I had a lot of free time, Quake 3, Elite Force, Jedi Knight 2, et cetra all took up a ton of my time; but as my age progressed, I had less time to dedicate to gaming. Mass Effect 1 and 2 both took about 100 hours away from me; but that was probably the most I'd invested in many years. I currently have around 500 hours of Dota 2, and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. The gameplay is spectacular, the community is great (I have made more Steam friends on this game than any other), the meta is interesting, the professional scene is a blast to watch, and the game is extremely well supported - especially with the recent Wraith Night/Legion Commander content update. The thing is that I'm not great at Dota 2. I've put almost 500 hours in, and there's still more for me to learn - there are still some heroes I have yet to play! It is a lot of investment, but once you 'get' it, you will have an absolute blast. EDIT: Just updating this now that I've put around 1600 hours in. I still completely stand by everything that I said previously. The game is super fun, and I'm really enjoying playing with all of the friends I've made in it. I've also experienced some of the negative parts of the community, and they're unfortunate; but I must say that they are far and few between. The community is largely welcoming, and I've made some fantastic friends through it - ones I hang out with in real life now. Definitely play the game, the learning curve is steep but entirely worth it.

review: After playing 1.500 hours (like there is 200 on the 2nd one) I have finally quit this game. Here is the reasons. 1)Broken stupid  meta , icefrog's nerfs and buffs. First of all the guy who makes all the balancing things doesn't even play the game itself. IF a hero gets picked too much in the pro scene , icefrog will nerf the  out of that hero and make it unplayable (Exp:Ember Spirit). Or he just buffs a hero like Riki since the day he came in Dota 2 (Riki is generally easy to counter in high skill pubs but he wrecks the  out of new players) and nerf a hero like Crystal Maiden both nerfing her damage movespeed etc. 2)THE ING COMMUNITY+MATCHMAKING (+Russians on English Lang.) AND RANKED Aaand here we are at the best part of Dota , the community... It is filled with immature kids who will rage at you and say stupid  like ''omfg u so noob'' ''learn2play feggit'' ''y u use midas on big creep'' , it's literally cancer for someone sensitive aganist stupidity . Believe me after spending hours and hours inside those people you will slowly become one of them or atleast it will cause depression + anger issues. Ranked system of Dota is just simply broken. There is no difference between a 3.5k player and a 1k player , it is all the same. The points are just there so some  can brag about his non existent 6k mmr lie.(Hell i typed a comment under a vid related to Dota some guy just came in and said he had 6k and you are a ing noob you should kill myself omfg) And the public matchmaking, slightly better than ranked a little bit because 1 out of a KAJILLION BILLION CHANCE you can actually meet with people who are funny and nice to play with (i made a lot of friends like this) but believe me most of the time you pick EU server with ENG language you will get Russians who farm Dagon on CM in hardlane and never communicate with you. You will slightly learn Russian because these guys never speak English even if they know it and since they love to scream in mic (like idi nahuy pidor  blyat padaroshnik pizdec bla bla bla...) you will instantly learn MOTTHEEERR RRRRUSSIA ACCENT.+Either you will get (Not being racist here , but Dota really does make you racist) Esta muerto mexican fellas , Spanish people on American server (or Russians with 9000 ping). Btw don't ever write guides like I did. I innocently wanted to help the other new players with a few guides about the heroes I know really well. Some Armenian kid called me a  with his poor English. (For telling people to use Midas on the big creep in jungle camps to get a level advantage) 3)Lastly (Because i dont need to say anything more why this game is so piece of ) the ing effects on you... Why do you even want to play this game , it is like eating an apple with 4000 worms inside. Anyways arguing with a Dota player made me realise that this game completely destroys your social life and your ability to think, go try it yourself try to say something opposite to these s... (There is a big ''real life'' world for you to discover out here. Get a hobby instead of playing this.) So im done please never ever ever start playing this game.

review: An accurate representation of pubbing in this game would be to imagine yourself trapped in a sewer swimming around eating nothing but turds your entire life, each turd represents an average public game. Now imagine after all of those turds you go to eat the another one and to your surpise it is a chocolate bar, it is the best feeling in the world. That chocolate bar represents those occasional games where everyone is evenly skilled and tastes so good that you continue eating turds just hoping for that next chocolate bar.

review: I really can't say anything other then this game is ing amazing. Look at all the hours I've spent in the game. You all are probably like "well, there are these people who have spent thousands of hours in the game, so that's not many." But do take into account that my total time owning this game hasn't even exceeded a year yet. There is not a day I remember since I got this game that I haven't at least opened DOTA 2. Usually to play a public game, sometimes to play a bot game, and sometimes to brush up on hero knowledge and look at guides. This game will ruin your life and obliterate all your free time. My only warning to new players is that the community it pretty toxic to new players, and not everyone speaks english. Just mute anyone calling you a noob, flaming you, etc. But never do so to the people that legitimately want to help you. Overall Rating: 11.6/10.

review: Hello everybody. First I would like to introduce myself :) . OK my name is etro, who has a hobby of playing a lot of games like skyrim, minecraft,pokemon, and etc. OK here's the point when I played dota 1, the first try of the game was hard and I really can't understand it very much. The moment I played dota 2 , that's how I realize and understands the game so the thing that I'am saying dota2 or valve can explain better than dota 1 (no offense , ice frog) so I would gladly recommend playing dota2 than dota 1 for the first try of the game :). Others say that dota 2 is not a good game or a bad game (well we all have our opinions :) ). For me it's the best game of all the time :D. I respect the Lol (league of legends) players. Even though they are saying that dota 2 sucks. Here in my country (philippines) many Filipinos say that they like Lol better. But I really don't get their point I mean (no offense to the Lol makers and producers) but Lol kinda copied dota 1 ( I don't even know if Lol have their permissions or paid icefrog for copying the main idea of dota) but valve paid icefrog for dota 2 so it means valve have their license while Lol doesn't have. I don't really know guys if Lol really have their permissions or paid icefrog. But I think they didn't ask for permissions or paid ( if im mistaken please correct me or you can just tell me to remove this review. And im sorry if im mistaken that Lol really have their permissions or paid icefrog.but i really think they didnt. Well the real point in this paragraph is I will play or follow the one who have permmisions or paid and that is dota 2 or (valve). If your noob or getting annoyed it's OK cause we all started like noobs :) and just ignore the people who are saying that you're noob,stupid,idiot, they will just annoy you and they have no hearts (they are monsters). Anyway for them to easily ignored just press the heroes panel at the upper left of the screen. In there you can see a speaker's icon then press it and wahhla you muted the player you chossed. I hope this really helped you guys :) OK thank you guys for reading my review with this game. I hope you recommend this :) bye.

review: DOTA 2 is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, that adopted most of its mechanics from the original DOTA Mod of Warcraft 3. Now, let's come to some of its features: - --> Once you understand the basics, and become good at the game (oh wait, everyone of us is a noob) , you will soon have a huge backlog of other games. :P --> Basically hat simulator. --> Can cause rage, anxiety and affect your mental state. (too many , griefers) --> You make 1000 good moves in a game, and you won't be recognized. Go feed once and get reported. --> You will start putting aside other priorities. Ty Dota2. --> To sum it up, it has a  community like most other MOBAs, unless you are insanely good at the game. 10/10 Recommended! Best game ever played!

Fourth : most people come in game only for curse to you and your family and not more. Sixth : all people ever fight with russian , some of russian really good play and some of them really bad play but this right to whole of people not only russian. and finally : if i tell you dont play you motivated to play, then when you start to playing dota : after 3 month play you only play for having more rank and not fun after 5 month you only play for trade not game after 6 month you come as a pro robber in trade and curse to russian for no reasons and only play to tell other people your so pro players. :) really if you want to play , play this game as a game not more 3 hrs in week so enough. Dont west your time on internet gaming, pay your times on your job :) and for understanding who you are. Good Luck in Your Real life, sorry because my bad en language.

review: Dota or Defense of the Ancients, was the first of its kind, and originally started off as a Warcraft 3 custom map but it quickly grew to become one of the most popular games in the world as well as spawning a whole new genre which we know today as MOBAs. The game is simple, 5v5, 3 lanes and both teams' objective is to destroy the other teams' Ancient. There are over 100 heroes in the game each with their own unique skills and attributes and forming a well rounded team with synergy is key to victory. Closing notes - The community can be awful. You will get yelled at, flamed and even reported for making mistakes. If you can overcome this, the game is amazing.

review: Cyk@ and axaxaxaxa are the only phrases you'll only ever have to use to communicate.  Don't be decieved by the server names, as every server is a Russian server.  I'd recommend never to play this game with friends, as your friendship will be destroyed into tiny pieces.  Phantom Assassin is the source of all depression.  Going into the depths of low priority is like taking a trip to hell with no way back.  You better be lucky if you random otherwise you'll probably get Earth Spirit.  If you're afraid of rats don't play this game as there's a gigantic one named Nature's Prophet.  Pray to the Lord that you'll never be against Spirit Breaker because his name doesn't lie. But somehow I keep coming back to the game. gg wp Valve 10/10

review: I don't usually write reviews, but I have to for this one. Extremely toxic (horrible) "community", the worst I've seen in any game, ever! Yes, worse than the old, pre 2005, US servers, World of Warcraft, Barrens chat! I've seen more team work in Team Fortress 2 than in this game. I've now played more than 72 matches total & also completed every single training mission and I've witnessed not just the other team but even teammates attacking eachother & myself verbally before the hero selection even starts multiple times. I don't mind if the other team trash talks sometimes, but in a game where teamwork and communication is a key to winning it's detrimental for people on the same team who don't even know eachother to abuse eachother for no reason. I don't even have enough "reports" left for this week, yes, they allot you a small number of times you can report people per week for being abusive or detrimental to your team, when in fact you need many more to report all the terrible people playing this game. GOOD LUCK if you want good communication and teammork, the majority of the time you will be matched with people who won't communicate properly in chat or won't work as a team, you'll have to end up soloing every match since your teammates will be "feeding" enemy heroes or off doing who knows what unless you have your own party of friends with you. If you don't have any friends queing for matches with you I suggest never picking a support since you'll need to be soloing 1 vs 5, which is unfair as it is. But the problems don't end there, since you are doing all the work your "teammates" will EXPECT you to win the game for them, and if you die they will verbally abuse you & report you or in fact they might do it anyway just for fun at your expense! If you only choose in the options to play with English speaking players, don't be surprised if noone on your randomly selected team but you speaks English!, instead it will be Spanish, Turkish, Chinese, Russian & more! They may even know English but just choose not to speak it, all the while trash talking you in their own native language. Many times if you tell your teammates which lane you are taking before the match starts and select it on the map someone will insist minutes after the match has started that instead you do what THEY want, for example, they want you to put a low on mana support hero by themself in the middle lane. If you ever notice your teammates ignoring the chat not telling you what they are doing or doing things together that may or may not be detrimental to winning the match it's because the majority of the time you will be matched with people who know eachother in real life and will only communicate with eachother outside of the game; whether by in person, or voice communication software, instead of communicating with you as well inside the game, so you will have NO IDEA what they are planning. Also, for the new players reading this review, do not expect ANY help for anything, like asking for advice or how to do something from the people you are playing with, as you WILL be verbally abused & reported (which is something that seems to happen often in this game whether you are new or not) instead just for being a new player or any other stupid reason, so I suggest doing all the training missions before you do any real random matchmaking. NOTICE: This review mainly applies to US servers, other server experiences may (and probably do) vary. UPDATE: So far, European servers are a MUCH better & different experience! All that being said I do recommend (not highly) this game after all if you are playing it with a team of friends & you love a highly competitive Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) aka real-time strategy (ARTS) game or you simply want to use its steam market.

review: One of my favorite games in my library. My play time reflects how much time I have spent appreciating the team work and competitive spirit of the game. Supports who actually support the team, carries who can carry the team to victory, and players who can execute a base push as timely as the New York Sunway. By the way, I love subway sandwiches. I eat a BLT without the T almost every week. Bacon is the most delicious meat. Lettuce is like the cup to the tea party. You can't have tea without water, and you can't hold water without cups. Unless of course you use your hands. Or your mouth. But lettuce cups are pretty delicious. So imagine the bacon and the lettuce together but without the disgusting creatures known as tomatoes. Which while they rhyme with potato, don't taste anything similar. If potatoes tasted like french fries, tomatoes would taste like awful fried wet vegetables. Speaking of wet tables, If you put water on tables, it gets wet. Not stuff like multiplication tables that are way too complicated. What is 6X6? Its like 64 or something. Which is like 10 if you add them all together. What does that mean? I am not sure. Math is hard. Unlike DOTA2. Which is a great game. Especially as a carry. Actually I never played carry before. It seems like a pretty easy job though.Just kill things until you win the game. That is a pretty simple job description. Unlike support or mid or offlane or jungle. I mean jungle is a location, how is it a job? It is more like a forest than a jungle. I mean jungles have lions and stuff right? Forests have angry bears. I am not sure where man-birds and horse-men are from though. Horses aren't jungle creatures I think. They sound more like mountain creatures to be honest. I haven't seen a troll before or a gnoll, but I bet they are forest creatures as well too. So jungle should really be called forest. Mid is a pretty self explanatory position. Its the middle of the map lane. Like if you had 3 lanes, he would take the second one. Or she. There are female heroes as well. Are they called heroines? Well I wouldn't want to call anyone a dangerously addicting drug. That would be sexist. I mean playing Lina is pretty addicting though. Fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire . Its like if you had a charmander and combined it with a jynx. Thats what lina is. Which reminds me that pokemon recently came out. X and Y are pretty popular with my friends, so I wamt a 3DS. Those things cost money though, but I head I can trade my items for cash. That sounds pretty amazing. Earning money while palying games, its like the American dream for people who don't want actual jobs. Not that I have a job yet. All I do is stay home and read manga. Which is pronounced mane gah, Like mango but with an a. I sometimes forget myself and add a false accent though and pronounce it mahn gaaaa. So offlane is the lane opposite of the safe lane. So the dangerous lane as they would call it. It isn't very safe cause you cross the mystical safety river to fight bad guys. Its like chinese vampires and running water. I don't think they can cross running water. Many they would have a hard time with modern day plumbing. One flush of the toilet and the go poof. Or do they? I actually know nothing about chinese vampires. I only know vampires from the books my friends lent me. It was the Twilight saga. I really preferred the Jacob to the other guy though. I was pretty upset when Bella made the wrong choice. I mean who wouldnt want a guy you could play fetch whenever you wanted. Plus the other guy was like 439434 years old. Yuck! So Support is the last job you can play. Not only do you provide moral support because most teams don't ever have asupport, but you also help buy buying items no one else in their right minds would buy. Like a slave donkey to carry your items for you. He can even be given magical wings for more than his actual buying price. Why wouldn't I want another donkey instead of one flying one? I am pretty sure two donkeys are cooler than one flying one. I mean how would you even catch a flying donkey? It could poop from like 60 feet and it would be awful. Like a divebombing terrible smelling equine terror. But donkeys are pretty cute. So keep them on the ground. If donkeys were meant to fly, god would have evolved them wings instead of using magic. So that is Dota. Its a pretty good game. But it has some problems too. After all, even BLT's have T's. Here are the digusting parts of the BLT. Games take a while to finish. So if you tend to have sudden gas attacks like me, you might have an accident while you are playing a particular game. A game of Dota can last from as long as 30 seconds to 50 hours. Like I am not even joking how troublesome it is to stay on the toiler for over an house to finish my game of Dota. I mean look at my avatar. That is my face for like the first 5 minutes of Dota before my legs fall asleep and I start getting cramps. It also has too many different heroes. I think the game could cut its hero count down to about 7. It would also encourage faster hero picking if the last 3 players couldn't choose any hero. It is a definitely annoying to choose the tree hero and the enemy hero picks an all fire team and the lumberjack hero. You are literally counterpicked because you chose too early. It would be better to give some kind of gold option or a repick option. Some game modes take forever. Like captains draft can be much shorter if they removed all the bans. Sometimes I want to make team electric, but then a ban comes up and I accidentally ban Mr. Thunder or the masked electric emo. Then Team thunder is ruined. I can understand why bans could be good though. Cause everyone chooses fat butcher guy. He uses his hook to hug you then you smell him to death. Sometimes he tickles you for extra damage. What is worse is that he eats you, he gets fatter and stronger. The biggest tomato of the problem is the fact that the game has too much action, but not enough story. Its like worse than Dynasty Warriors when it comes to story. I could use a few cutscenes telling me why I am teaming up with a giant spider, a porcupine, a baby rock, and a angel man. At least there was a reason in Dynasty Warriors 7 about why I am fighting Guan Yu with my hated enemies the filthy Wu. Were those filthy Wu actually even men? The way they fought with their cowardly fire arrows and powerful navy instead of facing the numerically and superiorly led enemy army head on just screams uncultured barbarians. So I think I will give the game a 1/10/14. Its a pretty good game, but the lack of story gives it only a 1 in that category. I understand that every hero has its own lore, but the bigger connection is quite lost when I team up with my biggest rival against my best friend. A 10 grade for the excellent team spirit of the game. People play like men instead of filthy Wu women. But Ali, why the 14 and not a 17? Because the game has that huge tomato. And I hate Tomatoes. I love BLT's without the T. BL is the greatest invention of man, till someone introduced the uncessary T. I would have BL everyday if I could afford it, but I have no job and spend all my time reading manga.

review: My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 24, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me CANCER anyway.

review: Most ed up game ever, took me almost 1k hours to find out how ed up the community, matchmaking and everything around that game is. Sad, and I'm the only one to blame for flushing my time down the drain. On the contrary, PRO community is one of the best communities out there, always fun to watch and follow, from players to casters, everyone is cool. I just can't play this  anymore, it's a pain, mental and physical pain...

review: Dota 2 - it's a kind of game which can easily become a part of your life. Once you get really interested in it, you'll never be able to get it out of your head. I've never thought that I would be into a game like this. It's just amazing cuz of many different characters, team roles and skills - it gives you a freedom to choose between lots of strategies. This game can teach how to play in a team efficiently, how to help each other in order to win, how to organise your small group if there's nobody to lead it... It isn't always easy to manage with all this stuff, but it makes the process even more challenging, more catching, you know. Dota 2 is so popular and loved game cuz it makes ppl think, realize themselves as a part of a team, choose the best strategy to achieve their aim. + a lot of characters + oceans of items + various game modes + great events + lots of strategies + improvement of your reaction and co-operative skills + an ability to create your own team - random teammates can be absolutely dumb and wry-handed

review: If you can get past the initial learning curve and burden of knowledge the game puts on you, then DOTA2 can be extremely rewarding. As far as most MOBAs are concerned, this one has a good blend of strategy and relfexes that rewards those who can use both to their advantage. The gameplay is, as a result, solid, and every sessions provides new opportunities for fun and strategy. The UI is a little underpopulated, however, and doesn't explain much. learning how to do some of the functional things, like leaving a game that's safe to leave, or muting people, or reporting people, are not super intuitive: you have to dig. Furthermore, the options available, though very powerful and plentiful, are not explained super well. As a result, it's important to toy around with your settings a bit, which can be a hassle. As far as the F2P model goes, it's pretty fair: you can play the whole game without needing any of the micro transactions. The only thing they do is customize your aethetics, and happily not to an extreme extent. Because of this, the game has a really unified look despite all the different items your characters can wear. This might dissuade people from buying them, because some of the items are barely even visible. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone with a hankering for a challenge. The game is NOT easy, but it is worthwhile and a lot of fun once you get a hang of things. Veterans of the genre will find a lot to like.

review: Dota 2. One of the best Moba's to date. I'm very fond of this team-building, strategy and interactive game. Dota is what started it all, League of Legends. Based off original Dota, this game is what started the Moba hype. Though the game does have it's faults, the tutorial is a little rocky. Not being anything like the actual game, and learning little to nothing through it. The game is a great F2P title, there are no microtransactions that will change the game, besides your character's appearance. Though the Dota servers are rough in some regions around the world, forcing players from those regions to play on other servers. Based for other regions, causing many problems. Such as language barriers, lag, and overall less team cooperation. If Valve improved some of the servers, instead of focusing mainly on N/A servers, this would most likely improve game quality for everyine around the world. Overall I would give a positive rating of: 8/10

review: Great moba game. If your deciding to start on a Moba game your probably going to choose between League of Legends and Dota 2. Both are great games and I think Dota 2 is a better expireance in my opinion, here is why. Dota 2 all characters are free so you dont have to waste your time trying to unlock them, the game takes more skill (IMO), characters have a bigger learning curve, the community is not toxic, game allows you to use your mic (You can turn off mic volume in less than a minute), no micro transactions, you can trade item sets (A.K.A Skins), you can combine item sets, you can buy item sets on the Steam market, you can parts of item sets for money. This list can go on for another 2000 words. The game only has one map so the game probably sounds repititive but its not, there is many ways to play the game, such as carry, support, tank, jungler, etc. When you check out this game it probably is going to look boring but definitly check this game out, one of my most favorite games.

review: this game is horrible, but at the same time good, it takes a tonne of time to get the hang of the game, and it's normally only fun when you win (differs from persons) i love it, but at the same time hate it, you really need a party of friends, or good players to win, in this game you loose if you have one bad player on you're team, and if you don't have the right balance of supports and carries/ semis then you loose :L some hero's are overpowered and yet some underpowered. and for some reason people in low priority are better than in a normal match one of the first mobas ever made, when it was made is was very popular on warcraft3 and of course its free, most rage enducing game since call of duty you need to play it to understand so enjoy!

review: If you ever wanted to learn russian, then this game is totally the best one to learn basic russian and insults at one place. Forget about school, get Dota and play with cold-blooded russians, which doesn't shrink back to insult you because you're not playing good with a hero, which is in their opinion, the easiest hero in the whole game. Well, the only thing is that you cannot understand them while they're talking ingame, because they're mainly talking russian. Get yourself a dictionary and start learning russian there! It's the best thing you can do. 10/10 would play it again.

Its a great game to learn foreign languages and such but not much else. Unless you are a tryhard I would not suggest this game as the community is rude as hell. Its pretty addictive as any other MOBA but by far not the best ive played. Even if the community is less racist then HON and more mature then the community of LOL, its pretty bad. The only way i am ever playing this game is with a group of friends.

review: Just like its previous installment when it all started back in Warcraft 3 as a custom map, Dota 2 is pretty much the whole same thing with several new additions added to which couldn't happen before. As someone who's been playing Dota since its beginnings, the first thing you may recognize and notice is that many of the games features such as map layout, heroes, and gameplay is almost, exactly the same but with a better and more refined look with updated graphics, making the entire map feel more lively and a refresh of old. Of course, that's all good but at the heart of Dota as many may know is its gameplay and replayability. The amount of hours I've pumped back in the first Dota was unforgettable, clocking more than +2500 hours of time played. Just like Dota 1, Dota 2 shares the exact same formula, pick a hero, last hit creeps/farm up gold, and win team fights to gain victory. Simple and straight forward, right? Wrong. If you played back in Dota 1, you'd come to realize the more you played it, the game had a fairly, high skill requirement in order to do well, especially if you're pushing to be top in a region or tournament. The amount of time and practice makes perfect as you will want to eventually learn every hero, how they synergize and working together with your teammates. It gets rough but extremely fun and satisfying, especially if you're on high level play. Unfortunately though, most people tend to ignore these kinds of games since difficulty is fairly high or they just can't stand to put the effort to actually play the game well and properly, otherwise various issues can occur, such as getting hate from other players and getting reported for not being able to play well. It's an immediate turn off and can easily have people packing their bags and finding another game. Unfortunately, again, this is thanks to the toxic communities that have spawned across all MOBA genre games. You will always have to deal with these kinds of people who will give you  and you have to bare with it as those kinds of players won't be going away anytime soon. I strongly believe competitive games have the highest chance to have ragers compared to other types of games out there and it's tough to avoid the negativity that comes with it. Now with some additions, they've added a store where you can purchase from hero skins, UI skins, to different voices for the default announcer, different couriers and selling/buying through the steam market. The thing that seperates skins here compared to others is that skins come in seperate, armor pieces you can equip on a hero, meaning you can say, keep a helmet and sell the other parts, like gloves to someone else on the steam market. It goes to show how much control the players have and what they have in their hands. The best part of all this, is that all heroes are free right off the bat to everyone, so no need to spend money and unlock the heroes you want to play. It allows us, as the players to explore and see what heroes we enjoy playing the most and if you're into cosmetics, you also have the option to buy a skin. The business model for me personally, is fair and likeable as I've had no issues with it whatsoever, it's equal for both the customer and developer. Now, while the gameplay is still the same and fun at its core, what else has been added by Valve? Well, we now have various events that take from time to time, usually worldwide holidays such as Christmas or Halloween are some examples. These events bring in replay value to want and play the game more such as getting limited skins for heroes, UI skins, couriers or just straight up rare items that can be sold across the entire steam market so you can get some funds put into your wallet for perhaps other items/skins on the market or even just saving up to buy another game entirely from either the steam store or in-game store. They've also made several changes to the UI compared to back in Warcraft 3. The UI is bigger and straight forward, and buying items through the shop are easily seen as everything is now categorized properly, and accessing them with a simple click. It's easily noticeable but just in case, you may have noticed, some heroes have not been put into the game yet and are missing. It's mainly due to copyright issues with Blizzard, seeing as how Brewmaster was a Pandaren from Warcraft and now Valve has changed him to a Koala beast of some sort? In fact, every champion for the most part, have been changed in their appearance because Dota started off by using Blizzard races and even some famous lore characters such as Thrall (Disruptor) or Rexxar (Beastmaster). It's certainly slowed down some heroes from being brought back, the recent being Legion Commander (male to female) and Terrorblade (no longer the demon hunter/Illidan). Valve still has a few more heroes to change and get out, such as Techies, so if you're a big Techies fan and/or mainer, you're going to have to wait a while longer until Valve finally pushes him out. Alright, and now my few personal grips about this game other than having a toxic community as I mentioned earlier throughout these types of games. I just do not appreciate or enjoy the art style that Valve has brought into this game. NOT in terms of quality but art style. The quality is fine for some but most heroes I feel, lost their identity and instead of something different, or unique, Valve just made most of the heroes look ugly and feel uninspired in my honest opinion. I mean now Earthshaker now looks like a mutated version of Beast from X-Men with a mix of a Koala (similar to the new Brewmaster). Hell, I still appreciate Blizzards art style so much more in Warcraft 3 than this new look, look at Pudge and Slardar, they had the look, voice and feel back in Warcraft 3 but now it's just not as strong anymore here. Even the almighty and fearful Zeus doesn't look like an intimidating god anymore, but a scientist. Another thing that I do not find a lot of fun a whole lot anymore is the gameplay itself, yes, the core gameplay. It's literally been the same thing over and over, nothing new or innovative, just a rinse and repeat of picking a hero, farming up gold for items, and winning team fights. Maybe it's just me after playing thousands of hours in this genre or perhaps if you take a look past the gameplay and look at what it really offers, there's really nothing going for it. Last hitting isn't fun anymore, as that's all you're doing most of the time early on, with team fights mid to late game (unless you personally find it fun). The worst part, is you will fall behind if you say die a few times to an opponent carry, it pigeon holds you because now your team has little to no retaliation or chance of hoping to win since that carry will just roll face your entire team and there's a decent chance someone on your team will call you out, meaning more anger and frustration can occur. I can safely say as a long time Dota 1 player/fan, Dota is still fun but it's not fun if you want to play decently at the average level because the amount of mechanics people know in that level will put you in a disadvantage if you just learn a few because most just don't have time to do it. So what can I say, I mean in the end, this is basically Dota 2.0 with better graphics, same gameplay like the original, a few added features like events, and the in-game store associated with the steam market. Everything looks great except the art style for most heroes (personal opinion) and of course, the ease of access to newcomers while it may seem straight forward, it gets more complicated in-depth, meaning there's a harder learning curve and barrier to pass through to fully enjoy the game at its fullest, meaning you'll need to spend some time and practice.

review: This is basically dota 1 with an upgraded user interface and graphics. Its still a work in progress but all in all this is what the original dota style gameplay needs if its going to increase its declining marketshare in the moba genre it itself once pioneered. The spectator interface for viewing live games is impressive and though it seems the matchmaking algorithm is not really active at the moment for a beta the parts that work do so rather well. The attack and spell animations are all reworked and changed in this version so even for old dota 1 vets there is much to learn that only comes with the experience of engaging in the matches themselves. If you can get an invite and you like the MOBA genre you will find far more to like than not. But as usual in these types of games it all comes down to how evenly paired both teams are in skill for a game to truly fire on all cylinders.

review: I've had this game in my Steam Library since beta, and occasionally I'd give it a try to see if I could tap into some of the excitement that continued to elude me, for some reason. 62 hours later, on May 12, 2014 (today), after reading the first 10 headlines in the Dota 2 Steam "forums", I promptly uninstalled the game. I'm not one of those dudes who mistakes his opinion for fact, so I'll just say this game isn't for me. Rude, unfriendly community coupled with an overtly pretentious, self-important theme and arbitrary, unnecessarily difficult online play ("laning"? "ganking"? "last-hitting?" REALLY?) are unappealing to me. I suppose the kids prefer the game this way because they feel like they've "accomplished something" when they win (as opposed to the rest of us who simply "play video games"). As an over-30-year-old gamer with kids of my own, perhaps I'm just too old for this. Anyway, thumbs down. NEXT.

review: I don't really enjoy competitive games, as a rule. I like the idea of them, but I don't play them. I have been playing a lot of Dota 2 though, because I don't think that Dota 2 is really a "game." I sometimes lose a game so badly that I wake, days later, in a cold sweat. At first, all I can think is that I am happy to have woken from the nightmare. Later, in a moment of creeping fear, I will realise that the real nightmare is how bad I am at Dota... and yet I cannot stop myself from playing it. Dota 2 is an endless nightmare from which I cannot wake. To install it is to introduce into your life a hellish netherworld, one in which close friends are so disappointed in one another that they cannot even express it. One in which improvement means only that you will be matched against better opposition... All of this horror floats on the constant threat of the "low priority queue," a stygian hellscape that this review could never hope to describe. Summary: 10/10, would play again (until my sightless eyes drop from their sunken sockets and the cold grip of death frees my mortal husk from its trap).

review: My favourite game of all time, amazingly deep pvp experience that has me still feeling like every game is something new and different after about 2-3000 hours given between dota 1 and 2. First off a warning. This is game is hard to get into. It has an insanely large learning curve, (and a community who (mostly) don't deal well with learners or anyone not at the top of their game.) If you push through this, which isn't so bad if you have some friends to show you the ropes and get you into it, you will have access to a high action strategy game with so many variables to each game that you can always be suprised no matter how long you've played.

review: This is the worst game i have ever played in my entire life, the most depressing and anxiety inducing game ever. Its an addiction you can't stop, a drug you cant refuse. Every thought you have is about the game...the lanes, the heroes, the creeps, the items. If you play this game, you fall into a deep dark pit you will never climb out of.

review: Of the majority of games that feature animal people, I don't think any other game of our generation can shout BLATANT FURRY CULTURE FORCING more than Dota 2. Ranging from the down and dirty Gondar lines like "for the right price, anything" to the drunk, pitiful Mangix; and you thought Disney was bad. On top of that they even added a character called "Troll Warlord" which is obviously a Homestuck reference. These guys are really milking the fandom department. Why can't a game just be about boobs like the old day- I mean what ever happened to good old Christian family values like Monopoly and Scrabble. Now we've gotta fill our games with fanservice and sell out to an audience that is somehow greater than ours? I don't think so. And there's even a character that's a flamboyant homosexual. I had to bring my children to therapy after they heard the words "puddin pop" from one such "Storm Spirit". On the topic of inappropriate directive, I can't believe a Greek Gorgon such as Medusa would go so far as to talk about her 'gays'. This is simply not alright. This "game" is nothing but a manifestation of what our society is becoming, and we can only petition to have Valve remove funding for this project to save our youth.

review: English Review I was a fan and player of DOTA 1 and I've been passionate player of new version DOTA 2 for some time already. Audio and video are incomparable. There were cube, cross in the older version, but in everything's smooth in new version. I mind the looks of some heros (sorting by race), but I used to it. Though what I miss from the older version is graphical visualization of objects, which was glowing out of them (aura, colors). But sound messages are just wonderful! Control, choice of using spells, items ... it's up to player, also like graphics and sounds. Great benefit is that you don't have to download and search maps, there is automatic update and synchronization. I give a big plus for buying, gaining of trading items. It's just huge jump and movement in this game. Who was devotee of the older version, he will also fall in love with this one. I recommend for 100%. Rating: 10/10 Slovak Review Bol som fanikom a hrom DOTA ''1'' a som i novej verzie DOTA 2. Audio a video s nezrovnaten. V starej verzii boli ''kocka, krik'' v novej ve pekne vyhladen. Trochu mu vad na poniektorch herov vzor (rozdelenie poda rasy), ale to som si u zvykol. o mi avak chba z prvej verzei je grafick vizulizcia predmetov, ktor z nich vyarovala (aury, sfarbenia, ...). o sa tka hlok: ,,S uasn!'' Ovldatenos, vber pouvania spellov, itemov, ... je na hrovi, taktie ako grafika i zvuky. Obrovksou vhodou je nesahovania a nehadanie mp, ale automatick aktualizcia a synchronizcia. Vek plus dvam i kpu, zskavania i trejdovania itemov. Proste obrovsk skok a posun v tejto hre. Kto bol zarytcom do starej verzie, tak isto si zamiluje i tto nov. Odporam na 100%. Hodnotenie: 10/10

review: Welcome to Dota 2, the Hotel California of online gaming. Late Last March, I was naive enough to dip a toe in its beguiling waters and today, 450 hours of gameplay later, I return as a semi-functional human to regale you with tales from its realm. Dota 2 is unlike any other game Ive ever played, both in its nature and history. It started off as a StarCraft mod popular enough to be ported to Warcraft 3, which then exploded into a kaleidoscope of player-made variants and eventually coalesced again into a single entity titled Defense of the Ancients Allstars. There is no single author of Dota, though all the anonymous contributors whove made it what it is have come from the community that first started playing the mods. As such, Dota is the very definition of grassroots game development. The idea of a game made by the people for the people, as a certain American president might put it, fills me with a particularly warm and fuzzy sensation. Of course, I knew none of this when I first picked up Dota. A friend recommended it because its free and Im cheap. I understood that the game had a team-based format where killing the other guys was a good thing, like with first-person shooters, but your character also leveled up through the course of a match, as in role-playing games. That seemed like a recipe for unbalanced gameplay, but as it turns out, its precisely Dotas balance that makes it so unbelievably addictive. You start off as a member of a ragtag group of five heroes intent on destroying the enemys base, which is embodied by the titular Ancient structure. Through a series of skirmishes against the other team, their defensive towers, and waves of autonomous creeps, you gain experience and gold, the latter of which can be spent on items that make you stronger, swifter, and deadlier. The more you kill, the more you make, the more you buy, the more you kill. Rinse, repeat, and make sure to say "gg" at the end. LEARNING A LANGUAGE MIGHT BE QUICKER THAN MASTERING THE FULL BREADTH OF DOTA Excuse me if Im making this sound simple, because it really isnt. Dota 2 has a roster of over 100 heroes to choose from, and the combinations of items they can obtain is an order of magnitude greater still. Each hero has four or more unique abilities, and to have any hope of defeating a skilled opponent, you have to know what those are, what items he or she is carrying, and how they affect your chances of survival. Ignoring all of that nuance, I jumped straight into the game with the Juggernaut and was promptly beaten into a pulp of samurai sushi. A dozen humbling  whoopings later, I was online and reading the Dota Fire hero guides. DOTA 2 CHOICES The key reassurance I can offer is that all of these intricacies are, in fact, worth learning. As daunting as Dotas complexity may be, without it the game just wouldnt be as rewarding. My way of rising to the high bar of basic skill required was to pick the last enemy hero to destroy me. Thus I went from playing Juggernaut to Bounty Hunter to Bloodseeker to Ursa to Spirit Breaker. Each time I was sure I had the "right" hero, a better player would come along, expose my weaknesses, and teach me something new. Im the worst loser I know and yet I played Dota 2 for nearly 100 hours before I could get my winning percentage above 50. Maybe if I could actually see that I was being dominated by 14-year-old kids listening to Darudes Sandstorm on repeat, I might have felt sufficiently embarrassed to retreat in shame. I stuck through it, though, because, in the immortal words of Agent Smith, "as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery," and Dota delivers both with just enough victory to keep me titillated. And once I had a couple of hundred hours of experience under my belt, I too started passing on the sacred knowledge of Dota through the time-honored tradition of owning noobs. IM THE WORST LOSER I KNOW AND IM ADDICTED TO A GAME THAT KEEPS KICKING MY  This is not a game for the impatient. Success in Dota 2 requires the strategic forethought of chess, the unselfish teamwork of basketball, and the steely nerves of poker. None of those skills are acquired with ease and theres no magic number of matches or hours played to achieve Dota competence. Its a lot like learning a language: I never felt discrete upgrades in my knowledge and skill, but eventually I got to the point where I could tell you every typo in the games hero descriptions and every corner of its single asymmetric map. Just know that the commitment required is on a whole different scale to other games. You could complete the epic Mass Effect trilogy (plus all of its expansion packs) in less time than it takes the average Dota player to familiarize himself with everything from Abbadons Aphotic Shield to Zeuss Lightning Bolt. But thats really the point. Mastering this game in 50 hours wouldnt feel anywhere near as satisfying as taking a good 500.

review: Being an old League of Legends player I really needed some time off LoL since I knew every champion, every item and every possible outcome for hero duels, I came to Dota 2. If you are just like me then I would strongly suggest taking a look at dota 2. It is much more realistic and I can guarantee it once you get to know a little bit the mechanics of the game and if you play it with a friend or two then you will have so much fun. No bugs whatsoever, very fluid game and most of all very diverse range of heroes. The only bad thing there might be (from what I have seen) is that there is quite a big number of trolls in the game.

review: A true masterpiece and a milestone in gaming, this sequel to a genre-definer that is now just bursting in a global scale is a great point of reference to anyone attempting to make a game of this genre. Great graphics, amazing sound and voice design, and rich backstories in every corner are just some of the features that make Dota 2 great. But it's major strong point is the depth in its mechanics. While Dota 2's gameplay might seem daunting at first, it's one of the best and more engaging ever seen in a game, and learning it is just one of the reasons why this game is addicting. Other games such as League of Legends end up falling short because their devs decided to cut much from the original formula, but Dota 2 kept it intact, and makes sure you learn something new everyday. Not only the core game is strong, but also the eSport scene surrounding it is amazing and growing, with several tournaments going on, including Valve's own The International. At the time of release, the game looks like a train with no brakes, about to crash against its competitors and run them over, raising the bar on the genre with a myriad of awesome features that perfectly compliment an awesome game.

review: More Russian than Moscow! 10/10 DotA2 is a Russian simulator, explore the every day life of a Russian glued behind his computer screen wondering why these English capitalist dogs do not speak the almighty language of justice. Enjoy not being able to understand your teammates and swearing at eachother in a variety of Spanish/French (very rarely English) and most of all: Russian. You can play on the Europe West servers (with Russians), American servers (with Russians) or if you're missing out on that full Russian experience, play on the Russian servers. No wonder Ukraine is not taken yet, they're all too busy ''playing'' this game. Feel free to enjoy Solo Queue and end up with a group of 3 Russians and a Spanish 13 year old repeatedly, listening to a repeated soliloquy of backwards letters you've only seen once in a Chernobyl documentary. Attempt Duo Queue and end up with 3 Russians, which kind of diminishes the full blown Russian experience; thus I do not recommend you try this or you can play with bots, which are surprisingly better teammates than the Russians. Just for good measure I'll throw in an extra ''Russians'' to get the point across. Enjoy yourself, comrad. For those of you that do not enjoy the full Russian gaming experience, there is always CS:GO, which is the softcore version of DotA2. Disclaimer: Long exposure to DotA2 might cause capitalist ideals to give way to communism.

review: Dota 2 is a 5-v-5 MOBA game. You have a selection out of 108 unique heroes, each with a unique skillset. Every hero is also available from the minute you start. No playing X amount of games before this hero becomes available. The object of Dota 2 is to destroy the other teams Ancient. To do this, you can work your way down any of the 3 lanes (Top, Mid or Bottom) by destroying the outer towers. Youll start most matches pairing up or going into a lane solo trying to get some experience and gold by last hitting creeps. As the game progresses, youll start teaming up more with your other team members to take on the other team or to quickly kill of a solo member of their team. Because of the importance of coordinating your attacks with other team members, communication is a very important aspect of the game. I therefor also recommend playing this game with some friends because random people that youll be teamed up with wont always show the same willingness to communicate. If youre just starting out playing Dota 2, I also recommend playing with a friend who already has some experience in the game because the learning curve is very steep, especially when you have to figure everything out by yourself. The skill ceiling is also extremely high. So every time you play, you might learn something new. Due to the high number of available heroes, skills and items, you can be sure that every game is unique. Something to be wary of is the community. There are people out there that take this game way more seriously than you might. Most players have an opinion of what you should have done in a certain situation and will be happy to blame a lost teamfight on you not taking that action. Flaming is something that could happen often. But if youre playing with a team entirely made up of your friends, this shouldnt prove to be an issue. If this is not the case, dont worry. You can always mute the players that are causing you grief and continue enjoying this wonderful, team oriented game.

review: Dota 2, a very frustrating game that forces you to play with and against other players. You'll rely on your team to preform their selected roles, and then watch in horror as they completely ignore the game mechanics and just chase down kills, rarely successfully. You build in game items during the match to enhance your characters role and then hope and pray your team doesn't feed the opposition too much. Team fights, normally 5v5, tend not to happen as you watch your fellow team members run to meet their fate and be a hero. Sadly this ends up throwing the game and you lose. I would still recommend this game, purely for those few matches when the your whole teams synergy is in harmony, watch as the gold floods in, the towers crumble and the opposition blame each other for their loss.

review: A message to my fellow conservatives: all is lost. A message to my fellow classical economists: we're all Keynesians now. With the release of How to Train your Dragon 2 (which might've been more suitably named "How to be a Dictator 2"), Communist influence has been seeded into the minds of the children, destroying the potential for a perfect laissez faire economy for future generations. How to Train your Dragon 2 is a story of a young Shaggy Rogers discovering the wonders of "Sandwiches" for the first time with the Rottweiler he owned before Scooby. Our protagonist, a rebellious socialist who never came to grasp the true meaning of Republican Motherhood, is a frequenter of the parks, motivating the homeless by promising them peace and beating them until they promise to get a job or preaching to the innocent picnickers about the evils of animal cruelty. A subtheme of gun control is dished out discreetly as the script writers encourage us to do better than what game theorists think we are capable of with flawed moral consciences. In the same way viewers are assured that we have learned from the days of the arms race by subtly bringing up the Marilyn Monroe-JFK scandal. Obnoxious and unorginal, the production draws content heavily from the movies E.T. and Avatar, indicating that it could have been funded by a collective effort between PETA, James Cameron, the public health institute, Heidi Fleiss, and Joseph Stalin. In the end, the main character's tyrannical liberal-minded father boards a boat to Russia under heavy artillery fire by social darwinists, portrayed as defiant and unruly teenagers that want nothing but an end to civilization. I can say with certainty that any child who watches this film WILL become a democrat at some point in their lives, and, like the movie suggests, the only way to prevent the disease from spreading is to contain it. Oh and Dota 2 is a pretty good game too.

review: Defense of the Ancients 2 or DotA 2 for short, is like being addicted to an extremely harmful substance. No matter how many times you queue for Europe West and get Russians. No matter how many times you get an insta-pick Pudge going mid to feed. No matter how many times you see a Bounty Hunter build BattleFury. You'll keep coming back for that one taste of glory. It's an extremely abusive relationship that is impossible to leave.

review: I can't really write a good review for the ever-changing landscape that is Dota2. But I will say the following generic things: Dota2 is not a simple team game. There are a huge amount of advanced techniques that you will have to be told or lookup online. You come into Dota to have fun with "tools", every character is a different tool. They move different, they turn different, they attack differently. If you enjoy playing the same game over and over and perfecting little, small tricks to give yourself a slight advatange, then this is for you. If you come from any fighting game for example, you can get into this. Like really into this. What makes Dota2 different from other MOBAs? Depth. Dota offers much more variety, much more freedom to experiment. Other MOBAs shy away from the huge complexity that is giving more tools to the tools. You have items that give you more movement options, that take away movement options from the opponent, even random modifiers that spawn on the map periodically. In other games you will find these "options" baked into a character, they try to guide you into learning how a character "should" be played. Dota2 gives you the sandbox to experiment, As a reminder, it's never anyone's fault when you fail to build your tool properly. This is a game. Have fun. Most people just look up to a player and copy his playstyle, and Valve facilitates this. But you don't have to. Everything depends in Dota2. Should you try Dota2? Yes. But remember to have fun. You will be playing a game that can last 1 hour per match. Enjoy. Smile. A lot of people forget this. If you're not enjoying Dota2. Uninstall.

review: When you play for the first time all this game seems like is just a bunch of wierd colored creatures punching each other with sticks. It seems really stupid, but you suck it up and play through the tutorial. Then you stupidly decide to play your first game of real dota. Put short you fed, badly. After going 0/30 your first game you kinda hate dota. But you stupidly decide to play another, and chances are you lost again. And this keeps happening until you discover your first newb hero. Drow seems so op doesnt she. Afterwards you decide to play this hero again and again, and doesn't it feel good to win. 50 games deep you'll hate noobstomp heroes like riki, sniper, drow, and bloodseeker. Obvisously these heroes are really op. 100 games deep and you'll find yourself trying out some new heroes, tidehunters ravange is pretty epic you have to agree. 200 games deep and you'll have played every hero, with the exception to earth spirt. How the hell do you play that guy, I dont get it. 300 games deep and those newb stomp heroes dont seem so bad anymore. Manfight riki, stand right next to drow, get blademail for sniper, and buy a tp for bloodseeker. And dont forget to buy dust. 400 games in you will know how to ward, rune control, stack and pull and play a support. You will understand the basics of having one person farm while another supports and harrasses. Holy  you've made it to 500 games. Remeber your first match if only you could see yourself now. By this point you understand the basics of dota! Remeber to dodge the sunstrike! 600 games in and you'll realize that for the past months dota is the only game you have played. Like the only game, because once you start playing dota you never come back. Unless your power dies.... By 700 games you'll start playing against trilanes. Now as an offlaner you have to do your best to not die, and get some farm. Hide in the trees and sap xp where you can. By 800 your tempted to buy that arcana. Not saying you will but it sure does look tempting. By 900 you know what to buy, and you get what every hero can do. You know where to be and when and you get the feeling when there smoke ganking and roshing. Gamesense op! By 1000 games you hit a milestone. The game doesnt seem like colored creatures punching eachother. Welcome to dota 2. Noob Advice: read guides when your trying out new heroes. Practice in bots, and dont stick to one hero, play them all. And stick in there, your first 10 games will suck. Purge has some great guides that you really should watch before you even step into your first game. And also play with friends, otherwise you might have to put up with peruvians who keep screaming noob in chat when you make one mistake. People who have to rage at everything (thats why theres reports), and russians who will play uber aggresive all the time, which to be fair on there part works half of the time. Welcome to dota 2. Oh yeah and nerf void!

I only played a handful of matches, and being at least semi-literate in both MOBA UIs and old custom Warcraft and Starcraft maps, I can in no way recommend this game to anyone but the most hardcore of MOBA fans. The UI is unintuitive, the shop is a mess to look at if you're new, and you will likely get your face smashed in by even the computer-controlled players time and time again while you punishingly learn every little thing it takes to be good at this game. If you have never played a MOBA, if you don't have a friend who already plays this and can walk you through what to do, do NOT try this game. If you really love MOBAs and are looking for a new one, yes, definitely try this and I hope you enjoy it. I did not, not even remotely.

review: Don't bother spending hundreds on other language learning programs, or ones that claim to be the best, like Rosetta Stone. DotA 2 has the market cornered and you would have to be a fool to pay anything for these "superior" pieces of software when DotA 2 is completely free of charge! When you want to learn a new language, simply queue for your region, and select the language that you already know. Valve's patented system will immediately match you with other language speakers who will get you on the fast track to success! You will love your learning experience. I can guarantee that you will not grow to hate other cultures due to a language barrier, because soon you will be able to speak Portugeuse, Spanish, Russian, and Chinese!

review: Of Warcrafts Custom Maps, one stood a little taller than the rest: Defense of the Ancients. Here the heroes of Azeroth, freed from the tedious management of cities and armies, could fight as they were meant to: with weapons and experience, teamwork and tactics, all unadulterated by some abstract general and convoluted mission. A vast pool of heroes, pulled into one map, normalized and equalized through patches, armed with improved weaponry, combined to cement a gameplay experience that appealed to our encyclopedic minds, our fantastical tendencies, and our social impulse. Here was an unthinkable union of knowledge, skill, mythology, role playing, individuality, and balance. Here DotA matured to perfection. But this perfection was uneven. The brilliance lay there, but burdened by the crust and grime of history. The games greatest hero, Ice Frog, was a player who saw in DotA a wondrous achievement and vowed not to let that masterpiece deteriorate and die. Seeing the game as a growing process, owned by a community, ever meant to experiment and improve, Ice Frogs leadership kept DotA alive. Suffocated by a dated engine and forgotten game, he and his team worked with the legion of adoring fans to nourish what could be saved, and eradicate what could not. But even tenacity has limits, and in order for DOTA to break free it needed a new body; a new platform in which to siege the world. Here, as ever, an angel swooped from above. It was Valve, and they released the building pressure of DOTA into the atmosphere of mainstream gaming; steam that would finally power the community it deserved. The rest is history. Adopting the FTP model, utilizing the source engine and steam community, DotA has its outlet: DOTA 2. Players marvel at the games sheer number of balanced heroes, how it feels difficult yet strangely compelling, sophisticated in its strategy but gleeful in its murder, at times silly but still dark, oppressive but always promising emancipation if you practice hard and reflect often, so reliant on your allies, often complete strangers, that autonomous action can never rival teamwork. Like members of a symphony, clashing with your enemies in near perfect tug-and-war, entailing chess-like prediction and FPS-like twitching, your team fights together, wins together, and dies together. Never before except in professional sports has your weakest link dragged you down or raised you up. But drag you down they do. Even in the most porcelain masks do we see blemishes, and DOTA 2 has its fair share. Teams can and do exploit the weakest member of the opposite team, bullying with a savagery only seen in competitive gaming. Because of this exploitation, and the difficult nature of the game as a whole, frustration often runs high in the experience. Losses feel more painful than wins feel enjoyable, and the hope for those rare games in which perfect harmony among both teams leads to razor-sharp tactics and thrilling plays can be ruined by the cruel hand of fate, where a single hero out of position or a single RNG move can turn the tide of battle. DOTA 2 is, paradoxically, rarely satisfying, but when it is players never forget that feeling of triumph. Video Games, more than any other art, rely on us to deliver an experience. Whether they tell a story or present puzzles to solve, games need us to be competent and attentive. DOTA 2 takes this to new heights, and presents us with an outlet where the more we pour into it, the more it gives back. Eventually our exhaustion clouds the luster somewhat, but we shouldnt judge the game by our own limitations. Feral, profound, and terrifically challenging, DOTA 2 is competitive team-based gaming in its prime.

review: It's a purgatory simulator based on the existential novel No Exit, in which you are trapped in a game with 9 other people who hate you. You spend your time killing the same enemies, who spawn every 30 seconds for all eternity, until you have amassed an arbitrary amount of gold/items with which you kill the other team. The worst 2 players in the game are blamed for every mistake made and ridiculed without mercy, while the player with the highest kill/death ratio (often times not the best player) calls you a  for the 60 minute duration. It's a nice game and I highly recommend it.

review: A big portion of my nerve system died while palying this game. I no longer can express human emotions. My friends abandoned me as I fail to laugh at their joke or show I feel them when they share some tragic news. I am working on a application that can modify my photo with my emotionless face to a state I am really at. Most likely I will make billions, as Kristen Stewart is already on the project, so are many other famous actors (Mark Wahlberg, Channing Tatum and so on). I would recommend this game, as even if a part of you dies.... New part is always being born! Sometimes new part might require a straight jacket.

review: The neverending story. Skills never achieved at best and very hard game to learn. Many mistakes can be reason of losing game and game one of the hardest with opportunities which requires the years of effort and practice. Community full of all type of people from global. Players can report each other and happens often get reported by player because of his own mistakes. Also you must be smart and strong to survive people harassment. Definitely harder than League of Legends, World of Warcraft and many others games. Game play improved by many years of development and will be improved until Dota exist. Community loves professional players and players playing most of time very good at games but hates beginners or people not playing good enough. Better you play, harder you will win games alone. One of the best games for playing with real life friends, solo or with teams.

review: this is an excellnt game if you want a really dynamic playstyle and a unique item shop which offers much variation. The reason i choose dota over LoL is beacuse of the friendly community and the helpful players i often find in the games who are always willing to help me out if im stuck with what to buy or when they're telling me i shouldn't be initiating teamfights as the courier but whatever this game is great i'd give it a solid 7/10 just beacuse it's such an easy game to pick up after about 100 games you will have the basics mastered like how to last hit the minions and once you have that down you can learn how to kill your own minions to deny gold which is pretty hard and i still can't do it properly. I hope that in the next 20 games or so in can manage to get the basics of jungling down because it's very complicated and i always forget to eat the trees for health LOL. yes would reccomend definately to any new players looking for an online moba game which is really easy to pick up and get going aftert 10 games.

review: With over 110 heroes to choose from, Dota 2 has one of the steepest learning curves of all the games available on Steam. Many players find that even after 100+ hours of gameplay, they feel incompetent at the game. While this is probably Dota 2's greatest downfall, it is also the aspect that makes the game as great as it is. There is just so much to learn in this game, that it will provide fans with countless hours of playtime. Verdict: Dota 2 is an extremely difficult game, and that is what makes it most rewarding. Yes, the amount of time it will take a new player to become even an "average" player may take well over 100 hours. However, if you are can overcome its steep learning curve and are looking for a game long term, DOTA 2 may just be the best game you can currently find - and it is free.

review: Dota 2: As we are entering the moba territory where the fan bases exist to the extremes, I decided to test out all the moba games that I had access to which was League, HoN, HoTS, Smite and Demigod so that I tested out all games fairly and equally. After playing them all I believe that DOTA 2 is probably the best moba out there if you like strategy and a more grownup moba game. DOTA 2 does well with a focus on each hero being unique and each having their pros and cons to assist the team in their own special ways, so this means that each match will never be the same due to the choices of heroes and peoples playstyles. Its developers and lead designer Icefrog have a focus on balancing every hero on every major update and making sure that no hero is extremely overpowered. The game follows Valves concept of Free to Play games where the only thing up for purchase is cosmetics with nothing that will change or alter the gameplay, the game also has item drops at the end of the matches but at the time of this review the drop rates were changed and its current nigh impossible to even get a single item. The only issue I really see is the issue with some of the servers due to the outsourcing of servers to other companies and their locations. So Ill write down the list of servers that have issues that I know of: SEA (Location: Singapore) (E-Club) - Its a gamble, there is two servers and one is good and one is awful. Sometimes up, sometimes down. Good luck. Japan (Location: Tokyo) (NEXON) - It doesn't exist yet, they are holding it hostage for the past year. US Servers (Valve) - They are currently using Mail Pigeon for packets. (West - Seattle, East - Sterling) Russia (Stockholm) (?) - The server is perfectly fine, the only issue is the distance from Russia to Stockholm causes increase latency -------- Other than some of the server issues you can have loads of fun and you might even pick up the Russian, Spanish, Portuguese or Filipino languages. Dota is a quality gaming addiction and language learner. 10/10

You will be screamed at by other languages and dont know what is going on. Then you will be in games with blamers that blame everything on you. Filled with racism and Yelling 10/10

review: Dota2 often claimed to be the hardest MOBA there is and that is because the game is very complex, which is why there is a ~10 hour tutorial trying to breakdown the game mechanics into little pieces and if you want to get faster and easier into it you can't avoid watching videos for more tips'n'tricks, which makes this game very time consuming, not to mention that an average game is between 30 and 50 minutes long. However when you dig yourself through the wall of Dota2 and got to the point, where you start understanding what you are doing wrong. Then the game gets very rewarding and fun. Playing Dota2 is a combination of strategy - which hero to pick, where to lane, what items to buy and satisfying combat, one hero usually has 4 abilities and one of them being there ultimate ability, which is the hero's strongest ability, for newbies, there are a lot of hero's with passives and few abilities. Something, which I don't usually mention in reviews, is the voice acting, this game, although it has 108 different characters, has really good voice acting for every single hero. Although the game is getting to get a bit older now, its graphics are definetly up to date and personally I really like the water, it looks really good. Overall if have a lot of spare time and for a very strategic in-depth game go for it! It is free and you have excess to all heroes from Level 0 on. This game gets a 'G' for Good(A>G>O)

review: Pros : 1) Free 2) most played game on steam guarantees you can play this game 24X7, when the world is asleep, dota players are raging at their noob teammates, or being a noob themselves 3) low system requirements means your 3rd world friend with a  pc/laptop would be able to play the game Cons: 1) Most toxic community of any game, you know you are doing well in the game as a noob if you arent asked to uninstall the game 2) selfish players that take heros that make no sense considering the enemy draft. 5 carry teams or 5 support teams are not too uncommon 3) you are guaranteed to rage at the same noobs that you were when you start getting good at the game. not recommended for heart patients or pregnant woman.

Even when people Think or Say that people in Dota aren't Friendly, they're probably wrong, I won't decline the Fact that there are some of them, but Angry Gamers are in every game possible, y' know? Even when I've played with a "plague" of Dota 2 and CS:GO - Russians, I've heard 5-6 Swears and mostly because they were amused. About the Game itself. Gameplay may seem a Bit hard for the First time, but after you Play Tutorial + Some Matches, you'll get familiar with it. It's quite fun and Teamwork-ish, nothing here is Possible without Teamwork ( and Creeps ). Plus, it's this kind of a Games, where you have to be Sliced in a Half, and Complete some Objectives while Farming for Some EXP and Gold. The Match is getting REAL somewhere around 17 Minute of a game, Both teams got Heroes with Special Attacks, new Items, more Creeps. That;s where it starts. When you Bash through a Horde of Creeps and Kill a Sniper who was About to use a Shrapnel, then attack Creeps from Behind and you Push through Towers and even More Creeps with your Teammates. Sadly, but this Game was so Negatively Reviewed for most of the Time, but, everybody has an Opinion, right? Try it out by yourself, you'll Like it.

review: It's worth maybe somewhere between 1000 - 1500 hours, but once you become fairly decent at the game, you realize there's not much to it. it's neither complicated nor possesses too much variety. The most fun portion of this game is irking the other players. Actually, it also becomes fairly monotonous as you find players who don't even know what last hitting is despite attempting to employ advanced tactics. However, the game ios intrinsically bad, not in result of the players. Like I said, once you get somewhere between 1000 - 1500 hours of playing every character, it becomes boring. They end up playing too much like one another. I never feel a difference between playing lion, lina, vengeful, Cm, etc. as support. Sure, the abilities vary, but the use of those abilities don't. You're still going to stun when you need to, you're going to harass when you need to, etc. It's all the same. Unfortunately a majority of people I've met who are actually social are the ones whom I've seen play DOTA frequently.

review: DotA 2; What is there you didn't want in a game? This game; Yes can be frustrating and unforgiving and yes can be hard to get used to, BUT that is the fun in which this game provides you with. You may struggle to survive in the jungle against a five man gank and continuously get slaughtered but as a team and with strategies, you and your team can survive to become the victors at the end of the game. When I first started playing this game I had a hard time getting used to MOBA's and never had seen them before which in turn made it so much more difficult for me to understand what was going on but with the support of my mates I learnt and gradually got better. I would strongly reccommed new players to play a few hours of Bot games first because going online with no experience (like I did) doesn't benifit your team, yes you may win but was it worth all the jeering and crude comments from both your own team for feeding and the opposition for being quite horrible at the game? But MOST importantly you MUST have Fun. Playing a game without having fun makes there no reason to play it.

review: Extremly rage inducing game, recommended only for ages 12-65. You will be able to learn every aspect of racism and realize what actually "e-" means within DotA 2 i.e Anyone below 3000 MMR is trash tier with a 2 inch  and their opinion is always invalid. DotA 2 is also a pathway for you to be fluent in many different languages such as Chineese, Korean, Thai, Malay, Russian and many others. The secret to climbing MMR is insta-locking the most broken hero in every game. Overall 10/10 game, highly recommended.

review: If you enjoy dedicating your life to this game while at the same time ignoring your family, friends, and any sort of social interaction, then you will certainly enjoy fighting with your teammates over who will support or who will buy courier. By playing this glorious game you will also learn how to speak several languages as for some reason russians and mexicans like to join the US East and West servers when they have servers in their own country. Im sure you are already sold by this point, but just to add on one more thing about this game is that you will also learn how seriously people take this game and realize truly how terrible you are at this game because you are a noob with less than 3,000 hours on a game.

review: My least played heroes are some popular badass carries cause no one buys wards and couriers on my team and I have to play support all the time. Wards placing and couriers buying simulator.10/10 Normally people don't speak English on US server while I'm not even a native English speaker and I speak English. Multi-languages bad words learning tools.10/10 The most words you will hear from your teammates are not good try or nice play but OMG THAT XXXXX IS A ING NOOB. REPORT HIM AND FF PLZ Learning the attitude to your teammates like a real loser tool. 10/10 Conclusion: Find 4 nice teammates in order to group up and shout at each other or just play bots game and do kill secure with Dagon while reading others typing really? all the time. And yes, dota2 is not a MOBA game. Dota2 is a hero sets and unusual couriers simulation, which is 10/10 also.

review: I've played this game since I was in my highschool, Dota 1 days were surely a jumpstart for me. Now I'm a licensed Interior Designer and I still play this game. In-game items make this game a whole lot more interesting than before. But since I'm a new player, it's sad to know that DYNAMIC PRESENTS are now unavailable. Rendering Old Players an edge of having good set of items while New ones can never have while they level up. So this makes leveling up your dota profile a bit of useless to me. Leveling up a profile knowing that there is no use or benefit can be disappointing at some point. And hopefully soon there will be an AUTOBAN for rude players in-game. Some sort of a "PROFANE" word detection thru out any language. There are a lot of rude and tactless players out there that can most of the time disappoint newbies from playing the game. Not everyone though. But nonetheless, this game is still as awesome for me as it was before in Dota 1. Very nice graphics and enjoyable game. Keep up the good work!

review: This game is fun and entertaining if you actule have teammates to play with.... Do not play this game solo you will get crushed by partys from opposing team who know how to make combinations with heros... But that is not the worst part of this game, the worst part is the fact that you will most likely get teamed up with Russain players or Spanish who are uncapable of speaking English language at all. I have spent two years in this game trying to find one or two good teammates, but all i found in this game is non English speaking teammates who keep kill stealing and blameing others for their own mistake. This game is no fun for me, its real pain filled with anger and haitred....

You'll also find the best matchmaking system ever known to man, that puts you with EVENLY SKILLED PLAYERS no matter what, and a report system that will punish toxic players that trash talk or feed, 10000% guaranteed. In this long escalation of skills you'll find better players as you improve. It's one game you'll never want to stop playing, teamwork, communication and frinedliness are in the order of the day. Greatly recommended to anyone that enjoys teamwork and competitive teamwork oriented games.

review: I started playing Dota 2 around 2 years ago, at that time it was still at Beta and I would never have expected that this game would greatly affect my life. When I started I did not have any experience and much expectation of the game, due to the genre - it was all new to me, however before trying out the game it took my friends awhile to get into the game because I did not like the fact the game was still at Beta and at that time I was detesting its predecessor DotA due to the fact the gameplay was confusing which it turned me off and also the graphics was years outdated without even trying the game out. I was able to give its successor a chance when a friend of mine introduced the ESports scene within the game community of the genre. I was hooked due to I never have expected that a type of sport has been running for almost a decade which it has been under my radar. I personally was not a fan for Sports in general although after hearing about ESports is completely change my perspective on both of the game and sports. ESports is a term for organized video game competitions, especially between professional. It is known as competitive gaming, professional gaming and cyber sport. The most common video game genres associated with electronic sports are real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena. Generally Dota 2 would fall under the MOBA genre due to it consists of session-based online multiplayer matches, in which two teams of five players attempt to destroy their opponents' fortified strongholds known as Ancients. Each player controls a "Hero" character and, over the course of an individual game, focuses on improving their Hero's abilities, acquiring items, and fighting against the other team. Welcome to Dota, You Suck, is a well-known proverb within the DotA Community, which is aimed at new player. In fact is the truth, especially for new to the genre, for the first dozen hours or so, you will be showered with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. On the other hand if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. It's an achievement owed to uncompromising depth and complex gameplay, being a free-to-play, and the great features developer Valve has built up around it. That said, you should not expect to have fun on your first day playing... or even your first week. It is due to the unforgiving players within your team which expects you to do your job flawlessly although it is impossible even pro players can make a mistake, however theres a method of this insanity. In order survive in Dota 2 you need to understand every single hero and mechanics and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and gold theyd get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of complex abilities. There are 102 Dota 2 heroes (and counting) each consist of different abilities and mechanics and serves different roles from each other. For example Riki, is an melee Agility hero in which when he acquire his ultimate at level 6 he becomes permanent invisible, which is an obvious choice for most of new player. However there are various ways to counter an invisble heroes, this can be done by purchasing either a Dust of Apperance, Sentry Wards or Gem of true sight, anyone can purschase these item during a game, making the game more balanced. In addition some heroes has an ability to track an invis heroes for a short period of time. In conclusion, DOTA 2 is fun and challenging and deeply rewarding unlike other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. It has clear visuals and more balance gameplay unlike League of Legends and has an incredible longevity

review: You see... As a true christian, I was raised to to believe the true saviour, gaben. But when I heard about this game I said "This game has everything I need, religion, no sinners and a very casual experience." I praised the lord for this mighty gift from the highest heights of heaven. So, like any other true christian would I decided to play and not stray away from the reightous path, but when I loaded up the game the loading screens were riddled with satanic images and meanings. I was outraged by this atrocity more than when my son told me he had "sinned" by doing some dispicable acts. As Matthew McConau said in chapter 16:9, "Thou hou slay thou demonic presence shou nourish in the heighest points of heaven". So, after I got away from them satanic signs I started to become somewhat suspicious of this game. I pressed play and began to sweat as the jesus juices excreted from my body. I crossed my heart and prayed to God to forgive me for this act of satanism and waited for the match to started. Upon the game starting I was stunned by the amount of pagon rituals and signs that were in the game. I closed my eyes and picked a random hero only to discover something truly horrifying. My beer had run out. My bacon stained, sweat soaked vest had ripped. The russians were here, they were everywhere. My ears started to bleed as the russian flame began. I tried to continue on the righteous path but sin was inevitable. I pressed enter, I started to flame back, my fingers were numb. And then I realised, I had sinned. My heart stopped, I could hear God reaching down to me, but even he could not stop this. I had become the thing I dreaded most (more than a gay person)... A Dota 2 player.

review: I've been playing DotA 1 since 2003. I switched to DotA 2 a couple months ago from all my friends shifting over. Here is a short list of pros and cons that I have seen in DotA 2 as opposed to DotA 1. Pros: * Better mechanics, many heros function differently in DotA 1 due to the restrictions of the Warcraft 3 World Editor. * Visually stimulating, DotA 2 has many ways to customize heros, couriers, wards, animations, and more. * Item drops, as opposed to DotA 1, even casual players can end up making some money just by playing. * Spectating * Much easier for new players to learn due to the new system to help starting players. * Builds display on the item panel * Has many events in which additional items can be earned * Has an in game mic system as well as quick toggle phrases. Cons: * Currently doesnt have all the heros or neutral camps that DotA 1 has. * Lacks some of the game modes of DotA 1. * Surprisingly, lacks some of the important mechanics of DotA 1. The most notable one that I can pull off the top of my head is Batriders napalm does not trigger any damage bonus on radiance + veil even when the threshold for doing so is met. * Servers tend to be down for a brief period of time after nearly every update. * Doesnt have as well of a language division as DotA 1. I que US east and west with the language of English in DotA 2; yet 1:3 games, if not more, will have another language. I wouldnt even mind if it was something like Spanish or French, but I am getting everything from Russian, Chinese, Portuguese, Ukraine, Korean, Japanese, and many more that I cant even identify. * Double courier is a lot harder to use in DotA 2, even with hotkeys and grouping. I find this to take away from bottle crowing as well as make it harder for 2 farmers to get their items quickly for they will likely be on the opposite sides of the map. Even if they arent, the offlane will still likely need it to get items to survive. Every game will only have 1 courier unless someone accidentally buys another. Neutral: * DotA 2 has much better pathing and makes it harder to get stuck on unpathable areas. This makes sure you will never stupidly get stuck somewhere, but also takes away from some hero abilities that do move other heroes or yourself. * There is currently no public lobby system. There is everything from private, fiends, guild, etc., but there is no way to host them publicly for anyone to join. * Your computer needs to be decent to run DotA 2. At least 4 GB of ram and a decent graphics card is highly advised. In conclusion, DotA 2 is definitely a f2p game that you should look into. If you have yet to play any MOBA it may seem a bit difficult at first, but it will grow on you. To avoid the initial hate you may come across, I advise having someone assist you with learning the basics or look up some tutorials online. Going into this game with absolutely no knowledge of how this game works is definitely not a good idea. Once you learn the game, it can easily become the most enjoyable strategy game you have ever played.

review: So after 781 hours of this game (up until 8/16/14), a lot of yelling by commendable teammates and dozens of items later, I still enjoy this game. Previously with most games, they get really repetitive and boring after about 200-250 hours but Dota 2 is not one of those kind of games. I would recommend for others as this is an incredible MOBA, but may be difficult to learn for the un-educated. I would not recommend for others to procrastinate from school/uni work. Trust me, I learnt the hard way. All in all, I give it a 10/10. Story Time! Me (Sven) 200 health: Probably should get back Milkman (Ogre) full: Ye, probably should *3 enemies come from nowhere* *thinking I'm going to die anyway* MIlkman: Dude, get back NOW!

review: This game is simply the most thrilling game I have ever played. The combantion of the complex mechanics and the team based gamplay make this one of the best games to play with friends. However this game has many, many side effects such as..... Trash Talking anybody on your and the enemy teams, Lose alot of sleep, any money that you have will be spent on usless cosmetics such as skins, hudskins and announcers. You will not eat any food as Dota is more important, you will learn to hate every member of your team or the enemy team that is from eastern europe (mostly the russians) as they suck balls at dota, everybody else on your team will apear worse than you and you will want to kill them with a blunt object. these are just some of the reason to play the amazing game that is DotA 2!

review: I started off hating this game due to its massive learning curve, and quite frankly that is a good thing to hate about it, some people don't want to dedicate a lot time of to ONE game, that's understandable. I put 10-15hrs into it across a few weeks and then uninstalled it. A year later I jump back into the game and gave it an ACTUAL try. They added a tutorial, after I finished that; learning a few things along the way, I starting playing easy bot practices with a few easier heroes. The game's less complicated than it is on surface, once you get going certain things quickly become easier, however certain things take a long time to learn which is where its learning curve comes into play. That's where a lot of people (including myself at a point) are put off by this game, LoL is an easier alternative. But once you break past those first few (horrible, death filled) matches of you being confused as hell and making a ton of mistakes the game really starts to shine. You see the depth the game contains, the tactics. You start to get sucked in (if you're anything like me.) You start finding heroes that suit your tastes. THAT is where the game shines. Once you've put about 30hrs in you're probably bored of bot matches, so public matches here you come. This is where the game is the best, and also where it's the worst. The game can get very intense, if you're with the right people; a lot of teamwork will come into play. But (especially for a newbie) this is where the game is at it's worst. The community in this game is among the worst I've ever seen. You will be yelled at for making minor (or major) mistakes, for some reason they don't realise you're new, and they were to at some point. You have to start somewhere with Dota, so with all of the above in mind, do you want to start?

review: I dont get this game, it's like Civilization, every one picks one of the 108 country but it's a 5v5 game. The diplomatic exchanges with your team mates are limited because you can trade a limited amount of luxuries and you have to spend a big amount of gold to upgrade your country, there is no research feature, also the spying are realy limited as you can only place "wards" (wich replace spys in this game) on the map but they are usless. They are city states but they just stand here and hit what's in range and never come to help you when you are far from them. Finaly there a only 3 era (early, mid and late) but it dont change much the gameplay and some country are too OP in the late era and you can't buy atomic bomb to nuke them 2/10, this game lacks a lot of content to pretend to be a Civlization-Like

review: This is a game that will quene you with people that have 40% of your Hours played. This game will show you the worst scum of the worst and will favor them in a Trial. This  game will show you that in this Cyber world, there is a hell, and you are in it once you start palying rankeds. This game will take away your will to get better at it by throwing hords of Russians, Peruvians, s and whatnot who speak only their Native language, but start playing a Ranked in which team Coordination and Communication are a MUST. This game will take away your hopes of a normal Match and it will leave you with a bad taste in your mounth once you lose a game by being the only one that did his job right and is not feeding. Overall i give this  game a 4/10, the game itself is worth at least a 9, but when you put Russians and  of the entire world together without putting them in their own servers or restricting them by their gameplay, this is what you get, people that cannot communicate and play together to win. I promise you, this games community will make you loose all hope in Humanity and in everything that is good, if youre unlucky, you will end up as one of them. I, for this matter, am abandoning this ship, after 1,3k hours played i finally figured, this game is being ed by its own community because it fails to set up people who can communicate, i might come back and play it once valve makes people stay in their respective regions by creating dedicated servers ( Like LoL ) but untill then, i will no longer participate in this Shitfest. Thank you and good luck trying to make something out of this game, you will need it. (FYI, im pretty sure there are some typos and grammatical errors but i dont really bother checking them right now) Regards, Steve, a once diehard Fan of this game who was hoping Valve would do something about the Community but was dissapointed over and over again.

review: Heroes of WHAT? League of WHAT? Sorry, what was that? I can't hear you clearly over THE AWESOMENESS OF DOTA.
game-hours: 13.5
review: Alright, listen up. Instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians, I'm going to tell you how Dota 2 really is at it's core. In a nutshell Dota 2 is a great game, but a terrible experience at the same time. You want to keep going back to it, but you also hate to go back. Why? One word: community. Dota 2's community is for the most part rude and hateful (and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own), sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting MOBA. It's unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake. Make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away... at the best of times. Often it's much worse and I would prefer not to go into the details. Sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you haven't actually done anything wrong. Occasionally though you come across friendly players, and when that happens, the game is a pure joy to play. However, since the game is 5v5, coming across four nice players at the same time (if you're solo queueing) is a rarity. Why then have I played the game for over 2000 hours? The sensation of winning. Your determination to keep playing, despite of the discouraging community, is fueled by the fantastic sensation of winning. That sweet moment when you see the enemy Ancient blow up and look back on the match, remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying. But even a victory can come with a grain of salt. Many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning. There is a mute option, but that doesn't stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat. People can intentionally feed the enemy team, ignore their own team, teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player. It's really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time. Going ranked doesn't really solve the problem either, at least not completely. Ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in Dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill. It feels much more professional and "tryhardish". Although you meet nice players more often, nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell. Having played some matches in ranked, I can say the mode isn't "hate free". I had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode. Another problem with ranked is that, like I said, it's more "tryhard". Many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and such. But don't get me wrong, Dota 2 is a great game in itself. The core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well. No technical issues to speak of (not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so, of which I have had none myself). Graphics are great and have a very subtle water painting type feel to them. All the various spells and abilites look great. The game is very deep and complex with tons of items, skill and item builds and strategies to learn. It can be a bit terrifying to beginners, but once you get the hang of things it's engaging. All the playable heroes are well balanced (although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being "OP") and free to play from the start. That's another thing the game does right. All the heroes are free and playable from the start, unlike Dota 2's undeniably very successful competitor, League of Legends. Dota 2's microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff, which means there are zero "pay to win" elements in the game. It really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this great game. To put it roughly in perspective, it's like playing Skyrim, but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make, calling you a "fooping idiot" every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective. Failed to kill Alduin? "Uninstall Skyrim, noob." Don't know how to make dragonbone armor? "Learn to play, tard." It's like that. Having played the game as long as I have, I would say that you are better off not playing Dota 2. The game is fun when you're winning (because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine)... which is 50% of the time. Sometimes not even when you're winning. It isn't the losses that make the game unpleasant, it's the unfriendly people. If you're one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you, you have a better chance of not finding Dota 2 so terrible. But realistically, why should you even have to? Videogames are supposed to be a form of entertainment and when you can't have fun half of the time, the game isn't worth it. People will tell you that Dota 2 is great, but that greatness comes with a price. Do take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view. This review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what it's really like, not just the great things. If you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis, then you're golden. The game is at it's best when you play with friends and don't have to worry about getting "a stick in the mud" player on your team. Great game with a bad community.

review: Dota 2 is a multiplayer game (though you can play against bots). There are two teams of five players - the Radiant, and the Dire. Each player picks from a list of many characters, each with a different set of abilities. The two teams start on opposing sides of the map (there's only one map in the game). Each team has a base area, in which resides an "Ancient". From each base, creeps - these autonomous NPC creatures - spawn periodically in waves, and start a journey toward's the other teams base. Towers are scattered around the map that will automatically fire on any enemy unit. The goal for each team is to destroy the other team's Ancient, while defending their own. Hence: Defense of the Ancients. Sounds simple - but there's a lot more to it than this. Imagine the game starts and both teams just stay in their own base. Creeps from both teams will wander out from one base and head to the other, meeting somewhere in the middle of the map, where they will fight (again, they do this automatically without any player input). The creeps are evenly matched so typically they will both wipe each other out. The next wave of creeps will clean up anything left over - or they'll reach a tower, and get smashed by it - and the cycle will continue. Basically, nothing will happen - the game will not end, because the creeps can't get anywhere. Now imagine just one player from one of the teams goes out with his creeps. He can attack the enemy creeps, and support his own creeps as they make their way across the map, knocking down towers along the way. Eventually, he'll get to the enemy Ancient, and be able to destroy it. But if just one enemy player comes out to meet him, the teams will be more evenly matched - and it comes down to a player versus player (PvP) scenario. The PvP is, of course, the heart of the game. It is of a high level of complexity - the learning curve is quite steep, making it challenging for noobs, which is one of the reasons why the community was famed for being full of what I will euphemistically call "short tempered people". One player who doesn't know what he is doing can easily bring down the whole team. The complexity comes from two main parts - first, the sheer number of selectable characters in the game. At the time of writing, there are 102 characters - with more added periodically as the game is updated. Each character has four different abilities (sometimes more) that are active (requiring the user to press something to make them go) or passive (they just operate automatically). The abilities are character-specific, though there are common elements between them. Some of the abilities require chaining to use them effectively, and each ability is leveled individually as your character earns experience. After you've done the maths and figured out how many different abilities there are between all the characters - and thought about how long it would take to become familiar with even a small handful of them - consider that in addition to that, there are over 120 different items that you can equip your character with. Items can perform new actions or augment your existing ones (again, they are active or passive in nature). Oh yeah - each game takes a long time to finish - around 45 minutes is pretty common. You will never get away with saying "I'll just have a quick game of Dota" to your significant other - at least, not once they've put up with you playing it a few times. So - learning curve. Big one. Time investment (or sink, if you prefer). Big one. Especially when you're trying to play with other people and they're abusing you for not knowing what you're doing. But the real question is - is it worth it? I've clocked up almost 400 games (and there's still some characters I haven't played). I'm not turning pro any time soon, but have a reasonable handle on the fundamentals. My win rate is about 50%, which seems to be fairly normal. Losing is often traumatic, especially after you've lost a couple of long 45-60 minute games in a row, or you're saddled with random teammates in the matchmaking who are abusive idiots (or just bad). But the games that are good - they're really good. With so many combinations and different ways to exploit them, the level of satisfaction when you're playing with friends and manage to co-ordinate a five-person push on a tower, laying down that perfect combo that takes advantage of all your abilities, wiping out the other team.... well, that's what keeps me coming back for more. Not only that, but once you've invested a bunch of time and gotten over some initial learning humps, it's genuinely fun exploring the different characters and item combinations. There are always new builds to try and new items to buy. I've gone through several "favourite characters", depending on which new ones I've played recently and how well they worked out with my natural play style and with my teammates. Even after around 400 hours of gametime, I still have more to explore. I do, however, only really enjoy playing the game with my friends. I've tried a few games "solo", just picking up teammates using the matchmaking service, and I find this massively less fun. It's less engaging because I typically don't like to communicate with randoms via voice, and your chances of picking up toxic players are increased. I've had good games with randoms, but generally don't bother playing unless my mates are online. As with all reviews, this one attempts to help answer the question: "should I buy this game?". Well, good news - Dota 2 is free. It has just come out of a long invite-only beta period, so your actual financial investment in whether or not you should get into the game is zero. But there are two big questions you need to ask yourself: 1. Can I justify the amount of time I need to get decent at this game before I start enjoying it? Make no mistake, the learning process for this game is An Ordeal. If you're prepared to spend many hours reading guides and playing with bots until you can beat them on a reasonable difficulty - maybe 10 games? - then that's a good start. If you've got mates that are happy to babysit you then that's good - but note that most of them will not want to do this because it almost certainly means they'll be losing (a lot) while you're still struggling with the basics. The best way to approach it is to read some guides - I recommend Welcome to Dota, You Suck - and play with bots until you can beat them on Hard, reliably, with one character. Then find some friends who are happy to play with you knowing your noob status, and play some games online with them. The more friends the better; if you're matchmaking with randoms they will probably be less tolerant. 2. Why is it free? I seriously can play this without paying anything? Dota 2 is built on the "freemium" model. It's free to play, and you can purchase in-game items for money. By giving the game away, Valve hope to make more money selling in-game items than if they'd charged for the game. This is an increasing trend - so get used to seeing it more, especially for games with a strong network effect (i.e., anything with multiplayer). The things you can buy for Dota 2 are basically adornments for the characters. For example, you can outfit them with new armour, or a new sword, or some new spell effects, that are different from the stock-standard one that they come with. You can get some of these for free - they'll randomly drop at the end of games - but the good ones for your preferred characters you'll have to shell out for. It's very important to note that these items are purely decorative and have no impact on the gameplay at all. You can't pay money for a new sword that does more damage - it just looks different. This is critical and stops the game from becoming a silly pay-to-win thing. If you're a content creator, you can also create your own stuff and sell it in the store (splitting revenue with Valve).

review: To fully illustrate what makes DOTA one of the most compelling multiplayer games of all time, it helps to have a bit of background on the game itself. DOTA has its roots as a Warcraft 3 modification. Warcraft 3 introduced a unique mechanic in its campaign and multiplayer modes of "hero" units - units that actually gained experience points, abilities, and items as the game progresses. This really made it feel like you had an investment in these units, and you grew attached to them. To a degree these hero units, effectively commanders of your army of relatively disposable units, became your avatar in-game. It was a brilliant concept, and DOTA took it a step further. DOTA created a multiplayer mode that focused *exclusively* on playing these hero units - it removed the base building and unit management seen in the standard RTS format. It's one of the best examples of "less is more" than I've ever seen, and that description hardly does it justice. Managing your individual hero and your income, position on the map, constant decision making, and being able to size yourself up versus your enemy brings more depth than any other game I've ever played. I've yet to play any other multiplayer game where *every* member of your 5-man team is crucial to your victory. Everyone must do their part, and do it better than the other 5-man team. There are very few cases of where a game can be winnable 4v5, and teamwork becomes a huge factor. In the most intense and close games, the level of immersion really can't be matched. It's hard to think of another game that draws you in more than DOTA, especially when other people are counting on you to do well! It's a hectic, stressful, enormously complex and in-depth experience - not to mention absurdly fun. This is what keeps me coming back, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to really experience what multiplayer gaming can truly offer. If you're new to the game and want some background on specific heroes and strategies, or just want to watch some gameplay, be sure to check out my YouTube channel. Thanks for reading!

Actually i could say that the transition from Dota->Dota 2 gameplay was amazing,they didn't forgot a single thing and added even more than original Dota.The game got amazingly cool graphics and a great Soundtrack.The menu organisation are very simply and easy to understand to all new players.Valve really cares about your learning in Dota2 so they've made a "Learning" page where they "teach" you how to play better by making you a recommendation of the best items (Dota 2 have in stores always recommended items for you to purchase for each hero),because Dota 1 didn't had that option,so you need to now by your experience what to buy.They have videos where they show you each skill of each hero and it does.If you also want you can play with tips in your game if you need more help and also ask a more "professional" player to teach you (it's called coach),he will spectate your game and make you tips. The gameplay is amazing,i love it because it's very realistic and logic (dota 2 got a lot of logic,instead mobas like lol don't have).The art of Heroes are sorry but i'll repeat it,are amazing,everything is amazing in dota (almost) xD Still dota got some problems that need to be corrected: 1st-The community.Dota 2 community is full of stupid noobish kids,who don't know how to play and don't even learn how to play,and when you say them don't feed or other item,they'll always say to you fuc...you,noob,i've fuc.. your mother...(typical answer of russian 12 y.o kids). 2-Some updates that don't needed to be done (like removing the pudge fountain hook,because it had a lot of logic....and they removed it).but nevermind to this. 3-I can't tell you if Dota2 still got many bugs or not,but i notice that they still have a few,like shop bug where you can't buy items. 4-Servers.I don't know why but it's normal to have the servers down in dota2,and sometimes in the game will appear "Searching for Dota2 Network",don't know why this happens but probably their servers can't hold so much people?(my opinion). So yeah thats pretty what i've wrote.I hope you play this game and like it and enjoy as i do. Good Luck & Have Fun :)

review: DOTA 2 is a fun and challenging game where you and 4 mentally challenged people fight off against 5 high skilled players, the main objective of the game is to defend your base from the enemies for as long as you can (since no one on your team will try to attack the enemy base anyway). You can also yell at your teammates for trying to 1v5 , or farming the jungle while your team dies! Communicating and working together is crucial in this game to get the high score for "Longest time trying to carry your team" You can choose from a wide selection of really well-made and balanced heroes like Huskar and Death Prophet. You fight the enemy heroes on "Lanes", pathways across the maps where your creeps spawn and try to attack the enemies on the other side of the river, people refer to these lanes as Top, Bot, and Mid or feed. You can also tell your teammates that the enemies on your lane are missing, warning them about a possible gank, but for some reason that function doesn't seem to work. Last - hitting creeps and enemy heroes grant you gold, but keep in mind that no one on your team besides you has the ability to do that . Getting kills or good items only help you defend against the enemies longer, since the result will ALWAYS be the same! DOTA 2 is also a very educational game, yes! From Russian to Spanish, you will expand your vocabulary greatly! It also teaches you new ways to break your keyboard and monitor everytime you play!  YOU, DOTA  YOU

review: Very similar to League of Legends, although I haven't played League of Legends. Been looking at gameplay of the two and Dota 2 looks better overall. If your contemplating getting one of the two I would suggest Dota 2, played a bit of it and the people I was with didn't mind that I was a bit of a 'noob'. So from what i've experienced, the Dota 2 community is the complete opposite to the League of Legends community. Anyways; about the game. The game seems very competitive; as a new player you will encounter various players who are way better than you. First game I played two of my opponents had 0 deaths at the end of the game and a fair few kills (We did win though). You also will get loads of team mates who sit in the spawn; AFK, this is because they are just there to get the exp at the end and cant be bothered with the game. Why get the game to be AFK, and you are not contributing by doing so. Basically, you help the minions on whatever side you are on make their way to the enemies base. Pick one of three paths and guide the endlessly spawning minions down your path where you will destroy two enemy towers. The other paths will have your team mates on who SHOULD be supporting the minions on their path. You will encounter enemy packs of minions which will usually have a player supporting them. (As I said; a lot of them will be better than you). You earn exp whenever you are around and helping your minions kill other minions. You also get exp for killing other players. You will level up which lets you upgrade your 4 abilities which are all useful in different ways. You slowly earn gold randomly which can be used to buy various items. You have to find a merchant in the middle of the forest if you want to purchase the best items. You also earn more gold from getting killing blows on minions and enemy players. The game does take some stratergy so you must develop your specific playstyle while also contributing to your teams gains. Dont try to take someone elses playstyle if they are beating you with it as you will not be able to pick it up quickly. If you like the sound of this game then I really recommend getting this game as it can be addictive. There are people with over 4000 hours on this game; theres your proof on the addicting thing. It is very fun with friends.

review: Dota 2 is a multiplayer game (though you can play against bots). There are two teams of five players - the Radiant, and the Dire. Each player picks from a list of many characters, each with a different set of abilities. The two teams start on opposing sides of the map (there's only one map in the game). Each team has a base area, in which resides an "Ancient". From each base, creeps - these autonomous NPC creatures - spawn periodically in waves, and start a journey toward's the other teams base. Towers are scattered around the map that will automatically fire on any enemy unit. The goal for each team is to destroy the other team's Ancient, while defending their own. Hence: Defense of the Ancients. Sounds simple - but there's a lot more to it than this. Imagine the game starts and both teams just stay in their own base. Creeps from both teams will wander out from one base and head to the other, meeting somewhere in the middle of the map, where they will fight (again, they do this automatically without any player input). The creeps are evenly matched so typically they will both wipe each other out. The next wave of creeps will clean up anything left over - or they'll reach a tower, and get smashed by it - and the cycle will continue. Basically, nothing will happen - the game will not end, because the creeps can't get anywhere. Now imagine just one player from one of the teams goes out with his creeps. He can attack the enemy creeps, and support his own creeps as they make their way across the map, knocking down towers along the way. Eventually, he'll get to the enemy Ancient, and be able to destroy it. But if just one enemy player comes out to meet him, the teams will be more evenly matched - and it comes down to a player versus player (PvP) scenario. The PvP is, of course, the heart of the game. It is of a high level of complexity - the learning curve is quite steep, making it challenging for noobs, which is one of the reasons why the community was famed for being full of what I will euphemistically call "short tempered people". One player who doesn't know what he is doing can easily bring down the whole team. The complexity comes from two main parts - first, the sheer number of selectable characters in the game. At the time of writing, there are 102 characters - with more added periodically as the game is updated. Each character has four different abilities (sometimes more) that are active (requiring the user to press something to make them go) or passive (they just operate automatically). The abilities are character-specific, though there are common elements between them. Some of the abilities require chaining to use them effectively, and each ability is leveled individually as your character earns experience. After you've done the maths and figured out how many different abilities there are between all the characters - and thought about how long it would take to become familiar with even a small handful of them - consider that in addition to that, there are over 120 different items that you can equip your character with. Items can perform new actions or augment your existing ones (again, they are active or passive in nature). Oh yeah - each game takes a long time to finish - around 45 minutes is pretty common. You will never get away with saying "I'll just have a quick game of Dota" to your significant other - at least, not once they've put up with you playing it a few times. So - learning curve. Big one. Time investment (or sink, if you prefer). Big one. Especially when you're trying to play with other people and they're abusing you for not knowing what you're doing. But the real question is - is it worth it? I've clocked up almost 400 games (and there's still some characters I haven't played). I'm not turning pro any time soon, but have a reasonable handle on the fundamentals. My win rate is about 50%, which seems to be fairly normal. Losing is often traumatic, especially after you've lost a couple of long 45-60 minute games in a row, or you're saddled with random teammates in the matchmaking who are abusive idiots (or just bad). But the games that are good - they're really good. With so many combinations and different ways to exploit them, the level of satisfaction when you're playing with friends and manage to co-ordinate a five-person push on a tower, laying down that perfect combo that takes advantage of all your abilities, wiping out the other team.... well, that's what keeps me coming back for more. Not only that, but once you've invested a bunch of time and gotten over some initial learning humps, it's genuinely fun exploring the different characters and item combinations. There are always new builds to try and new items to buy. I've gone through several "favourite characters", depending on which new ones I've played recently and how well they worked out with my natural play style and with my teammates. Even after around 400 hours of gametime, I still have more to explore. I do, however, only really enjoy playing the game with my friends. I've tried a few games "solo", just picking up teammates using the matchmaking service, and I find this massively less fun. It's less engaging because I typically don't like to communicate with randoms via voice, and your chances of picking up toxic players are increased. I've had good games with randoms, but generally don't bother playing unless my mates are online. As with all reviews, this one attempts to help answer the question: "should I buy this game?". Well, good news - Dota 2 is free. It has just come out of a long invite-only beta period, so your actual financial investment in whether or not you should get into the game is zero. But there are two big questions you need to ask yourself: 1. Can I justify the amount of time I need to get decent at this game before I start enjoying it? Make no mistake, the learning process for this game is An Ordeal. If you're prepared to spend many hours reading guides and playing with bots until you can beat them on a reasonable difficulty - maybe 10 games? - then that's a good start. If you've got mates that are happy to babysit you then that's good - but note that most of them will not want to do this because it almost certainly means they'll be losing (a lot) while you're still struggling with the basics. The best way to approach it is to read some guides - I recommend Welcome to Dota, You Suck - and play with bots until you can beat them on Hard, reliably, with one character. Then find some friends who are happy to play with you knowing your noob status, and play some games online with them. The more friends the better; if you're matchmaking with randoms they will probably be less tolerant. 2. Why is it free? I seriously can play this without paying anything? Dota 2 is built on the "freemium" model. It's free to play, and you can purchase in-game items for money. By giving the game away, Valve hope to make more money selling in-game items than if they'd charged for the game. This is an increasing trend - so get used to seeing it more, especially for games with a strong network effect (i.e., anything with multiplayer). The things you can buy for Dota 2 are basically adornments for the characters. For example, you can outfit them with new armour, or a new sword, or some new spell effects, that are different from the stock-standard one that they come with. You can get some of these for free - they'll randomly drop at the end of games - but the good ones for your preferred characters you'll have to shell out for. It's very important to note that these items are purely decorative and have no impact on the gameplay at all. You can't pay money for a new sword that does more damage - it just looks different. This is critical and stops the game from becoming a silly pay-to-win thing. If you're a content creator, you can also create your own stuff and sell it in the store (splitting revenue with Valve).

review: I used to be a healthy and contributing member of society until I encountered Dota 2. The moment I started playing it, I thought to myself "Wow.", "This is it.", "The game that will finally do what no other can." I was right, ever since I played Dota 2, my family has disowned me, I lost my job, my girlfriend dumped me, and I was left by my dog. Instead of talking civilly to other human beings like I used to, I now simply scream expletives at them without even looking. I no longer have to remember purposeless numerics such as my social security number, my cellphone number, my age, and even the number of children I have. Before I played Dota 2, I thought I can measure my life's worth with useless factors such as my income, quality of living, or contribution to society, but now I know the truth and realize how foolish I was, Dota 2 taught me the true meaning of living, that is, one's MMR, the one thing that separates 7k gods from other 1k scrub trash. After Dota 2, I have never looked at life the same way again. 10/10

Its very addictive especially once you get the hang of it. My favorite characters are Sven and Zeus, they're pretty good. I personally think Ursa and Sniper are overused, So you may wanna use some underused characters like Death Prophet! >:D Have fun playing!

review: Listen here, you uncouth curs. This a game about "heroes." Not "champions," HEROES. They go around and do crazy  like hit each other with magic and , all high fantasy nonsense. Look here man, I watched some lady dressed all in black two shot a ing god, where else can you find this level of ludicrosity!? WHERE?! On top of that, this game goes way back. It has like, an established culture and if you don't follow it, you will be ostrascized as if this were ing Sydney. That was a lame  joke but it makes sense because where else would find a rat- ostrich than Australia?! WHERE?! All you need to know is that words like "" and "blat" are some of the finest praise that you can get in this game, and feel free to use them when you see an invoker drop an EMP or when you look at the shop and look all lost and confused. You will fit in just fine. But what the  do I know? I just play wtf mode with my one really cool friend and this other guy who I really dont like to be seen in public with.

review: What is Dota 2?  A welcoming community, where everyone is so kind, that they are even ready to take care of your relatives, especially your dear mother.  9/10 players are always ready to play with you  A very multicultural community. It literally erases the borders between genders, nations, ages, anything. Just like in real life, you can meet foreigners anywhere.  Has a lot of mini-games within such as: King of the Hill, Hot Rapier (a Dota 2 version of "Hot potato"), Hide and Seek, Base Race and many others.  Experienced players are always ready to teach you how to play. Always.

I personally like this a whole lot more than League. Dota 2 has all of the things League of Legends is missing, like couriers and a stash. It's free and the costumizables are a huge bonus, just like in TF2 with all the hats. Although it might be hard in the beginning, if you stick to it I'm sure you'll find many hours of fun, and to add one last thing: it's best played with friends!

review: 10/10. By playing this game you basically sell your soul to Gabe Newell. Aside being one of the best balanced ARTS games ever, other features include: > Dota 2 offers a system called "matchmaking" that allows you to learn multiple foreign languages. > For a fee ranging from BZZ pugna bracers to Dragonclaw Hook, you can customise any hero's look (Except Zeus, he is already fabulous.) with virtual hats. > Owning and frequently playing Dota 2 allows you to safely assume every other ARTS (or MOBA, in other languages such as LoLspeak) is inferior and therefore concluding that Dota 2 is the best game of its genre. > A very balanced ranking system measured in "MMR" also known as "e-peen points" that has no meaning whatsoever past the 6000 mark, since matchmaking pairs you with 4000 MMR players and 5000 MMR bought accounts. Bored with the game? No problem! You can indulge in the world of Dota without playing via a plethora of ways: > You can participate in Steam discussions where you can assume you know what you're talking about. > Go on reddit and discuss anything about Dota, whether it's a thread about serious metagame discussion, or a thread about Arteezy tweeting about a thread about Arteezy tweeting. > Or you could experience the "pinnacle" of human stupidity by participating in any popular Dota 2 stream's twitch chat. The persons chatting there offer a broad range of insight about the stream or the game in general, be it "() I'M LOL FAN AND I HAVE DOWN SYNDROME ()" ,"   (___FISSURE_____()" or the simple, yet very concise "322" or "fEEd."

review: How to Properly Play the Game Step 1: Open Dota 2 and jump straight into matchmaking in Russia, it is multi-functional as you can learn Dota 2 AND Russian racial slurs Step 2: Pick the coolest looking character you can find Step 3: After you picked Meepo, head to the middle lane Step 4: Die to the enemy, it shall boost their morale to make them more reckless Step 5: Keep dying, it probably will pay off Step 6: At the 15 minute mark, buy the courier that everybody has been swearing about Step 7: Click on the courier Step 8: AHA! YOU CLICKED ON THE COURIER! Now, you will forever be a Donkey, in the midst of your confusion, bravely clop to the battlefield Step 9: After much "wtf", blame the support for being a noob to keep your reputation intact Step 10: After you lost the match, head towards to the store and buy everything you can to improve. Cooler looking stuff should probably buff your character, right? Step 11: Get mistaken for a pro due to your accessories Step 12: Repeat steps 4, 5, 9, and 10 until you lose your soul Step 13: Sue Valve to calm your emotional distress

review: A great game filled with action and strategy. Takes a very long time to learn, longer to master. After 700 hours I still cant play each hero, and havent mastered quite all of the advanced mechanics. You must play this game for 50-100 hours before you can even think about deciding if its a game for you. It is very competetive, and sensitive people will not enjoy it. You will be insulted, a lot. If you get to a high lvl and have played many matches like me, you wont be paired up with Peruvians or Russian quite as much, but at the beginning there will be someone who doesnt speak English (in a U.S. English server) and they will most likely suck and lose the game for you. There will be heros that will wreck you every game until you (and those idiots you call allies) learn how to play against them. Even after all the hardships, I'm still playing this game. Those 700 hours? I found this game 6 months ago, 500 of those hours only on the weekends, even with school. It's a fun game, but people suck. Enjoy

review: Okay, I recommend and do NOT recommend at the same time: Why I recommend: - It's a Valve game, Come on people! - The training missions are good. I put 2 hours into them. - It's freaking free - Just get it if you're looking for a random game to play Why I do no recommend: - It just sucks - I am not the kind of person to play this game. - I like campaigns, not massively multiplayer stuff.

review: When I first started DOTA2 I was a little overwhelmed, as my first ARTS/MOBA game it was pretty complicated. I soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying. Before I knew it, I was performing  and better. I stopped making silly  and  got vastly better at not  the enemy . For the  part, everyone I've met was very helpful and , there  the   however. As  - play DOTA2    ,  ,     .      !

review: To fully illustrate what makes DOTA one of the most compelling multiplayer games of all time, it helps to have a bit of background on the game itself. DOTA has its roots as a Warcraft 3 modification. Warcraft 3 introduced a unique mechanic in its campaign and multiplayer modes of "hero" units - units that actually gained experience points, abilities, and items as the game progresses. This really made it feel like you had an investment in these units, and you grew attached to them. To a degree these hero units, effectively commanders of your army of relatively disposable units, became your avatar in-game. It was a brilliant concept, and DOTA took it a step further. DOTA created a multiplayer mode that focused *exclusively* on playing these hero units - it removed the base building and unit management seen in the standard RTS format. It's one of the best examples of "less is more" than I've ever seen, and that description hardly does it justice. Managing your individual hero and your income, position on the map, constant decision making, and being able to size yourself up versus your enemy brings more depth than any other game I've ever played. I've yet to play any other multiplayer game where *every* member of your 5-man team is crucial to your victory. Everyone must do their part, and do it better than the other 5-man team. There are very few cases of where a game can be winnable 4v5, and teamwork becomes a huge factor. In the most intense and close games, the level of immersion really can't be matched. It's hard to think of another game that draws you in more than DOTA, especially when other people are counting on you to do well! It's a hectic, stressful, enormously complex and in-depth experience - not to mention absurdly fun. This is what keeps me coming back, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to really experience what multiplayer gaming can truly offer. If you're new to the game and want some background on specific heroes and strategies, or just want to watch some gameplay, be sure to check out my YouTube channel. Thanks for reading!

review: If you're looking for a good, visually appealing and challenging game, perhaps you like League of Legends a lot but you're looking for a new game? Then this is for you. I personally like this a whole lot more than League. Dota 2 has all of the things League of Legends is missing, like couriers and a stash. It's free and the costumizables are a huge bonus, just like in TF2 with all the hats. Although it might be hard in the beginning, if you stick to it I'm sure you'll find many hours of fun, and to add one last thing: it's best played with friends!

review: I highly recommend this over it's competitor, Rosetta Stone. While Rosetta Stone promised "Adaptive Learning", "Social Sharing", and "Community Learning", I found Dota 2 to be a much better product in terms of cultural exposure and hands on training. Unlike Rosetta Stone, Dota 2 matches you up with real Spanish-speakers, Russian-speakers, or dirty Pinoys that are fresh off the boat and ready to help you delve into their ethnic practices and language. As an English speaker, I learned the Peruvian dialect of Spanish in less than 3 months solely playing Dota 2 for an hour a day. I highly recommend this game. As we say in Spanish, "jajajajajaj gringo noob la  madre concha tu madre. idiota hijo de la gran  calla csm. que huevon eres. pajero de  .l. jajajajaj xDDD."

Blaming you in a common indicator to show that theyre russian - well this seems legit but its not always as easy as some of them are playing with a name of arabic letters, dont show that theyre russian or sometimes even write in english - You need to grab those black sheep as they refuse to offer free classes of russian - zz thats quite unfair whilst the rest puts a lot of effort into teaching. Spanish and portuguese isnt any use for us as we only want to learn languages which help us in everyday life. 700 million people all around the world is fairly and squarely a joke compared to the use it is to win a russian friend (Geez theyre crazy fun fellows) and have lots of fun trying to get a russian accent while talking to them (and of course) attaching the previous words which strenghten the bond of friendship between you and your feeding teammates.

Other than that, when you're in a game, the little book thing in the top left contains community guides that will light up which skills you should get in order.

review: Dota 2. Well, Dota 2 is definitely the best game I have ever played in my whole life. From this game I gained so many awesome friends,mates and never felt bored while playing with them. It's a fun game if played with friends. Dota 2 requires TeamWork in order to win the game properly. Dota 2 is purely based on Skill. And I said this for four reasons : 1-Counter picking. 2-Map awareness. 3-When to start a team fight when to defend. 4-Picking right items. Plus the more you play Dota 2, the more you want to learn about the game, and then you will enjoy playing it more than anytime! So actually Dota 2 is more like a team game. But playing solo is an other story... In solo matchmaking TeamWork is laughable. People will most likely tell you what to do step by step. If you don't follow what they're telling you. [All chat] "report player". Your random teammates will blame you for every single mistake you have done. And they won't even try to help you. They will just start insulting you in [All chat] and this will result to a lost game. I have tried to be nice with all my teammates when playing SOLO but as everytime, it's either I carry the team or I will lose the game. it's my mates attitude, I rarely get to play with people who speaks English properly. I will always get the " squad" spamming in [All chat], "REPORT INVOKER NO GANK!!" " blat, adi nahoo". I'm not quite sure what they're saying, but I'm positive, they're insulting me or my mother, most of the time. Well of course there are nice guys, but they are rare. Overall this game is awesome and somewhat addictive. B E C A R E F U L L. 8/10

review: I'll give a thumbs up only because the game itself is pretty good, but this is not an actual review, its more like a short summary about my over 900 hours spent into this game (LOL n00b cant write  until 2kh NOOB). I started playing it because my friends convinced me, and because almost everybody in the forum I post on play this. So I started playing it both with my friends and solo. Today at the end of my very last match(which I lost) I realized that I have never had fun in this game. I mean, out of 900 hours I can only remember like, 7-8 really funny moments where I actually laughed. Oh, the irony of fate, the very last laugh was in my very last match. I was Earthshaker top dire in lane with Warlock against Death Prophet and Batrider, we got first blood like 10 seconds after the 00:00 mark, I spotted DP warding our jungle, I used fissure to block her escape way and Warlock used Shadow Word. While we were AA her, she started to move left and right like she didn't know what to do, it looked like she was dancing, and it reminded me of that case of mass hysteria happening around the early XVI century in France, where several people started dancing uncontrollably for weeks until they died(yes I know, my interests are ed up), and THAT actually made me laugh, THAT to me was a funny moment, not the quick first blood, not the 2 more kills we did on bat in the next couple of minutes (warlock got all of them btw) but the fact that DP started dancing while we were beating her up. This made me think a little, but only for a couple of seconds, there's a game to win here guys! Focus! There's very little to say about what happened next, the typical things that usually happen in a bad, unranked, 0 MMR, trench  tier match; me without blink until 25:00; our Drow disconnecting (and abandoned) cause of PC problems, Lina with Aghanim and no Meka; wards only for half match(I'm guilty of it too); we lost Roshan two times, over 20 kills of difference for the Radiants, Lina and Storm Spirit arguing with each other, calling names, your mama did this, your fatha did that, your sista lul  don't evel let me start on that one, and so on. At the very end of the match, we hid in the fountain waiting for them to FF GG WP EZ QQ M8S ecc, and in that moment, reading the argue between Lina and Storm, i asked myself some questions: Am i having fun? Is this game making me laugh? How many funny moments i can remember about this game? Is that normal that to me every single match i've done looks exactly the same as the others(lul of cuz yes u ing <2kh scum n00b)? The answers to the questions were: no, no, not even 10, i don't know. In that instant, I realized that this game, to me, was just a gigantic waste of time. How many times have I actually enjoyed what was going on on screen? Why am I taking this so seriously? Why do I want to win so desperately? Why do my teammates want to win so desperately? ... How many times have I smiled while playing this game? ... These are not pro player matches we play, we are earning nothing from this, there's no need to yell at each other! This makes me sad. I've heard yelling my whole life, I play games because they help me forget about how life is hard, to relax and laugh at the hundreds and hundreds of funny, silly, nonsense moments this beautiful piece of software can gift me. Games really help me, they help me a lot. Please, guys, stop, dont get mad, Im serious! This is a game, right? Games are meant to be fun! Please stop arguing, we lost a videogame, its not the end of the world, next time you will win, we will all win :) and even if you don't, who cares! Its just a videogame! Enjoy the little things you can get out of it! Remember DP dancing to death? Wasn't that fun? Remember Pudge denying himself after we wasted literally all we got at him? And then the Radiants team wiped us? Yes, we lost money and experience, but wasn't that kinda fun? Sorta fun? Even a little bit? Yes we lost this match but cmon! Don't hide in the fountain! Lets do something silly to them! Lets annoy them! Storm, use your ulti to get near them and then immediately go back in the fountain! Lets watch them throwing everything at you in the attempt of catching you! Isn't that fun? :D <<Storm?>> <<Storm?>> <<Storm?, are you listening to me?, Storm are you still arguing with Lina because of her Aghanim? She made a mistake, everybody makes mistakes, there is no need to take it personally! Now she knows that Aghanim is a no-no, shes got it, now just chill out man, its a game!>> :D *SLAP* << :O b-but Storm, w-why? ;( >> <<BECAUSE U R A ING L0SER THATS WHY YOU PIECE OF SHIET!

review: Dota 2 is a Multiplayer Online Battle Area (MOBA) game with a huge community and fanbase. This game takes the player's hand-to-eye coordination, decision making, reaction time and teamwork and puts it to the test in a 5 vs 5 situation. Unlike most of the MOBA games on the market Dota 2 is free of charge from the beginning with no money, in-game or real money being spent to unlock playable characters meaning players do not have an advantage over others on the choices they have and it's easier for beginners to get to know a hero. However this game does have a rather steep learning 'cliff' (similar to a learning curve but instead of gradually learning, it takes some time then the game *snaps* into focus for you and you become pretty good and then it's a normal learning curve from there on). There are a few issues with the levels of toxicity of some of the players but overall this is a good game, higly addictive though and you'll probably end up being glued to the screen for hours on end.

review: Dota 2 is one of those games which cause a myriad of emotions. You'll love it and hate it all at the same time but that doesn't stop it from being the most competitive and professional eSport games on the planet. One of the first negative things you're going to encounter in Dota 2 is the learning curve. It isn't like most games. It requires knowledge of many unique aspects and only after encountering every hero at least once, will you start to get comfortable. If you want to take Dota 2 seriously, or even casually, prepare to invest a lot of time. Guides can of course cut this time substantially. When you do learn to play, you will be rewarded with one of the biggest feelings of accomplishment of any game. You will feel like a god among men - but remember, most people feel this, and as such, the Dota community is one of arrogant and toxic tossers. There are nice players, but there are plenty of unpleasant ones. If you want to play Dota 2 properly, you need to play with friends - or just learn to mute people. Overall, Dota 2 is a team game that is really hard to play casually. You will either love it or hate it - but more often than not, both at the same time.

review: Dota 2 is probably tied with Call of Duty for the best online multiplayer indie anime game. The people who made this game knew what they needed to do to make this into the great game that it is today. I have about .3 hours on this game and I can tell you those were the best .3 hours of my life. The great thing about this game is the friendly community, I remember after a match the person on the opposite team said I was a , I assumed that was the German word for Gg. All and all I reccomend this game to any one who loves a game with a good campaign and story. And remember to say  after every Dota 2 match.

review: Day in the life of Dota 2 player: -Wake up in the morning and think about playing some Dota but instead prepare for school. -Watch some famous players play Dota the last few minutes you have before you leave. -Get on the bus and fall asleep only to think about Dota. -Get to class and make murmurs here and there about Dota and curses about noobs or matches you lost. -Get random smiles throughout the day when you remember a really amazing match, but sadly have nobody to share it with because all your friends play League. -Get on the bus to get home and realize you have a lot of homework, have to walk far from the bus to get home, and play Dota. -Run like a mad man from bus stop to get home for Dota. -Have an argument with yourself on whether you should play Dota or finish your project you have been putting off for Dota. -Play dota for only 1 match he says. Finishes at 10pm he does. -Hate yourself because you didnt finish any work, talk to any non-Dota friends, and played 7+ hours of Dota. -Cry yourself to sleep and wake up in the morning to do it again. Dota has essentially ruined my life. I went onto the steam store to find a F2P game because I was always bored with hours of time. I played stuff like warface and what not and I kept seeing this. I had also heard about youtubers making jokes about the game so I figured why the heck not. Played the game ONCE. That's when the addiction started. Soon my hours of freetime reduced to minutes, seconds, sometimes I would stay up 3+ hours later just to play more matches. DONT EVEN THINK OF MAKING FRIENDS ON HERE, THEY ONLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO PLAY MORE. Dota has essentially taken my life away, and I must say im ing loving it. Dota is love Dota is life. Warning game causes following symptoms: -Racism towards Russians for reasons you don't even udnerstand, -Insomnia -Anxiety -High blood Pressure -Low blood Sugar -Malnutrition -EXTREME LEVELS OF STRESS -Hyperventalation -High amounts of giddyness and happyness -Extremem amounts of sadness -Rage And carpul tunnel.

review: Created by Blizzard and stolen by Valve, Dota 2 is one of today's most popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena games, with a mere 9 million more monthly players than its close competitor, Avalon Heroes. Based on a third-party modification for Warcraft III, Dota 2 strives to fill the wallets of its developers and empty the wallets of its players. This classic strategy game offers a substantial amount of playable heroes (each with their own unique and blatantly overpowered abilities to fit any playstyle), only one map and a metric buttload of entirely worthless cosmetic items. Being the best video game in existence comes at a price: Dota 2 has a very steep learning curve, requiring an estimated 14 years played before gaining a basic understanding of how the game works and another 30 years to get a very weak grasp of any one hero's hundreds of thousands of spells and abilities. On top of individual skill, this game heavily relies on teamwork, coordination and communication - this ensures that you will get buttraped the first 500 games you play. Also it's free. Rubbish game straight from the bargain bin; 10/10.

review: A team game were over 90% of people dont want to cooperate, play as a team, talk, plan, do strats and so on. Game looks good at first, but at the end of the day, its just a horrible online experience. If you have a 5 man stack, with good game knowledge, good coordination, yeah matches can be decent (but i recommend setting up "inhouse matches" with another 5 man stack!!). If you dont have a 5 man stack, its a pub train all day (or just plain bad/noobish). You win 50-5, then you lose 45-7, then you win 41-17, then you lose 60-28 and so on. Its all about the "lucky roll of the dice" named matchmaking. Most players that play this game have lvl 0-1 accounts, with only dota or other free to play games. So dont think if you report them, they care. They just make another account to troll, feed or w/e. Also, alot of people play this game drunk, stoned, or just very tired. That can be ok i guess in a 1v1 game, or a 2v2 with one of their buddies. But in a 5v5 team game, its not nice. They just ruin the experience for alot of other people. Most people use their own language. Chatting or writing. Teamspeak or just skype is not on their menu. So most russians will speak russian, most turks will speak turkish and so on. There is no region lock. Again, for a 1v1 game, maybe that could work. But for a game like dota, having a player from Australia or Peru joining the Euro server with 300-400 ping is not cool. And alot of people just check more servers for faster queue times and also check more languages. So if you check EU West or US East, and expect all people to have good pings and speak english, think again :)). At least some of the dota 2 players, played wc3 or dota 1, dont even get me started with the other mobas... Its the only genre that makes me feel ive wasted my time in most cases when i play the game. Bonus: People either flame/curse etc, or just dont know what the hell they are doing. In most cases both ^_^ So, i recommend using your free time / gaming time, playing other games. And stay away from all free to play team games / MMO's. They are a magnet for trolls, kids or just noobs that dont care. And you know why? Bcuz they can make 1000 accounts... So if they get banned or their ranking has gone down, its no problem, new acc on the way. Its kinda sad, game could have been fun. But its not. And thigs will never change bcuz of all the reasons ive stated above. The game at its core is good, but the overall online experience is bad. Cant recommend this for a new player, a true newbie. Cant recommend this either for an old skool RTS player. These guys online dont even look at the minimap!! So most of the time the games/matches wont be good and fun. Even most of the wins are fun just bcuz you had fun / a good talk or w/e, with a real life friend that you had on skype, or a gaming friend that you laned with, not bcuz of the dota match tbh. So just go and drink beer with that mate, or just play other games with him/them. With this concept of f2p and team gameplay, i cant see valve fixing this, so i cant see a reason to recommend this. Sure you can get random good matches, but after all my experience playing this, i think you are better off without this game / genre completely. Peace!

review: This is truly a masterpiece of gaming. Naughty Dog's latest title, and their first foray into the first-person shooter genre, is without a doubt a dazzling success. Drumstick of the Albatross 2, co-designed by Gabe Newell and David "Phreak" Turley, has everything: HUNDREDS of weapons to choose from, an ENORMOUS array of materials obtainable to build one's own home base, and THREE different unlockable character models. At the low price of $5.99 each, booster packs are an amazing addition, allowing one's character and mount to be personalized even further. But where DotA 2 really shines is in its gameplay. The tight control scheme, designed exclusively for the Steam controller, allows a seemingly seamless interface between man and machine--you ARE the character. The experience of battling with enemy mechs up-close and personal is unrivalled by any game, especially with the advanced mango physics. Overall, I would rate DotA 2 a 9.8/10 experience; its only flaw is the slight lack of purchasable, pay-to-win content that I usually rely on to make my gaming experiences successful. I'd love to see a DotA 3, especially if Zynga takes a note out of Blizzard's book and makes the game dozens of times easier for paying customers to succeed at PvP.

review: This is a short story about a player named Karl and his experience with Dota 2. There once was a time, long ago when Karl played games expecting no help from the team... He chose snowball heroes his MMR rose, there was a certain joy in his victories no matter how badly his team did. Then after long nights of 1v5 he thought to himself "I wonder how it would be if i played with those other four russians" For a week he tried to help lead others into the light of smart plays, excelent ward placement, and proper item choices. He led by example keeping the games close through the mid-game. But when the late game struck and the enemies BKBs were built, the team he spent the past thirty minutes of his life guiding and supporting were not there. They were not there when the bottom rax fell, they were not there when the ward spotted the Radiant attempt on roshan's life, they were not there when the mid rax was taken, they were farming, chasing illusions and supports. When the time came. When the last set of rax seemed doomed to fall, they came. In came my four hard carries like the lost children of a single mother they came to defend my home from the void. They had spent so much time farming and leaving the fighting to me that they hadnt a clue how to fight together. the four of them died a horrible death, only killing a crystal maiden they saw on their way back to the base... Why do i tell you this tale? Because there is a moral to the story, never play a support to climb the MMR bracket. It only leaves you heart broken, and 25MMR less. 10/10 would Carry again.

review: One of the most addictive games i have played so far. Yes i have the greed of drops no lying but this one is just kickass :D Different heroes their abilities and the items. <3 Heroes range from funny to creepy :D . Okay for those who will start new there are a few things. Just don't ignore the tutorial it's boring at first but really important. and do ask you friends while in game which item is good for which hero and go for easy heroes at first like Rikki or Razor, don't wish to make lots of kills at first just hang around your friends and towers and defend, it's generally a helping community, Start making friends when you understand the game better to make a team for when you have to play ranked matches. People do say go after the recommended items and it's right for when you start playing first but after that every item has an detailed explanation just go through them and with your gut feeling because it doesn't matter what skills the heroes have what matters is how you use their skills and no one knows it better than you yourself.

review: I'll make it easy for you. This game is amazing! If you want to know why then keep reading. DOTA 2 is a completely free to play MOBA. The things that you can buy are mostly just for novelty or cosmetics for your heroes. There's no paying to win in this game. If you are interested in winning expect to put a lot of time in as this game has a STEEP learning curve. The good news is that this game is so popular that you won't have any trouble finding some game guides or youtube videos to help you out. Dota 2 is also one of the best Esports games out there currently. They have tournaments on a regular basis and you are able to watch them directly from in game! This game also has fantastic graphics and can run easily on most PCs. On top of that the game is developed by Valve so of course it has fantastic support both from them and the community. This without a doubt is one of the best games available today. Did I mention it was free? Read more game reviews at

review: I don't like this game very much. Every time I play it, I want to kill myself. Anytime I play with friends, I don't want to be friends with them anymore. Anytime I play with random strangers, I want to kill the entire population of this pathetic planet. This game is bad, because it makes you realise how bad everything else is. The game itself is 10/10, but playing the game is a whole different adventure. It ruins your life. Don't start playing this game, it will consume you. A+++

review: Biggest learning curve known to man. Not really but enjoy spending 1000 hours learning and memorizng all heroes, all items, and all creeps and mechanics along with damage types, warding, the gold system and so much more. Fun game if you slog through all that  first- don't play bot matches they make you garbage. Queue up with no idea how to play, like a man.

review: This is a great game. I used to play the warcraft 3 user map settings version. It was addicting way back then, and it is still addicting now. I played league of legends before I played dota 2, and I admit i was a little scared of the transition from league to dota. But as I write this review now, I do not think I will ever play league of legends again. I will stick to playing dota2 from now until forever. Perhaps it's the nostalgia it gives me or perhaps it's fact that everyone is a  on league of legends. Eitherway, this is a great game to get into, especially if MOBAs are your type of game.

review: You might see this  installed in my friends list and go "Wow, you really have a MOBA installed?" No I don't you ing weebs. I don't play this nerd  so just stop right in your  tracks if you were gonna ask me to help you get some  360 noskill points or climb out of your "cardboard-cloud-9-tier" whatever that you dorks do. I won't have that . I installed this "Dot A" game because some disgusting ski-mask-wearing cockbiting chuckle put a gun to my head and said if I didn't install it then he would suicide bomb every bald eagle. We all know I don't  around when it comes to the greatest symbol of freedom on Earth so I installed this dumb spaz  before punching that  in the throat and breaking his  neck and promptly washing my hard drive in bleach. Because Corporal Jace Stryker once told me "I don't negotiate with Cyber Terrorists" and I don't either god dammit. #SemperFidelis

review: Very crappy matchmaking. Opponents too OP. Bad graphics. No first person view. Long loading screens. Unpolite and awfuly rude teammates that call you in many bad names. Even my grandma's toaster has a better frame rate and It also makes you crunchy bread. Heroe's are called just like pornstars, for example - Queen of pain, Crystal maiden, Bounty hunter, Silencer, Witch doctor. Or just sounds a little bit too homosexual - Lone druid, Razor, Batrider, Nature's prophet, Beastmaster and Tiny. Last, but not least is MAGNUS. This hero does not only wield a name that`s destined for a huge , but his horn also looks like one too. Sadly, heroes appearance is also poor. Meepo looks lika a rabbit that smokes weed before every round. IO is just a light bulb. Kunkka is the Heihachi Mishima from Tekken. Morphiling is just water. I think Sven and Juggernaut are twins. Storm spirit looks like an avarage asian man, only he loves drinking energy drinks and watching tentacle porn too often. Nature's prophet cannot even smell flowers because he has no possesion of a nose. Ogre magi has the nicest . He/they beat even cuties like Mirana and Windranger. Faceless void? Let's just call him Eyeless d*ckhead. All females look... let's just say - pretty bangable. Annddddd..... Magnus. Name says It all. Lastly I`d like to say that all maps are identical which makes game boring after a while and game's ending is too predictable. All items that I buy always disappear starting the next round and I hate when games don't have easter eggs or other skins for characters. If you have read this until the end, listen to me, listen to the voice of reason, turn off the computer, go outside and discover all the things the world can give to you. If you don't, well, welcome to the dota nation.

review: A solid Multiplayer-Online Battle-Arena game... What is a MOBA? a Moba is probably a game where by fundamentals everything is first set in total equilibrium... and players actions, skills, teamwork and effort is what makes the difference for one team to finally win over another. With over 100 different heroes to choose from, all absolutely free, no need to unlock and no need to buy anything.... On top of the "seemingly" repetitive one map and mode there's actually different events with a very distinct gameplay and features.. ranging from Team versus Team like Diretide and even Co-oP like the Wraith Night. The game's business model is the way I see it, most user-friendly... Everything you want unlocked is unlocked... Everything that u can buy is purely eye-candy and visual effects and models... But at the same time, one courier... one announcer... one "set" on your favorite hero is enough to make the game experience just SO MUCH more! Be Vary though.... Amongst the player base lurk some really irrittating and annoying children from all across the globe, who's primary aim and goal ( in game and in life ) is to just annoy people and piss them off for their own pleasure. Steer clear of falling into arguments with them that cost you the whole game and some nerve cells... There's the report abuse button and let the MODs do the rest!

review: For all of Dota 2's flaws, including but not limited to - Russian kids on almost every server, a learning curve high enough that it has a bloody overhang, obnoxious "It's all about me" fools who think they can carry a game while getting their teats kicked hard enough it can turn a good match into a one-sided slaughterfest - Dota 2 is now one of my favourite games of all time. Despite the abysmal learning curve, there's one very simple step you have to take in order to be good at Dota - ...yourself. Getting over yourself, realising you can't carry a match on your own as any Hero, and learning to fight with the team is a fundamental aspect of being good at Dota. For example, one of my favourite heroes is Juggernaut - a Carry/Pusher. Come on, he's tailored to kick the asses of the enemy team if he is played right, but he's fantastic fighting in your own team thanks to the fact he's strong on both offense and defense, but the defensive part goes to waste if you don't work with your guys. That's what Dota is about. Don't just do it for the sake of getting as many kills as possible. It's the team that matters. At the end of the day, it's the exploding rock garden that wins the game, yes? So for God's sake, people, work together. Plus, it's loads of fun. Valve brings its best polish for this one alright - loads of characters to choose from, a cartoony style not as exaggerated but certainly reminscient of Team Fortress 2, and, personal opinion; miles better than League of Legends, but that's really down to personal preference. Reco-bloody-mmended.

The depth of this game is amazing, a huge variety of items and characters to do battle 5 vs 5 in online multiplayer. I would like to point out that this game has only one map. One ing map that never gets boring. The best way I can describe Dota 2 is that it's like chess and football, it's a game of momentum as well as timing and skill. Everyone needs Dota 2 in their life. Put it like this, I have 80+ games that I may as well uninstall because I only play this game. 10/10.

review: Dota 2 is the sequel to the popular Warcraft III mod known as Dota. It is very well crafted and improves the gameplay from orginal modification in the source engine. Gameplay mechanics are solid and is very difficult, it requires to be attentive at all times. Positioning is key throughout due to the very long stun times and high damage output by every hero at a certain point in the game. Dota 2's graphics are much improved from the original Warcraft III modification in the Warcraft engine respectivly and shows great colours and lighting on the map and characters. Unfortunatley due to it's difficult nature and very large learning curb and tends to push back a large amount of players. My recommendation is to start with a group of friends in bot matchs, and play every single hero at least once to figure out their abilities. Then play the game online where everyone is an idiot or russian. GLHF

review: The Warcraft III Mod that took the world by storm is now a stand alone game in F2p model with microtransactions and cosmetic items that allow for customization as well as a bustling digital market for trading currency. I can see this going the way of TF2 where it stays a relevant game for years to come. I bet Blizzard is kicking themselves over cause if they had picked this up before Valve did, they'd be making a whole lot more money. M.o.b.a. games are a trend these days and the original DotA was a game i really got into for years. I recently only started playing again and immediately i remembered how petty and elitist certain players are. Sometimes you don't even enjoy playing the game, sometimes you just play cause you wanna even up the losses from the last time you lost. This game makes you rage in ways you thought you never could. Ah but the feeling of crushing your enemies is a fair trade off, no? Good graphics, gameplay hasn't changed that much, events are pretty cool, marketable items are nice too. If they do promotional tie-ins with certain games like how TF2 did (for rare items. other than that genuine master thief set.) that'd certainly make it more interesting. Pudge with a super meat boy outfit or maybe Sniper with a tf2 sniper set. I give it an 8 out of 10. Play it if you don't mind getting flak from your teammates when you mess up one tiny bit. I'd play LoL but then its too cutesy for my taste. To each his own.

review: Steep learning curve, but once you invest the time to not suck then it is a pretty addictive and fun game. The teamwork aspect of it is what makes it and/or breaks it if you are unlucky to be paired with a feeding player. That said, if you can find a small core of people that you consistently play with then win or lose it is a pretty awesome game. Oh, and don't use Riki or Sniper unless you have to. Just trust me.

review: Dota 2 is a lot of fun if you meet the right team - too bad that doesn't happen very often. The community is more toxic than botulinum toxin. On the other hand, I've learned several Russian swear words since 70% of the community is Russian. Russian simulator 10/10

review: Would you like to play one of the most competitive, high skill capped games on steam? Here it is, you are gazing upon Dota2's famous legacy, down from my childhood Warcraft 3 days, where I'd be mid with some other guy not knowing what to do. To now my current self, playing on the competitive scene. This game is free, AMAZING! The community is by far better than most other known Mobas *points at League* It also has great micro-transactions incase you wanna make your favorite hero a total and utter badass with items, but wait. You don't need to buy the items, because in time you will get them! Sure it's all randomed and time is consuming but that's the joy of it, it's all just free. Great Game overall, I could spend countless hours on this thing, and many more! I'd give this a solid 9.2/10 Just because of how great it is

review: Game is awesome. Took me a little while to get in to it, because when you first start Dota seems complicated, confusing, and spontaneous. After a week or so of playing/trying to understand the game I understood it and tried to learn some of the basics so I could actually play. So try it, it will take you a while to get a hang of it but when you do this game will be so fun you need to play it every day for the rest of your life. I HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone! Try it out!

review: Not that hard of a game to play.Really the only hard parts about this game are the items and heros.You must at least be familiar with the 3 types of hero styles.As you progress through the game you will be familiar with the heros and even know which hero can counter others.On the other hand there are the items, now most heros are not as good without specific items ,others are already good without them.Although It does take time to learn the items and which hero there better off with, I still highly recommend this game.

review: Dota. I have played this game for a short while. I never played the original as I was staying in cell 6 of the Wakefield high security prison. However in Dota 3 I have experienced nothing but vile language and Russian profanities. This is painful, as when I was learning to play in a public match I was violently insulted for taking the wrong 'lane'. I mean obviously I went in the left lane, that's the correct driving lane here in England. I believe it is nothing but the simple minds of children that know nothing of the real life world. After I lost every game I have played, I realised that I had been reported a number of times. This was upsetting. I felt as if I had to return the prison I came from, hated by the community of players I put the game aside and played League of Legends instead. A community of 12 year olds is far more satisfactory that 40 year old Russians. At least I have a fighting chance, verbally... 10/10 million.

review: DotA 2. This is one of the MOST AMAZING games I have played in a very long time. It's a simple idea, a 5 vs 5 arena with the same map everytime, both teams trying to kill the others base. You fight as over 100 heroes, each with different roles. That's all it is. Team communication is VITAL, you can't win without coordinating and fighting as a team. Overall, it is definately a game for certain types of people. You need to be able to work and talk with your teamates, and be concentrated pretty much 100% of the time. Also, it's a lot more fun to play with people you know. Form up a group with four of your friends, and it will be much more fun. The games can take anywhere from 30-70 minutes, but most of the time game I play only take about 40-50 minutes. Lastly, don't jump right into matchmaking right away. You will probably get flamed and insulted and hurrased by your teamates if you don't do well. Play some bot matches first, learn what heroes you are good with. If people DO flame and insult you, take it with a grain of salt. Just don't yell back, that won't help anybody. It's a really fun game, and you should all try it out. Bonus: It's free, so you don't lose anything by playing a couple games, then learning you hate it. Chances are though, you will LOVE it!

review: This is a great game. I used to play the warcraft 3 user map settings version. It was addicting way back then, and it is still addicting now. I played league of legends before I played dota 2, and I admit i was a little scared of the transition from league to dota. But as I write this review now, I do not think I will ever play league of legends again. I will stick to playing dota2 from now until forever. Perhaps it's the nostalgia it gives me or perhaps it's fact that everyone is a  on league of legends. Eitherway, this is a great game to get into, especially if MOBAs are your type of game.

review: If you're fond of blaming others for everything or uncomfortable with acknowledging the fact that there will always be someone better than you out there, this is not the game for you. If you like a constant challenge and you're capable of continual improvement than it comes highly recommended. The game itself is crazy fun and varied, the map is ridiculously intricate, and it's all free-to-play without being pay-to-win! The matchmaking system on the other hand leaves a lot to be desired, ie. no region lock, solo-queue disadvantage, questionable balance methods, etc. The community really isn't as bad as everyone says, and the hero that you think is OP is not. There's always more to learn, and that's what keeps me coming back.

But I love it. I love coming back from piss &  circumstances and winning with 25 deaths and 2 kills.

The animation is perfect, the voices are pristine... however every game has its flaws. The community is horrible, there are numerous bugs and that's just grazing the surface. That being said, I never recommend this game to friends as once you pass that learning curve you won't be doing anything else once it latches on.

review: I was jungling chaos knight one afternoon, racking up the six figure kill spree when I had an epiphany. After about 3 matches you've seen it all- this is a painfully simple game that offers no challenge whatsoever. I have some suggestions to improve the gameplay at least twentyfold: 1. Introduce a loadout screen and killstreak perks, such as uavs and AC-130s, to reward hardcore junglers such as myself. 2. Have an in game marketplace, where in game gold can be purchased for bitcoins, at a ratio of 1:1. 3. Increase number of players per team to 16 for epic battles.

review: This is by FAR the greatest choice making RPG to date.There are over a hundred characters and each character has stunning storys that can change based on your choices. It seems every new game I start has diffrent NPC and voice lines that drive the story through the end. The ending is generally the same wether the Dark lord or light lord wins. This single player RPG allows building of the story through dicisions and item purcheses. Like recently I choose the Character Phantom Assassin and built the powerful mechinism that allowed me to heal my party members. The dialoge on this story line was great though the curse filter was removed as I heard lines from the ever changing juggernuat character such as " this noob feed loses the game" and "She took safe lane for a ing mech?". though there are still a few bugs such as the one that causes incorrect traslation of the NPCs lines, as in my PA storyline the Puck character was translated in spanish and my ally in arms Keeper Of The Light was incorrectly translated to Russian. Though sad I will miss their dialoge im sure there is much more to come, as I havent had the same dialoge yet in my 3000 hours of gameplay [10/10 would shoot myself.]

I had lost 5 games in a row, one of which was due to 1 second lag in the first 5 minutes of the game which corrected itself right after the point where I was too underfarmed to do anything anyway. Then, I played a game and I started winning. I worked well with my lane partner, I ganked the enemy safelane five times as Timbersaw before the 10 minute mark and got my bloodstone at 7 minutes. Then, during an exciting teamfight in which I was the #1 damage dealer and Ace on the team, the game crashed. The entire East Coast crashed. Because I was winning. Because I was having fun. Half of America's DotA servers blew up because I thought I could have fun.  you, DotA.

Upon selecting any of the US Servers you will promptly meet someone or a entire lobby of people who don't speak a lick of English. Better then any language learning program out there! The best part? It's free! You can also dress up your little people and make them move and talk while learning the language! Best interactive learning software I have found to date.

review: Its a wonderful yet brutal experience which leaves you with a strange love-hate feeling for it, like any worth while relationship does. For veterans from Warcraft 3 mod days will fell quite nostalgic and really appreciate the up scaling done to the game. Newcomers will still have a sense of how detailed the game is, both graphically and game mechanics wise. At its core it's an RPG through and through with leveling systems, items and fixed hero abilities. The community still needs to grow in terms of mannerism but anyone with thick skin can power through the nasties, which aren't that many anyway.

P.S- The game does have a tutorial to get you going but If your new to the MOBA scene take the time to learn, watch guides becuase this game has quite a steep learning curve and quite a big selection of items to buy (it can be overwhelming to the new player), i recommend playing a few bot games before jumping into a match against other players.

review: I want to introduce you to a game, Defense of the Ancients is its name. In this game, our chances are all the same So when you are good, it will bring you fame. But when you are bad, it will bring you ''flame in-game'' Since becoming a good player always be your aim. And the game starts for Radiant and Dire Ten heroes are picked from a pool of 107. Five heroes for each, all different styles From being Supportive, selfish to even vile. Unstoppable, wicked sick and beyond godlike, For a single purpose: to defend the ancients with all their might Many many more i'd like to say, But it will take too much time of my day. So i will stop and step out of your way, Cause you've known the basic, it's now your time to play...

review: It takes a while to get in to, but once you're in, you will never get out. A great game once you know the basics and has a huge range of what you can do to get better at in the game, it is very deep. The back stories of the hero's are very interesting and it is very good on the game mechanics side, and the story side. Some heros are however quite fustrating to play against, but it seems that Vale and the developers are still definitely updatimg the game and trying to make everything balanced. Also I have never tried Dota's competitor Leauge of Ledgends so I cannot say wether I think it is better.

review: Ok first off a sortof mixed review. I love and hate this game. I first started playing dota just after the international 2013. I moved into a house where the housemates were hell bent on this game and had friends over every day to play it. It was the 1st MOBA i had ever played, infact i had never even heard of the term MOBA before, (and for those who dont know it stands for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) First of all i was LUCKY i had friends who played this, and watched and got help from them as they played before even starting the game, as when landed into the thick of it, it is quite daunting. The tutorials are BLAH... until you actually get to the main gameplay tutorials, but no mention of custom build selection??? , this is another reason why some of my friends have just given up. From my experience, if you are a keen gamer STICK WITH IT. However if you value your life then give up now because it is very addictive, stressful and fun in the same sentence. DOTA is a very tactical game, which is extremely fun, overwhelmingly addictive too and by knowing the basic fundamentals and working as a team and not being arrogant or being able to take advice you can have a great game. You dont have to be an absolute strategist to win, although it does help The problem with this game is the community, and that is not the communitys problem, infact i blame the creators VALVE for not putting enough restrictions in place, and the restrictions they do put in place are ridiculous. First of all you have to have a half decent machine to play this on standard settings ( i sometimes even have problems on lowest settings on this machine and my machine lives up to their MINIUMUM SPECS. That saying that the game is quite playable for the most time on their minimum specs, but it seems bugs do keep popping up that they just wont sort out Also take the game as it is... free to play... and if anything happens just suck your gut in and relax. VALVE support absolutely sucks, so if anything goes wrong and you have any problems dont go running to valve for help because i have done this on more than 3 occasions, with a 2 day + response of just "sorry we cannot help you with this issue". And my last email getting the response "We will ignore any future emails about this issue from you" Back to the community... Dont take ranked too personally. DOTA is a TEAM game, however many times you will get landed with players who cannot play as a team, don't get the essence of DOTA in the same way you do, are absolutely rude and ignorant and arrogant. My advice after lots of headaches.... sod them, you are playing because you like to play, if you suck they dont help by screaming at you, and if you are dieing too often (and not intentionally feeding) then it is their fault for not working as a team and protecting you. Also matchmaking, you will find when you get into the game servers.... english speakers take off everything except us east, west and europe west and set language preference as english. This wont stop you being annoyingly teamed with people who dont speak english, but it sure helps... for some reason people dont understand communication is fundamental for a team game and selfishly pick servers where the know they will be teamed up with people who dont speak their languages. YES I AM SPEAKING TO ALL YOU RUSSIANS WHO SELECT EVERYTHING OTHER THAN RUSSIA. Other problems are that with the report system or restrictions. Now people with low end computer who get annoying bugs ingame which randomly kick them off suffer most. However it goes for everyone on the report system. I rarely use it anymore because it does jack  unless you are with a group of people you know will report the same person for the same actions. You get 3 a week no matter how much you play, which is dreadful, and you only get a report back if action is taken against someone, which seems to me it doesnt matter what they have done, if noone else reports it there is no check and they get away scott free. Unfortunately if you are in a game and the rest of your team is a party, and they dont like you for some reason... excpect a 6 game ban in low priority. Also a new bug bear that has come out is this "Failed to load" Scenario.. My games usualy load up, with some slow lagging problems at the start but manage to settle itself out. When the games didnt load it was a pain in the  and you may have to search another 3 - 10 mins for a game, but that was an annoyance i could live with. Now on the odd occasion i fail to load i get penalised for half an hour from finding ANY game, except ones with bots, remember failing to load does not effect the game as the game hasnt currently started, and it is annoying but getting a ban from finding a match for 30 mins (i even got an hour at one instance) is ridiculous, taking in account that a game lasts between 30 and 60 mins on average. that means sometimes when you only have a set ammount of time to play you are screwed. Other bugs ive experiences are random spikes in loading (it will flick on and off the shop/skill attributes at the start of the game randomly and sometimes even boot you off) and the courier button just dissapearing... sometimes the whole thing, sometimes just the flying bit.. this usually comes back if you reload but not always, and sinc most people dont have the decency to pause the game it screws you up rotten. Other than that this game is the most fun game i've ever played, and so rewarding so no matter how crap valve are, or no matter how annoying the game can be at times, i alway come back for more. Even if it means playing out my low priority ban matches with complete s

review: Never before have I had such a profound hatred for other human beings. You can't leave. I've tried, and will most likely try again soon. Mostly what this game has taught me is this- I am a racist bigot. Everyone I know is a racist bigot. Even the peruvians and russians are racist bigots. Everyone is stupid. Teamwork, like sleep, is a false promise. Don't queue in groups of people less than 5 Never go alone. Seriously it's that important. You will not have fun. Angsty narcissistic 10 year olds exist everywhere. Everyone is a noob. Even you. Don't delude yourself. Search your feelings, you know it to be true. Run.

review: Heard of Dota 2 all my life from friends around me.....and now I see why xD Its.. 1) Addictive 2) Fun 3) Competitive 4) Challenging 5) Teaches something that's not only important 'in game' but also in the real life which is TEAMWORK! 6) This point may sound awkward/weird to people to be a PROS instead of a CONS...but! its the 'LEARNING CURVE'. Wut!? how is this PROS instead of CONS you say!? Let me explain... Every game you play you either win or lose. Now not all games are meant to be won ;) Cause its when you lose you learn something and even when you think you havn't learnt a thing from a game of loss? You just did. You learn't that you did something wrong to have achived that loss and should try to improve in that missing element. Knowing the fact that no ones perfect. This is what makes Dota 2 fun and keeps you playing over and over, day after day so its hard to get even close to 1% of being bored. Plus in top of that there are 100+ Heroes, that makes getting bored of this game dead impossible :') and that gives us point #1 ;) So I recommend everyone to play this game, even if you're a cat...... cause cats are awesome.......so is Dota 2 ;) Happy Gaming! -Arafat / TRAPWOLF

review: Though DotA 2 is not beginner/noob friendly at all everyone is able to play it. There is nothing much to say about why you should try it or not, but the sheer number of players and year-thousands of cumulative playing time spent on this game should make you giving this a try. Be aware that the learning curve however is exponential. This means that you will most likely be bashed down by the complex mechanics of this game for like the first 300 hours, depending on how eager you try and how naturally skilled you are. After you are in it and got some friends to play, you will be able to have a thousand (or more thousands) of hours of gaming time in which there is variety and fun. Also, for the big and free game like this is you have to expect by a 50/50 chance to find games with 'bad communication', meaning that either your teammates or the enemies are not friendly/helping etc. You just have to deal with it. But on the other hand you will get to learn some russian, french, spanish, korean etc. curses you did not knew before. Also this is F2P, but there are only smaller cosmetic items. Nothing involving the gameplay. Just for your information: If you played LoL or HoN before you will not have an easy going here as this game takes the genre some steps higher.

review: Dota 2 is a fast-paced first person shooter with some RPG elements mixed in. In all my years of playing indie games, I have never seen a better real time strategy game. For a space travel simulator, its lacking in rocketships, but overall, it is one of the greatest zombie survival game on the market. If you could possibly desire a better game, then you should think about purchasing Drake of the 99 Dragons. Both it and Dota 2 share many similarites.

The Best MOBA I have seen and played besides maybe Smite, I would recommend this to anyone with a good group of friends who like to have fun and play Video games like it.

The only hope for a goodgame is now only in the ranked playlist, and even there you'll get your trolls from time to time. If you're going to play, bring some friends to have a team, or dont even bother at all. It used to be fun and you could search an all pick and actually encounter people who want to win and play but now it seems that all the CoD casuals have drifted over to DOTA 2.

review: I love the game! It really gets addicting, which explains my playtime, lol. You might not like it at first, but I bet it will really turn into your close-to-everyday hobby after a while, once you have gotten the hang of it. It has a huge variety of heroes to choose from, enjoy, experiment, and master. Though there are still a few missing heroes from the original Defense of the Ancients, like Arc Warden, Winter Wyvern, and Abyssal Underlord, the constant updates on the game which balances heroes, and adds more content will still make you have fun and be strategic on the game. Hero sets, and other custom items like HUDs, Loading Screens, etc. are present in the game. Hero sets are a handful of items which customizes the whole hero. From head to toe. And I guess I don't have to explain the custom HUDs and stuff, right? There are a few yearly events to look upon on as well. Like New Bloom (Chinese New Year), Diretide (Halloween), Frostivus (Christmas), some random events like the recent Foreseer's Contract event which gives you and possibly quite a few more that I have missed since I have not played the game for long. Each of the first three events offers a new map as well as new content, as I have mentioned earlier. Map changes may also vary on future game updates. But like all other games, there are flaws, the #1 flaw would be the really bad community. Only rarely you see friendly, good players who will actually help newbies learn. Most people in the game are rather stupid in the sense that they insult people who are new to the game, blames others for their own mistakes, and those who trashtalks for no reason. There are players which does not know how to wait for someone too, causing them to receive an abandon and gets them into the low prioprity punishment pool. Gets really really annoying. No justice done, really. There are some people who ruins games too, which can be explained in one word - "troll". They feed the enemy team intentionally. Worst part is that, reporting them never does anything. The reports need better management. No, Valve, the low priority pool isn't that good of a punishment either. Some players just report other users with no apparent reason, and I think causing them an LP would not do any justice. At least examine the reports before taking action? Another thing is the servers. Some users has gotten problems where the server would just kick them out for no reason which yet again causes them an abandon. There are instances where the servers would actually crash due to an update during a really good game. Really. Happened to me once, was not happy. Especially when the game is already over an hour long and you were winning a hardly fought match. Seriously. This is just based on my own experiences and my opinion, you might disagree on some stuff I have uttered, but overall I like this game. It gets even better when you get to know the right people, and I think I'll give it an 8/10. I have met a lot of really good friends from this game, I hope you try it out and find your own. Have fun!

review: Dota 2, arguably the steepest learning curve strategy game you will ever play, yet none more rewarding. A highly competitive game that is now played by millions (for millions, TI4 winners took ~5million USD), that is hugely satisfying. Pros: * Variety in hero builds and teams * High replay ability * Real-time mixture of RTS and MOBA elements Cons: * Brutal learning curve and impossible to master * Demanding community and poor tolerance thresholds * Huge, huge, huge, occupier of your time! (Some games last more than 60 minutes) Otherwise, what are you waiting for... At 805 hours total, I am beginner/intermediate level, and have no plans on stopping now...

review: If you have a penchant for feeling completely let down by your team-mates. If you want to see team mates ignoring the objective and dying under towers in places they should never have been after fighting hard for nearly an hour and seeing defeat snatched from the jaws of victory, this IS the game for you. No , it really is. Do you have an unyielding sense that the participation aspect of team mates in communicating effectively to engeander positive co-operation in fulfilling victory after victory in both the battles of defending and attacking, and the war as a whole is absolutely necessary?.. Then providing you have the ability to speak russian, spanish, and portuguese and understand that even though you have chosen to play on an english speaking server, you are likely going to be in the minority and everything that goes wrong is going to be your fault , waste no time, install this game and jump in, the incredibly forgiving and supportive community is waiting to help teach you how to play. You to will soon have 6.5k mmr and can hang out in the reddit chat with the rest of the 1337 dotoists. And just remember this one thing and you will never go wrong. If someone has a lower mmr than you, no matter what the issue is, they are always wrong. welcome and glhf.

review: This game is good, that's all I have to say. If you think you're good at it, chances are you're a noob, anyone can be a noob, everyone is a noob, even pro players are noobs. It is a very fair game, at the same time you will be left gobsmacked at how unfair and flawed something in this game can be. I recommend this game because it has earned my 2 cents... Or should I say 400 hours at the time I write this review, I have fed the community market a small (ok maybe medium) sized amount of money over my career to make my little characters look as pretty as I can and that's only a small (ok maybe completely full) aspect of the game to many (Oh yeah I should also mention don't buy Arcanas, they are expensive, like really expensive... Or legendaries, they're not as expensive, but they still are and you know they are.) Short story short, download this game, install this game, play some easy bots matches, play some medium bots matches, play a couple of pubs when you feel confident, get your  kicked and trudge back in there to beat up their asses, so you can feel proud, and move up to the next scrub-tier! But don't forget, have fun! (And give Gaben all your cash monies)

review: Dota 2 is one of the best games out there. It is a massive rage factory, and you will hear insults come out of your mouth that you didn't even think you knew. You can play powerful heroes, like a succubus with a pain fetish, or a massive red man who loves to splatter people into numbers. Also, the learning curve is best described as a learning cliff. But whatever i tell you doesn't matter, because you people read the reviews for comedy, rather than purchasing information.

review: A solid Multiplayer-Online Battle-Arena game... What is a MOBA? a Moba is probably a game where by fundamentals everything is first set in total equilibrium... and players actions, skills, teamwork and effort is what makes the difference for one team to finally win over another. With over 100 different heroes to choose from, all absolutely free, no need to unlock and no need to buy anything.... On top of the "seemingly" repetitive one map and mode there's actually different events with a very distinct gameplay and features.. ranging from Team versus Team like Diretide and even Co-oP like the Wraith Night. The game's business model is the way I see it, most user-friendly... Everything you want unlocked is unlocked... Everything that u can buy is purely eye-candy and visual effects and models... But at the same time, one courier... one announcer... one "set" on your favorite hero is enough to make the game experience just SO MUCH more! Be Vary though.... Amongst the player base lurk some really irrittating and annoying children from all across the globe, who's primary aim and goal ( in game and in life ) is to just annoy people and piss them off for their own pleasure. Steer clear of falling into arguments with them that cost you the whole game and some nerve cells... There's the report abuse button and let the MODs do the rest!

review: Its a wonderful yet brutal experience which leaves you with a strange love-hate feeling for it, like any worth while relationship does. For veterans from Warcraft 3 mod days will fell quite nostalgic and really appreciate the up scaling done to the game. Newcomers will still have a sense of how detailed the game is, both graphically and game mechanics wise. At its core it's an RPG through and through with leveling systems, items and fixed hero abilities. The community still needs to grow in terms of mannerism but anyone with thick skin can power through the nasties, which aren't that many anyway.

review: Dota 2 (Defence of the Ancients) is an online Battle Arena video game, it requires strategy, concentration and determination for the whole team to win a game. The only problem is it relies WAY too much on your teamwork. To win a game you have to destroy the opponents Ancient after you level up and become powerful. Killing the enemy heroes levels you up faster and gives you more gold than the creeps. Because of the teamwork thing I would rate it 9/10, but yes I seriously recommend this game to everyone because it is addictive and really fun.

review: When I started with such types of games.. Shifting form First Person Shooter. I was confused. And I did not know if League of Legends or Dota 2 is better. So I downloaded Both. Starting from Dota 2. I played. It was complicated. But the games I found fast. And the Understanding of the game.. It made sense. After playing about 100 hours. I decided to Give a try to League of Legends.. hearing that It is one of the top ones. I expected it to be better.. But frankly.. I was horrified by LOL's quality.. The gaming is very arcadish.. U get defensive upgrades at the cost of boots yes.. that cheap. Anyone can hide anyone can get back to town withouth scroll.. it was.. senseless to me.. I never the less gave it a go.. played league of legends for 30 hours. The waiting for games were long. choosing for sides was irritating. So then I Removed LOL and havn't looked away from Dota 2 ever since. Oh the game.. The lust for getting those kills.. One map.. Infinite possibilities.. I specially enjoy the Ability Draft.. Makes the game even more enjoyable as u may make a new hero all together.. The Community is friendly.. and The best part about Dota 2 is.. It makes sense. A lot of sense. And the Physics ingame are very much realistic. The Dev's Have done some amazing Job in the game. And I thank them for their constant efforts. :) So after such a ... strange review.. my point being is.. It's an amazing game. And hence Must for everyone to try it. :) U'll be hooked, M sure of it. :D

Honestly within 10 hours of gametime, I was a natural speaker in Russian a language of which I had never had prior knowledge to before. This game is great for racism as you learn to hate the Russian people despite how much they love or hate gays. It's a great team building exercise as you learn to love those that you do not know despite how well they're playing, because after all God taught us to love each other. Apart from Russian;  the Russians. Overall;   ,            ,     ;              .

review: The latest in rage simulation technology. Dota 2 is supposed to be a team game but plays like call of duty where your team is full of little kids, non-english speaking players and people who play like they are using a trackpad. What is supposed to be a objective based game turns into a team deathmatch if you get matched with russians. Valve constantly releases patches to try and balance the handicap that peruvians give you but its not working, what seems like a 5v5 match in reality is a 8v2 or 9v1. I do not recommend this game unless you like getting angry at yourself for not being able to win a 9v1

review: Though DotA 2 is not beginner/noob friendly at all everyone is able to play it. There is nothing much to say about why you should try it or not, but the sheer number of players and year-thousands of cumulative playing time spent on this game should make you giving this a try. Be aware that the learning curve however is exponential. This means that you will most likely be bashed down by the complex mechanics of this game for like the first 300 hours, depending on how eager you try and how naturally skilled you are. After you are in it and got some friends to play, you will be able to have a thousand (or more thousands) of hours of gaming time in which there is variety and fun. Also, for the big and free game like this is you have to expect by a 50/50 chance to find games with 'bad communication', meaning that either your teammates or the enemies are not friendly/helping etc. You just have to deal with it. But on the other hand you will get to learn some russian, french, spanish, korean etc. curses you did not knew before. Also this is F2P, but there are only smaller cosmetic items. Nothing involving the gameplay. Just for your information: If you played LoL or HoN before you will not have an easy going here as this game takes the genre some steps higher.

review: Dota 2 is a fast-paced first person shooter with some RPG elements mixed in. In all my years of playing indie games, I have never seen a better real time strategy game. For a space travel simulator, its lacking in rocketships, but overall, it is one of the greatest zombie survival game on the market. If you could possibly desire a better game, then you should think about purchasing Drake of the 99 Dragons. Both it and Dota 2 share many similarites.

review: A fantastic multiplayer experience. This game is deeply complex with it's metagame and many strategies a team can employ. The community is not as toxic as many say it is. Yes there are the few rude, obnoxious, and annoying players but that is true for all multiplayer games. There are many ways to play such as the carry, support, nuker, initiator, and jungler. These roles all have their place in this game and there is something for everyone. Pros: - complex but easy to get into - many ways to play - relies on teamwork - great esport community - 100% free - nice aesthetic - many heroes to choose from - great ui - very rare glitches - dota tv - metagame Cons - a little difficult to get into - players not playing on thier region's server - first few hours are not very fun - occasionally takes a while to join a game

review: Dota 2 is a game I've been playing for about a year or so now, and I don't think I've ever been so addicted to a game before. It's a game with teamwork, strategy and beautiful visuals. The hero pool has a huge variety of different looks, skills and basic stats. The game modes for the online mode are also cool, but I wish some people who play captains mode will actually listen to their teammates instead of just picking wherever they want to. Overall this game is really fun to play and it's free! I would definately recommend this game to people who have a semi-long attention span and a quick reaction time.

review: Really great game. Introduced me to MOBA's. Very addictive and a friendly and helpful community. Little confusing at first but fun once you get used to it. Fascinating graphics and crisp sounds. Gameplay can feel repetitive but there's always an element of suspense. Each player hero is unique and powerful and the user interface of the game is easy to understand. Does not constantly bug you for micro-transactions which is great. Only problem is that finding a match, even on my closest servers takes quite some time (3-4 mins.) Loving the game otherwise. 9/10 - The Best MOBA

How about having thousands of hours on record, and still being a miserable scrub-feeding noob? Well then, Dota is for you! It will frustrate you, take all your time, make you feel worthless and have you come back for more!

review: DotA 2 is your ordinary high school classroom. It has affluent kids who have all the latest hats thinking that pre-cal subjects can be passed with these. Most of the time, they only want to show-off and has no real understanding of the subject. It has absurdly-gifted students (those with high match ratings) who turn into snobs when forced to work with members 'inferior' to them. Little did they know that it is they who serve as role models to their less intelligent mates. A class clown happens to be in the same subject some of the time. These people are so funny that you wish they do not get grouped with you. Air heads who do things repetitively and who seem not to get on the team's conversations. Farm - get killed - respawn (rinse and repeat). Then, the average reasonable dudes. Some of them think too highly of themselves while others have the potential of being your friends. Did i mention ladies? They are not myths. They exist; however, they are as rare as women in engineering classes. If you survived high school, this game is for you. P.S. Ironically, the average age for people playing this game is less than seven. 10/10

review: If you wish to learn russian quickly, turn to no other programme than Dota 2. Unintentionally valve have came up with a brilliant tool to comprehend the angry sort of russian language for example ''. Before trying a michael thomas or rossetta stone course consider dota for your soviet language learning experience. 'Thanks, and have fun' ~Gabe Newell Now to be serious... Dota is extremely difficult to get your head around. To start, if you are new to moba's, you will be lost and somewhat overwhelmed by the gameplay. But as you advance in skill level and playing against rivals similar levels to you, you then realise how fun the game is. You will get raged at and you will fail, but that is whole point of improving. Dota is brilliant.

review: Dota 2 Is literally one of the best games I have ever played! I give the game 8/10 because It can be really hard at the beginning If you dont have anyone telling you how to play it. Dota 2 has about the same type of game as League of Legends, but I like Dota 2 much better because its more real-life. LoL (League of Legends) Is almost the same just with comic book look alike textures and more champions.. If you dont agree with me, then thumbs down. Your choice! If you want to play a mmo/rpg game, that has AWESOME and AMAZING textures you should definately download this game right now! Be sure to thumbs up if you agree or this made you wanna play it!

review: Dota is strategy game where 10 players pick a hero and fight. Fight to win and make other 9 players lose. Ironically there are only two sides of conflict, but you will have to mange- it's all out war there and war don't take prisioners. At the end of day, after games full of hate, rage, feed, brain scarcity, RUSSIA SUPREMACY, birth defects and your own shortcomings, you will notice no one is a winner and text at the end of the game "RADIANT/DIRE VICTORY" give you only as much as few points of MMR, a hollow rating feeding only your ego. For that Dota2 would be perfect for any anti-war commercials, pointing at the end that "In war, there is no winner". But for nolives like us it doesn't matter, all we need is our own ego and MMR so we fight, fight those other 9 players and hope, hope we will see that side we are with wins, hope that our MMR will reach as high as our ego, hope that other 9 players will die from cancer or other painfull diseases.

review: Much better then League of Legends. This is coming from someone who played LoL since beta up until 6 months ago. Dota 2 shines above other games in the genre for these reasons; 1. Hero versatility 2. Learning curve is steeper but more rewarding 3. Games snowball less, but if they do its for the RIGHT reasons. 4. Games are less likely to be decided early therefore there is always plenty of time for a comeback. Overall, the game is much more rewarding for someone who is starting out in this genre, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

review: this EN GAME! Reasons dota sucks. 1. Dota is filled with some of the worst scum sucking pigs that have ever walked planet earth 2. Dota is so unbalanced, it has tipped the very universe upside down creating chaos and the Ebola virus to spread to the states via illegal russian imigrants 3. Dota grabs you where it hurts and makes u squeal while relentlessly calling you a "" while listing off the different ways he ed your mother. 4. Dota doesen't sleep, Dota stays up till late into the night while whispering into your mother en ear "One more game, just one more, i know you lost those last eleven, but one more will make it all better" 5. Dota doesen't forget..... Remember when you first started playing dota? U found a hero that was fun and easy like Sniper or Drow and u played the hell out of that hero till it made its way to your most successful heros list? Yeah? Well  you! Dota takes that hero and slams it in your face FOR A GOD DAMN YEAR! SO NOW AFTER U LEARN OTHER HEROS AND U SEE THAT SACK OF  U ONCE HAD FUN PLAYING, U LOOK IN THE MIRROR IN DISGUST AND JUST THINK "WOW IM A USELESS PIECE OF  SNIPER PLAYER" 6. Dota hates u and everyone around you 7.Dota laughs at your pain. 8. Dota makes you hate the ones u love most. 9. Dota spelled backwards is Atod, thats not even a word, Dota doesn't know english 10. Dota is fun. 1 Comments

review: As much as I only have 20 hours on this game, There isnt much to talk about. The game is addicting as  and can ruin your life if you dont control it. Its the same game over and over again. Two sides, the same map, same defences and ancients. The sounds, graphics, and game play is just awsome. However, I do find the community to suck alot. I do not have a problem with the Russians but my problem is most of the people who do speak English are the most whiny  people and report if you dont do as they say. Then theres the unfair system of the penalty pool. The fact that one can get reported with no evidence and suffer longer waiting times and ier . In conclusion, I recomend people to play this game with a group of friends, maybe time to time random servers but be careful that this game wont ruin your life.

review: An Educational game that teaches and develops the required skills that was needed during much earlier times. Based on true historical facts Dota 2 has given the player unique heroes throughout history so that the player is able to get an understanding of life in the early 1900's. Dota 2 also allows player to see the true horrors of war and allows them to get deep into the bloodshed so that they are able to learn about the true terrors when facing war, it also helps the player develop their own strategies when in combat so that when the day comes they are battle ready and won't go down without a fight. Not only is Dota 2 a historical game about combat but it also shows an indepth field of dedication. This allows the player to not just learn about dedication whilst seeing their characters dedicated to their job so much so that they will kill themselves many times for a kill, but also the player may also himself use his new skill of dedication upon the game itself. After many years of dedication he may enter tournaments within the game and develop new skills like; Teamwork, Compassion, Bravery and even Empathy. So not only is Dota 2 a historical game but it teaches the player unique skills for living day by day. This is trully a master game and it cannot be compared against any other games of its Genre. #Dota2 #History #LifeSkills #10/10

review: Dota 2 is a very intensive video game that is just as good as League of Legends, although it is somewhat lacking in it's misogynistic protrayal of women, where all the female heroes are highly sexualized and often oppressed by the patriarchal standards of the game. There is only one strong female character (both metaphorically and literally), named "Legion Commander", and even she is highly sexualized and often the target of pornographic parodies. Although they are perfectly equal in the terms of gameplay, Valve has quite a ways to go before they reach the same plethora of well-characterized and non-sexualized female characters as Riot Games managed to do in League of Legends. Therefore, although the game is reasonably fun, I cannot honestly recommend it to any mature gamers out there.

review: i hate this game like seriously i hate all of this like i have learned to hate things i cannot understand, peoples i have never met, and emotions ive never know to feel before i playd this game. its like learning just to fail. it tests the limits of humanity in a philosphical way that degrades the mind, and stamps on the soul. why did i ever play this? why did i particpate and ignore the warnings of others and sink all this time into this madness? This game is like your crush continuosly telling you she doesnt like you and slowly pushing you out of his or her life. This review says i have around 400 hours of gameplay. But you dont understand, every one hour of stress is about 5 more hours and self hate, loathing, and mass sprits of depression man this stinks

review: Graphics: + detailed heroes + nice animation and effects + living setting - blured textures Balance: + very good hero balance + video tutorials for beginners + train with KI - very hard for beginners Game Size: + currently 108 heroes + over 120 items + many tactics - only 1 map Sound: + diverse hero sounds + nice music + nice battle sounds + 7.1 surround Language: + learn easy different languages (russian, spain etc.) :) Welcome to Dota 2! They say, before concluding with, You suck. They're not wrong: for the first dozen hours or so, you'll be bombarded with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. But if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. A fantastic free-to-play model. Dota 2 has become notorious even among its MOBA peers for its difficulty  and thats totally justified. Its a double-edged sword that leads to both a terrifying introduction and a world-class game at the highest levels. You should not expect to have fun your first day playing... or even your first week, maybe months. Dota 2 is a deeply layered construct of systems, and to survive you need to understand every single one and how they interact with one another. Everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own AI units to deny the enemy experience points and gold theyd get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of abilities like Bloodseekers Rupture (which deals huge damage with every step you take) is a big barrier to entry. Even figuring out which of the 108 heroes fits you best is a time-consuming challenge. Your learning has just begun when you've settled on what roles, heroes, and builds suit you best  you also have to adapt based on what other players choose. If the other team plays a Riki, you need to compensate with an emphasis on detection. Go up against Bloodseeker and his hideously powerful Rupture will force you to carry around a Town Portal Scroll to get home. Shop System: Only cosmetic enhancements, almost all of which are created by the community. Tournament goodies (such as tickets for viewing live events) are for sale. Theres not a single paid on the in-game balance, and thats great! In short words: Dota 2 pits two teams of five players against each other. mix of strategy and RPG, skill management and tactical gameplay. 108 heroes, each with their own style and combat abilities. most heroes have 4 skills that can be increased in power by levelling up by killing enemys. there are over 120 items to choose from within each game, each with their own ways to power up your stats and active abilities. creeps that charge down the game's three lanes, and the player controlled heroes on the opposite team. Theres a huge time investment before you can enjoy a game. it creates a playing field where skill and teamplay is top priority. the best DotA game. many heroes, items and a great balance. Thanks for reading! If you Like my Review, give me a Thumbs up in Steam (not the youtube video). I make this for the Community and your help is greatly appreciated :)

review: A game with an amazing community which never fails to blame everybody else when they make mistakes. Dota teaches a variety of different languages including the infamous Russian, which teaches players to despise anybody who does not speak English as their first language. As well as being multicultural, the dota 2 matchmaking is just phenomenal. It always ensures you are put with first class Russian feeders, which really improves the gameplay as it allows you to be unable to play a game of dota without experiencing the variety of different 'styles of play' that this game offers to the community. As a whole this game encourages suicidal thoughts, rage and possible brain hemorrhages and/or heart attacks. 10/10 would uninstal, then reinstal. 11 vodkas  cyka blyat mid or fid

review: Community with toxicity levels rivaling the other horrible competitive games out there. Avoid it unless your Warcraft 3 nostalgia is a large as your tolerance for Humanity's pettiest of creatures. Nice people do play the game, but they are overshadowed by the far-larger "variety of unmedicated disorders" that plague the gamer community as a whole. What's worse is Valve has three cash cow micropayment fests now, and they don't look to be dissuaded from that. They've hidden it so well since they're price-tagging "holier than thou satisfaction" (percieved social status through cosmetics) rather than skill-removing or advantage giving items. it's holding art assets to ransom instead of code. I don't want to have to pay USD$2.49 to unlock the orange HEV suit skin or "classic" crowbar reskin some day.

review: It's a good game and all. but it has so many flaws. first off, the pros. The game is getting massive content every now and so and it feels fresh, the map is fantastic and simple to learn. same with the heroes too and the community made content is fantastic! but the cons.. where do I begin? now, I love this game and everything... but the community is just what ruins it. I've been into games and I have over 800 hours plus and still being called an noob and everything and blames me. there is some situations that I couldn't do anything and my friend keeps trying to help, and no one else trys to come to the lane. and i'm the one getting blamed. also, the game seriously need either: more servers, or region locks. because I am sick and tired of being matched with peruvians, portugese, russians, etc. and not to mention, if you're in a parties. more chances you're gonna find some stupid clan team that does nothing but just does stun stacks while we just wanna have fun. the worse of all, is the people who always spam "UMADBRO?" and take insults from . but seriously, it's impossible to not be frustrated in a video game, espacilly dota... seriously. it's just sad that these kind of communities just ruin a game, and I can no longer have fun. To me, the game is just not fun anymore. some heroes are broken as hell, heck valve tried to nerf riki... but they just buffed him more instead. well gg.

review: I have played a game that has similarities to this one. It is called League of Legends. I can tell you this: "If you are one of those sub-humans that think L.O.L. is a decent game, I feel for you. I pray to valve gods that RIOT sinks into the sea, and you all are saved from the horrors that lie deep within the L.O.L." George to the Apostles 2:16 DOTA is the game to go with. If you are a male in your 30s and you love to hit it off with actual humans then play DOTA, but I suggest being part of the PC master race before playing. If one plays on a Mac, You will find it hard to be liked. People will ask "why you are playing on a toaster?", or "What is this 'Mac' you speak of?" On the third day Gaben had cometh and said to all the sub-humans in conjuction to himself, "Illumanati...I belive that is how you spell it...Wait I mean the 'Orange box 2.0' will include HL3, LSD, Cocaine and Cocaine accesories." GABEN- Illumanati 2019 Pretty much, DOTA 2 is good. Unless you are a dingo baby-eating, coco puff-sniffing turtle soup . -A loyal RITO Consumer

review: I used to play this game in order to clear my mind and relax from playing League of Legends but now it's exactly the opposite. Very addictive game, loads of fun, coming from someone with a fair amount of experience in MOBAs. Loads of heroes to choose from (all free to use with purchasable skins), tons of items and possible item builds, some nice workshop content and a lot of support from the community. Community overall is not perfect but you will never find a "perfect" gaming community. I recommend this game to people who enjoy playing battle arena games and remember: you're playing for fun, not to win.

This game sucks because you automatically get every champion and they are all confusing other than sniper which has to be the most skilled champion in this copy cat of a game.

The graphics are good, the game mechanics are fun and varied, the enviroment and map seems to be quite detailed too, I may not play it too much, but that doesn't means I think that indeed this game is one of the best; if not the best game out there of the MOBA genre.

League of Legends offers you better artwork than better graphics, with a paid roster of over-designed heroes that makes it look like an all-star fighter game, also with more sellout boobs and more fan-made porn Dota 2 offers you height vision, unforgiving death penalties, buyback, fortification, day/night cycle that affects gameplay, all chat, a state of the art replay system, over a 100+ items with various active effects and more! League of Legends offers you... nothing? yes. "League of Legends is more popular than Dota 2" is what you're gonna say? Does it make it the best game? no. Because if i followed your logic, then Candy Crush Saga & Flappy Bird are the best games ever! or Call of Duty is better than Battlefield? Rust is better than DayZ? Counter-Strike is better than Insurgency? Team Fortress 2 is better than.. oh  this one anyways, its a breeding ground for casuals who cant handle frustration and competitiveness in videogames. Anyways... Pick your poison, DotA or LoL?

review: My first MOBA game. Very difficult, and very competitive. Easily the worst part of this game is the community. However, your performance does impact your team's performance, so be sure to watch some videos, play some bot games, and ask some questions before you play matchmaking, or you will definitely jarate off your entire team. There's a very nice hero selection, so you have a lot of choices. It now just needs more maps ;) (I'm no map purist)

review: Strangely addictive after you've figure out one hero. Alternatively frustrating and exhilirating. Interesting events. Nice when you have a team or bunch of friends but also good to play solo. Love the hero items and effects. Agonizing to play when the internet connection is bad or when you have abusive teammates. Every game, even played with the same people, is different. Infinite combinations of heroes, items, usage and player skills. Takes some time to get the hang of any hero at first but some help always... helps... hahaha... =) Enjoy!!

review: Dota 2, sebuah game yang menuntut pemahaman yang lebih dari seorang gamer yang ingin mahir bermain Dota. 800 jam saya bermain bahkan saya belum berani berkata bahwa saya sudah mahir bermain Dota. Dota 2 adalah game bergenre RTS, dimana didalamnya pemain akan bertanding 5vs5 dalam sebuah map dengan 3 line yang akan digunakan untuk lining (istilah untuk farming exp dan gold) dengan tujuan akhir menghancurkan ancient lawan. Tiap pemain akan memainkan sebuah hero, yang hero-heronya itu memiliki role dan peran masing-masing demi mendukung kemenangan tim. Untuk memulai belajar bermain, saya sarankan menonton tutorial di Youtube akun DotaCinema :) Dota 2 menurut saya sudah sangat baik dalam hal gaming experience, akan tetapi masih kurang dari segi cash in game yang berguna untuk kosmetik hero yang digunakan. Pengembang Dota 2 seolah tidak berusaha untuk mengendalikan pasar item yang harganya sangat-sangat mahal. Hal ini disatu sisi memang menunjukkan bahwa Dota 2 memiliki pemain yang serius dan berdedikasi untuk game, tapi di sisi lain cenderung tidak ramah kepada pemula-pemula yang ada. Tapi hal ini bukan masalah yang serius, karena banyak orang yang menikmati permainannya tanpa memikirkan itemnya. Sebagai game yang memiliki pemain aktif terbanyak di Steam, anda harus mencobanya!

review: I hate competitive games. Especially moba's and starcraft. This one however managed to suck me in with "vs bots" game mode and cosmetic items store. I'm still not sure how or why it happened but i do enjoy playing Dota and sometimes i even play vs people, even though it makes me want to cry or yell in rage. There are few major issues with Dota 2 at the moment: 1) Absence of communication between developers and players. Dev forums seem to exist only for players, since thousands of bugs (especially cosmetic ones) and suggestions simply remain ignored. 2) Infrequent content updates and lack of features. They could've at least allowed us to play game modes from different events to diversify gameplay or added new maps, instead they keep focusing on adding new cosmetic items. 9 out of 10 updates only include "hats". Game folder keeps growing but nothing changes gameplay-wise. They even stopped adding new bots to my favourite game mode. 3) Constant server side issues which they can't fix. There are issues with downloading replays, reconnecting to games, watching matches, searching for games and even finishing matches without somebody getting crashes or disconnects. 4) A lot of racism, swearing and general anger towards other players. Especially Russians. Report system is completely inadequate and doesn't help at all. I would recommend Dota 2 because its cute and well-thought game, with amazing voice-overs and excellent replayability. I do advise however against spending money in their store since once your start you cannot stop. This is probably how drug addiction works - they pull you in with free stuff and then you just want to complete a set, buy new items because of the modified effects, gamble for a chance to get some common item which would later cost hundreds of dollars (valve deliberately removes some items to drive up prices), find some unusual courier which could easily compensate all of your spendings... or plunge yourself into poverty if you get unlucky with chests.

review: Great game, really enjoyable. The character selection is fantastic. They still add in new heroes from time to time to keep it lively. They keep it updated to keep it lively as well. Great selection of community made skins, weapons, etc. alongside a fun selection of voiceovers that you can choose as the announcer. If you don't like buying DLC or add-on content, they allow it to be shared in games so it eleminates the hassle of never being able to see it in action and, for me, eleminates me having to ever buy the content =-). It's one of the top MOBA's out there. Only drawback would be the community that encompasses it. Sometimes it's not so bad depending on the group you get matched with. Obviously, the way to get around this problem is to play with a bunch of friends you know so you won't ever get "grouped" up with others. Nevertheless, the learning curve on the game can be harsh, as can the general rules of the game. I prefer the fact that it is punishing if you get killed frequently/on a regular basis.

review: Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena game from Valve. Dota 2 is the next installment from the previous game or mods Dota. Dota 2 has the same gameplay as Dota. You pick your heroes, and then battle them in one map against another player. In the arena, as you kill and progress you will get coins and the use them to buy items to enhance your heroes on your current battle in the arena. You need to pick the right items each time you play as it will decide you will win the game or not. Dota 2 introduce item drops each time you finish a match online. There are many items in Dota 2 that can enhance your favourite heroes looks. Each item has rarity, the more rare the items, the more expensive it will become. Most items can be sold in the Steam Marketplace. Dota 2 has far improved graphics from the previous game. Heroes are even more detailed and the arena has better view. All heroes ability effects are also improved, even the UI is better. Dota 2 has many tournaments that you can participate. The biggest is "The International" Dota 2 tournament. Most tournaments can reward players with some rare items just by watching the tournaments. Dota 2 is the best MOBA game yet. I recommend this. Rating 9/10

review: A very confusing game, that strives to continue where Heroes of Legends left off, but resorts a bit too often to slavic jump-scares to create an immersive Slenderman-like experience. Current main issues: Pros: - A friendly and positive community - Possibility to make friends and discuss delicate topics with new people from various ethnic backgrounds, chat comes with emoticons and other essential stuff - Strong focus for learning new languages - Full of fun mini-games if the main game is not compelling, like the Shopkeeper's quiz, buying stuff from the Valve shop, in-game advertisement clicking, guess-games for DOTA 2 network offline times etc Cons: - I picked the Sniper class but had trouble aiming in the first person mode, needs to be fixed asap - Playing the game with Oculus Rift resulted in nausea - Low replayability, after their first game everone I know has practically reached their skill cap - Basic things like in-game quicksave and quickload functionality is missing - Raid bosses like Roshan and Troll Warlord are hard to understand and severely imbalanced - Steam achievements were teased but are still not working, I already ate my 500th tree but didn't get the achievement - The crafting system is confusing and unintuitive - Want to create a drum? Well, you need a robe and a bracer, of course! Want to create a buckler? Yep, you guessed it, you need a chainmail shirt armor and a branch! - Hitboxes are off and often clipping; for example, I bought a bigger sword for the Sven class, but game doesn't register hits that clearly happen against smaller models like the Phantom Assassin - NPCs like the mud golem and the shopkeeper only have few lazy dialogue lines, I was more interested in hearing their immersive part of the story while constructing a hut in a nearby forest out of treebranches - RTS system for building or repairing base components are limited to only a few heroes and could use a revamp - Character wipes happen a bit too often in the servers I've been at Without going into too many spoilers, finishing the campaign left me with more questions than satisfying answers. For example, why was the evil Dragon Knight so eager to hurt the seemingly innocent creeps for monetary gain? Why did the mysterious Drow Ranger attack our valiant hero? Why does Axe look like a tomato? So many questions, yet so few answers. Overall, the game is OK for an early access FPS-RPG hybrid but doesn't entertain the more hardcore gamers for very long. For a small-time indie developer team I guess it's acceptable, but I'd wait for more available DLC expansions before paying anything for the main game.

Having a big studio behind it and loads of fans from Warcraft 3 times made it very easy for DotA 2 to become an competitive game and e-sport, but for me is not enough to hide one of the biggest flaws this game has which is: RNG. DotA 2 has loads of items and heroes based on procs and other random elements which leaves many fights in this game to chance, a thing that i dislike so much in PvP games. DotA 2 is a good game, but is not the PvP game i'm looking for.

review: So basically what happened was I was talking to my drug dealer / grandma about addictive substances, and i was running low on crack so she told me to try out dota 2 since it was free. Long story short i tried to rob a bank so I could afford the Arcana set for Legion Commander and now my cell mate's name is Chester. He keeps asking me what his name rhymes with but I dont know. He always spanks me and calls me naughty boy. Anyways, play this game if you like screaming and waking up your neighbor with epilepsy.

review: Stop playing LoL and WoW..... play a game that requires real skill. Just remember, you suck at DOTA2 til you have about 500 games won. Takes about 30-45 minutes per game..... and you're not winning a majority of your games. edit:wrote that review when I had played less than 30 hours of the game. Having played almost 1,000 hours on DOTA2 now, I stick by my previous assessment that DOTA ing sucks. I will  you in it though..... :D

review: I find it amusing because I'd actually say that DOTA2 is a bit easier. To deny, just right-click. League, you actually have to plan ahead and play significantly more cleverly to deny, predict your enemy's backing/roam more and be able to clear waves to use the tower instead. The mind games play a much larger role, as well as efficient use of skills, rather than just buying hard-counter items to match a given situation. The trouble is, it /looks/ simpler at first glance, while actually offering far more depth, strategy and complexity. So those who play at a low level never actually see anything more than 'simplified' gameplay, and quickly go back to D2 or HoN. And nothing of value was lost.

review: Funny game, competitive, every match is different... and best support and innovation I've seen in a long time in a game... And all this for free. Yeah, I could say we are in front of the best MOBA game in the market, but I can say some things that are not that great though about Dota 2 at the end of this review. It's true that this game is bringing the best innovation I've seen in a long time in a videogame. This industry is a bit stuck in making money giving just enough for the clients and players and then adding more to pay via DLCs, some times they even launch a game that is a Beta at 50 bucks price or higher. When I talk about innovation I mean, for example, about the best support for watching games, replays and tournaments. But the bad side of this is that if you want to watch tournament games... ALL of them requires a ticket to be bought, except the only free yearly tournament that is The International, being the only exception. Also, the visual customization of the heroes is insane, you can customize by separated parts (helm, shoulders, arms, body, legs, weapon...) just like in a MMO, and even some animations or skills... and you can trade all of your items in the market or with friends. The great thing about this game compared to others like League of Legends is that paying money does not affect to gameplay, just visuals. In League of Legends paying money gave you the advantage of having more and better runes and more rune pages, for example, giving you a little advantage in a competitive scenario. Also you need to buy some heroes/characters or you can't play all of them when you feel the need to. Even when you can buy those things without money, it's almost impossible to get everything without paying, even if you play a lot. Big limitations to competitive gameplay. In Dota 2 there is no restriction: you play every hero, you play with every skill. Also there is a lot of other great things like user skill and item builds and guides that you can select and use in-game and rate up or down, you can customize your own for each hero and even the announcer if you have one, among other things. Then, what is the bad side of Dota 2? First of it, you ALWAYS need a team in order to play or get some fun. Solo matchmaking is not just bad, it's horrible. No matter how good you are and how long you've been playing this game you will end up with drunk players, idiots, trolls, bored players who are not focused on the game... And this is on both sides of the game, in your team or in the other. Report system doesn't work at all (maybe just a bit for excessive cases), and even if you play with friends in a full team... You won't find balanced games. The common issue here is either you roflstomp the other team or they roflstomp yours even if you played great. Of course, playing with a full party of friends can decrease the chances this happens, but even with that, playing a good balanced, funny and competitive game will be hard. This said, they need to implement some kind of public ranking system in order to maybe avoid that a little. And then, maybe the things could become really better. But overall this is a great game with a very good support from their developers, constantly adding content and not just focusing on getting your money, something rare to find nowadays in the industry.

review: The game, where all s gather. If you thought annoying COD kids were too much, then you haven't experienced dota2 yet. It's full of obnoxious, rude people, who have absolutely no idea what a co-op / team game is about, and constantly whine about stolen kills, like if this was some FPS. The following list contains the type of people you will meet in dota: 1. 12 year olds, thinking they know everything, and play dota for life, while skipping school 2. People who can't speak english at all, despite playing with the english language filter 3. Reporters, who do nothing but  about everyone else, and report them for everything 4. Multiple account 'pros' who constantly swear about how their team sucks 5. Idiots, who tell you to attack 1v5 / close range against long / ask you to help and then run away 6. Quitters 7. Mr. AFK who gives up at the start of the game and just hangs around spawn 8. New players who get talked down for not completely understanding the game after 2 seconds 9. Extremely rare, but nice and helpful people Worst. Community. Ever.

review: Dota 2 - A Game worth getting/playing Generally let me start of by saying I usually play alot of playstation but Dota 2 got me hooked and im still hooked on it. Ranged from using abilities, working as a team to the just pure enjoyment of having a last kill. Player friendly, can spend hours enjoying it with mates/friends and well if you decide to go alone, take some time to practice and learn the capabilities of each hero. I think this game is fun and yeah what makes it amazing is each character takes some time to play with its not like easy from the start which makes it fair for the noobs/newbies to the game. Positives about the game: Loads of characters Loads of items to choose from Epic duals to awesome kill streaks And well u think there are negatives, but its hard to find one except for the fact that the creators have created a awesome game but my only negative would be the maps. Stuck on the same map makes u wonder when the update will come or if will ever but yeah its only a small lag in the game which u can bypass!!! Negative Different maps Anyhows said enough, if u guys find it helpful pls like it and yeah catch u on dota 2 :)

review: Recommended. I'm not playing anymore, but still. + Nice graphics + Lots of new stuff coming to game + Big hero pool + Lots of gamemodes - Annoying people - here, in EU, it is kind of big problem. I was playing on EU servers (west and east) /w English prefference. But people usually don't care; I need to say, that raging EU guys are annoying. When you make mistake, you are hated from them, reported or something. And that's big problem. Mostly for new players, who just want to try for example new hero. - Pinging - this is pretty much connected with "Annoying people" point. You know, you can always ping or draw on map. I once met guy who stole my items and pinged me all the time. It is annoying and you can't focus. (btw. I reported him. When you have to, report. Don't be scared) - AD spells - some are not working. Idk why, but they aren't.. It is really stupid -but this is just small thing. Guys, guys! Play this game, really. It is fun. You just need to learn it. ~ Thx for reading.

review: Dota 2 consists the most unblanaced heros for any game on the market as of right now! There so many over powered abilities on too many heros. In fact, the heros are considered over powered are played every single, of every single match. Dota 2 is the worst game, I have ever played due to the lack community(which is toxic), hero abilities which are over powered, and all around broken game. If you like your sanity, do not play this game. If you do not want to become racist, do not play this, if you don't rich pumping  tons of money into professional gaming just so the game can make a buck or two, do not play game. If you do not like Russia, do not play this game. If you do not like any hispanic, do no play this game. Basically, what saying to you, if you want to play a moba, go play league of legends.

review: If you want to get rich playing games then this is the game to play. This is an amazing multiplayer online battle arena. The real-time strategy is the best part. If you ever want to win a game you must out think you opponent. Communication with you team is key, although you might end up hating them shortly after they start dying. The only down fall is abrasive players, if you tend to die lot and feed the other team some of your teammates will release their rage upon you. Other than the sore losers that you will meet from time to time this game has an amazing community. The Dota 2 community is a bit crazy but in a good way for Valve at least because they spend over 20 million dollars in just over 2 weeks. Currently about 8 million of those dollars are going towards the prize pool of The International, the ultimate tornament for the best Dota 2 players in the world. The team that gets 1st place will get around 4 million dollars and 2nd through 8th place will split the rest. Keep in mind that this game is free to play it is not pay to win; you never have to pay anything to enjoy Dota 2 at its full potential. Everything that is sole in game is cosmetic and does not affect you performance in-game. Again I say if you want to get rich playing games then this is the game to play.

review: This is the best video game I've ever played hands down. I have so much to say where do I start. Ok so dont be turned away by the huge learning curve, when you start you will be TERRIBLE but thats ok and likely you may never be great but you will make amazing friends and have so much fun. Actually I wish i could go back to being a blissfully ignorant noob because learning hero's abilities, what certain items do, lane compesitions, ect I can go on forever about how much there is to learn even after 2.5k hours (probably 1.5k - 2k hours actually playing) I'm still learning! The game hits an odd paradox it can be the most satisfying and exciting game I've ever played but also the most enraging and frustrating, its a ing emotional roller coaster sometimes. There will be highs there will be lows from amazing comebacks, to terrible throws, great teamwork, and Brazilian  feeders. I've even tried giving up after long agonizing losing streaks but nothing, no other game can quite fill hole not playing this game for a few hours a day leaves. Its perfect for me, I love being social, competitive, passionate, and excited all maybe too much at times but thats just the kind of person I am. Some of my best friends I've made playing dota with and even though I've never meet most of them I love them all and noting can quite compare to queueing for a ranked captains mode game with a 5 stack. Valve is an amazing company and I'm glad they took the game and ran with it. Were constantly getting new seasonal events, heros, game modes, and more cosmetic items I can throw my money at. Oh and one of the best parts, all the heros are free and unlocked from the start! No progression system where you can buy characters with in game currency or level up some  passives in a skill tree or something (like a certain game). You don't need to spend a dime but I strongly suggest you should considering your funding not only the people who make the game but the cosmetics are created by the community who they pay! Also all the items are tradeable, Ive spent countless hours browsing trading sites looking to swap my items that I got for free as random drops for my favorite heros new hat or whatever. Ive spent way too much time watching pro games as well which Valve fully embraces, they even host one of the biggest e-sport tournaments ever every year called The International. I put a good bit of time into writing this review so thanks for reading it all if this even gets one person to give it a try then its not time wasted. I hope you enjoy the game half as much as I do.

Hundreds of hours spent on playing on the same map, even with lots of heroes. After first 20-30 hours, u'll start to be too agressive. After first 100 hours, u'll split up with ur girl friend and u will play dota even more times per week. After 500 hours, u'll  every mom u will meet. After 1000 hours... You're nobody. You got no friends, no girldfriend, no knowledge... Everything u have is DOTA. Do not play this game.

review: This is pretty much my favourite game of all time. The learning curve for the game is pretty brutal and it is quite difficult to become good at it, but once you do become a competent player, the game is infinitely rewarding. The game is always changing with regular balance patches and holiday events and the cosmetic item system is pretty awesome. You can customize the appearance of all the heroes and it does not affect the balance of the game and I find collecting cosmetic items to be quite fun. If you are into trading you can make a ton of money (steam wallet funds) playing this game. Pretty much all my steam games come from profits from cosmetic DotA 2 item trading. I have been playing DotA for 10+ years (including WC3 DotA) and never get bored of this game. I have played other DotA style games before and HoN and LoL can't hold a candle to this game. Seriously, those other games do not even come close to being as good as DotA 2 in terms of game and community. There is also a large esports scene around DotA 2 if you are into that.

Can be a Walrus. Very enjoyable once you've learnt the basics. Cons ~ This game is not newb friendly what so ever. Smurfs. Leavers. 10 year olds. Pudges ;-; Steep learning curve. You WILL sometimes be the only person on your team that speaks english (Even if you are queing for servers where you live.

review: "Actually DotA HD" I came into this game a little uneasy, my past with DotA1 not being the brightest in the world; but seeing something named "DotA2" I excepted new features, characters, etc etc. I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG! Valve honestly didn't add a single thing (except one thing we'll get to later) the shop interface is still more unfriendly than a rabid bear in heat, mages are still completely useless in late game are are the least used class of character, the balance is still horribly out of whack leaving a single fed agility hero to be able to take an entire team by himself *cough* Antimage *cough* and it just feels lazy. Even the characters were lifted straight from the WarCraft III modles. Now back to what valve actually DID add... Hats. Not even joking. This is a shameless cash grab by Valve, do not spend money on this game. If you want the REAL "DotA2" play "League of Legends" it was an upgrade from the orignal BY the original creators, there's a reason LoL is #1.

review: this game is interesting because while it is very enjoyable and there is lots of variety; the people you will play with rarely know how to work as a team and when they do its becasue the enemy is really bad at the game. Also the community is very unwelcoming to noobs so if you just joined and are learning how to play nobody likes you. all in all it is one of my favorites but i will warn you it isnt the easist to just pick up and play. Also there is a low prioority pool so if you cant get out of that you will always be with noobs even if you are a good player.

review: Dota 2 consists the most unblanaced heros for any game on the market as of right now! There so many over powered abilities on too many heros. In fact, the heros are considered over powered are played every single, of every single match. Dota 2 is the worst game, I have ever played due to the lack community(which is toxic), hero abilities which are over powered, and all around broken game. If you like your sanity, do not play this game. If you do not want to become racist, do not play this, if you don't rich pumping  tons of money into professional gaming just so the game can make a buck or two, do not play game. If you do not like Russia, do not play this game. If you do not like any hispanic, do no play this game. Basically, what saying to you, if you want to play a moba, go play league of legends.

review: If you want to get rich playing games then this is the game to play. This is an amazing multiplayer online battle arena. The real-time strategy is the best part. If you ever want to win a game you must out think you opponent. Communication with you team is key, although you might end up hating them shortly after they start dying. The only down fall is abrasive players, if you tend to die lot and feed the other team some of your teammates will release their rage upon you. Other than the sore losers that you will meet from time to time this game has an amazing community. The Dota 2 community is a bit crazy but in a good way for Valve at least because they spend over 20 million dollars in just over 2 weeks. Currently about 8 million of those dollars are going towards the prize pool of The International, the ultimate tornament for the best Dota 2 players in the world. The team that gets 1st place will get around 4 million dollars and 2nd through 8th place will split the rest. Keep in mind that this game is free to play it is not pay to win; you never have to pay anything to enjoy Dota 2 at its full potential. Everything that is sole in game is cosmetic and does not affect you performance in-game. Again I say if you want to get rich playing games then this is the game to play.

review: Dota 2 is one of the best Free 2 Play First Person Shooters of the Animated Cartoon Genre I have ever seen. I have played this game for over 1000 hours and have learned many new languages such as Russian and Peruvian, I have learned that no matter how long you play the game there will always be someone there to tell you you are a "noob", and I have only thought about murdering my friends over this game twice.

review: Easily the most fascinating strategy games in years and easily the most exciting to watch (regular matches to tournament / championships) Bringing the most spectacular and vividly detailed strategies to players and viewers alike. One of the most addicting games ever made; and one you can never master as something can always be countered. While some people may be turned off by the first few games due to he learning curve; rest assured if you dip atleast 10 hours into learning how to really play the game and the character you chose to start playing with, you will soon be engulfed in an AAA package unlike any other game, which is why I give it a 10/10 - Many RTS games, RPG Games, MOBA's, Hybrids, all bring new innovative things to plate; or end up getting big by copying a formula near exact (such as LoL... -sigh- ) - DOTA 2 is the best "Action Real Time Role Playing Game" or "MOBA" (Name doesn't matter) but it's the best in its field and one of the best online centered titles you'll ever play.

This game is better off you recognizing every aspect of the game and getting used to the learning curve, play 600-2000 hours, get mad at it, and fanboy over professional teams. Fanboying and following professional teams and tournaments is the best way to go. Also the lore isn't half bad. TL;DR this game is better than League of ies

There are three types of heroes: Strength, Agility and Intelligence. Strength heroes are more on physical abilities and tough to deal with. Agility heroes are more on damaging and ints are more on supports.

review: Dota 2...where to begin? Dota 2 is a game of ups and down, heart break and happiness, and most of all, utter ing sadness. This game will literally kick you when you're down,  on you, and then continue to make you give your own father fellatio. Dota is not a game for the faint at heart and one should only attempt to play it if ready to lose; but losing the match isn't all you'll lose! When playing with friends you will find yourself constantly hating each other as you or your friend(s)  up. You will latch onto that hate and it will consume you. If you can survive the hate and keep coming back though, you will soon emerge into a world of new found misery and sometimes joy, as you begin to learn the basics. You will start to win, while you remain to lose at the same time. Dota 2 is a game where the player never truly wins. The player is never truly good, they're only slightly better each and every time; and every time will be different, no matter how many hours you pour into the masochistic game, that is -- Dota 2.

review: '"Is DotA2 a fun game?" is usually the first question people ask about this game. Great games in recent times seem to often have set themselves apart from other games by being an 'experience game' as an example Proteus is 100% experience and very little game. Braid was great because it was an innovative platformer but some of the greatest lasting attraction I felt to the game was because of the endearing story and symbolism that was symbiotic to the music and art of the game. DotA 2 is not a game that tries to make it as easy as possible to 'experience' the game and then be done with it, unlike the set of games that have defined themselves a new genre in run of the mill First Person Shooters which make it as easy as possible for new players to complete sections of it and reach great heights in an attempt to lower the dominance new players have through tricks like fast healing, killstreaks and fast respawns. It doesn't fit with Half Life 2 like games in being a great singleplayer experience which you run through like a roller-coaster ride either: each game starts out the same but can diverge in an incalculable number of ways due to the enormous number of variables innate in the vast number of heroes and builds. DotA 2 is a game; a game with rules and learning and practising; a game where you can't see the top of the skill ladder from the middle, a game that is challenging and intriguing at every turn. What is it that makes a game fun? I don't think anyone knows the true formula, but we know that fun activates the reward centres of the brain. DotA 2 will give you the rulebook and some practise scenarios, but you cannot expect to have it play itself. You must teach yourself the game and through your endeavours you will get noticeably better each time and you can and will feel proud of it. DotA 2 challenges both the intellect and the reflexes with battles between an enormous range of heroes each with interesting, astoundingly well thought out and developed move-sets and characters. Because of the sheer challenge and complexity of what DotA 2 provides, it is a very fulfilling game with much room for growth; it is a game that will be enjoyable, I expect for a very long time. Because of this, DotA 2 is not a game that is inherently fun in as much as you can't pick up a pack of cards for the first time and expect to play poker. But we have touched only on the mechanics of the game: DotA 2 takes place on a very beautiful map, complete with birds and squirrels, fish and butterflies, spiders and cobwebs, day and night; and forests and ravines. In honesty, all it would require for me to feel its atmosphere was perfectly polished would be weather effects it would be wonderful to see rain splashing in the river, or even little streams! The game has over 100 heroes, each memorable, with well-developed movesets, storylines and copious amount of character-to-character dialogue which allow the game's endearing heroes to cater to a huge variety of playstyles. Overall, DotA 2 is a game that is not made to take Game of the Year one year, then fade into obscurity as people complete it, it's a game that sits in that category of games that you go to to have fun with some friends, it's a game that wants you to keep coming back to it and you know in years time you can still pick up the cards and have fun again. If you want to pick up DotA 2, which, I should again emphasise requires some self-investment I suggest you ask a friend to introduce you one-on-one to the game's concepts with passive bots, then practise with bots, trying characters until you find one you like and are good at. Progressing to be able to beat the hard bots with little difficulty is very good preparation for multiplayer. Then, all get on mic and play an online game, you'll win or at least have fun if you co-operate.' - Zemnmez 2k13

review: This game allows you to exert your knowledge and understanding of layered mechanics (and exceptions of those game mechanisms) onto randomly-selected regional people without their permission or interest. Heated debates can lead to forged alliances to achieve that common goal or end into displaced frustration projected onto others to substitute one's own failures and inabilities to execute one's characters' (heroes') qualities. On the other hand, this game allows one to create 'hero build' guides as a pretense to be productive with his/her vexation as well as to fruitlessly raise the standard of expected knowledge of the game through item and ability walkthroughs in hopes that those one encounters in the future, rely on these indirect, serviced suggestion(s).

review: Quite tough for new players, but you once you start digging deep you'll find an infinite amount of depth in this gem. Originally a Warcraft 3 mod, this faithful remake brings the original into an all new graphics style which is very pleasant to look at. The game itself is a bottomless pit of mastering every hero, every item, and digging deep into the mechanics for the win. This game rewards time investment with a world that in some ways rivals ten games in complexity and depth. Plus, it's completely free, save for cosmetic items that don't affect gameplay at all. This means that all the characters will be unlocked right from the get-go. And of course, new heroes are still being added from the mod. I really look forward to the ongoing future for this game - winning a match beats everything else in its euphoria effect, and riding the high is half the game of Dota 2. Play it - even if you're scared of the community.

review: If you're jumping in this game alone, you're gonna have a bad time. DoTA2 is a team based game, if you're not playing it with a team mindset, you're wrong, and you're impression of the game will be wrong. The character select screen is incredibly daunting when you first start, and most of the characters are unique in their abilities, it takes many hours (days?) to even consider yourself a rookie in this game. After a week of playing nothing but 'Least Played' mode, you'll be pretty in the know of most of the characters, it's going to take watching youtube guide videos, experimenting, careful study of the tournament games and overall pure luck on who you get teamed up with (god help you if you're playing solo) to be able to win a game and even understand why you did. In short, what you need is; Trustworthy teammates, lots of free time, dedication, the ability to adapt well, and a looped playlist of 'Eye of The Tiger' and 'You're The Best'. Then maybe, you'll be considered a "nub" that won't get reported.

review: Gamenya bagus banget, grafik luar biasa dengan gameplay sama kayak dota 1. Nilai tambah disini karena steam yang menopang game dota 2, dimana keamanannya luar biasa ketat, namun jadi boomerang sendiri yang kadang dimana keamanannya malah sedikit "menggangu" player, karena tiap ada hal yg berhubungan sama security harus nunggu berapa hari Di Indonesia mungkin kurang ada wadah buat nopang player yang  game ini, mungkin lebih ke akses pembelian barang, dan lain-lain. Diharapkan steam bisa membantu player Indonesia yang ingin menyalurkan aktifitasnya agar menjadi lebih mudah didalam dota maupun steam Overall good banget!!

The continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. It's hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. I'm helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. If you can spare the time - play it. :)

review: I used to play DOTA 1 on my old Pentium 4 PC back in 2009 and it was a great experience. And when I learned that Valve acquired the rights to make a sequel for 1st mod game I was shocked like "How can they do that?, are they going to collaborate with blizzard to develop a new one?".. But then I found out that the project will be a standalone sequel without Warcraft or Blizzard.. And when I tried the final product I was surprised cause it's very similar to it's predecessor and for those who enjoyed the first one, I'm pretty sure that you will surely enjoy this Valve version as well, not to mention Ice Frog, one of the main modders of DOTA1 was the lead designer of this game so expect that the features that you've loved on the first still remains in this version.. Kudos to Valve and Ice Frog.. So far I'm enjoying the game more than any other titles on Steam... I will definitely recommend this to MOBA addicts out there, especially the DOTA 1 patrons..

review: Do you like being matched with non-English speakers on English servers and losing to "right click to win" heroes? Do you love lack of communication between team members in a team game? THEN YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE! Introducing Dota 2, the most innovative method of mental self-harm known to man. Some games are so "fun" (ed), you'll want to commit seppuku to end the miserable experience. The best part about Dota is when you make the life of the other team miserable. Then you're in for a world of fun. PS. Always, always, always bring along some friends. Dota may be agonizing otherwise. The more friends you play with, the better.

review: Dota 2 is a free Strategy / RPG type game made by the worlds most biggest and succesful Game Company - Valve. Dota 2 gives you the oppurtunity to learn skills and tactics you have never been able to learn before, and also has a money making potential to it. Dota lets you master different players in the game, getting stronger and unlocking new items for them to make them more "Buff". There are three lanes in Dota, Top, Bottom and Middle, all in which occupy a tower to defend the teams "Ancient". To win the game, you will need to destroy the towers to get to the ancient and then destroy the Ancient with it. 10/10, I love this game.

review: This is a very competitive game with some incredibly complicated mechanics. The graphics are nice, everything runs well and I've rarely seen issues, which are fixed on a regular basis. What makes it entertaining to me is the combination of hundreds of available characters, each with their own relatively unique skill set, along with hundreds of items to be bought during the course of each match. In a 5 man team, there are endless combinations of roles which can make for a solid strategy. There is a matchmaking system that does a fair job of creating balanced teams (hopefully, dear player, after you have practiced playing with bots and know all of the heroes) and an endless learning curve. The only problem I have with the game is how much abuse is prevalent in the community. New players are able to join matches before they have the experience to make reliable teammates and rather than give them advice or instruction, many would simply vote to kick a player from the team, and 4v5 is hardly ever winnable. I wish there were more people able to demand some respect and cooperation, that I had more reports for those who use the word noob regularly and then claim the game is over before it began because of anything else. If you like competition, teamwork, hilarious math, reflexes, and leadership, then this is one of the best games you'll find. But it will be frustrating at times.

I've travelled wide and far to experience the european servers but no matter how hard I try, I can never seem to find the promised lands. I've been around to experience the following: Ti3 = Na'Vi fountain hooking whilst Gabe Newel was clearly there. Diretide 2013 =   _  Give DIRETIDE VOLVO! Chinese New Year = "Broken ShiTblades,  my life I quit this  game." Ti4 = Techies confirmed, Valve shut up and take my money. 12/10 rated. Much fun. Very Russian. Too many reddit leaks. Would recommend, have recommended. They continue to play Call of Duty & GTA V. Maybe I should recommend to PC gamers, League of Lung Cancer still beats Defense Of The Ancient-russians 2

review: Dota 2 - A Game worth getting/playing Generally let me start of by saying I usually play alot of playstation but Dota 2 got me hooked and im still hooked on it. Ranged from using abilities, working as a team to the just pure enjoyment of having a last kill. Player friendly, can spend hours enjoying it with mates/friends and well if you decide to go alone, take some time to practice and learn the capabilities of each hero. I think this game is fun and yeah what makes it amazing is each character takes some time to play with its not like easy from the start which makes it fair for the noobs/newbies to the game. Positives about the game: Loads of characters Loads of items to choose from Epic duals to awesome kill streaks And well u think there are negatives, but its hard to find one except for the fact that the creators have created a awesome game but my only negative would be the maps. Stuck on the same map makes u wonder when the update will come or if will ever but yeah its only a small lag in the game which u can bypass!!! Negative Different maps Anyhows said enough, if u guys find it helpful pls like it and yeah catch u on dota 2 :)

review: A pulchritudinous looking game, it is definitely my personal favorite MOBA game yet. It has a huge hero roster, is completely free (the only possible transactions result in aesthetic changes), requires coordinated teamwork and has a huge fan base and community. That said, you should be wary of many of the players, as many are extremely negative and will work to frustrate and annoy you in whatever way possible. In many cases you will feel that an opponent is overpowered, or a particular hero is cheap, but I can assure that in 95% of these cases, that is not true. I would also highly recommend that you learn the basics first and complete the tutorial, because your first few games are gonna be rough; you will probably get crushed into the finest paste you've ever been in your life.

In my 600 hours of gameplay I regret nothing except for the mass amount weight I have amassed playing dota a total of how much i gained. I figured for every hour played I gained 1.5 LBs now I am going to be competition for the worlds biggest man. Overall dota is a great game. I would recommend this to anyone I have noticed also my grades have slipped but I have plenty of time to catch up with the grades becuase I am only in thrid grade.

review: Oh wow look at me, writing a review for 1 of my 3 favorite games on Steam at 10:00 P.M. time for spell check spam. Well anyways as I said it is one of my 3 favorite games on Steam so lets start at the begginning. It all started in World of Warcraft, I bought the game in 2008 and knew little about. Later I found out it was Warcraft 4, so I went and looked at Wacraft 3. One of the mods for Warcraft 3 is called Dota (Defense of the Anchients) sound familiar? Well it is a super worked on mod that eventually turned into a game. Dota2, this has got to sound familiar to you now. So basically last time I counted there were 100 something classes in the game so obviously I wanted to try them all. Yah, I got to about 1/3 and I got tired of failing with new classes. So I chose my favorite class. Phantom Lancer. Anyways in Dota2 you can go around and kill people in a 5v5 match, doesn't get much better than that... Oh wait! It does. When ever you think you have the best class, there is one better than you. So you'll always get owned by someone, unless your Riki, C'mon that guys a god. Basically the goal of Dota2 is to use teamwork and your brain to destroy atleast 5 towers, 2 barracks and the, well, Anchient, hence the name Defense of the Anchient. So I want to make this really long so I am going to go on. When I got my first name tag, kill counter, and description tagged and jumped in joy. I was able to make the best item ever! (It is a common xD) So, in short do you like MOBA games? Roleplaying games? Strategy games? Teamwork games? Games where you break your keyboard? Dota2 is the game for you! To continue on with my jibber-jabber I would like to introduce No one the Puppet. No one the Puppet: Hi bros and brodettes! Get this game! It's free, fun, fascinating, furious, fabulous, frightening, fantastic, funny, fuming, another "F" verb and so much more! So get it. Post more "F" words below! Anyways I give this game a 9.5/10. Only thing I don't like about it is that matches take 30-60 minutes long... and you don't want to leave your screen during that times. So get this game!! But I feel like this review is to short. I am going to talk about Riki. So Riki is a Dranei (flying space goat) Assassin, heh, that obliberates. He has a shadowstep that can teleport him to a target, where he can 3 shoot the enemy with 3 backstabs, throw down some powder making it so his enemies can't do crap, kill the other 4 enemies, vanish, and go buy a Divine Rapier. Yah that is pretty OP. If you want to suceed against Riki make sure he never hits level 6, when he gets his stealth ability which is his elite skill. He can basically be forever stealthed when he is out of combat for 3 seconds. More on elite skills, every class has one which is his or hers greated ability. But in my opinion Phantom Lancer is better. Once he is high level is invincible! He can do lots of damage with his normal attack and when you run away at 15% health he shoots a lance at your, finishing you off and summon an illusion. When you attack you can summon an illusion, and when that illusion attacks he can someone another illusion, so on and so forth. So basically what I am saying is that Phantom Lancer is also OP. There is another class called Sniper which you use in tutorial mode. Basically you can have Riki stand invisible by a tower, so you have a view of the tower but the tower isn't attacking Riki, then have a Sniper, outside of the towers range, shoot the tower down and destroy it in glory! This would also work for any other stealth classes. Well I do not know much else to say so I am going to end this here.... but... I have 1 more thing to say... GET THIS GAME! IT IS AWESOME!!!

review: Are language tutors like Rosetta Stone too pricy for you? Do you enjoy repeating tasks for hours for losses that will tear apart friendships and wins that will be forgotten about immediately? Do you find pride in knowing that you and your group of friends can work as hard as you can, and train for thousands of hours, only to be destroyed by a melanin enriched man livining in his chicken-farming parents' shack? Regardless of whether or not he's on your team? Do you like to receive a couple shiny, colourful virtual objects that compel you to spend money on more? Do you enjoy spectating other people playing games, and thinking to yourself "Gosh, they're so bad. If I were them, I would be doing so much better."? Do you enjoy semi-high pitched 'ping' noises? Do you enjoy shouting being emitted from a chain smoking Peruvian, into a ham radio, into a headset from 1993 radiating out of your speakers? Do you enjoy being blamed for every fault within your team? Do you enjoy right clicking? Are you a masochist? If you answered yes to any of these questions, Dota 2 is the game for you.

review: To start with if you're thinking of playing Dota2 it's going to be rough when you start and it's probably best to start with some friends, BUT when you get past that barrier you'll never find another game to fill that void of Dota2's MOBA experience. Would totally recommend this to anyone thinking of playing just beast through the beginners block and ignore the flamers :)

review: This game litterally ruined my life. I started playing dota awhile ago, thaught it was hard, but fun, so kept playing.... But now, Dota has taken everything away from me. Dota is my new life. I now don't get to go outside with my friends in the glorious sunlight. I no longer worry about grades at school. My dream is now to be Dendi. This game a has also brought out the dark side in me. Out of the over 800 hours i've been playing this game, at least 20% of me playing has been me screaming at my FREAKING TEAMATES BECAUSE ALL THEY DO IS FEED. This game has also made me extremely rasict to all non english speakers, especially: Peru, Brazil, every spanish speaking country, and Russia. Do I reccomend this game? HELL YEAH 100/10

review: There are a lot of MOBA games out there. A lot of them are basicly the same thing with different graphics and heroes/champions (you choose what you want to call them). However, there is something different about DOTA 2. I wouldn`t say it`s the difficulty (that depends on community more, than on the game itself). I don`t even think it`s the heroes, there are few unique heroes, you won`t find in other MOBA games, but a lot of them are simmilar (either visually or in their skills). I think this game has somethign in it, that makes you want to play it. It can`t be described. You won`t be able to tell what it is, but you will now it`s there. So it`s hard to say if this game is for you or if it isn`t. You won`t know until you play it. Be aware though. If you choose to give this game a try, expect that you will hate it and love it at the same time. You will hate and love the community. You will hate and love your friends you play this game with. BUT BE MOST AWARE OF HOW MUCH TIME YOU SPEND PLAYING THIS GAME, AS IT WILL TAKE ALL YOUR TIME ONCE YOU WILL BE DRAGGED INTO IT..

review: A real competitive game, Valve did a very nice job bringing dota 2. A real strategy game, a challeging fun game. There is over 112 Heroes to try, each one is balanced, and no hero is the most powerfull or the most weak, every hero in the game is equal, every hero have his / her's high and lows. And that my friend is Dota 2.

game-hours: 116.1
review: When I first tried to play Dota 2 - around the same time it came out - I made the mistake of jumping right on in thinking I knew exactly what I was doing; obviously failing, I gave up and left about ten-minutes later, and throughout the course of a few months, I did this about five-times, because I wanted to understand what the big deal was about it, and why people found and still find this game so addictive. Up until recently, I hated it with a passion - not only for being killed over-and-over - but also for the sheer complexity of it overall, but, now I know, I wasn't taking the time to actually appreciate that complexity and realise that the learning curve was so full of depth, that if you set your mind to it, you can seriously enjoy it. Considering it's all based around one map, with the same game-mode every time, it's evident you'd think it'd get boring quickly - but you'd be wrong. Even though this is the case, there's so many different heroes, with different abilities, and different play-styles, it just makes it more enticing. It's also extremely strategic and teammates count for everything, which means you'll be working together and maybe even making some more friends. In conclusion: This game is worth every hour you're willing to invest into it, and if you enjoy learning, teamwork and have an addictive personality like me, then those hours are going to be endless.

Strategy is perfectly orchestrated into the captivating gameplay and perfect graphics, storyline is not key but there are hints and traces of it shot out at you through weapon flavor text and fanmade comics. All in all this game is great, and although it may seem that this game is kind of lame because you don't keep items after matches at first, that doesn't matterf after the first hour or so of gameplay.

Just be warned though people are not friendly, people trashtalk a lot, people are very elitist regarding the meta builds and does not want you experimenting. If you encounter this people, mute them ASAP, dont bother firing back. Just remember you been warned. Have Fun! :)

review: the websters dictiondary definition of ancient is ancient adjective \'an(t)-sh?nt, 'a?(k)-sh?nt\ : very old : having lived or existed for a very long ti and Boy this game is old and existed a long time. Steam made the old game DO.N.A. and now made it into the new game D.O.T.A.2. it stands for Defence Of Ancients. it used to be a old game for nerds but now It's a real life recration of the medevil life style. you can go down to the street to buy wares from the Fat man down the Street like olive branch, the slippers, and a eye ball on a stick. Just like medeval Times. Its a real life simulater so its got night and Day also. you can do all the chores you want like chipping down a tree with a leaf and driving the donckey horse down to the river to drink (your Team Mates will get mad if you do this wrong so get a lot of practice) if you like to be wizzard and cast Magic this is the video game for you. its technically a Massiveley Multiplayer On Line Battle House, or MOBO. this means that 1. 1. theres a LOT of people thats playing it. I counted at least 8 people in one house. 2. theres A lot of magicyou can cash a spell and it makes the little guy glow with magic glowing rings. I think theres a nother spell but I did not try it yet. 3. theres a lot of medeval guys (and the ladies) to pick from. Marana is the best one though because she shoots a really big arrow and rides a lion cat so shes the fastest. Watch out though that its pro grammed to be a Realistic arrow so its slow. you can also play as a donckey horse and this is easier except some times it does not like to listen but thats what stubborn donckeys do. 4. and if you like Secrets then Boy there is a lot of secrets in this game to choose from. if you chip down the right tree in the forest you get hit by a lightning bolt!!! It's a hidden secret and i could not find out how to make it happen again. it also happened when i didn't chip down a tree so its weird. also did you know theres a secret Fat man in the woods that sells wares but i could only find him once. if you find him again please make a web site saying where he is. 5. theres a lot of peope that shout a insult and curse word at you. this is the bad part of the game. I dont know why Steam put this part into the game but the voice acting is not very good. if its too loud you can leave the game house though. also i have a gameplay Tips for you. -stay onto the side of the house that you started on. if you go to the other side you get killed by a building. I dont know why Steam did this. -theres a Dragon in the forest. just like Medevil times. if you Slay the dragon you win i think. I killed the dragon after drying two times i finally killed it. then the game ended. I wont spoil it but its a big hole in the ground with little guys jumping and it says Die Wins. -some times people say things to you but its a secret code. i figured it out though. if they say b it means bad or g means good. some times they say Top or mid and bottom, it just means you have to tell the donckey horse to drink in the river and mid means go to the middle of the river.

review: Ok. For a game built for Russians, played by Americans and won by absaloute swearing at team members so that sniper can go top, this game has taught me more about the great passion that people have about winning games such as DOTA, your feeling do not count for  on the playing field, no. Niether does your spirit, but just your hero and its abilities and how fast your able to use them.To play this game requires not a patient personality but your skills at how fast your able to press "1,2,3,4" and where you use them. You will be sworn at, ed over and hated at first......which is fine because your not gonna get better at a game like this, oohh no, firstly to even count yourself as even a little bit past begginers level, you have to asess yourself. 1.) Am i russian? - if yes continue 2.)  ? - if yes continue 3.)          ? - if yes continue if you have answered no or yes to any of these questions you are still and undoubtedfully not a skilled DOTA player, please take it lightly that you wont do well in life, you cant play Dota, you cant play life.

review: "Welcome to Dota 2: You Suck" TL;DR : Amazing game, try it. I was never really the type of guy to play one game for prolonged periods of time, but there are exceptions. Dota 2 is one of them. I discovered this game through a friend, downloaded it, played it, immediately hated it, and everything about it. But not because it was a horrible game. I hated it because it was soul-crushingly cruel; coming from FPS games, I was tossed into the game with no idea on how to play passed last hitting. Even that, I couldn't do right. After about six hours of trying heroes, different lane combinations/strategies, and subsequently feeding, I essentially gave up on it. Three months later, I decided that I didn't give Dota the chance it deserved. I redownloaded it, studied up on guides, practiced for hours as one hero until I got it right, and I found that this game was much deeper than I had initially thought. I was a long-time FPS player, but I was familiar with League of Legends. In LoL, you're expected to push and harass; amass gold, gank and kill to win. Simple, right? So I thought the same should be done for Dota 2. Just push the lane until I win, that's how things are in League. I learned one thing after hours and hours of getting owned by Medium Co-Op bots: Dota 2 isn't LoL. Not even close. In LoL, it's basically a pushing contest with ganks thrown in. In Dota 2, I had to learn how to counter pick, orbwalk, gank, control creep waves, stack jungle camps, stack ancients with helm of the dominator, deny junglers EXP by placing wards in camps, harass without getting aggro, what heroes countered my heroes (all of them), which lanes are best for which heroes, learn when it's better to defend or trade towers, when to buy items like Hand of Midas. It's a daunting task for... anyone. To learn all of that at once would be nothing short of overwhelming. But you don't learn it all at once, you learn it through hours and hours of humiliation and practice. Then there are the heroes; I prefer Dota 2 heroes over LoL Champions. In LoL, they expect you to work for heroes or buy them right-out with real world money, the same for any cosmetic items you may want. Dota hands you all the heroes in the game for free, and any item you see in the shop can be earned (at random) through playing a match. The items are also tradeable. The champions in League were always so-so to me, I never really connected with them either because they looked cartoony to me or because they just simply didn't talk enough/have enough lines. Heroes in Dota are rather serious and usually have over a hundred lines each, which really lets you get a good feel for who they are. Note: I don't dislike LoL as I've played it myself, I just prefer Dota. Like I said before, I was a long-time FPS shooter before coming to Dota 2 (I still am, but I digress), and a part of why it was fun was because I had friends playing with me. Yeah, I get to talk to people I know while we kill random people online, that's fun. But it was just us going rogue and seeing who can kill more people than the other while we talk about mundane things. Dota 2 is different. My friends and I found that we *had* to rely on each other to win. We were given the opportunity to organize plans, tell each other what we were doing, if we needed a gank, ect. High fives went around the room whenever we won, and gaming with friends has never been more fun. Dota 2 is that rare type of game that doesn't hold your hand through it all; you don't just pick it up instantly. It demands your time and attention; it deserves it. Dota 2 has one of the steepest learning curves of any game, the steepest I've ever experienced. But that doesn't take away from how great the game is; even when you fail, it only feeds your desire to become better. You get to reading more guides, finding which heroes you play best with, getting rid of the ones you don't, learning of the strategies you could use, and learn how to talk with your team. Much more emphasis is placed on learning, practicing and communication than most games, but that only adds to the greatness. Dota 2 is needlessly cruel, but it may be the most fun you'll ever have. An amazing game, there's no reason why you aren't playing it. Give it a try, you won't be sorry when you come out of it.

review: - Disclaimer - This review is for the Standard Edition of Batman: Arkham City, as of 08/08/2014 the review feature for said game has been disabled - This game is a bomb. I've never been deeply into the Batman franchise, never read any comics. Back in the day when it was on TV, "Batman - The Animated Series" gained my attention and never lost it. Batman:Arkham city is arguably the best, longest and most refined entry in this current series of games. It was thankfully developed by the Rocksteady studio under the guidance of Paul Dini, the main writer for the Animated Series. That whole thing plays like a Batman movie produced by Christopher Nolan. Talking about immersion. You will think you are batman. And that the events happening really occur TO YOU as the witnessing player. Stunning graphics, excellent sound design and a well rounded combat system give this game the edge it needs to turn you into a non lethal crime fighting combat machine. Comes with leaderboards,challenge maps and a multiplayer mode, nothing short of a single player campaign 30+ hours rich, set up in an open air prison this game shows, how deep the rabbit whole of human cruelty really goes. This is lore wise easyly one of the best games I've ever played in my whole life and I hope Rocksteady will soon deliver an Arkham City 2 after the letdown that was Arkham Origins. That what you get when you change a winning team, Eidos. If you like super heros, or punching based action games, or just good movies in general, pls do yourself a favour and buy this game. It'll be a sad story if you miss out on it.

review: Dota 2 has to be one of the most annoying, unlogical and stupid games of all time... but i still love it and play it almost every day. Bear in mind that i have only about 1000hrs on this game so my opinions and views are based only on the short time i have spent playing it (yes 1000hrs is not much game time at all) and i have only two bits of advice for some who is starting dota: 1. Stick at it, never give up, never give in. Comebacks are possible from almost any situation and although you will probably suck at first, only trying out the easiest of heroes - drow,riki,viper ect- soon you will become better, soon you will graduate from noob school and become novice level (like me), This happens at about 750hrs. 2. Dont rush for the same hero every time, even if you really like the hero dont do it. Picking every hero will teach you their abilities so you will know what each of them are capable of when you play with them or against them, so try randoming for the extra gold too. Do this until you have won a game as every hero or have played a hero atleast twice. Good luck and may Dendi be with you!

review: This game, like most Moba games, is like an abusive partner, it will hurt you and make you feel awful so you tell yourself you will stop yourself and that you will put an end to the relationship but when you confront it it pulls you close and whispers in your ear while gently carressing your back that it is sorry for hurting you so you forgive it and the cycle continues. Great game

review: As a drop while playing Dota 2. Because Dota 2 is a free-to-play game, players do not receive free cards like most other games. Instead, a card drop becomes available for roughly every $9 USD spent on cosmetic items in the Dota 2 Store. If you have card drops available, they will appear automatically in your Steam inventory as long as your Dota 2 client is open. Cards drop approximately once every 15-60 minutes. From the Steam Community Market. By trading with another player. From a Booster Pack. Booster Packs are packets of several cards that drop randomly after you have forged one Dota 2 badge. Booster Packs can also be bought on the Market. Booster Packs drop more frequently for players with higher Steam Levels.

The continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment.

Very heavy focus on team play, stunning graphics, massive hero/heroine selection, and the only thing you actually need to pay for is cosmetics. Honestly, I don't care much for the flamewar between DotA and LoL. Seriously, shut up already - it's obvious DotA 2 is better.

review: This is my review for one of my favorite games, Dota 2. Dota 2 is much like League of Legends, in the sense that it is a MOBA game, and the best MOBA out there. I have tried other MOBA's like LOL and Infinite Crisis, yet Dota 2 seems to prove its the best of them all. With over 100+ heros, Dota 2 is very diverse from other games where each hero has a great skill set and personality. Each hero serves a role in-game, and items are bought to your choosing or what best fits the hero. But the game is very balanced, because each skill and items can be countered by another skill or items. This makes each and every game unique and very stratigic based. After over 500+ hours in-game, I have come to love this game. You couldn't ask more from a free game, and it is very fun. Although it is free, the game does have a store where you can purchase items that change the appearance of your hero or HUD, to having the in-game voice somebody else, to making your own workshop content that could be put into game. Training for the game at first is very difficult, and alot to take in at first. But if you are persistant and play against bots to practice and better your skills, Dota 2 becomes one of the best games out there. Although the game is hard to understand at the start and the community is harsh on "noobs", with time this game is one of the best free games out there, and I highly recommend it.

review: You wont like DotA2. You may be one of the millions of people that think you like it, already playing it and making it the single most popular game on Steam by a ridiculous margin, but thats only because you dont understand it. DotA2 is pure abstraction, complexity for the sake of complexity, and rule sets within rule sets that are broken at random. This game is so far removed from the theme of heroes with swords and spells clashing in combat that you might as well be playing a game of chinese whispers in a mental institution for the mathematically insane. Many of the subsystems only function the way they do now because of the limitations of the Warcraft 3 engine, while many others have been quietly modified for this sequel. This game is a triumph of accidental design that rewards memorization, social adroitness, deductive reasoning, and the ability to predict what other humans will do in a complex system that they do not understand. Ask yourself why you play games at all. Compare the aforementioned truths attributed to this game to your definition of fun. You see? I've just saved you a lot of time. This game wasnt made for you. It was made for me.

review: I haven't played this game that much but from what I have played, this game is really good. Game is a MOBA ARPG game. The objective is simple enough, destroy the opponent's Ancient which lies deep within their territory. Graphically speaking, the game is best in all the games out there for sure, very nice animations, looks of the heroes can be improved though, to me they look more like cartoons and I would like a realistic approach for them. Voice acting is nice as well, soundtrack can be improved. The best part of this game is that its not pay to win, all the items that you can get only alters your look in some way and not your performance in the game so no matter what weapon you are using. Be it vanilla or $10 weapon for a hero, it will do same damage to the opponent in all cases. I for one don't care much about Hero looks so its a big plus for me. All in all a very good and polished game. It also updates very frequently which is good and bad depending on your bandwidth. Must play for sure. :)

review: Dota 2 prefectly inherited the play style and cs feeling of Dota. The game flows pretty well with the new visual upgrade and getting rid of the old Warcraft3 system, it's entirely a nice try. However, it is an embarrassing situation Dota 2 and its Valve behind it are facing: first, the same old problem of Dota-it's just too hard for new players to play, even a seasoned player of Warcraft3 find it pretty hard and need months of practicing to become an ordinary player, not to mention those young players who never touched Warcraft3 before; second, for old Dota players, the old and familiar sound of each hero vanquishes, instead are newly created heroes that lack the lore backup them from Warcraft, I don't know how other old gamers feel about it, to me, it's a completely different game, lost the contest by his young and more energetic grandson--League of Legends. Sorry to say, but the golden age of Dota has faded. Dota 2 is merely a replacement of the greater past. When we play it, what haunts in our head are "The night beckons.""Us here to obey.""I'm here, as always." No...not really, you are not always here. Farewell.

review: I only recommend this game based on the FACT that this is the most generous Free2Play title you're ever going to find. The amount of content and support here is insane. There's a reason why seemingly millions of people play this game for years on end. Chances are, you'll like it if you're looking for a free game. But if you're looking for a free game, chances are you're young, unemployed, with tons of time to kill, which is what most of the fanbase here is. It also happens to be the only kind of person who can LEARN this game properly. You'll need months and hundreds of hours before you're any good. I want to say that, besides all that, it's a great game, but I can't. I've dabbled in DOTA when it was just starting to get attention. It was the only reason I installed Warcraft 3 a second time. My overall distaste for RTS games is actually not a factor here, as DOTA has very little in common with the game it was built on top of. No, my problem with the game is almost every core mechanic it expects you to learn is not fun at all to implement into your sessions. I disagree completely with the tasks at hand that are in every MOBA out there. I don't like the pointless, constant, neverending flow of creeps. I don't like how everything is a race to earn EXP at the fastest rate instead of using actual tactics, and if you die or leave the proximity of a fight for 60 seconds, you'll never catch up to the enemy leveling so you better just give up. The item shops are super convoluted and have nonsensical upgrade paths. I don't like the ESSENTIAL systems of "last hits" and "denying", as they make no god damned sense. Killing your own infantry so that the enemy doesn't get the EXP is LUDICROUS! It's the dumbest videogame logic I have ever witnessed and I can't get behind it. If all this stupid crap were removed, I feel like we would be left with a fun game, but perhaps that game has already been done elsewhere, like the PVP arena battles in Guild Wars. I just feel like if this were simplified down to heroes battling each other directly with their core abilities, I'd have a good time. It's so beautiful. So well crafted. So much innovation in the networking features. Presentation is tops. Epic as all hell. Everything you could want. It's a shame that all this is pasted onto a core game that is incredibly busted and dumb.

review: Do not play this game unless you have already been playing it for 2 years or more. As a new player YOU WILL get matched against players with 2000 games or more experience, and YOU WILL get matched with players who have 100 games or less even after years of playing, and no matter how good or bad you are YOU WILL STILL LOSE about 50% of the time unless you have 4 more friends who play with you every game. This game is JUST AS BAD as LoL and HoN in every aspect. PEOPLE WILL rage quit, go afk, feed on purpose, give up after first blood. The game is so well balanced most games will have 1 team with LESS THAN 50% of the other teams score, NOT JUST IN KILLS, but in experience and gold earned also. If you are thinking of switching to DOTA 2 from LoL or HoN, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, it is the same game with the same issues and you will be 2 years behind the learning curve. If you have never played a MOBA before, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, more experienced DOTA 2 players will just treat you like garbage for your first 300-500 games and make you want to not play.

review: I'm not a huge fan of MOBA's, but I do enjoy League of Legends very much and iv'e played Smite when it first came out. Like most MOBA's, the community can be cruel and insane at times, torching you for the simplest mistakes. Neat and interesting abilities that can be even complicated the first time you use them, this game has a lot of replay, giving you the choice to play many many heroes. Unless you like competition and a fierce community, stay away from Dota and try LoL or another MOBA, but you should still give it a try, play a bot game or two and feel the game. No Pay 2 Win as its a official steam game, and a very successful one. You can earn and buy costumes and cosmetics through playing the game and buying them with real money. If you feel up to it, you can also trade unwanted cosmetics for ones you want through the steam trading system. Personal Rating: 3.5/5

For 2014 the game I have already dedicated about 300+ rounds of play to is DOTA2. If you're a fan of team vs team games; This is the game to play. I'd love to play this game professionally in tournament style and make my way into The International - DOTA2's highest paying tournament for millions of dollars.

review: This game is dumb. No charm of the original WC3 game. Models are outdated, buggy, and sometimes just boring. LIttle to no equipment for other heroes, while some have 6 different sets. Will literally make you rage and wish you could kill a man with nothing but your bare hands. But this game will also bring you close to your friends. Like, that special gay close. Like so close to your friend who picks CM every game for you and you just wanna stroke his ear and say, "Thanks baby, I wanna do something special for you now." still the game sucks. I hate it. 10/10 would play again.

review: A wonderous 5 lane world of 20 kill supports, 1 v 5 heroics and lost russians. Each game guarantee's: -A noob who does exactly the opposite of what the team suggests, this is a great time to practise reverse psychology. -At least some form of Russian, be it english players that enjoy their newly learned dialect or a "Genuine player of Russia" who due to their 3rd world conditions are obviously too famished to actually play the game properly. -A pudge pro that insists on mid and then deems it a great time to showcase exactly how not to attempt to hook players for all of 27 minutes while the other steam rolls you entirely. -A support with a Dagon. With numerous repetition of the line "BUT I THOUGHT HE WAS GETTING AWAY" while he is now 4 levels above the Medusa right next to him. In summary this game will make you very... very... angry. A lot of the time. I can't go a single day without playing it.

review: The MOBA equivalent of getting kicked in the , repeatedly, for hours on end, until little remains of what could resemble genitalia. However, the truly astonishing part, is that this wasn't torture, but done through your own volition; you wanted to made miserable. Hell, you probably paid for it a little. Every game brings such traumatic pain and anguish, this game should be considered a war crime. Psychologists have analyzed why DOTA players put themselves through this kind of Hell, and all tests have come up inconclusive. This game has caused the perpetual virginity of thousands of people. Friendships have been ruined, careers lost, and marriages have ended, all because of this game. Dear God, get rid off this awful blight on humanity. Only the dead can know peace from this evil... 10/10 I recommend this game to all my friends!

review: When I first started DOTA 2 my brain had downs, I had no idea what I was doing at all... But I soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying and the learning the heroes (All heroes are free!). Before I knew it, I was performing better and better. I focused and kept learning little by little and BINGO! I got pretty good. You will encounter a lot foreigners good or bad but most of them can understand english. There's a lot of great people in the game and some are trolls and jerks but it's fun . I recommend this game for everybody! If you play LoL stop, unistall, and play dota 2. That game is canerous especially it's community has grown to filth I played since 2009 it was a great MOBA for many years until this game came out and perfected the orignal one(Warcraft III Mod). It's really hard at first I know that but give it a try and learn.

review: I can say that this game is kind a good. I really love it and i continue playing it. I think every gamer who like strategy and mmo rpg games will love this game. So many things to do and learn, so meany characters and items, so many item builds. However you can see a lot of awesome animations and effects. You can explore the map at day and night. Also this game is not pay to win like other games, You just pay for character appearance ( if you would like ). I was a LoL gamer but when i tryed Dota 2 i thought that i left 5 years of playing kiddy game. This is an EPIC game with a lot of PVP and PVE and TM ( TeamWork). My rate is 10/10

review: This game improved so much since it was released on the beta. There are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as DOTA 1. I know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in DOTA 2 and I think it will help new comers. I know some people who play LOL might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. Its like comparing COD and Battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, I think bot of them are good) Give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. I think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. Try it out, its free and badass,A great PvP game that offers some of the most intriguing and nuanced team combat around. The Best Game Ever

If you answered yes to any of the above questions then this game was essentially made for you. Now I could spend hours verbally blowing this game and telling you all the reasons you should play it and love it or you can just download it yourself you lazy sod and learn why it's the most played game on steam.

review: Dota. Dota. Dota, Dota, Dota Dota Dota Dota. What do you know about Dota? I know that it's the best competitive teamplay game in existance. Fun may or may not be found there, but once you get good, sure as hell you will have satisfaction from outplaying these pesky Queen of Pain and Invoker with your Earth Spirit or rampaging through the enemy team in Chronosphere as a Void who was allowed to farm for a little too long. You will have fun sometimes. You will get mad. You will get mad a lot. And you'll love it. 11/10 would sell my soul for.

review: One of the best Esport games in history. A lot of people have problems with it's steep learning curve. It'll be hard for really long time to compete with veterans but it's an Esport game so that's what you should expect from games of this type. Also prepare for flaming from Russians. They think everyone know their language so they select all servers to 'communicate' with wider range of people.

review: A great game to think that it only started as a mod ^^ Played it at the time, still playing, one of my favourite games ever. + Teaches teamwork. + Recuires multitasking, map awarnes, calling misses, ETC. + Great to play with friends, makes losing actually still quite fun (as long as you are not curp stomped). + Fun way to meet new people ;D - Takes a lot of your time, why? Addictive as hell... - Like all MOBA games (even this the great ancestor) community can be quite punishing. - Steep learning mountain to climb.

Before you can properly assess this game, you must first climb the highest mountain while your consciousness is implanted into a robot at the bottom of the sea. The moment you realize the gold that this game achieves is the very same moment that you become one with the greater knowledge, so please wrap yourself in this higher power by becoming one with the Dota 2.

review: Dota2 is a gateway game of the worst kind. It's a bad game, a cluster of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive waifu ry and DARKNESS. The normal gamer can see this as the  it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the game itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad. However, these very aspects that try to smear over the  of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie, unsociable underageb& s who engage in every kind of ry both online and in the real world. The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the abilities, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole hero ry and everything about the Dota world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on revenge, and overall preachiness of the game make it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of  that makes little kiddies and underageb&  eat this  right the  up. Dota is basically THE series to attract the most hated game fanbase known to steam, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every gamer to troll the  out of this game and everyone who likes it, and ensure that no Dota threads ever encourage the newfriends to show their faces here. In short: 10/10 game, would buy again.

Why would they need something new when theyve got this incredibly deep, rewarding multiplayer experience? Rating: 9.9

review: I remember the first time I played a MOBA; back in Starcraft, playing AoS which was later re-made in Warcraft. Aeon of Strife, AOS, that's how we came to know games of its like. Afterwards, Tides of Blood popularized the custom map variant and the original Dota and it's ilk *About 100 different or so versions of it* spammed the custom map channels. Until All Stars came in and swept the competitions. Now we see Dota 2 here, nearly a decade later and I have to say... It's even better than it was back then. The balance now is impeccable (Not withstanding popular competitive picks), the community is friendlier (Than LoL or HoN's to say the least) and although more complex than its competitors, the game gives you everything from the start. It's a difficult game to be sure, but as a RTS-RPG hybrid, it contains depths of strategy, tactical complexity, and split-second reflex gameplay that is sure to delight and impress any gamer. Dota 2 is a highly polished e-sport designed to draw in and awe. Is it perfect? No. Is it good? You bet. For those of you who don't know what Dota 2 is, Dota is a mobile online battle arena, otherwise known as MOBA. You control a singular hero and play in a team of five heroes, who's task is to protect their ancient (home base) all while laying siege to the enemy ancient. The team who destroys the opposing ancient, wins the game. In conclusion, I highly recommend anyone to check this game out. You won't be disappointed.

Russians are a problem, but you get over it eventually... and yeah, let's hope you have some strong friends because after this you'll be screaming their head off. But who am I kidding, if you're playing this, you don't have friends.

The continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. It's hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. It took me a long time to warm up to, but I'm helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. If you can spare the time - play it.

review: Dota 2 is one of the deepest and most interesting games that I have ever played. Sure it's difficult to learn, but once you've grasped the basics, Dota will provide hours upon hours of entertainment. The learning curve is undeniably steep and the community unforgiving of your mistakes, but the game itself is worth the pain. I highly recommend learning Dota 2 with a friend-it will be much more enjoyable. On the question of LoL or Dota: Both games are great and I recommend you to start the game that your friends are playing. After all, MOBAs are team games, not solo efforts.
game-hours: 608.4
review: I wouldn't recommend this game. After a huger then huge learning curve, you will log in, be online, and  up our matches, because you suck. After proving you suck, we will still have to play with your noob  for at least 30 mins. So you will get hated on. You will get reported, you will be in waiting queues forever. After about half a year you might grow some ing sense and skills to play decent, but I doubt it, and even then you'd be no match compared to the OG's.. So, stick to CSS dude, go play TF2, have a nice Portal experience or something... Just keep away from this game, it'll damage you beyond repair, and you will intoxicate our DOTA2 experience, and besides that, your just too dumb. Now get lost. Move!

review: Who would have thought that a mod for a popular strategy game would give birth to a subgenre of strategy games that ended up as the most popular and most prestigious form of competitive PC gaming. The original DOTA was a mod for Warcraft 3. Dota 2 is the sequel where most of the original heroes made a comeback despite the game being developed by Valve themselves instead of Blizzard. Two teams of 5 competiting to bring down the enemy team's Ancient. Simple sounding, but Dota 2 is not a simple game. It is probably the most difficult and most aggressive MOBA currently. The game itself is good. Graphics are nice and most PC rigs would be able to support it nicely. It however, takes time, A LOT of time to learn to play each one of the heroes properly. When things go down to the wire, it gets really, really hairy. Only the ones who make the most of what items they have and using the right abilities at the right time would come away as the victors. And when you do win, it is one of the best feelings in the game. The heroes or champions in the game are as different as they can be from one another and each one of them has a different job to do in the in a team. Not only that, they do look awesome as well. But Dota 2 isn't perfect, far from it, actually. Mostly it has to do witht the community. You think CoD's fanbase was bad, play Dota and you'll think different. Trolls, whiners, noobs and really dumb people are common in the public matches and it is them who bring down the fun experience in the game. Also, Dota 2 is a free game so you can bet people with bad connections or bad PCs would try to play the game though and what happens is a cluster**** of annoyances as certain heroes and their abilities require precise timing. Dota 2 isn't the best game of all time (definitely not). But it is a timesink for those who'd love a challenge or want to be a part of something large in the PC gaming community. I personally spent more than 300 hours in the game as of this review and I am thinking of taking a break as Dota made me neglect my other games. But whether I quit or not, Dota 2 was fun while I still played it, despite experiencing plenty crappy moments.

review: 75% of characters look like undead piles of crap and all the human females look like s... 10/10 In seriousnes, most of the charcters look pretty cool, even the undead ones, no hold backs on the female humans looking like s though. I'm not really a big fan of the game or any MOBA game as a matter of a fact, but when trying this game out I actually got pretty addicted to it for a while. I recommend trying this with friends though, makes the expirence better and gives less worries of meeting a stranger whom is gonna curse you out for eating his tree that one time... I recommend trying out the hero named "Sniper" if you're gonna play the game for the first time.

review: Dota has become one of the most popular games ever, being one of the Top 10 most played games on Steam. Here's why. The learning curve. Some might say this is the worst part of the game but almost no one can deny that it's what gets you addicted and stuck in this world of heroes, might and magic. Like any traditional MOBA, each hero has it's own distinctive role from support to carry and many other positions. Dota focuses mainly on building your character up in the beginning of a match and then through teamwork and strategy, going head to head with the other team and "pushing" (Destroying the enemy team's towers, creeps, etc.) all the way to their "ancient" leading to its destruction and victory. It might sound strange to someone who may be unfamiliar with MOBA style games but, it's an art and science within itself, with millions of diehard fans constantly urging themselves to become better and more efficient with their playing styles. With the inclusion of the 100+ available characters, there are at least five different ways to play each character meaning there is an insane amount of replayability already staked onto the stellar online multiplayer experience of both casual, experienced and professional Dota 2 players. The game's learning curve will take at least 40 hours of in-game time and potentially hours of research outside of the game (YouTube, Wikis, etc.) which can seem like a major turn off for a game such as this. However, there is an offline practice mode available for new players to hone their skills and find out what characters they enjoy playing the most. I've read the other reviews for Dota 2 and found that many people are upset with Russians and Chinese going on US servers, causing a language barrier and potentially losing games because of that. I will admit, this is a problem that will hopefully be fixed in the near future, as it is rather problematic and detrimental to emerging victorious in a Dota 2 match. In conclusion, Dota 2 is a great game and has become one of my personal favourite games of all time. The amazing diversity of every match, the fantastic community and the overall amount of content being added every month is astonishing. Plus, it's a free to play. Not a pay to win, it's legitamately a F2P game. What do you got to lose? Give Dota 2 and try and find out what everyone is talking about. You won't regret it.

review: Dota 2. Better than LOL or HON by almost every extent possible in my opinion. The graphics are beautiful, you can deny, slower pace gameplay, more impacts when you die. All of them have a problem with their Community. You get everything for free and only have to pay for announcers, hero skins, and other stuff that only affects looks. Not Pay To Win. It's Play To Win. Get it now. It's free. The reason people don't like Dota 2 over LoL is because "it's too slow and harder for them" or because "it has a higher skill curve".

The game is bright and colorful and with a huge variety of characters to play and has easily become one of the biggest played multiplayer strategy games I've seen.

review: A RTS game which play by 10 players,divided by 2 teams ( Radiant and Dire) This game is so excited because of there are so many heroes which their skills are so variants,such as stun,kill,healing,disabling and so on. DoTA is the game like chess and soccer, because you must use strategy to defeat your enemy,not just kill,looking for gold. For amateurs this game can use build help if the amateurs dont know what item must they build. Remember,in this game you must be patient and cooperative when your teammates doing some fault because in this game there are winner and losser,the way you prove that you are pro is by cover up your teammates. I very reccomend this game not only just a guy can play this game,also a girl like me can also play too. End of my talk, I LOVE DoTA2

review: DOTA 2, this name needs no explanation, and yet, so much explanation. To say that this game has not changed my life would be a lie. DOTA 2 has proven that it can both create and destroy life, in term qualify itself as God. To speak lowly of DOTA 2 is heresy, but I am a heretic by default, a devil's advocate who speaks out against DOTA 2. DOTA, its predecessor, was an amazing map that I used to play with friends, DOTA 2 is just a target jokes nowadays. Boasting a lovely all Russian Matchmaking, with off-branches such as Turkey Matchmaking and Brazilian (HueHueHue) Matchmaking. If you wish to play DOTA 2, all I can say is go ahead. It's an amazing game that deserves so much more, a one man's story. It's you, and them, your team's just a meat shield. Don't let others coerce you into wasting your precious, hard-farmed gold on those pesky wards or, god forbid, support someone. Remember, chicks dig carries, so always pick them. Plz add VRZO, pokemonftw. 420SwagYOLO4EVER!

review: Ruins lives. prevented me from studying for exams. my mummy got me a fedora and some dank after i got my 1st rampage which was 1 min in coz im asian. the long seating hours made my lower body jelly and immovable. plus the loong hours of masturbating over io made me run out of , thus making me unable to reproduce. this game made me learn 5 languages in 1 game when i selected language preferences to english and got russians, indians, koreans and other various languages. the dota community is so friendly that they called me a noob when i was carrrying the team and lead them to victory. this game is reccomended for people who have no life and dont give a  about wat happens in life. also good for people who like dank and porn bcause u can smoke this game and wank over it like i do. the flavour of the doritos and mountain jew when playing this game is so amazing it makes my brain fart.

Once you learn the heroes, and get a good play style down, and learn the gear choices, its a lot of fun. The game flow is better as well, and having a courier is awesome. The graphics and physics handle really nice, and the heroes all look way better as well. All in all, a great game, and lots of fun.

review: An interesting proposition. Unlike most games, this is the gift that keeps on giving. Over the lifetime of dota 2 many additions have been made, and many continue to come along. Dota 2 is based on an old warcraft mod, and on a weekly and monthly basis, valve continues to update and add features to the game. Aside from being a lucrative scene for competitive gamers, it also has a steep learning curve and endless combinations as far as team compisitons go. If you aren't the kind of person who likes to play versus other players, the game allows you to play cooperatively against bots. And to further add to the lifespan of the game, the developers release festive events every 3-5 months to add something extra for players to do. As the game is free to play, this game can potentially net you some gains in the form of the marketable items you recieve for playing.

review: Dota 2 for me has set the standard for MOBA's. The level of detail gone into this is brilliant. The characters are well thought out with hilarious quotes and rivalry with the combat being fluid and fast paced. The only downside to this that I would say is the matchmaking. There is a steep learning curve when it comes to playing proficiently and already seasoned players do not take lightly to new players. Beware of this, and if this kind of stuff doesn't phase you then match-make away!

The community may be fierce at times, especially when you are new but once you log a few hours and get the base mechanics under the knee the game and its community actually become pretty enjoyable. Serves to provide many laughs and WTF moments and is best enjoyed in a party with people who will be willing to help you get through the first few games.

review: A couple of years ago, a friend of mine started me on this game, and, boy, what a ride. I won't get into the details of the game, but there are always a few tournaments going on that you can watch as well as the Free To Play documentary (on the first edition of The International Dota 2 tournament, look it up on Youtube), to get a good feel on the game. If you're still interested after that, if you have friends to play with, if you have patience to learn, and if you have time to spare (each game lasts 40 minutes on average), I wholeheartedly recommend you try it. This is what competitive video games are all about. It is daunting at first, has a steep learning curve, but every day I'm playing I'm learning something new and that is rewarding by itself. It is a team-based game so you'll get your fair share of frustrations, but as long as you be smart about your decisions, salvage every mistake as a learning experience, and most importantly have fun doing so, this is your game of the forever.

review: Possitives: Have you played any other MOBA before playing Dota2? Well allow me to introduce you to the first son of the MOBA genre's father father, the one that started it all, Aeon of Strife. Dota 2 is a well balanced and evenly paced MOBA which offers a lot of variety when it comes to Heroes to play and items to make your hero stronger. The game has quite a steep learning curve, but once you feel like you've gone over that curve then the game becomes so enjoyable especially with friends. The game has now been released and is F2P, so what do you have to lose? Negatives: The community is quite hostile to anyone who doesn't play very well, sadly. A lot of Russian players don't even want to play with other Russians and instead choose the 'English' language preference and end up screwing over the people who actually do speak English and causes communication issues. The toxic behavior some people in this game can be unreal, and they will sometimes do whatever it takes to make your game horrible. Yeah, you can mute them and try to ignore them but surely they would be inclind to just help the enemy team by feeding themselves to them just because you done one thing wrong that they didn't like. But that's why you should try to play with as many friends as possible, in order to minimise this issue.

review: Welcome friends and all to the greatest game of the millenium. By the year 2030, dota 2 will have infiltrated into mainstream media and become the game to decide all conflicts and terrorities. A frantic rush to recruit all the top players was undertaken by the nations. A great battle was sieged and only one victor emerged . With excellent teamwork, vocabuary, the Philippines quickly became the sole ruler of the Earth. I have returned from this apocalypse and now I regularly play and hone my Dota 2 skills for the day when the Philippines will rise against us. 10/10 would play again.

review: DOTA 2, the resurrection of the old classic MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) game that started the craze. I played in the original WC3 version ages ago, and it was interesting to give it a try. The game has various "really-not-warcraft-heroes-srs" like "not-Sylvanas" and "not-Arthas" and a variety of more original heroes to play. Free to play, and easy to get hold of as Valve throws a few dozen copies at me every now and again. The skinny: 8/10 if you're looking for a tree-harvest avoid-the-murderer simulator. I'd give it about 3/10 for gameplay if you want a MOBA. 1/10 for community - and that's because a) some friends of mine play it, and b) there's a lot of Steam Workshop content. The good: There's a lot of Steam Workshop support. It's free. The bad: From what I've seen, completely unbalanced player combat, which narrows down to who gets the first hit in, and has little to do with actual skill-based play. Majority of the time is spent cutting trees, but game is advertised as a "battle arena". Before the inevitable "UR butthurt" complaints, I'm not usually the poor sod being killed. I tend to play support, and hang back a lot, watching the tree cutting competition. The ugly: I'm not sure what it is that entices some players to this, but it's a harsh, bitter community that judges you even before you've had a chance to speak, or played a single game. Doesn't matter who you are. For those who I speak to, I'm pretty hard-skinned, and I can appreciate a good troll. This isn't that. This is hate, and there's almost nothing to help narrow it down. Some people keep playing it religiously, however. Perhaps there's something magical that they found in this tree-cutting simulator, because that's what the majority of the game time is spent doing. Then someone finds someone else, gets a stun off, and kills the other party before they get control of their champion back. The player who gave "first blood" to the enemy team is then reported for feeding, then their team quits, and you queue back up for another rousing tree harvest simulation. Overall, I'd recommend other games in the same vein. Because this one is pretty bad. In a game that's meant to be about community involvement, DOTA 2 doesn't have anything to entice me back. If anything, it has things to push me away - it skips past the ribbing and trolling and dives straight into XBox Live chat styled hate. For some, it's addictive. For me, it's not.

review: Most games reward the player to some degree, when they have sunk hundreds of hours into them. Dota 2 is the only time sink I have experienced where you get absolutely nowhere for your troubles... thanks to a heavily broken matchmaking system that can take forever to queue up a game (as I am writing this, a 5 stack for a ranked match can take up to 20 minutes!). Dota 2 is less about how skilled you are, and more about who you know. If you don't have at least a dozen experienced friends who are consistently competent, prepare to queue with some of the worst players you have ever played a multiplayer game with. As an added bonus, you will often get players who do not speak your language -- even in ranked games! I have often wished that I never started playing this game...

I appreciate some people trying to make the game a good game but the game is simply overrun by immatures or people who just wants to rage at others. As for people who are curious if they should play this game or not. My answer is: go ahead since it's free to play. As for those who just wants to have fun, this game is not for you. People who play this game is not about fun but about winning. If you plan on having fun, I suggest go get other game or people will just insult you in many different crappy languages (that doesn't even exist).

review: Dota 2 Dota 2 is a F2P MOBA game made by Valve and was in beta for a long time until it became free to the public in 2013. Dota 2 requires alot of skill and it isn't a game where ou jump right in to the game like TF2. Valve intended that players should find their favourite hero and learn tacticts with that hero however most players don't get that and hate on it for childish or just ride the hate wagon. Let's get to the game now... You start in the same map each time (And I would appreciate some more maps). Each side looks similar and there are 3 main roads to each team's spawn but they are protected by minions, towers and players, the objective is to destroy the towers and get to the enemy base and destroy this core thingamajic. You start leveling up your character and your abilities/hero gets stronger and it's key to the game. You will really need to play as a team rather than a lone wolf and will require you to speak with your teammates and not expect them to know your stun and attack plan. I will give this game a 4.7/5. I think it's a good game but it might need some new maps.

review: A wonderous 5 lane world of 20 kill supports, 1 v 5 heroics and lost russians. Each game guarantee's: -A noob who does exactly the opposite of what the team suggests, this is a great time to practise reverse psychology. -At least some form of Russian, be it english players that enjoy their newly learned dialect or a "Genuine player of Russia" who due to their 3rd world conditions are obviously too famished to actually play the game properly. -A pudge pro that insists on mid and then deems it a great time to showcase exactly how not to attempt to hook players for all of 27 minutes while the other steam rolls you entirely. -A support with a Dagon. With numerous repetition of the line "BUT I THOUGHT HE WAS GETTING AWAY" while he is now 4 levels above the Medusa right next to him. In summary this game will make you very... very... angry. A lot of the time. I can't go a single day without playing it.

review: The MOBA equivalent of getting kicked in the , repeatedly, for hours on end, until little remains of what could resemble genitalia. However, the truly astonishing part, is that this wasn't torture, but done through your own volition; you wanted to made miserable. Hell, you probably paid for it a little. Every game brings such traumatic pain and anguish, this game should be considered a war crime. Psychologists have analyzed why DOTA players put themselves through this kind of Hell, and all tests have come up inconclusive. This game has caused the perpetual virginity of thousands of people. Friendships have been ruined, careers lost, and marriages have ended, all because of this game. Dear God, get rid off this awful blight on humanity. Only the dead can know peace from this evil... 10/10 I recommend this game to all my friends!

review: When I first started DOTA 2 my brain had downs, I had no idea what I was doing at all... But I soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying and the learning the heroes (All heroes are free!). Before I knew it, I was performing better and better. I focused and kept learning little by little and BINGO! I got pretty good. You will encounter a lot foreigners good or bad but most of them can understand english. There's a lot of great people in the game and some are trolls and jerks but it's fun . I recommend this game for everybody! If you play LoL stop, unistall, and play dota 2. That game is canerous especially it's community has grown to filth I played since 2009 it was a great MOBA for many years until this game came out and perfected the orignal one(Warcraft III Mod). It's really hard at first I know that but give it a try and learn.

review: If you're jumping in this game alone, you're gonna have a bad time. DoTA2 is a team based game, if you're not playing it with a team mindset, you're wrong, and you're impression of the game will be wrong. The character select screen is incredibly daunting when you first start, and most of the characters are unique in their abilities, it takes many hours (days?) to even consider yourself a rookie in this game. After a week of playing nothing but 'Least Played' mode, you'll be pretty in the know of most of the characters, it's going to take watching youtube guide videos, experimenting, careful study of the tournament games and overall pure luck on who you get teamed up with (god help you if you're playing solo) to be able to win a game and even understand why you did. In short, what you need is; Trustworthy teammates, lots of free time, dedication, the ability to adapt well, and a looped playlist of 'Eye of The Tiger' and 'You're The Best'. Then maybe, you'll be considered a "nub" that won't get reported.

review: Gamenya bagus banget, grafik luar biasa dengan gameplay sama kayak dota 1. Nilai tambah disini karena steam yang menopang game dota 2, dimana keamanannya luar biasa ketat, namun jadi boomerang sendiri yang kadang dimana keamanannya malah sedikit "menggangu" player, karena tiap ada hal yg berhubungan sama security harus nunggu berapa hari Di Indonesia mungkin kurang ada wadah buat nopang player yang  game ini, mungkin lebih ke akses pembelian barang, dan lain-lain. Diharapkan steam bisa membantu player Indonesia yang ingin menyalurkan aktifitasnya agar menjadi lebih mudah didalam dota maupun steam Overall good banget!!

review: Really outstanding game. Definitely give it a try sometime. Outstanding how they managed to make such a big and difficult game `easy`, try to dont get confused and fight through it. Worth the time, practice by playing with friends, watching games on YouTube(I really like PurgeGamers) or just watch a random pub. All of that is really instructive and helps you become a better player. PS: Playing the tutorial really helps.

review: Dota 2 is a game played by ten players divided by two sides, the Dire and Radiant with 5 players each. There are over 100 heroes to choose from. There are three types of heroes: Strength, Agility and Intelligence. Strength heroes are more on physical abilities and tough to deal with. Agility heroes are more on damaging and ints are more on supports.

review: I began playing Dota 2 at a time when I thought "MOBA" games were the weakest of the game genres. I always thought it was weird to play a game like this and whenever I saw gameplay videos of Dota 2 - I had no idea what the heck was going on. It never occured to me though, that this game would have baited me in for more hours of playtime. When I first started Dota, there was some training missions I had to go through. These explained the basics pretty well to me and eventually, I thought I knew what I was doing. Also, I also thought there would've been some sort of story mode (Due to the way the training was presented). Unfortunately, there was none but I could see some potential for a story-like mode. Although during my first public matchup, I did feel like quiting because I really did have no idea what I was doing and my "teammates" were complaining about how bad I was TO THE OTHER TEAM (That's right; the other team/our enemies). Then they all began calling me a noob. The amount of insults I received were terrible, but eventually I had a few other friends play the game along with me and that's when things began to change. That's when Dota 2 became something I actually loved to play because of friends, and because my friends and I got better. It came to a point when we started to insult the enemy team whenever we trashed them. Everytime we do that, it would just end up with us having fun regardless of us winning or not. That's what Dota 2 is for me: having a good time with friends and having fun. I then tried LoL and I came to the conclusion: Dota 2 > LoL So since this game is free to play, I highly recommend it. It's free so I say, "Why not?". It's best played with people you know, after all- it is a team based game. There are more things to talk about in Dota, but if you want to know what they are, play the game. Experience it.

game-hours: 436.6
review: Wonderful game. Very entertaining and the atmosphere is a little more relaxed then the other popular mobas. The beauty of this game is that it tends to emphasize individual initiative more than your ability to emulate the latest guides. As cool as that is nothing really compares to the strong sense of nostalgia players of Dota 1 will feel while playing since the game barrows as heavily from the original as is legally possible. That said you absolutely have to play with at least two friends otherwise you're playing experience will go to hell very quickly 1 - No regionalization of servers - ae: Theres going to be a lot of psychotic chittering mic spam and people who think they speak English are just going to shriek at you with preposterous accents. Unless reliving you're favorite moments of Full Metal Jacket strikes you as being the epitome of strategic entertainment you'll want to queue with some friends. 2 - Self Imposed Dictators - ae: Everyone knows the self important team leader type. Some stranger you have never met, seen or heard of who feels that its perfectly acceptable for him to tell you what skills you're going to pick during ability draft ext. Unless you enjoy angry, nasally congested, petty and vindictive mic spam you'll want to grab some friends. 3 - Steam is still technically PG-7 - ae: Only the characters in your games are allowed to curse. Stating to another player "wow you sure suck at dota!" is a punishable offence. This issue is compounded by the fact that the ban system is automated. A player will automatically be banned based on the number of reports they accrue cross scaled by time they accrued them in. Fortunately I have managed to avoid any of the chat bans but some of my friends havent been so lucky... Consider the math. One in four people on the internet may be defective. Four reports within a 2 hour period may get you banned. You play three 40 minute games. How is that going to shake out for you in the long run? It may not happen to you and it hasnt happened to me but sooner or later you are going to get flagged and auto punished by the assbrains and this could compromise youre whole steam account. You dont have to be a victim of an injustice to speak against it and I believe flatly that automated oversight is as dangerous as no oversight at all. Dangerous and foolish business. So like I said, bring at least two friends with you or prepare for a pretty hellacious experience. Otherwise its very fun.

review: If you are new to PC gaming or RTS/MOBA games, DotA 2 will appear as impenetrable as a wall. The learning curve for this game is by far the worst element of MOBAs. However, those of you with some experience with RTS games or are willing to learn will find the teamplay experience of DotA 2 an enjoyable. Would recommend to anyone with a competent PC and drive to play competitively.

review: Dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably wont suit you if youre looking to play casually. Theres a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But once you start to learn its secrets, theres a wild and exciting variety of play here thats unmatched, even by its peers. Its a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that its completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isnt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. May the best team win. PS. Dont play with Russians

review: Defense of the Ancients 2. Probably the game that has sapped more time out of my life than anything else, for a good reason at least. This is the first MOBA I have played and by far the best. While this game can be so infuriating with its RNG heroes that I can blame every time I die, PA, Void, Troll, pretty much anything with inbuild crits/evasion/bash, even Sange, Halberd and SnY slow if you are really into blaming the RNG on your demise. So what's the appeal in a game, with a limited number of heroes, however it was 109 so that's quite a lot to call it limited, but it's the same concept every game, you and 4 russians must defeat 5 russians on the enemy team. Sorry for sterotypes, but the primary object is a 5 vs 5 game, it has transition phases, at the start is the Laning phase, the objective is to gain farm, and deny farm. Gank, and countergank, pull and stack. There is a lot to do and that just dictates the first 10 minutes of the game. Then teamplay, map awareness comes into play as the game continues. This addictive cycle will make you want to perfect your last hitting, your knowledge of the game, how to outplay your enemies and lead you to victory. You strive for victory every game. I don't exactly know how I came to spend so long on this game but I know for certain that it won't end anytime soon.

Really hope this does not become the norm for dota. Other than that, current meta is pretty stale with SF, sniper and jug in every game. Hope TI5 changes things up for the community. Side Note. Managed to learn fluent russian and tagalog in this 2 years. Who knew dota was a language simulator?

review: An interesting proposition. Unlike most games, this is the gift that keeps on giving. Over the lifetime of dota 2 many additions have been made, and many continue to come along. Dota 2 is based on an old warcraft mod, and on a weekly and monthly basis, valve continues to update and add features to the game. Aside from being a lucrative scene for competitive gamers, it also has a steep learning curve and endless combinations as far as team compisitons go. If you aren't the kind of person who likes to play versus other players, the game allows you to play cooperatively against bots. And to further add to the lifespan of the game, the developers release festive events every 3-5 months to add something extra for players to do. As the game is free to play, this game can potentially net you some gains in the form of the marketable items you recieve for playing.

review: Do you like MOBAs? Enjoy League of Legends or SMITE? Well this game is, of coruse, another MOBA. However it is also the ORIGINAL MOBA. One of the things you may love or hate about Dota is that there isnt really any sort on unfairness to new players beyond skill. If a person with 10,000 hours faces a player who has only 12 they have no different items, no different heroes, no different abilities. The veteran may have new aesthetic things but the only thing seperating them will be skill. If you're new to MOBAs I encourage you to try this one, they are very fun and are fortunately not pay to win.

review: "Welcome to Dota 2: You Suck" TL;DR : Amazing game, try it. I was never really the type of guy to play one game for prolonged periods of time, but there are exceptions. Dota 2 is one of them. I discovered this game through a friend, downloaded it, played it, immediately hated it, and everything about it. But not because it was a horrible game. I hated it because it was soul-crushingly cruel; coming from FPS games, I was tossed into the game with no idea on how to play passed last hitting. Even that, I couldn't do right. After about six hours of trying heroes, different lane combinations/strategies, and subsequently feeding, I essentially gave up on it. Three months later, I decided that I didn't give Dota the chance it deserved. I redownloaded it, studied up on guides, practiced for hours as one hero until I got it right, and I found that this game was much deeper than I had initially thought. I was a long-time FPS player, but I was familiar with League of Legends. In LoL, you're expected to push and harass; amass gold, gank and kill to win. Simple, right? So I thought the same should be done for Dota 2. Just push the lane until I win, that's how things are in League. I learned one thing after hours and hours of getting owned by Medium Co-Op bots: Dota 2 isn't LoL. Not even close. In LoL, it's basically a pushing contest with ganks thrown in. In Dota 2, I had to learn how to counter pick, orbwalk, gank, control creep waves, stack jungle camps, stack ancients with helm of the dominator, deny junglers EXP by placing wards in camps, harass without getting aggro, what heroes countered my heroes (all of them), which lanes are best for which heroes, learn when it's better to defend or trade towers, when to buy items like Hand of Midas. It's a daunting task for... anyone. To learn all of that at once would be nothing short of overwhelming. But you don't learn it all at once, you learn it through hours and hours of humiliation and practice. Then there are the heroes; I prefer Dota 2 heroes over LoL Champions. In LoL, they expect you to work for heroes or buy them right-out with real world money, the same for any cosmetic items you may want. Dota hands you all the heroes in the game for free, and any item you see in the shop can be earned (at random) through playing a match. The items are also tradeable. The champions in League were always so-so to me, I never really connected with them either because they looked cartoony to me or because they just simply didn't talk enough/have enough lines. Heroes in Dota are rather serious and usually have over a hundred lines each, which really lets you get a good feel for who they are. Note: I don't dislike LoL as I've played it myself, I just prefer Dota. Like I said before, I was a long-time FPS shooter before coming to Dota 2 (I still am, but I digress), and a part of why it was fun was because I had friends playing with me. Yeah, I get to talk to people I know while we kill random people online, that's fun. But it was just us going rogue and seeing who can kill more people than the other while we talk about mundane things. Dota 2 is different. My friends and I found that we *had* to rely on each other to win. We were given the opportunity to organize plans, tell each other what we were doing, if we needed a gank, ect. High fives went around the room whenever we won, and gaming with friends has never been more fun. Dota 2 is that rare type of game that doesn't hold your hand through it all; you don't just pick it up instantly. It demands your time and attention; it deserves it. Dota 2 has one of the steepest learning curves of any game, the steepest I've ever experienced. But that doesn't take away from how great the game is; even when you fail, it only feeds your desire to become better. You get to reading more guides, finding which heroes you play best with, getting rid of the ones you don't, learning of the strategies you could use, and learn how to talk with your team. Much more emphasis is placed on learning, practicing and communication than most games, but that only adds to the greatness. Dota 2 is needlessly cruel, but it may be the most fun you'll ever have. An amazing game, there's no reason why you aren't playing it. Give it a try, you won't be sorry when you come out of it.

review: This morning. I had the offer to either have sex or play Dota, I told her to wait until my game was done. Dota will make you turn down sex. You dont want an abandon and the possible Low priority hellish nightmare. Dont download this game. You'll say "Ill play one game and then go to bed" and then youll hear that spongebob voice say "9 hours later" and youll be like. Wtf where did my day go. Oh well I might as well stay up all day and play until tonight. Its a monster. A vicious circle. It awakens inside of you and makes you want to kick small children, beat your wife, masturbate and open every door in the house without washing your hands first. Save yourselves!@ You must look within! Have a life!

review: This game is extremely fun to play. Very team-based, but it still involves a lot of player skill. Don't be discouraged if you play your first match and die 20 times. This game has a very large learning curve, and you will become a good player with practice. I recommend playing a game with bots before you play against players. This gives you an idea of the mechanics of the game, as well as some of the heros' abilities. Overall, a very great game...and free!

It'll be hard for really long time to compete with veterans but it's an Esport game so that's what you should expect from games of this type. Also prepare for flaming from Russians. They think everyone know their language so they select all servers to 'communicate' with wider range of people.

review: A thoroughly intricate game with massive emphasis put on both skills and knowledge, it is not recommended for casual gamers or for those seeking for some "easy enjoyment". With over a hundred heroes with their own unique abilities and ways to specifically build and play said heroes, as well as their weaknesses and strengths when paired with other heroes, it is arguably comparative to dynamic chess, if not more complicated. Coupled with the iconic map as well as over a hundred items, there is no possible hope of having a sense of deja vu in this game. Of course, it entails an extremely steep learning curve but those who are willing to plough through the enourmous amounts of literature on the game and develop the necessary skills to make them competent will be greatly rewarded, albeit at the cost of their social lives (which has sadly happened to me). Of course, there is no end to learning in Dota. It is said that only 50% of the time is spent in the game. The rest is spent on reading up skills, builds, and other playstyles as well as watching videos of professionals duking it out with each other. Whether one derives enjoyment in self improvement through reading and watching is another matter. On the other hand, the infamous Dota community is a force to be reckoned with, as they are not so forgiving as communities of other games such as Starcraft. A piece of advice for newcomers-don't let negative comments put you off the game, everybody has to start somewhere.

review: Amazing gameplay yet with a huge learning curve. Definitely the best MOBA until this day. F2P, a fair game I'd say. There are 100+ heroes, and they're all balanced :) You can pay for hats/cosmetics, but they don't affect the game itself, but the game experience, as they only change the interface or your hero's outfit/animation/effect. "The workshop is strong with this one." -Yoda This game has a lot of attention, it is updated, fixed, balanced as fast as noticed necessary. There are also some cool events throughout the year. Englobes many different strategies and play styles that will widen your vision, clutch skills, teamwork and help you improve your prestidigitation. Requires training. If you want to play this game, you should be open-minded, willing to learn. You may play this for years and still be able to learn new stuff. All in all it's totally worth it. And yeah, we now have techies :D gg 10/10 Here's a good and detailed guide:

review: This is my review for one of my favorite games, Dota 2. Dota 2 is much like League of Legends, in the sense that it is a MOBA game, and the best MOBA out there. I have tried other MOBA's like LOL and Infinite Crisis, yet Dota 2 seems to prove its the best of them all. With over 100+ heros, Dota 2 is very diverse from other games where each hero has a great skill set and personality. Each hero serves a role in-game, and items are bought to your choosing or what best fits the hero. But the game is very balanced, because each skill and items can be countered by another skill or items. This makes each and every game unique and very stratigic based. After over 500+ hours in-game, I have come to love this game. You couldn't ask more from a free game, and it is very fun. Although it is free, the game does have a store where you can purchase items that change the appearance of your hero or HUD, to having the in-game voice somebody else, to making your own workshop content that could be put into game. Training for the game at first is very difficult, and alot to take in at first. But if you are persistant and play against bots to practice and better your skills, Dota 2 becomes one of the best games out there. Although the game is hard to understand at the start and the community is harsh on "noobs", with time this game is one of the best free games out there, and I highly recommend it.

review: This game has a lot of mechanics to it, be it controlling your character, managing other units at the same time. Game is hard to pick up, but worth learning the steep curve. If you've ever heard of League of Legends, this game is the hardcore mode of it. I would also confidently say that this game has a better community than League of Legends. Players are slightly more mature, and less hateful(?). I highly recommend this game to anybody that is looking for a game that has unlimited replay value, every game would be different, be it good games, or bad games. Sometimes you meet people who are rude, even though they did very badly in this game, sometimes you meet people that are actually doing what the team needs them to be doing.

review: When I first tried to play Dota 2 - around the same time it came out - I made the mistake of jumping right on in thinking I knew exactly what I was doing; obviously failing, I gave up and left about ten-minutes later, and throughout the course of a few months, I did this about five-times, because I wanted to understand what the big deal was about it, and why people found and still find this game so addictive. Up until recently, I hated it with a passion - not only for being killed over-and-over - but also for the sheer complexity of it overall, but, now I know, I wasn't taking the time to actually appreciate that complexity and realise that the learning curve was so full of depth, that if you set your mind to it, you can seriously enjoy it. Considering it's all based around one map, with the same game-mode every time, it's evident you'd think it'd get boring quickly - but you'd be wrong. Even though this is the case, there's so many different heroes, with different abilities, and different play-styles, it just makes it more enticing. It's also extremely strategic and teammates count for everything, which means you'll be working together and maybe even making some more friends. In conclusion: This game is worth every hour you're willing to invest into it, and if you enjoy learning, teamwork and have an addictive personality like me, then those hours are going to be endless.

review: A great game everyone should try, if they like League of Legends. Dota 2 is very similar to LoL in many ways, with the gameplay, shops, and graphics. Although, in LoL you have to buy items, and there is no way to trade or earn anything. Plus, in LoL you get skins. In Dota, you get sets, with individual pieces. You can mix and match to your heart's content, and get discounted items from the Steam Community Market. A must play game! 5 out of 5 stars! <3

In an effort to BALANCE heroes they completely destroyed my favorite hero Phantom Lancer to the point where he is almost unplayable. His new passive is useless, his new illusions useless, his new escape, ING USELESS. He didn't even need to be nerfed but apparently people buying gems or dust is too ing hard to understand. Meanwhile Drow and Axe remain near unchanged, Bane is OP with agh, and countless other heros remain the same. However they did nerf sniper, so thats nice. But I am still left wondering WHY PHANTOM LANCER, WHY OUT OF ALL PEOPLE WOULD YOU NERF HIM?!?!? I still recommend this game if you hate free time, yourself, anybody that doesn't speak English, the outside, and phantom lancer.

review: - Disclaimer - This review is for the Standard Edition of Batman: Arkham City, as of 08/08/2014 the review feature for said game has been disabled - This game is a bomb. I've never been deeply into the Batman franchise, never read any comics. Back in the day when it was on TV, "Batman - The Animated Series" gained my attention and never lost it. Batman:Arkham city is arguably the best, longest and most refined entry in this current series of games. It was thankfully developed by the Rocksteady studio under the guidance of Paul Dini, the main writer for the Animated Series. That whole thing plays like a Batman movie produced by Christopher Nolan. Talking about immersion. You will think you are batman. And that the events happening really occur TO YOU as the witnessing player. Stunning graphics, excellent sound design and a well rounded combat system give this game the edge it needs to turn you into a non lethal crime fighting combat machine. Comes with leaderboards,challenge maps and a multiplayer mode, nothing short of a single player campaign 30+ hours rich, set up in an open air prison this game shows, how deep the rabbit whole of human cruelty really goes. This is lore wise easyly one of the best games I've ever played in my whole life and I hope Rocksteady will soon deliver an Arkham City 2 after the letdown that was Arkham Origins. That what you get when you change a winning team, Eidos. If you like super heros, or punching based action games, or just good movies in general, pls do yourself a favour and buy this game. It'll be a sad story if you miss out on it.

review: Dota 2 has to be one of the most annoying, unlogical and stupid games of all time... but i still love it and play it almost every day. Bear in mind that i have only about 1000hrs on this game so my opinions and views are based only on the short time i have spent playing it (yes 1000hrs is not much game time at all) and i have only two bits of advice for some who is starting dota: 1. Stick at it, never give up, never give in. Comebacks are possible from almost any situation and although you will probably suck at first, only trying out the easiest of heroes - drow,riki,viper ect- soon you will become better, soon you will graduate from noob school and become novice level (like me), This happens at about 750hrs. 2. Dont rush for the same hero every time, even if you really like the hero dont do it. Picking every hero will teach you their abilities so you will know what each of them are capable of when you play with them or against them, so try randoming for the extra gold too. Do this until you have won a game as every hero or have played a hero atleast twice. Good luck and may Dendi be with you!

review: Real Time Strategy, micro one character, but strategize with bots, teammates, items, board features, and more! Replayability is like a physical sport, the game is different every time! One of the founders of the MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) genre! One of my favorites obviously!

review: This game, like most Moba games, is like an abusive partner, it will hurt you and make you feel awful so you tell yourself you will stop yourself and that you will put an end to the relationship but when you confront it it pulls you close and whispers in your ear while gently carressing your back that it is sorry for hurting you so you forgive it and the cycle continues. Great game

review: It's an amazing game - technically outstanding, showing all of Valve's usual polish and attention to detail, especially in the all-important multiplayer aspects. The continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. It's hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. It took me a long time to warm up to, but I'm helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. If you can spare the time - play it.

review: Dota 2 is a MOBA in which you don't need big bucks to be better than anyone else. A new player is just like an old player with the only differenece being the experience. The game is balanced to a very high degree and has a lot of tournements with stupidly large prize pools. The heroes are fun and unique, and the mechanics are great. In my opinion it is the best game in this genre so far.

review: This game, what can i say about it. It has a great selection of heroes, with an absolute perfect balance with each one. A excellent combat system that is as paramount as the original DEFENSE OF THE ANCIENT. A store that does not sell you items that will piss off the opponent. A map design that doesen't have those ing bushes where people can hide and jsut ing ambush you when you walk by like in LOL. And a ingame item system that can actually effect the outcome of the game. But what i hate about this game, i quite a big list. First, there is no surrender button, therefore if you know you are going to lose, you would need to sit there for twenty minutes getting killed over and over again till your ancient falls. Also the community surronding the game is somewhat of a , first there are the racist comments, then there are the spanish and the russians that can't even speak a word of english. But overall, this game I find, is quite good. Why don't you come down to the SEA servers, where everyone shuts up and plays the game

review: My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, "If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately." Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- "Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.

It's full of children, who never had a taste of Bill Gates lifestyle. The people who have had a taste of it will never set foot in the YMCA ever again. Ever. Unless, of course, they find that everyone is too good, and they leave to join the YMCA (Nothing against the YMCA, but Bill Gates' life is probably better).

I try to play at least one game a day and have been doing so for months and don't plan on stopping. Give the game a chance (more like 5) and I guarantee that you'll see why its the most played game on steam. be prepared to be dumbfounded as to why you were playing anything else. also a side note: the games free. steam is free. the only thing u have to lose from giving it a try is alil self respect in the beginning. but don't worry after one game where u actually do really good you'll feel like a million bucks.

review: Dota2 is the highly successful sequel to the WarCraft 3 custom map Defense of the Ancients. The original DotA was the parent of the MOBA genre that we enjoy today, and Dota2 has done an amazing job carrying on the legacy. If you were a fan of the original, or enjoy the current MOBA games on the market such as League of Legends, Heroes of Newerth, or Smite - Give Dota2 a chance. There are literally dozens of heroes to choose from, with multiple item builds for each hero. This can make the learning curve a little steep, but there is a decent tutorial system in place for helping new players learn. There is also an improved bot mode now, where you can practice against AI and hone your skills until you feel comfortable playing with other players. Ranked play adds a more competitive arena for players looking to improve and advance, and there is now a solo mid 1v1 mode to practice laning if you so choose. Dota2 is an ever evolving game, and growing into a prominent E-Sports arena. It isn't for everyone, and players that get frustrated easily might want to avoid it. The community can be a bit hostile towards newer players, but with some patience you can find great players and make friends that will help you through the process.

I skip out on breakfast trying to come up with new strategies to use in this stupid game. I go to class and get  grades because i'm thinking of good team comps to beat strangers that call my a  and try and impress my team who report me and tell me to uninstall. I go home and instead of doing something with my friends, if i had any, i play this ing game. As I am watching the stupid ing black volvo guy turn his head at me, i begin to think about my  life. I have no girlfriend, and I am still a virgin. I turn down requests to hang out with my real friends so I can gain imaginary points on this game. This game has ruined my ing life. There are so many characters and items and strategies. I ing love it. This is the most beautiful turd pile of a game I have ever played. 0/10 would recommend.

review: Wonderful game. Very entertaining and the atmosphere is a little more relaxed then the other popular mobas. The beauty of this game is that it tends to emphasize individual initiative more than your ability to emulate the latest guides. As cool as that is nothing really compares to the strong sense of nostalgia players of Dota 1 will feel while playing since the game barrows as heavily from the original as is legally possible. That said you absolutely have to play with at least two friends otherwise you're playing experience will go to hell very quickly 1 - No regionalization of servers - ae: Theres going to be a lot of psychotic chittering mic spam and people who think they speak English are just going to shriek at you with preposterous accents. Unless reliving you're favorite moments of Full Metal Jacket strikes you as being the epitome of strategic entertainment you'll want to queue with some friends. 2 - Self Imposed Dictators - ae: Everyone knows the self important team leader type. Some stranger you have never met, seen or heard of who feels that its perfectly acceptable for him to tell you what skills you're going to pick during ability draft ext. Unless you enjoy angry, nasally congested, petty and vindictive mic spam you'll want to grab some friends. 3 - Steam is still technically PG-7 - ae: Only the characters in your games are allowed to curse. Stating to another player "wow you sure suck at dota!" is a punishable offence. This issue is compounded by the fact that the ban system is automated. A player will automatically be banned based on the number of reports they accrue cross scaled by time they accrued them in. Fortunately I have managed to avoid any of the chat bans but some of my friends havent been so lucky... Consider the math. One in four people on the internet may be defective. Four reports within a 2 hour period may get you banned. You play three 40 minute games. How is that going to shake out for you in the long run? It may not happen to you and it hasnt happened to me but sooner or later you are going to get flagged and auto punished by the assbrains and this could compromise youre whole steam account. You dont have to be a victim of an injustice to speak against it and I believe flatly that automated oversight is as dangerous as no oversight at all. Dangerous and foolish business. So like I said, bring at least two friends with you or prepare for a pretty hellacious experience. Otherwise its very fun.

Theres a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. But once you start to learn its secrets, theres a wild and exciting variety of play here thats unmatched, even by its peers. Its a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that its completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isnt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. May the best team win. PS. Dont play with Russians

review: Easily the most fascinating strategy games in years and easily the most exciting to watch (regular matches to tournament / championships) Bringing the most spectacular and vividly detailed strategies to players and viewers alike. One of the most addicting games ever made; and one you can never master as something can always be countered. While some people may be turned off by the first few games due to he learning curve; rest assured if you dip atleast 10 hours into learning how to really play the game and the character you chose to start playing with, you will soon be engulfed in an AAA package unlike any other game, which is why I give it a 10/10 - Many RTS games, RPG Games, MOBA's, Hybrids, all bring new innovative things to plate; or end up getting big by copying a formula near exact (such as LoL... -sigh- ) - DOTA 2 is the best "Action Real Time Role Playing Game" or "MOBA" (Name doesn't matter) but it's the best in its field and one of the best online centered titles you'll ever play.

review: Current meta sucks, next meta will probably suck just as well. This game is better off you recognizing every aspect of the game and getting used to the learning curve, play 600-2000 hours, get mad at it, and fanboy over professional teams. Fanboying and following professional teams and tournaments is the best way to go. Also the lore isn't half bad. TL;DR this game is better than League of ies

review: As a drop while playing Dota 2. Because Dota 2 is a free-to-play game, players do not receive free cards like most other games. Instead, a card drop becomes available for roughly every $9 USD spent on cosmetic items in the Dota 2 Store. If you have card drops available, they will appear automatically in your Steam inventory as long as your Dota 2 client is open. Cards drop approximately once every 15-60 minutes. From the Steam Community Market. By trading with another player. From a Booster Pack. Booster Packs are packets of several cards that drop randomly after you have forged one Dota 2 badge. Booster Packs can also be bought on the Market. Booster Packs drop more frequently for players with higher Steam Levels.

review: If you're a fan of MOBA games you'll probably enjoy this. Surely you might find it to be harder to begin playing with it if you're coming from League of Legends or some other MOBA game. The community is quite trash mostly, and if you're playing pub matches you'll be overrun by low level players that use pubstomp heroes and you'll most likely lose, unless they're so bad they're even bad at those heroes. It will take you a while to get onto some decent levels and decent pubs but it's worth it. Graphics are nice and somewhat toony, like TF2, and gameplay varies a lot depending on the teams, heroes and item builds you pick. It's free, so why not try it? All it's features are free, the only thing you might want to buy are aesthetics. EDIT: "Depression Simulator 2015" - This game taught me that everyone deserves the same amount of hate... oh and if it's Russians that are playing, I'd prefer Russian Roulette, thanks. At least you get to learn every single language except English. Nobody talks English in Dota 2, are you crazy?

review: The most challenging and engaging MOBA, warning to LoL players there is a steep learning curve and you need to unlearn a lot of habits. All attack animations are not designed to last hit, making it actually take skill. Meanwhile the game is all about skill, activatable items and always being able to comeback if you're diligent and knowledgable. Its about crushing defeat that sinks to your core, and triumphant victory that makes you yell to the skies!

review: Pretty much a boring version of League of Legends. Why League of Legends is better than this game: 1) League fo Legends is f2p. Dota 2 costs $30 2) League of Legends has a broader selection of playable characters 3) League of Legends has a nicer UI 4) League of Legends has a slightly smaller map for more intense and skilled battles 5) League of Legends is more popular on Twitch.tv and has more MLG pro gaming tournaments and such 6) No russians in League of Legends 7) Dota features a Pay-2-Win system in which you can buy exclusive items for each character such as armor and weapons. 8) Dota only has one map while League of Legends has several maps and game modes which you can play to your liking 9) Biggest problem with Dota: NO RANKING system. You can't see improvement through ladders and such, horrendous stats page, absolutely no ranking system other than levels which is also Pay-2-Win with XP boosts avaliable on the market 10) Very gimmicky crates dropped at the end of each game trying to sucker you into spending more money on keys 11) Extremely boring map, it's all dark and depressing. Makes me want to fall asleep. 12) Very low player population. Highest played game on Steam, but not even 1/3rd of League of Legends population due to the fact that this game isn't free to play and supports a Pay-2-Win model 13) This game suffers from a lack of updates, it seems to be just a cash cow for Valve 14) Matchmaking takes ridiculously long, it's actually suprising that the #1 game on Steam suffers from match-making this awful. Really shows how rarely this game is updated 15) Players can draw on the map disrupting each others experience and mic usage is also allowed which always brings griefers who like to spam the mic and ruin the game for everyone 16) You can teamkill your own creeps in this game ruining the game for your team and your enemy 17) There is no META anyone does anything, this causes a very chaotic enviorment which is very daunting a new player just trying to learn the ropes 18) This game is not free to play 19) This game uses a Pay-2-Win system with gimmicks involved like Keys trying to get you to spend money 20) The community is actually terrible with plenty of hackers and griefers ruining the game for everyone involved. PLAY THIS GAME AT YOUR OWN RISK

But after that it's very rewarding and fun with friends. Make sure you get a group because going in alone is a big risk for frustration. (Also a good way to learn new exotic languages!)

review: Dota2 is the highly successful sequel to the WarCraft 3 custom map Defense of the Ancients. The original DotA was the parent of the MOBA genre that we enjoy today, and Dota2 has done an amazing job carrying on the legacy. If you were a fan of the original, or enjoy the current MOBA games on the market such as League of Legends, Heroes of Newerth, or Smite - Give Dota2 a chance. There are literally dozens of heroes to choose from, with multiple item builds for each hero. This can make the learning curve a little steep, but there is a decent tutorial system in place for helping new players learn. There is also an improved bot mode now, where you can practice against AI and hone your skills until you feel comfortable playing with other players. Ranked play adds a more competitive arena for players looking to improve and advance, and there is now a solo mid 1v1 mode to practice laning if you so choose. Dota2 is an ever evolving game, and growing into a prominent E-Sports arena. It isn't for everyone, and players that get frustrated easily might want to avoid it. The community can be a bit hostile towards newer players, but with some patience you can find great players and make friends that will help you through the process.
