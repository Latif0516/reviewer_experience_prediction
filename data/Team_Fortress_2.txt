review: One of the best free-to-play game out there and one of the best multiplayer experiences! Incredibly well balanced and very fun, especially when exploring the abilities of each class. Both the co-op and the versus modes are incredibly fun and unique in their one way. I highly recommend it! Edit: I disagree with those saying the game is pay to win: all weapons can be found in game through playing. The only items that cannot be found with a free to play account are cosmetics such as hats and accessories

review: You can role-play an obese russian hat hoarder who has mental issue from his psychopathic war experiences. He has a speach impairment and can't prenounce sandwich and calls it "sandvich" whenever he eat 1 of his 12 a day. Also a crazy nazi scientist who is still mad about WW2 follows you around with a gun-thing that I'm sure gives you testicular cancer. 10/10 would recommend.

review: This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes. At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'. Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve. 'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, "Mann Up", gives rewards upon completing a "tour". In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available. In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them. The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since November 2007 and I still return to the game on a regular basis.

review: Uh Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed Now to make it 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

review: I was only 10 years old. I loved TF2 so much, I had almost all the weapons I wanted. I would leave my computer on for hours, Just to get a few drops. Then I got my first hat, The gibus. Suddenly everything changed. I no longer cared about playing for fun, I only cared about the 'hats' I "borrowed" my mommys credit card and bought more hats. I had so many hats, I loved them all. But then someone traded me, I accepted. They offered an Unusual for all my hats. It was so sexy looking, I put up all my hats and traded. But no Unusual, He scammed me. I lost it all. I was so sad I cried for hours. Later that night I prayed to Gaben for my hats back. I went to bed after praying. I felt warm. I looked behind me, It was Gaben! He said "This is Gabe Newell" and handed me a Burning Team Captain. Then I woke up, I was wearing my Burning Team Captain and I was naked. I saw Gabe leave through the window, he looked back at me and winked. Hats are love. Hats are life

review: There's a point where I can write a review that can be both amazing yet bias at the same time; I hope I don't try to influence anyone by this review alone. When I first got Team Fortress 2, it was an experience that can't be beat. This first-person shooter can't go to say that this is probably the greatest in gaming history. From trading to crafting, this game will keep you on th edge of your seat until you know it's ready to stop playing. There are 9 classes, each that is unique and makes the game fairly balanced, making th game experience even more fun. With all the updates, there are some positive and negative effects than can affect the Team Fortress 2 trading community as a whole, but the whole aspect is to game, have fun, and enjoy your time on this game. It's your decision to buy from the store. It's your decision to craft metal and hats. It's your decision to play, idle, or even be a teammate and balance the rosters. The community is just like this game: random. So if you wish to stop playing other FPS titles and take a break from imbalanced games, then your choice is this: you won't be dissapointed.

review: I was so excited to load up Team Fortress 2, a cool wacky FPS that was team based and had many variations! Awesome! I said to myself. This must be way better than Call of Duty! As the download was running I sat on my chair eager to play the game, I started searching up some videos on the game and basic gameplay mechanics so I could get the edge on the competition, I learned many things that I could apply in battle! Before I knew it the download was complete! Awesome! I sat there as the game loaded up, eager to get into a server! I saw a map called "ctf_2fort" "That map sounds fun!" I exclaimed, I joined the server and was greeted with a class selection screen. I figured I should play the sniper since my experience in other FPS would help me through. My first ever spawn! I promptly walked forward out of the doorway and was greeted by a demoman camping spawn with his stickybomb launcher. I died. 10/10

review: I should have probably written a recommendation for this game a long time ago, as it is literally the most fun Ive ever had in an online game. Playing with, or without a team of friends, competitive or casual, this game delivers consistent fun that never really gets old. The dynamics and balance of class-based shooter gameplay that exists in this game is unparalleled anywhere else that Ive seen, with no one way to play being superior. The pay-to-advance mechanics in other freemium games aren't present here, as aside from a few utility unlocks and different play styles, the stock weapons are largely the best for every character, with the microtransation and trading economies being largely cosmetic and for non gameplay-affecting in nature. The support for competitive play is amazing, with all levels of skill supported, and many servers dedicated to skill improvement, in addition to casual gaming. The community is also amazing, with no shortage of community content, media, artwork, and a plethora of gaming networks that bring the TF2niverse to life outside the game, and into the rest of the world. (Still waiting for the civilian bobblehead from Meet the Sniper) There is also a virtual macro economy, with Valve's random item distribution system leading to a diverse market for all things TF2, within TF2; hats, specialty weapons, memorabilia items, that can all be used in-game to customize your character and add depth to your actions in-game and within the steam community. The bugs due to lack of optimization, and occasional grief caused by players abusing vote-related moderation systems are the only two things that I can complain about with this game, as it's good, wholesome fun regardless if you're just starting, or are a competitive pro. Even though this game is nearly 7 years old, the community that plays it really brings it to life once you get into it and with the nonstop fun that it provides, Its one of the genuinely few online games that I can wholeheartedly give my seal of approval to. Do i reccomend this game? Of course. There's no boring tedium of waiting around for your opponent to act, and hard-set roles and proceedures that needs to be adhered to, lest your team's fun gets ruined thanks to one person slipping up like in many of the other games these days. (heck, you can charge at a rocket launcher-wielding enemy with a claymore sword, and kill him if you pull it off correctly) I think it allows for more personal expression and playstyles than i think exist in a lot of games. 9.5/10 for doing everything right that can be done in an online shooter, and actually listening to the concerns of the community. Also for providing not just something fun to play, but a universe to be part of.

review: The vicious cycle of Team fortress 2 First when you'll arrive in the game, you'll want Weapons, tons of them. Then you'll see that everyone has hats, and you'll want these, a tons of them. Then you'll realize that hats doesn't matter, only skill count, so you'll want a lot of skills, tons of them. Then new weapons will be added, and you'll want them, all of them. Then a new hat will be added and you'll want it, cause it'll be fancy on your main class. Then you'll realize again, that you don't give a damn about hats, all is about is skill. Then when you have waited for 3 years, new weapons will be added, and you'll want them. And then you realize that you spent like 2000 hours of your life for this, met great friends, and you'll have a server where's you feeling like home, and you discovered so much things via the community, it learnt you so much. Then the rude reality of life, bring you on earth, and this game is here, Waiting for you to play 1,2,3... hours, and you'll be happy to see that all your good friend are still here.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a really stupendously addictive and fun FPS game. The game revolves around a set of 9 classes, each of which have strengths and weaknesses and counters, whose duty it is to conquer the opposition. The thing about TF2, at least for me, is the artstyle. The comic cartoonyness of the characters and world is incredibly fun and light. It's the perfect game to blow off some steam and relax after a long day. The players, at least in my experience, are all generally really nice. I feel this is because being "bad" at TF2 is not really a factor. Regardless of your skill level, how much time you've spent on TF2, or how much money, everyone can contribute and everyone can have a great time. One of the strongest parts of the game is that losing, dying or being killed doesn't lead to hate or anger or frustration. A game in TF2 can last from 3 to 10 minutes, and these short rounds contribute to a lack of concern if you lose. Not in a bad way, not in a way which results in you not caring about the game in general, but in a way where if you lose you don't blame yourself, or your team mates, for the loss. It's refreshing and fantastic. Hugely recommended from myself. I've spent about 550+ hours in the game, am in no way a master, half-decent maybe, and I have no reason to stop playing. The game is consistently updated with new maps, items, lore and content and I look forward to many more hundreds of hours of gameplay. Nilesy

review: I was only 13 years old. I loved TF2 so much. I was always at the bottom of servers. I pray to Gaben every night, hoping I would get a hat someday. "Gaben is love," I said. "Gaben is life." My dad overhears me and calls me a wm1. I know he's just jealous that I got recruited into FaZe clan. I call him a bodyshotter. My dad airshots me and sends me to my room. As I feel my numb face, I turn on my PC and log into Steam. My hands are shivering as I click on the "PLAY" button to open up TF2. "I'll show that airshotter," I said. I open up the Steam Market Place, and purchase 20 Half Life 3 Cases and Keys. 10 minutes have passed by, and I've unboxed 19 Strange Neon Annihilators As I move my cursor over to the final case, I click and select "OPEN". My cursor moves even slower as I move it towards the giant, green "USE KEY" button. I click the button. "I can't look," I said to myself. "My dad will noscope me when he see's that I've spent six grand on super exclusive and rare Half Life 3 Cases and Keys. I close my eyes and listen as I hear Gaben laughing over me, as if I am almost certain that I did not get a hat. I open my eyes. A large clump of feces leaves my  very quick, as my eyes look at the item I have just been given by the Holy Gaben himself. Another clump starts sliding out as I stand up to run to my dad to tell him that I've just unboxed a Ghastly Gibus. My dad cries as he suddenly gets his Steam account hacked by OpTic. I wear my new hat and noscopes his face. I then walk into my room, take my pants off, and thrust my pelvic region into the air, imagining Gaben with me. "Gaben is love, Gaben is life."

review: This game started as a class-based combat simulator, capturing the control points, stealing the intelligence from the enemy, moving a bomb-holding cart. Then, it moved onto a hat simulator game, only hats mattered, it was a competition to see who had the best hat. Recently, Team Fortress 2 transformed into a Bread simulator, you could spawn bread with a teleporter, bread was amazing, even bread weapons were released... But now, it is a conga simulator, one conga is enough to ruin a server. 10/10 must conga harder.

review: There is pretty much a reason for anyone, and I mean anyone to play Team Fortress 2. Let's review. If you like to play with fire, and not have to seek professional counseling. Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you like to stab people in the back while smoking a cigarette and speaking in an outrageous French accent. Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you like to run around and hit people with a bat, while talking like a cast member from "Jersey Shore". Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you've ever said to yourself: "I want to build guns, but I also have a life long dream to beat another man to death with a wrench,". Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you've ever wanted to pretend you're an obese Vladmir Putin while simultaniously firing an ridiculous machine gun. Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you've ever wanted to behead people while in a drunken Scottish rage, Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you've ever wanted to sound like that one kid's dad who told war stories and never shuts up about America, and shoot people with a rocket launcher, Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you want to prove that the plural of the word "Sniper" is "Too damned many", Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. If you've ever wanted to pretend you're a Doctor that barely escaped trial at Nuremberg, Team Fortress 2 is a game for you. Finally, if you like hats...be they fancy, or shabby...Team Fortress 2 is a game for you.

review: Team Fortress 2 is the BEST FPS that I EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE!!!!! This game is a MUST-PLAY!!! The cartoon feeling combined with the combat makes this game a different one from the other FPS games. What also makes TF2 also a unique FPS is that it is a Multiplayer only video game. TF2 is one of the games that you don't have a pro to enjoy the game. For other FPS games, such as COD , you would have to be a pro at the game in order to get the other weapons. For TF2, you just have to play a certain amount of time and then later you will acquire some new items! If you're lucky, you could get a misc or even a hat. There are many different qualities for items and weapons in the game. They are Normal, Unique, Strange, Vintage, Genuine, Unusual, Haunted, Collector, Community and Self-Made. There are 9 classes which are the Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy. These classes are divided into 3 categories. They are Offensive, Defense and Support. Each class specalise in a particular area. The Scout can double jump and is the fastest out of all class which means he can escape from danger with no diffculty. The Soldier can rocket jump to get into higher areas. Pyro can burn enemies and can do compression blast which blasts projectiles away such as rockets and grenades. The Demoman is able to make traps for enemies. Heavy is able to take a lot of damage and has the most health. Engineers are able to construct buildings such as a Sentry Gun to defend points and support the rest of the team. Medics can heal fellow teammates so they are able to survive in battle longer. Sniper can do a significant amount of damage with sniper rifle. Spy can disguise as the enemy team and can sap Engineers' buildings to disable them. As you start Team Fortress 2, there are detailed tutorials that teaches you how to play the particular class efficently. When you finished these tutorials, there is a "Training" Mode which enables you to sharpen your skills on bots. Training Mode also has several diffculties. TF2 has many gamemodes. Some examples are Capture the Flag, King of the Hill and Payload. Each gamemode has a certain objective and requires everyone in the team to contribute. Team Fortress 2 is one of those games that requires a lot of teamwork. If there is no teamwork, the team is unable to advance to the next point. A unique gamemode called Mann Vs Machine is when 6 players work as a team to prevent waves of invading robots deploying a bomb at a certain point. As you advance through, the waves of robots begin to get increasingly more diffcult. There is also a "Mann Up" version. This is the official version of Mann Vs Machine played on offical Valve Mann Up servers. In order to get into these servers, you would need to purchase a "Tour Of Duty Ticket". After you complete a mission , you earn a pile of loot which you get at the end when it is "Victory" Time. When you complete a Tour Of Duty, you would get normal weapons, Botkiller weapons, Killstreak Kit, an Australium Weapon and many more. TF2 has also many custom mod servers which consist of unoffical gamemodes. Some of these mods are TF2ware and Versus Saxton Hale. The best feature of Team Fortress 2 is that there is always update which contain new items, weapons,weapons changes, maps, gamemodes and THEY ARE ALL FREE OF CHARGE!!! This says when you go on Team Fortress 2, there is always new content to enjoy. TF2 also celebrates special events such as Halloween and particular maps change their looks to match the event. In these events, they are special event only items that you can acquire. Team Fortress 2 are just those games that get very hard to bored of. They can get so addicting that you would just play them all day. NOT TO FORGET, IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE HATS. TF2 is an absolute MASTERPIECE!!!!! I give this game overall 1,000,000,000/10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review: This game......... I've lost family and friends to this game, its taken over my life, it's not just a game to me, its more than a obsession, its a drug, a way of life to me. I sold 1 of my kidneys, my body to science, shoes, clothes, worldy posessions just to feed my addiction to buy hats and weapons, ive gone so far as to morgage my house, not feed my children, miss countless days of work, FOR THIS GAME "father, we're hungry, these year old saltines hurt our tummies" "Sorry, but i really need this hat" The time i spend playing this game, i could be using to better my self, not just for me, but for the loved ones around me, but i keep getting pulled back into the same habits. Do i recommend this game? yes, i do. Do i recommend you neglect your family and friends, just to play this game? of couse I do. Do i recommend you give up your life like i have, down to my last 100$ and pack of top ramen, using newspapers as diapers, feeding off compliments that i get for my hats? I think you know the answer to that question. GET.THIS.GAME  Jk about all of that, its a pretty good game, i highly recommend it, get it "I dont want to spend the money" ITS FREE! or is that still to expensive for you?

review: This game is PC gamer's essential. The art style is unique and appealing. The gameplay varies dramatically from map to map, requiring the player to create new strategies and work with their team in order to succeed. The community is also a nice bunch of people. The game has it's own charm, that keeps a big, goofy smile on your face the whole time you play it, maybe it's the art style, or the personalities of each classes, and maybe it's how the game sort of make fun of itself and takes itself so un-seriously. There are frequent updates that keep adding new items and features that get the whole community excited for a good reason, these new items can throw a real curve ball in the right situation. Lastly, it's F2P! So what are you waiting for, go and fire up steam and download it now, you will not regret it.

review: October 2007, Valve gives birth to their newest child, a young boy by the name of TF2. Old friends of his father, Team Fortress classic, as well as a newer bunch flock over to see the new child. They love him, he's unlike any child they've ever seen before. Beautiful for his time, with the mechanics that they knew and loved and then some, he becomes one of Valve's most popular children fairly quickly. But Valve thinks, "let's add something new to the mix- a new hat and a new gun." They do just that, and even more people are attracted. Everyone loves him just that much more. Valve notices the attention this child is getting. This child is a happy one, a thriving one with a lot of friends. "How can we make him happier?" Valve asks themself. More hats. TF2's 3rd birthday is almost a week away, but Valve wants to surprise their child with his 3rd birthday gift a bit early. A new pile of hats and guns. TF2 looks at his gift, awestruck, his mouth hanging wide open. It was unlike anything he had ever seen! And then, without warning, Valve chucks the child in to this new pile of hats and weapons. Initially stunned, he eventually feels the great pain of the impact against the metal and wood weaponry that he had landed in. He cries loudly, and for months. "What do we do now, how can we make our child happier?" Valve ponders this. All of TF2's friends are still around, happy as ever without noticing his pain and suffering. Valve knows what they must do. May 2011 comes by. Valve carries with them boxes of WW1-era helmets. More hats should definitely make TF2 happier. More hats will always make him happier. Valve approaches TF2 with the boxes full of helmets. TF2 looks up to her and stops crying, he looks up to her with a hopeful look upon his face. You can see his smile slowly return. And then valve pulls out a cold hard helmet and throws it at TF2, hitting him in the head. He's stunned, only this time he doesn't wake up quite as quickly. "Why. Won't. You. Be. Happy?" Valve asks, chucking a helmet at the child between each word. TF2 sits there like a ragdoll. All of TF2's friends are now yelling at Valve. They notice the abuse, they beg Valve to stop, and they finally back off. But then, TF2 wakes up. He doesn't cry, he doesn't weep, he doesn't know quite what's happening. A new group flocks around him, Valve sees this as a victory and returns to her spot upon the sofa to take a powernap, she's quite exhausted. In reality it's quite the opposite. TF2's old friends and new friends now fight over him, and he suffers heavily from brain damage causing a wide variety of problems. Valve wakes up and notices. His netcode is very severely damaged. Valve responds by throwing more hats and weapons at him. His best friends are turning invisible completely at random. Valve throws more hats at him. His friends' clothes colors are changing for no reason at all. Valve throws more hats at him. It always seems to make his friends happy, but at this point hardly anybody realizes that TF2 is dying of abuse and neglect. 2012 - TF2 turns 5 years old and his friends are poking at him doing the same exact thing they've been doing for the past 5 years. Valve gives birth to two new  children, CS:GO and Dota 2. Many flock over to them, but most of his friends still stick around. TF2 looks longingly at the two new children. They both are already more popular than he ever was, and their parents take better care of them. Maybe someday, he hopes, Valve will realize what the real problem is and take proper care of him. Day by day, more of his friends begin to leave him. Word goes around of a new upcoming medical procedure that could fix all of his problems, "Source 2" is what they call it. It's a long way off, but maybe- just maybe, he hopes- Valve will let him have it and he'll be as happy as he was as a child. But for now, it's merely a dream. A tear rolls down TF2's sunken-in cheek, and he shuts his eyes for yet another night.

review: Oh TF2, oh TF2.. We've come a long way, but everything will end eventually, no matter how fun it was. If you are looking for the game's details, read the positive reviews, I will have a little rant here. A few years ago I found this game through the famous "meet the series", after I started playing I was instantly hooked by the amazing variety of gameplay, even though I do not play anymore do to the reason I will give below I am still active in the community, some of you might know as Gilgamesh from OpenGriefing. The game: With the nine classes and huge amount of weapons that come with it TF2 is a game which you can play for days, even months! Each class has their own individual role which is completely unique to it, you can play in all sort of ways, and there is so much to do it rarely feels repeditive. The community is nice, and although most do not appreciate the sight of a new player, there is still a huge amount of nice people. I my self have taught 4 players on how to play TF2 whom I personally don't even know, and I had great fun in doing so, and there more people out there that do the same. The game has a series of cosmedic items which add a lot of life and color into it. You can dress the big muscle guy called the heavy with his huge machine gun up with a fairy custom, or you can turn the German doctor called the Medic into a WW2 German infantryman of the battle of Stalingrad, these are two examples of thousands of possibilities. There are many game modes and dozens of maps for each, which let you play the game for an unbelievable amount of time with out getting bored once. These are just the official maps. There are tens-of-thousands of community maps which also enhance the gaming experience. The community: TF2 is a very old game, yet it is one of the most played multiplayer games even today. The community is very committed and it was the community that made the game what it is today. Valve kept the game fresh by releasing updates that always added more content with which you could play with your friends and have loads of fun. With that being said, here comes the problem: As I said, TF2 has a very committed and loyal community even though the game is from today's standards as old as the bread crumbs that are left in a toaster that one day have the fortune of being vaporized, leaving the toaster as dust. Now, valve always showed their appreciation for this through out the year by adding fresh content. This however, has changed. Valve, like other companies, has noticed the potential of modern competitive games, one genre of which is MOBAs. It is also very obvious that they have grown old of TF2 and want to work on different things. Their plan to keep the game alive, while slowly leaving it was to let their loyal community take over, which I have to say is quite an honorable thing to do. However, they have completely failed at it. The problem is, the community may be able to handle parts of the game, but not the entire game it self. It is impossible do to many factors. By this I mean, the community might be able to add content like hats and taunts to the game, but they can not expand the gaming experience, the expanding the gaming experience is exactly what made TF2 a special game, every year there was always something new to try out and after doing that, the normal game was appealing again, and the loop continued. But instead of fixing the issue, they just want to pull it through till the end, like dragging a bleeding body to the hospital but knowing that it won't make it. Warning Rant: They also treat the community wrong, they have gotten to used to the community of TF2 treating them like some kind of divine council. They think anything will satisfy it. An example of this is the ing ducks. Some people complained that the "End of the Line" not including snowplow, with Valves' response being 'It is too complicated for new players", from what I have heard though, the did not include the map due to it not reaching their standards, which is fine by me. Also the lack of weapons that were promised by the creator of the animation did not appear, which was upsetting, but still bearable. What really shoved the middle finger up my  though, was the ducks. The ing ducks that cost 5 ING EUROS. FOR ING DUCKS! Is this some sort of joke? Was Valve thinking,"Ayy Lmao, ducks are funny right?" from Valve and the End of the Line team. Without the ducks, I would have nothing to complain about, but if they seriously think that DUCKS will satisfy their loyal community after they miss out on the promised weapons and a new game mode, then must have ing plumbum in their water supply, They tried making up to it by rushing 3 new weapons which are all useless and uncreative. The creativity is what counts, not the effectiveness of the weapon. Pre-access, now for TF2 also! Another issue is BETA maps, they adapted the method of their platform into TF2. They release unfinished , act like it is finished but still needs "fixing" and let the community do all the work, instead of actually using already made maps by the community OR getting of their asses and finishing them. The beta map Cactus has a ing holes everywhere! It is also so monotone, I cringe when thinking valve could even put it in the game. What they appear to think of the community: They take us for a bunch of clowns, juggling around in the circus with a red nose and wacky hair, riding on a one-wheel making "toot toot sounds". They put disclaimers on their ! "For expert players only" they write in captions under their new Pre-Access game mode. Who ever complained to them, that some game modes for too complicated? Someone with 0 neurons in their skull, succeeding at surpassing the stupidity of a pigeon?!? The game mode is just as "complicated" as the other game modes, there is nothing that could irritate new players, if you exclude all the unnecessary glitches. Hats: As it worked in the past, adding more cosmetic items usually was endorsed with a lot of positive responses from the community, this was because they added fun cosmetics, while adding more content for gameplay. It was a balance of a innovation and fun, always the right mix. But now, they just try to make us suffocated in cosmetics. This can be do to 2 reasons: 1. They just want to add more cosmetics to.. recreate Barbie simulator. 2. They realized that the game is dying and wana milk as much  out of it as they can before it goes downhill (same thing goes for ducks) Servers: I will try to keep this short. Most Valve servers, the servers I personally enjoy playing on the most. Have  BETA maps on them. Most TF2 servers went from TF2 to DOTA 2 and CS:GO. I remember always finding at least 3 full servers of a single map, for each map a year or two ago. Now I have luck if I find a single full server of a map. To end this: As I mentioned before; "They realized that the game is dying and wanna milk as much  out of it as they can before it goes downhill", the game IS in fact actually going down the . Look at all the TF2 youtubers! STAR_ and Jerma have stopped playing the game! Why? Because there is nothing new, and they have a bitter taste because of the recent decisions of Valve regarding TF2. "So what if two youtubers quit playing the game, it happens all the time." When a pretty much TF2 only channel with at least 90% of its subscribers being TF2 related, quits the game because the company is ing up, then it is very obvious that there is something wrong! This is not just YouTube, it is also on my steam friends list, I used to see at least 10 people playing the game at any given time. Now it is rare to see anyone at all play it, and look at the size of that list! With the majority being hardcore TF2 Players. This game is dying and Valve needs to seriously step in before it bleeds out for good.

review: Good afternoon, dear gentlemen and gentlewomen It is a pleasure to perceive that one such as yourself would partake in my review of this most splendorous game. I say this for it is the most honest and veritable truth. Quite close to the objective Idea of Truth, to estimate it properly. At first I held the opinion that Collective Fortification II was merely another dull, boring and uninteresting ludum of the general significance and craftsmanship as Summoning of Obligation. However, this was in advance of the actual attempt at undergoing the experience of Collective Fortification II, which is, in hindsight, presumptuous and bold. Contrary to whatever estimation I conferred to Collective Fortification II in the past before, mind you, partaking in the adventure that is Collective Fortification II, I must declare with due expertise that this ludum is marvelous! In this ludum one will find a most engaging experience worthy of eternal estimation in the irrefutable and absolute realm of Do Desire. Certainly, anyone who would claim that this ludum is not worthy of said realm would be a scoundrel, a fraud and a lout. Yes, the sheer dilly-dallying that is facilitated in this ludum is thus charming that one such as I, one who could be described as paresseux comme baise, would scribe a true pinnacle of summitous apexity in the latitudes of criticisms. And thus, at the decisive terminal of this criticism I would implore you, my venerable gentleman or gentlewoman, to amuse yourself with this ludum of exceptional excellence. Now, my treasured asinine, experience the wonder that is Collective Fortification II with your personal senses by embarking on the quest that is this ludum! Godspeed and have a good evening by now. Best regards, MLAnonymous

review: TF2 Is that unique type of FPS that rarely comes around, more of like a one of a kind, it's a extremely different type of FPS, instead of rehashing content like certain other series, TF2 mostly gets updated with brand new content a few times a month, or even hints to upcoming updates, which makes it ALOT more mysterious/fun, TF2 at it's core is a very balanced/simple several-gamemode game, with all the classes ranging from Scout all the way to Spy. They all show ALOT of personality, almost all of them unique, from the Insane Medic, all the way to the Baby Yelling heavy, It's modding community is VERY well known aswell. Sick of the default gamemodes?, Try some community ones such as Parkour Fortress, Zombie Fortress, Dodgeball, Prophunt, Hidden, Freak Fortress and so much more, "But what's the catch?" i hear you say?, None really, but there are some downsides such as some of it's community and some if not most competitive players that scream at you for bodyshotting them, or mocking you because you are a F2P, all in all TF2 is a one of a kind gem by Valve Go play it. It's good.

review: Ah, tf2. Best game I've ever seen in my life. When I started playing tf2, I only played it for the gameplay. It was (and still is) real fun to play. But after some months, I discovered trading. The wonderful trading. After months of trading, I learned a lot about it. And now, I do it almost every day! It will always be my hobby. c: It's even a great way to earn money! :D I have to say, there aren't that much weapons. There are more cosmetics then weapons. I'm not really a fan of cosmetics, I prefer have weapons (that's why I almost have them all, except 5). And when there comes new items during an update, then that are only cosmetics/reskins of weapons/weapons in an other quality. For now the qualities that are coming more of: Strange and Collector's. Collector's is a new, and pretty expensive quality, but not really diffirent then the 'unique' quality. And Strange is a quality that counts kills/points/etc that you made with the weapon/misc that's in this quality. I'm a truly fan of Strange weapons, and I own 41 out of 120 (this is except Australiums, Botkillers and Festives, because that are 'just' reskins) Someday I'll buy the rest of them too :D Alright, I told pretty much I guess, and I hope this review was useful for you. Thanks for reading and enjoy playing tf2! - Wario_16, 2014.

review: Once upon a time, in a server far away There was a blue Scout that shouted "Bonk!" when he hurt people. This Scout was facing a dilemma. The Scout shouted, I need a dispensah over ere! However, the Engineer was facing problems of his own. A Spy is sappin my sentry! The Engineer shouted back. The Scout could see no red spy. Unfortunately, this lead to his downfall as the Scout was then backstabbed by the Spy. Before the Scout completely died, the Spy whispered into his ear, I did your mother. As the Spy walked out of the room, he disguised himself as the recently fallen Scout. Until he got hit by the Sniper's Jarate. This drew the attention of a red Soldier "I think his mate saw me." The Sniper whispered to himself. A rocket to the face only proved that fact.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a weird game, and it is not only a FPS game anymore. I would describe it more as a social hub for people to hang out. This game have two teams that are supposed to fight each other, but only in Team Fortress 2 with two people of the opposite team giving each other high fives, stop fighting during the game and walk around crouching, or dance together! There are nine classes divided into three groups; offense, defense and support. But Team Fortress 2 have changed so much since release that it does not really mean anything anymore. Pretty much every class can function as any of the three groups with the right loadout, but they are still very different from each other. You got a fast Scout with little health, and a slow Heavy with a lot of health, and anything inbetween that! There is no way you will not find a class you prefer sticking to. Valve never added a new class, but they added tons of weapons! Some of them are really silly (punch an enemy in the back to make him stop and laugh, a great way to get silly taunt kills!), while others generally are a big improvement over the stock weapons (like the Degreaser). However most of the weapons are very situational and I prefer the stock weapons. There are many game modes to play. Capture the point, capture the flag. Payload where you push a cart through the map while the other team try preventing you from doing it, and if you're a fan of tower defense, you will enjoy Mann Vs. Machine! You're a team of up to six people who are supposed to kill a huge army of robots before they move their bomb to your base. Some of them are small, others are big and really hurts, and others are big and runs fast. But what really makes this game mode different from the more traditional Team Fortress 2, is you can upgrade your weapons. Fire speed, damage, reload speed, damage resistances, running speed, jump speed and so on. It is really fun, and if you are lucky you can win a huge prize for completing a Tour! Cosmetic items are a huge deal for many people. Hats! There are so many hats in this game, and they are all so different. There is no way you are not going to find one you like and will wear and be proud to wear every time you play. Many of the cosmetics can also be painted into your favourite colour! Team Fortress 2 is free to play. Is it pay to win? No. All the weapons you see in the store, are weapons you can get simply by playing, or you can use items to craft the weapon you want. If you buy premium you will receive weapons faster, your backpack will be larger so you can keep more items, and you can trade with others. Trading is a good way to get the weapon you're looking for. It is a lot of fun! It is fun to play the actual game, or just hanging out with people ingame like you can not do in any other game. This is the game where you make friends! ^____^

review: The Second Fortress of Team is a roleplaying rpg. If you can see around this game's high price, I'm sure you'll be able to enjoy the stunning, photorealistic and colourful graphics this game gives. Based heavily on realism, Second Team Fortress is a very tough game to learn with all of the realistic gun mechanics. It improves on its strick mechanics by allowing the player get killstreaks after a certain number of kills. I give Call of Fortress 2 a Treyarch of an Activision.

review: In this game helping your team (collect hats) is vital to ensure victory in the (tryhard) battle field full of (F2Ps) death and dispair (hats). With all 9 classes (9001 hats) to choose from, the gameplay (hat choice) will most definitely be different from the first time you played (wore a Gibus) as your skill (backpack value) goes up in the ranks of battle (unusuals) in this Free to Play (Free2Troll) funfest (Gabefest). I give it a dan outa dan.

review: I actually like this game alot. Most people think of TF2 as a shooter game where all the players eventually get sucked into the world of hats and unusuals and strange weapons. That is very true. I've been addicted to collecting them since I started. Still don't have an unusual, but I just got my first professional killstreak weapon and I'm going to use only it for the rest of my life. :D

review: This review is very lengthy, as I have a lot to say about this game. So sit tight, you are in for a long ride. Let's get the verdict out of the way before getting to the real talk: I recommend this game. I have spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars on it. Is it worth playing? Yes. Is it worth investing your time for a deeper experience? Probably not. I already predict a lot of hate for this review, but I need to get it off my chest and explain the issues I have with this game. Once again those are my own opinions that a lot of people happen to share. It is completely fine if you want to argue against it, I will just ask you to be honest and less defensive because TF2 is in a critical state. First of all, I'd like to point out that I've spent 1780 hours, which might be low for some, high for others. I started playing in late 2009-early 2010 in intervals of several months between late 2010 and early 2012. I enjoyed this game a lot since it was a fresh change from the FPS games I used to play back in the days (CoD 2/4 or CS). It was extremely fun, and trust me, I do not regret a single minute I've spent on this game, before early 2014 at least. I'm not really the Shakespeare of game reviews, and English doesn't happen to be my first language, but I'll do my best to explain my points clearly. I'm going to spend some time explaining each major part (IMO) of TF2: Competitive, Trading, Community, and Updates. I - Competitive: Why do I want to list this subject first? Simply because this will be a quick talk: Competitive TF2 is basically the best place where you can fully enjoy TF2. The competitive community is mostly made of good and helpful people. You will play the game the way it should've been played, whether it's a lobby, pug or a UGC match. For my part, I didn't really want to get into UGC because unfortunately I was already getting into CS:GO and couldn't get the time to look for a team, even though I played pugs with and against silver/gold teams. II - Trading: We had the good part, now the not so good-decent part. Barely spent anytime there. I never got interested in it mainly because I'm not patient, and I can get the thing I need directly without spending 3 years working for a bigger backpack. Most of TF2 is usually into trading, whether they spend 1 hour a month or 23 hours a day in a trading website/server. The trading community is really mixed. It has good people in it, but it also has scammers and some self-centered losers. Yet, this is where I got to meet a lot of good friends, and where I've been amazed by a lot of idiots thinking they have the networth of the 1% in their inventory. At the current state of the game, according to many professional traders, unless you have some insane item, you won't make any profit. With all the useless hats added, the supply of cosmetics is insanely high, the demand is scattered and the value the currency holds keeps dropping, dragging everything down with it. In short, trade if you want, but watch out for scammers and sharks and stick with the good people. There aren't many, but they are out there. Trading would've been one of the strengths of TF2 if Valve and the heads of some communities didn't ruin it. III - Community: It's really mixed. You can find good people if you go to the right pubs, as well as s who will instantly kick you if you aren't a "friendly heavy" or "ruin the conga" or w/e. I wasn't lucky with Valve servers as well. Most of the times I played in those servers I was left with autistic meme spouters, 300 ping brazilians or  who will call you a tryhard if you simply try to play the game as intended. Some people also blame bronies or furries for making it worse. I honestly don't care about both, I had to witness a lot of pubs with regulars I've enjoyed playing with dying, and if there is something to blame it is not one of the game's communities such as the ones cited above, but rather the direction the game is currently taking. IV - Updates: The game is making a terrible turn. It went from a game that could've been a success in eSports to a casual cash-grabber made to attract more people into Steam. They keep on adding useless lore-breaking cosmetics aswell as useless weapons that keep on making the game worse. Many want Valve to add more weapons to the game - I don't. You have to understand that the point of unlocks are, or were to be very situational items and could also act as a costly alternative such as the Gunboats. Some weapons now are either completely useless such as the new grenade launcher or the Back Scatter or completely random such as the Base Jumper or the Tide Turner. Many people are complaining about EoTL for being one of the worst updates possible to the game. It was overhyped by you guys because you couldn't understand that this was the way Valve wants the game to be. Don't blame those who made EoTL, the ones to blame are those in charge of TF2. They had then to throw in a broken  game mode that seemed to be coded within a day, as well as a couple of useless weapons or taunts to calm the community down after the disaster.The sad part is that it worked. The game is now 8 years old and still a success for the wrong reasons; but how long is it going to last before more and more people get tired by the way Valve handles the game? Once again, most of these are based on my opinions as well as the opinions of others. I hope this might be useful for some. I had to write it to unleash the anger I had against the incompetent team supposed to replace the original developers. So go ahead, enjoy the game, play it as its fullest. If you've never played this game you are missing something, so do it now while it lasts. Thank you for your time.

review: Probably the worst FPS of all time, where your chance of winning is decided by the amount of headwear one can use. And as the heavy's head is the biggest, he is obviously the most op class. Scout is a manifestation of post-marxism homosexual propaganda masked with a Boston accent to calm the Italians. Soldier does not only suffer from heavy mental retardation he is also a extremely nationalistic American, basically male Sarah Palin. The Demoman is a anti-stereotypical to the point that it becomes offensive, trying to detract from his african american origin as much as possible. The pyro is the gimp from Pulp fiction with a flamethrower, not only is that copyright infringement but also damaging the image of latex fetishists all around the world. The sniper is the most incorrect character since 1. He is not a kangaroo and 2. He isn't upside down. The Medic is a nazi. The heavy is a false display of an incredibly overweight Putin with an insuffurable amount of brain cells. The spy is a meek attempt at poking at the french which fails by him not actually being offensive at all. 10/10 best game ever.

Want to use your ammunition to propel yourself across the map at incredibly high speeds and shoot a barrage of high powered rockets in the faces of your enemies? Want to burn down the homes of those you hate and simultaneously think about unicorns and rainbows? Want to operate highly explosive bombs and grenades while shouting like a drunk scottish man wielding a medieval sword? Want to eat sandviches? Want to carry your team by sticking a life saving device up other people's butts and become the center of attention because everyone either loves or hates your very soul? Want to build aimbot guns that do all of the work for you while you sit in a chair and drink beer? Want to be an MLG 360 noscope champion who throws piss at people? Want to use invisible hacks and kill other players in just one hit by pretending you're one of their friends? Then play TF2. 10/10 would wear a hat again.

review: I have to say. VALVE YOU ARE SO AWESOME YOU DID A WONDERFUL JOB!!! This game has to be one of the best games I've ever played. It's just one of those games you don't play once and then give up forever. It's one of those games where you play it the first time and it just gets so addicting. I have to say this is one of Valve's greatest creations. From all the different classes, to the 9ish different game modes this game is a work of art that everyone deserves to see. I also am a fan of the gamemode, mann vs machine. It's something unique that I have seen in some other games, but all the other stuff added makes of for it. I guess the only downside of the game, is that the game is rated M and I'm not really a fan of blood. I did find a youtube video that lets you put in the code to turn off the blood however. I give this game a 99/100 for a new unique game that everyone deserves to play.

Most likely that is not important enough in the game is the appearance of caps and other items I think the game was given a second life, which she lives and sow the day. It is not strange but in the game there are also disadvantages, the most important and perhaps the only time that has passed since the inception of the game, namely, today people want to play next-generation games, the game is losing popularity faster and faster, can not withstand competition.

It's not all self based like Call Of Duty, you work with your team to win. Team Fortress 2 also has unique weapons that help you in combat. On the other hand, I HAD to talk about HATS. Some people play just for the hats, I play for usually both of them. If you're looking for a great F2P game, this is the game for you. Hope you have fun!

review: This game is free and yet it is one of the most popular games on Steam. That says something. I definitely recommend playing TF2 or at least trying it out. However, i believe that to fully enjoy this game you cannot play for a short period of time. The reason for this belief is that when i first started playing TF2, i played for around an hour and didn't really like it. However, i decided to try playing again a month after my first try and i slowly began to enjoy it. Over time i began to understand how to play as each of the characters and i unlocked many game changing items. TF2 is fairly easy to play once you get used to it, but when you first start playing, it's like entering a whole new world. TF2 is unlike any other game and it will take a bit of time to fully understand it, but once you do, it becomes one amazingly fun multiplayer game.

review: This shooting game where cosmetics are more important than weapons introduces the player to a world where two teams of mercenaries fight each other in various modes like King of the Hill, Payload Race and Capture the Flag. There is also the Mann vs Machine mode where a small team fights giant hordes of robots. Play as the 9 different mercenaries, each with their own abilities and personality quirks. No matter your skill or playing style, there's a class that suits it! You'll surely enjoy this game that never gets old thanks to the frequent updates that bring new content such as hats, maps, weapons and gamemodes. And the best part is that it's NOT pay to win, since the game is well balanced and you can get weapons for free fairly easily. Your only concern will be getting more cosmetics! Team Fortress 2 is pure multiplayer fun, and one of the best games I've ever played.

review: I bought the game when it was still $20. It was the first game I had ever bought on Steam, and around that time in fall of 2008 there were only three characters updated with achievement weapons. Trading and hats weren't in existence yet, and the game truly was a "teamwork required" type of game. Every class felt balanced and fair, with each one having their own respective strengths and weaknesses. Even the achievement weapons brought a nice change of pace from the normal minigun and bonesaw. You actually felt accomplished when you did the achievements because you were rewarded. The community was surprisingly welcoming, and a majority of my Steam friends came from TF2. At the time, we had thought that Valve was going to update the rest of the characters with their own achievements and that would be all; and for awhile, we were right. One by one the rest of the classes got their own weapons and achievements, and by July 8th 2010 (Happy Birthday to me!), the Engineer was the last character updated. The game felt complete, three years in the making. Now... I think everyone knows what's coming next. Before I get into detail on the update that changed (or in my opinion, ruined) everything, let me just say that Valve had already put hats into the game months before, way back in August 2009. I was perfectly fine with the hats, they added a sense of personality to your classes and all you had to do in order to get them was play the game (a novel concept, I know). Hats were the only thing given to you as a random drop back then. I should probably point out that I took about a year break away from gaming at this point in time due to "real life." While I was away, the Mann-Conomy update happened. This update wasn't like any of the others, this update added tons of brand new weapons and hats, along with the addition of an in-game store and trading system to get them. When I eventually returned to TF2, the game wasn't about the objectives, or teamwork, or even being the best player anymore. All the game was about now was collecting the most hats and weapons you could get your hands on. The achievements didn't matter anymore because you could just buy whatever you wanted, or just find it as a random drop (since they updated it to more than just hats). The game that I fell in love with, spending sleepless nights for years, was all for nothing at the drop of a hat (quite literally). I'm not mad at Valve for what they did, from a business standpoint this is the smartest thing they've ever done. But whenever I see the game in my Steam library, I just get a deep feeling of nostalgia and longing for something that could have been. I hope that one day, I'll be able to relive those fond memories I have with Team Fortress 2.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a first-person shooter game from Valve. The gameplay is somewhat similar to Counter-Strike but with more variety of game modes, class based player, and unlike Counter-Strike, in terms of gameplay this game is more casual rather than competitive, at least for me. Everyone can play it, from kids, teens to parents, everyone can play. The game is very well balanced, each class has more than one unique abilities you can explore. You can get item drops as you play, and the more play, the more you can get. Items can be crafted for another better items too, or trade them for other items. And the best thing about his game is hats! Yes, hats. Most every damn people here on Steam loves them. You can show off your hats, craft it or even sell them! Many people make profit from it, many people collect it. Team Fortress 2 graphics is 3D but with cartoon style. Even though the graphics is cartoon, Team Fortress 2 still feature blood and gore effects. All effect from explosion, weapons fire, rockets, everything are cartoonized. This is great free to play game for me, I highly recommend it. Play it now! Rating 9/10

review: 9/10 - Need I say more? TF2 is one of the best multiplayer experiences steam has to offer. The purpose is in the name, Team Fortress 2 focuses on the use of teamwork to achieve various goals and it does so very well with 9 different and well balanced classes. The major flaw with TF2 is that of the younger crowd, I'd recommend finding some good servers and more mature people to play with before judging TF2's community.

review: Ah, TF2, one of the most well-known and popular FPS games out there on Steam, especially since it became Free To Play on the Steam Store. Ever since a friend got me into this game, I've been playing it non-stop for more than 200 play hours in total, and I would like to take the time to give my own thoughts on the game as a whole and some tips for newcomers to help them on their way to enjoy the game and not ragequit within the first 20 minutes of jumping right into it. First off, gameplay-wise the game is a typical multiplayer-based FPS game where the core goal is very simplistic: Hop on either the red or blue team and kill the opposing team and secure victory, however, the methods of accomplishing this range per match type, and usually good teamwork and class diversity are required to win the match. As for said class diversity, the game offers you 9 different playable class characters to choose from, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages, and it's a key requirement for any player to learn the limits and strengths of those classes in order to play the class effectively and to be of benefit to your team as a whole. Thankfully the game has a alright tutorial on a few classes, specifically the Demoman, Spy, Engineer and Soldier, but there are many tricks for a class that the game doesn't often directly tell you, but rather clues you in through the in-game loading screen tips section when you go to a match. Picking a class that suits your playstyle is often the first thing many new players struggle with, but the classes all range from fairly easy to pick up and play decently with, to far more tricky and fragile ones that require the player to be familiar with the mechanics and overall gameplay before they can effectively use them in combat. Such examples are the Heavy, Soldier and Pyro which in my opinion are some of the more easily accessable classes for new players to experiment around with, and Engineer, Sniper and Spy for the more experienced players when they feel confident enough. It has something for every kind of FPS gamer regardless of skill level, which is what I really like about this game. Atmosphere-wise, the game is very visually pleasing with alot of intricate map design accomodating the various matchtypes, and is designed so that players who are unfamiliar with the map and it's pathways are given visual cues on where to go, like if they're on the red team, a red arrow sign will point in the general direction where they need to head to, as well as various signs detailing a mission's objective and locations, like 'Intelligence' for the intel briefcase on capture the flag, 'Battlements' for the general middle area where most of the combat will take place, etc. The classes all have dynamic personalities that make them a blast to play as and you'll often chuckle at their lines regarding the situation, which really gives this game alot of personality. I personally really enjoy the Pyro because the character itself wears a gas mask which makes most of his lines almost inaudiable, but if you listen carefully you can make out a few key lines that he screams out. Besides the game's addictive core gameplay, there's alot of side content to it like customizable loadouts to your class' arsenal, cosmetic clothing and different taunts which you usually have to acquire through specific unlocking methods, crafting from metal which you get from turning additional weapons into metal which you obtain from random weapon drops during gameplay or trading with other players. Trading is one of the key mechanics of interacting with other players, and interacting with other players is oftentimes a good way of getting to meet a nice friend on Steam wether it's someone on your team, or someone you encounter while on a specific trade server, and who might be able to trade or even gift you some stuff if you're friendly to the player and and he/she is friendly to you in return. Just be careful of annoying or pushy players who are out for your items and will offer either nothing or nearly worthless items in return, though, if you happen to encounter those, just ignore them. There is also a Mann vs. Machine co-op game mode in where you get to work together with 5 other players being the limit against a horde of powerful robots trying to defend your area from a bomb they will attempt to deliver at all costs. This game mode is much more intense than regular multiplayer TF2 and you can earn nice cosmetic item rewards for your weapons in the Mann Up mode, but the Bootcamp mode is free to play and a good way for practice, but Mann vs. Machine is very tough and is not recommended for newcomers of TF2 to try out immediately. With that all out of the way, here are a few tips I would recommend everybody who's going to try this game out to follow if they want to have a pleasant experience playing this game in the long run: - Always stay friendly to other players and don't act obnoxious or self-righteous to others. The name of the game is TEAM Fortress 2, meaning that in order to win, you need to work together as a team, and not go out there, thinking you can take the entire team on yourself, which will oftentimes lead to you getting killed over and over again. Communicate with your fellow team members over the situation and what you're planning to do, or regarding plans or tactics that the enemy team is using through the default Y normal in-game chat and U team members-only chat window buttons. Your team members will appreciate it if you're friendly, and will be much more likely to co-operate alongside with you towards completing the objective if you do so. Sure the game can get very hectic and is easy to get annoyed over a supposed 'cheap kill' from a enemy player, but overall try to maintain a friendly atmosphere in the game. - If nessecary, do offline training on maps that you're unfamiliar with, and explore the maps so you'll know the shortcuts and side routes into enemy territory. This is a key factor into becoming a more skilled player over time, as there are many side routes that are often easy to miss or not pay attention to that the developers of the maps implemented in order to balance the game and make it possible for a team to overcome the other if they're being pressured or having difficulty breaking through chokepoints. If the enemy team is spawncamping, try to take a different spawn exit and flank them from behind. If the main route into their base is heavily guarded, look for a alternate pathway to take and inform your teammates about it. - Play classes that suit the current situation. This is a common mistake that I see occuring alot on many servers I play on, as quite alot of players seem to not grasp the limits of a class and oftentimes like to stick to one class only just because they like playing as that certain class and refuse to play anything else that the team might benefit more at that specific point during the match. Players need to observe the situation and pick classes whose advantages are required at the time. To give a good example, payload is a match type in where the red team needs to defend the bomb from being delivered by the blue team, and as such will be spawn-camping right off the bat during the start of the match. Yet alot of times there tend to be about 2 or 3 Spy and/or Sniper players in a team of roughly 9 to 12 players on blue. Those 2 classes can only take out 1 enemy at a time normally, and will be killed easily. You'll need a strong offensive class like Heavy or Soldier to pressure and kill the enemy team, and if your team doesn't have a Medic, be one. Medic isn't a easy class, but your team members will benefit from the healing so they won't have to retreat to the supply closet often. Class diversity and good communication about class choices mid-game can go a long way in winning the match. Thanks for reading this, and hope it was insightful. I definetely recommend this game!

Fo srs Pros: Lots of variety for classes if you dont like playing a color swap military man with a different gun. One half of the community is nice and sees you with open arms(no homo) Art style is very good, Lots of community content for more variety with game modes isnt neccesarily pay to win, moreover its a "pay to get that medic to uber you and your fancy hat" MvM is good if you want to kill capitalist robits Cons: Other half of the community is a cesspool of rich s that will make fun of you for not spending 400,000 dollars on a hat with an orbiting benis spinning around it. Very demanding for a constant framerate. usually needs a config to get one. Pyros are F@ggots 4/5 Kill all the m2 pyros

review: Team Fortress 2 was one of the best games I had ever had the privilege to experience, a few years ago, of course. TF2 is no longer the unique, team-based game it used to be. It has been narrowed down to an unfair, unbalanced mess of "who has the shiniest pink hats on trade_minecraft," "how fast can you get kicked from every valve server because some stupid kids think it's their private achievement server." and "how to get outskilled by someone using a more broken, overpowered weapon/class." Team Fortress 2 also hosts one of the nastiest communities to date, right below Garry's Mod and DayZ. I guarentee you, every server you join, you will be greeted by several bronies and furries spamming lenny faces, stupid Shrek memes, and pootis. If you like getting penalized for simply playing the game, this is the one for you. If you're 10 and still think memes are funny, this is the one for you. If you like having an overall bad time, this is the one for you. Team Fortress 2 also suffers from a severe lack of content updates. Every few months that go by, they will add more cosmetics and taunts to ruin the game and community even further. They DO NOT add balanced maps or weapons. They DO NOT balance the current game mechanics such as pellet/damage spread and random crits. They DO NOT Penalize those who are literally unable to play the game at an acceptable level. For example, if you get a team full of idiots who installed Steam the previous day, they get to stay with their 300-700 ping, slimeball community avatars, and inability to speak English in English servers. They will also vote kick you. Usually selecting the "No reason given" option, for they cannot speak English. Overall, if you are really looking forward to making your day a bad one, play the steaming pile of  that is Team Fortress 2.

review: It's a war-based first-person shooter that ISN'T a bloody Modern Military Shooter (henceforth referred to as MMS). What's not to like? Granted, the game has become overtaken with hats. But I'd say that's one of the reasons Valve decided to make the game free-to-play. They've received enough money from it thus far, and they don't need to rely on the money from every purchase to keep the game going. Unlike most MMS games, this one isn't re-released every single year with 1 or 2 minor changes and with a new name slapped on it. This game undergoes, just like other Valve games (and a lot of other Steam games for that matter), perpetual evolution without the need to be re-released. Sure, it has no single-player campaign. But there's the Portal and Half-Life series of games for that. It's a varied game with plenty of game modes that all run on the same sort of infrastructure but are different in varying ways. It's a good game. I'd recommend it.

review: Team Fortress 2 is the best free-to-play first person shooter in the world today. It's pure free-to-play, which means that everything is available at the beginning. You don't have to spend money on this game, except when you want to trade or buy cosmetic items. So what is this game all about? Well, you play in team of 1 to 12 (or even more) players and you try to beat the other team. TF2 features several gamemodes, Capture Point and Payload for example, and 9 'classes'. Each class has it's own pros and cons, and can be used for specific tasks. For example, the Engineer is a great defender and the Scout is very effective in capture-based gamemodes. TF2 is very n00b-friendly, since the game features Offline Training against bots and tutorials, as well as the cop tower-defense gamemode Mann vs. Machine. TF2 is a relatively simple game, you don't require a lot of knowledge to be good at it. The game also has a large economy of items, which you get by playing or trading. These are pure cosmetic, except most weapons, and don't give you an advantage towards other players. Verdict -------- This game is very enjoyable and funny, it's very different compared to other FPS games. It features several awesome gamemodes and funny classes. Some of the cosmetics are really funny, you can hit people with a mackerel and candy for example. An awesome free-to-play shooter you should play today. Your friends will not see you outside for at least 100 hours. If you become a "TF2 Trader" you will spend at least 400 hours on this game. Score: 89/100

review: Best thing since sliced bread.. No, seriously. Fun in pubs and all, but once you start playing with others, talking, communicating, laying strats, executing them in the heat of battle, risking friendships ove petty discussions, Team Fortress 2 turns into more than just a cartoon shooter. I don't even see the cartoon any more, all I see is "overextended heavy, engineer is spy!, chokepoints and bombing soldiers"

review: A game that will not only get you addicted to hats, but also hyped up about bread. Team fortress is the king of free-to-play games. In this multiplayer video game filled with humor you can choose a team (RED/BLU). The goal in this first-person shooter is to beat the other team in 8 different official game modes (king of the hill, capture-the-flag, push-little-cart). While in a team you can select one of nine classes with each class having its strength and weakness making sure therell be a game style that will fit you. You can also play co-op where you team up with 6 people to kill robots. Besides these official game types there are many others created by the community(such as a medieval, prophunt, etc.). But even if you ever get bored with playing you can always hang out and start collecting hats by trading, reason why its often referred to as the number one hat-simulator. Before this game I myself wouldnt even have considered playing any cartoon-like games. Im glad someone converted me. Its a game that will not get you bored easily. But more importantly, its free, why shouldnt you give it a try at least? Even if this game has been out there for a while, its still being updated on a regular basis. New game modes and hats created by the developers and community are regularly being pushed forward and major events are happening at Halloween, Christmas and Easter. There is only one downside I can think of: its quite large in size. So make sure you have enough disk space.

review: Have you ever had the craving to buy a strange weapon then spend all day leveling it up so your friends think you are cool? Then this is the best game for you! First job, get a strange either by wasting your money on uncrating, crafting all your hard found weapons to buy a strange from the overpriced scumbags on Tf2.Outpost, or better yet be a scumbag yourself and scam a newcomer who has just had this misfortune to uncrate and give him/her a scrap for his/her recently unboxed strange. Step two, locate a strange level up sever don't worry they are very easy to find due to the sheer amount of people wanting to level up their stranges so badly. And final step go and kill some idle people on the strange level up sever. Now all your friends/eniemes will think next time you kill them WOW they got 16854972 kills in one day? Defiently didn't go on a strange level up sever. 10/10 Best game

I recommend any new person coming into tf2 to NOT focus on hats or the economy, most of you will and you WILL REGRET it. Just trust me, there is way to much price manipulation going on. And if you do get into hats DO NOT get into unusuals. They will make you question everything you've ever done. Just dont do it. Dont go to the hat side. Anyways, just based on the game (not hats) i'll give this game a 10/10 will swag again.

review: English Review Interesting free game for entertainment and fun. You might tell yourselves, it 's the same as the other actions games (shooting games), where you can play through servers with different players, by the choice of a hero etc. But TF2 has something very interesting (some improvements and special stuff). Selection of 9 heroes, while every of them is somehow specialized and has different inventory to choose. And every chosen unit has it 's own statistics. Unbelievable 500 achievements will get you and surprise you, meanwhile for comparing with other games it 's a big shot. Chance of gaining equipments to inventory of your warrior or any bonuses which are going to be very useful in the game. It 's important to point out that there is a possibility of playing as single player or cooperation or any other methods, but it's useless and needless. And about graphics  it can't be compared with current class, but if you're searching for relaxing and getting crazy, then TF2 is made for you. Fory ou, it will not lose its attraction. Rating: 8/10 Slovak Review Zaujmav free hra pre pobavenie a zbavu. Mono si poviete, e je to to ist ako in akn hry (strieaky), kde mte hra cez servery s inmi hrmi, vberom hera a podobne.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a fantastic multi-player online first person shooter with 9 classes that all have unique personalities. Each class uses a primary, secondary and melee weapon. The Heavy has the most health, takes a while to fire, but can do the most damage per second with no reloading, but he moves slowly. The soldier shoots rockets, has the 2nd most health and and is the 2nd slowest, but experienced players can rocket jump. The demoman is a defender, using stickybombs to lay traps and grenades to roll forward, he can sticky jump with some practice and can also be a proficient melee class. The Pyro is a defender, lighting enemies on fire, causing damage for an amount of time, air blasting projectiles away and bringing good cheer and derpiness to any team. Engineers build teleporters, sentry guns and dispensers to defend the team and keep them healthy and supplied with ammo. The spy is elusive and backstabs people while invisible cloaking or disguising himself. His sapper can also disable and destroy the engineer's buildings. The scout runs fast with a double jump and shotguns people, he also captures at twice the speed of anyone else. Snipers snipe from far away. Medics heal and make people invincible at times. As for the modes, there are traditional capture the flag, king of the hill and less traditional payload, where blue team will push a moving cart, while red team defends it. The more blue players next to the cart, the faster it will go. If a red player is next to the cart, it stops moving. It is a great dynamic that makes the game really stand out above the rest. There is also payload race, where two teams push their carts, and control points where the goal is to capture all of the points (3 or 5 points instead of just 1 like King of the Hill). Teams for both modes are mostly 12 vs 12. Each mode has quite a few maps and maps are continually added over time. The newest mode is Mann vs Machine, where six players take on wave after wave of robots. There is a free version of Mann vs Machine called Boot Camp and a non free version called Mann Up that costs a Tour of Duty Ticket ($1 in the store). The ticket gets used if you complete a MVM mission. If you don't complete a mission, or if you complete a mission you've already completed, then you keep the ticket. A Mann vs Machine tour is composed of several missions across a few maps. What do you get for completing a tour? A random strange weapon and a notch in your belt! The maps in Team Fortress 2 stand out for their paths, there isn't just one path through each map, but there are usually several routes to get around a herd of foes. There is a lot of joy and satisfaction flanking opponents and killing an entire team from behind. Sure this game is free to play, but there are a lot of things to buy for real money! Hats for $5, keys for $2.50. Keys are like legalized gambling, you buy a key to open a crate, if you don't get what you want, you can always use Steam trade to trade the item for something you do want or just use another key! There is a whole micro economy in the game with trading. The game will drop you weapons as you play, then you can craft two weapons together to make metal. 18 weapons will make you a refined metal. That's the basic free currency of the game. When you have three refine, you can craft them together for a random hat. Most people prefer to trade their refined for keys, but well refined metal will always generate from dropped weapons, keys will always cost $2.50. You can also buy and sell keys in the Steam market for Steam wallet money to buy Steam games. The items you pay for are cosmetic if not strange weapons that count your kills. So it is not pay to win, even though you can buy in game weapons, but every weapon is a side-grade, not an upgrade, with pros and cons to each weapon. Since this is a multi-player game, nothing will overpower you. It is all rock-paper-scissors. Heavy can kill anything, but a spy or sniper can take out a heavy. A pyro can easily take out a spy. Stuff like that. Team Fortress 2 is updated regularly and has implemented a lot of community created items, maps and Halloween events. The Halloween events feel pretty special, but for the most part, they're just Halloween versions of normal maps. The community items, while cool, seem to be mostly cosmetic items with a few new weapons. There have been community maps made and maps are always free to play on. It is an exceptional game. Diverse weapons, maps and it is buckets of fun and free to play!!!! FREE!!! You get weapons dropped to you over time or you can trade them. It is such a good game even if you're like me and hate multiplayer this is fun multiplayer! Or single player against bots! It is a must play for any fan of first person shooters. The game is smooth, the 9 characters and weapons are very balanced and very different. There is a diverse array of modes.

Maybe some people don't like animation-style graphics but apart from this questionable part, it is perfect multiplayer FPS game I ever played or heard about, highly recommended for all CS nerds tired of "The bomb has been planted"

review: Team Fortress 2 is quite a game with a history. Originally a pay-to-play game, Tf2 became free! Upon so the number of players skyrocketed. Team Fortress 2 is a game where Reliable Excavation Demolitions (RED) usually defends from onslaughts of Builders Leauge United (BLU). You, the player, are given the choice of 9 merchanaries. The fast, cocky and furious scout, the patriotic brawler soldier, the mysterious hellborn that is the pyro, the scumpy-drinking, one-eyed black cyclops demoman, the comical and brutually large heavy, the whimsical engineer, the funny german medic, the cool, calm and collected sniper and lastly the man who perfers brains over brawn, the spy. What makes this game so entertaining is that each of the 9 mercanaries that you can play as all have such a distinct personality, looks and playstyle. If you're a player who likes run-and-gun, Scout is for you. If you like big guns, Heavy calls your name. Stealth? Spy is already right behind you, waiting for you to play as him. Who can forget the loveable pyro who sets everything ablaze. This game is also very rewarding to both new and experienced player alike, as item drops are given not for getting a certain amount of kills, but for just playing the game! However if you want to truely experience the full greatness that is Tf2 I reccomend paying anywhere from 50 cents to $90 in the Mann Co. Store to get prenium so you can truely have a great feel for the game. However if money is tight or if you're not sure you'll enjoy this amazing game, you are not truely penalized for being a Free-to-Play, unlike most other games of this kind. Overall Team Fortress 2 is a great game that doesn't require a supercomputer, and I'd honestly reccomend this game to anybody who asks so.

review: TF2 has changed...It's no longer about skill, stealing intelligence, capture control points, fun or even hats. It's an endless series of taunting and dancing of conga, performed by players and bots. TF2 and its consumption of life, has become a well-feeding machine...TF2 has changed...Strange people carry strange weapons, use strange hats and mics. Servers control. Trading control. Statistic control. Everything is monitored and kept under control. The age of deterrence has become the age of control. TF2 has changed... When everything is under control, "fun"...becomes routine.

review: I can not recommend this game enough! I've played it for a really long time, and it has never even once become boring. There may not be many updates to it, and it's glitchy as hell, AND the developers don't care about it as much anymore than they used to, it still is an incredibly fun game that you can just jump in any time you want. It might be a bit hard to get in due to all of the different weapons, classes, stats and what not (tons of stuff to remember), but once you got into it, oh man. The community isn't that bad, either. Had worse experiences in Dota 2... *shivers*

review: After all these years, TF2 is still one of the most balanced and dynamic shooter games out there. The art style is a refreshing break from the usual quasi-realistic-grim-tactical asthtic of most other popular shooter games. The action is fast paced, there are always new stratagies to try, and this game is great with friends. Whats not to love?

review: TF2 has been out for over 6 years and it still hasn't gotten old. You know why? Because Valve will never keep it the same thanks to frequent game changing updates. If you like shooting people, you'll like it. If you like blowing people up, you'll like it. If you like hats, YOU WILL LOVE IT. Just get this game. There's no reason not to.

review: This review/rating can be divided into two sections pre/post F2P(June 23, 2011). It is very important to distinguish between these two because they are really two different games. Pre-F2P TF2 (10/10) - For the first few years of TF2's existence, the game managed to have an absolute killer dynamic with a great playerbase that relied heavily on teamwork and a great community fostered by Valve's friendliness to the modding community. Valve really worked with the community to create new scenarios, maps, and weapons these first few years that helped vastly improve the game. Post-F2P TF2 (5/10) - The easiest way to describe the state of the game today would be a male dress-up Barbie simulator. I don't fault Valve for trying to capitalize on a game that is at the time of this writing over 7 years old, but the best times for this game are now well past. There's just too many new hats and new weapons to choose from, from which the majority are useless. Sure there are still plenty of servers to play in, but the majority of the servers are devoid of players with skill, microphones, and teamwork. There's still a few fun servers (see the No-Heroes servers) but donating is about the only way you will be able to see the inside of one of these servers when its full. The only bright side is that Valve is still adding new content with multiple updates a year.

Then a rich bourbon sauce is poured over them before serving. This is a fabulous recipe that my Mother gave me from a upscale restaurant in New York. It is to die for. ENJOY!! 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans 1/2 cup dry bread crumbs 8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves 1/4 cup clarified butter, melted 1/4 cup Dijon mustard 1/4 cup dark brown sugar 2 2/3 tablespoons bourbon whiskey 2 tablespoons soy sauce 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce 3/4 cup unsalted butter, chilled and cut into small cubes 1/2 cup sliced green onions Stir together the pecans, bread crumbs, and 2 tablespoons of clarified butter. Spread the mixture out on a plate. Press the chicken breasts into the mixture to coat on both sides. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of clarified butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place the coated chicken breasts in the pan, and fry on both sides until nicely browned and chicken meat is cooked through, about 10 minutes per side. In a small saucepan, whisk together the Dijon mustard, brown sugar, bourbon, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce until smooth. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat, then remove from the burner, and whisk in the 3/4 cup of unsalted butter one piece at a time. Do not return to the heat. Arrange the chicken breasts on a large serving plate. Pour the sauce over the chicken, and sprinkle with green onion.

review: Ever since I bought this game, I have never put thought into doing a completly honest review. If you want to take a few minutes from your time, you can listen to my storyThe first time I played this, was around late december 2007 on my brothers old windows vista computer. It didnt have much on it; weapons, hats, unusauls, etc...I'd played it a few times over at friend's houses and watched it change. New gamemodes, servers, weapons, etc...and how that all Changed the gameplay balance. I didn't get my own steam till about 3 years ago, and I was only going to use it for garry's mod. Then I decided oh what the hell, I guess I'll download tf2 since it's free. I'd been playing it on the xbox 360 for about a year then (by the way it sucks on that.) And I remember my first game, feeling sweetness as I got an insane killstreak on 2fort...like 50 something kills in less than 7 minutes. I hadn't been using steam much at the time, but around late August 2012, I'd really started to get into things. I found out about trading, and the tf2 economy, and getting cool hats for your characters, and the new mvm update which I mainly play right now. Then, when my friend told me about unusuals in tf2, everything ing changed. In late december 2012, i was doing everything I could to get one of these so claimed unusuals. They had these like cool particle effect thingys coming out of them. Finally, from the help of a steam buddy of mine, I was able to get one. The very first unusual I owned was a steaming handyman's handle. Now I know you're thinking, "haha a 10 key hat? So what?" But at the time, I didn't care if it was worth jack squat. It just felt so good to have that thingy with steam emmitting out of it. Then soon after that I got earbuds, and a bills hat, and some strange festives. And then, around my sprnig break in 2013, I got scammed out of my unusual. My only unusual...And the guy who did it, I wanted to ing rip his head off I hated him so much. I will give his name out: balestorm1, although he's been offline for over a year now. He's a really interesting guy, Did a scamming spree of like 6 unusual hats. Back to my story now. After that I traded my earbuds for a second unusual hat. A stormy pith helm for solly. It looked pretty cool as well, I then started trading up to make profit, and by early summer 2013, I already had about $1000 worth of items. A whole summer went by dedicated towards making profit and spending more of my money on unusuals/stranges, etc...but after reaching what seemed like my full mental capacity for trading, I started to feel sad, and lonely, and withdrawn from the everthing else (I'm not kidding.) I decided I should probably cash out of tf2 to get money and such for it all. I did end up getting around 500 u.s. dollars via paypal, but I still had a whole bunch of . After doing that...I traded towards an awesome burning Dapper's for soldier of which i favorited, then i traded and traded till in finally decided to spycrab what was primarily left of my backpack. Not alot, but something. ~4 buds worth of  I lost in multiple spycrabs on the MCT/Pink Taco's trading server. During all that, I was also taking a long break from tf2 as well going into several gmod communities, I even made my own server with a buddy of mine. That is a different story though. All the trading has put aside a focus for the core gameplay. I feel like this is how it is for many others who play this game as well. Several updates ago, I was getting really pissed at the game, and with this new Love and War, or Bread and Conga (lol not) update, It really pissed me off for multiple reasons. And for like the 6th time, I said "I'M DONE WITH TF2. I'M NEVER PLAYING THIS  OF A GAME AGAIN." But here I am, amidst all this chaos...Standing strong I prevail through all of this. I know, no matter what, this game, with it's mystery will be my all time favorite video game.

review: TF2 is a casual free to play first person shooter. On its own, that doesn't really translate to much, but with a wide variety of game modes, incredibly high skill-cap, and diverse classes with a variety of weapons to cater to a large amount of playstyles, TF2 does stand out as being a cut above the rest. Balancing unfortunately, isn't as strong as it could be and there are a few legitimately overpowered weapons, and not all classes are equal in usefulness. However, with the lack of cash shop based game stats, and the default weapons generally being the most versatile and reliable in the game, on top of the skill-caps of the classes; Keeping in mind the casual nature of the game, any issue with balance is minor enough that it can be worked around through player skill and team-coordination. Their business model only requires a single item to be purchased from the in-game store--or to be gifted a premium upgrade package--at which point, any cosmetic weapon, or upgrade can be found through playing the game, crafted, or purchased through in-game resources. It's a very fair game, with one of the best free to play models in the market. The primary difficulty you'll find with the game is starting it. With a lackluster tutorial, un-cordinated public games, and little assistance in the relatively deep tactics and game mechanics for the various classes, it can be hard to become skilled enough to coordinate in solo-play. Playing with friends, and doing some research into the game is highly recommended, as TF2 won't do it for you. TF2, on it's own is highly mod-friendly, and has a variety of community made servers running custom game modes. With a bit of searching, you can find hangouts, mini-games, training servers, custom maps, unofficial weapons, and the like. On top of the official game, and fairly friendly community, it's not especially difficult to get hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of the game without any issues, or requirements to invest money. It has its problems, but ultimately they are minor. What TF2 offers is a rich FPS experience, with enough community support to satisfy a variety of tastes. So I have no issues recommending this game to any FPS fan looking for a team-focused, objective based shooter.

review: This game used to be fun. Team Fortress 2 used to have the friendliest community, where people would help eachother learn how to rocket jump and give an Engineer tips on Sentry placement. Now its got hordes of lime green and pink Scouts running in, killing everything that moves, and putting "git gud scrub" in chat with a keybind. This game used to be fun. For some it may still be fun to play, for others its a way to pass the time, and some people only still play because it has become routine to do so. And for many the in-game economy has actually become a job, a business, even if they don't work for Valve or any other software developer. If Valve were to remove metal and cosmetics entirely, many people would lose hundreds or thousands of dollars. This isn't even a game anymore. People who play TF2 say that many aspects of this game need fixing. "Why would you nerf the Heavy and not the Demman?" I would say that the whole thing needs fixing. Specifically the community. This game used to be fun. The community used to be fun to be a part of. A few months ago it has become just as bad as the Call of Duty fanbase and community. You may still find it fun to play this game. You may somehow find the patience to deal with another toxic community. My patience is shot, I can deal with no more. If any of you need me, I'll be playing a single player game. I can actually play those without being told "git gud, noob" or "get rekt, scrub" after every death. The NPCs of a Singleplayer game like Fallout or Metro are certainly friendlier than the real people who play Team Fortress 2. EDIT: After about two months to think, I believe I've put too much into this game to simply give it up entirely. I believe I've found a little sub-community that's still got the kindness I missed. My opinion still stands, as there are a multitude of sub-communities that promote behavior like this in exchange for donations. Looking at you, Saigns and NighTeam and your pay to win admin slots. I've also found a way to make sure that I don't get hit by phisher and scam bots. Play with the community that I trust, and stay away from quickplay. Every friend request I get now, I also tell them to prove to me that they aren't a bot.

review: Hat Simulator 2: Hat harder, what can I say about it that hasn't been said already? It's fun, it's free, it's got cool stuff that is seriously underplayed, and the classes and asthetic are nearly timeless. But, you've heard that a thousand times. What of the meat and bones? The mechanics that everything is built on? Gotta say, hella good. The interplay of a lot of slightly different weapons and the drastically different classes combines well with the objective focus, but more importantly it makes you ask yourself silly questions. Like, "what if I ran a melee medic?" "or a melee heavy?" "What could make this more fun to play?" It is a great game, with great appeal, but most importantly the mechanics are fun. Plus who could argue with the price? Now if they would just do more with the magic spells, and medieval mode, and the bosses, then I would have no complaints.

review: A great first person shooter with comic look and interesting weapons and a creative and big community. In the first hundred hours you learn to play the game on regular servers, find new weapons you will test (and recognize that not always more damge = better) Enough of these matches? How about a bit coop mann vs. machine? You can upgrade the weapons you learned to love and kill waves of robots with some friends or other TF2 players you can make bonds with. I still have a lot of the players I met as friends on my friendlist. Done more than enough of these two? But wait, there is more. Have fun with community made mods like Zombie Fortress, Versus Saxton Hale, Parcour Fortress, Death Run...there is so more to find. You got that good that the public servers are starting to bore you? Get into competetive and meet highly skilled players along your way. Build a team and learn how strong the team aspect of Team Fortress really can be. Want some special items? There is a whole big community based on trading in TF2. Look around and you'll find players trading the stuff you want to have. (Please inform yourself about what items are worth before starting to trade; many items you find may not be as valuable as some items you want; AND DON'T TRADE AWAY UNUSUALS FOR ANY WEAPONS, EVERY UNUSUAL IS WORTH MORE THAN 1000 WEAPONS, NO MATTER WHICH WEAPONS; I warned you) All in all, great game, many possibilities and a lot the community has to offer.

review: The best hat simulator to date - this game features a large assortment of headgear and other wearables in a variety of styles and colours. With the ability to trade, purchase and stash away pixels in a virtual backpack, you can finally feel comfortable knowing that you've wasted your life. And once you have completed your worthless collection of wearable items, you can show them off to other pathetic losers in-game. You can also express your poor creativity by naming, describing and painting your items with a large array of bland, depresssing colours. Become a true jew by repeatedly attempting to make miniscule profit off of hour-long trades! Oh, and you can also shoot stuff. A must-buy for all basement dwellers and fat losers; 10/10.

review: I doubt anybody really needs to be told why to try Team Fortress 2, especially with its reputation and lack of a price tag, but I suppose I should throw my 2 cents in anyway. Team Fortress 2 is a fun game that gives you fun options in how you want to play. You get 9 classes to toy with, each having an interesting personality and a unique playstyle. Then, as you play, you'll come across weapons that let you experiment within each class's playstyle. The more you play, the more stuff you amass, and the more options you'll have at your disposal. If you haven't already, take a dip into the world of Team Fortress 2. You're almost guaranteed to find something you like!

I can't enjoy the sounds of my character's pained screams because of the squeakers constantly violating my ears.

review: Hat fortress 2, oh sorry Team Fortress 2, is a multiplayer fps focusing on cooperating with your allies to complete objectives or stop the other team from completing theirs. At your arsenal you have 9 unique classes with hundreds of weapons of your choosing. You find "random drops" in form of weapons as you play, allowing you to try out new weapons and eventually finding your favourite combos. Unlike other popular fps games, TF2 focus on advancing with your team and fill in for your allied classes weaknesses. While a heavy class have great damage output, his slowness makes him a sitting duck. A medic class can keep him alive and together advance into enemy territory to do damage. In another example, an engineer class can setup a small base for allies to heal, refill ammo and have a few seconds of not being fired upon. Against a demolition class like soldier or demoman, he can just watch as his buildings are wrecked, however with the support of a pyro, their explosives can be turned against them. Some weapons are even specifically made to support another class in battle. The real gem of TF2 is however it's crazy customization. You can equip all kinds of hats, clothes and other miscs, making your classes stand out. And not only that, TF2 even got a huge economy, with thousands of other players involved into. Trade a weapon or a hat with a friend, profit on selling your rare misc or simply hoard it all! It's all up to you Pros: Crazy fun gameplay, badass costimization, hilarious voice acting, huge economy and one of the longest surviving fpses on the market. oh and FREE Cons: To avoid having to play for tons of hours to try out all weapons, the in-game store sells extremly overpriced items. Trading however enables you to get everything cheaper but new players will have trouble with this. To make your items tradable, you are required to buy a premium upgrade (which you can by buying the cheapest item in the store so not too expensive)

review: Team Fortress 2 is really fun multyplayer game. There are 9 classes and all of them have balance, like heavy has a lot of health but he is really slow and really big target on the battlefield, sniper is verry good at long range but he is verry weak in close range, pyro is verry good at close range but weak at long range, ect. In tf2 there are weapons that you can get by random drop, buy them from mann co. store, craft them or trade them. All weapons have balance, no weapons are OP,if there is a op weapon it's going to get a nerf, they have good sides and bad sides, like frontier justice: you gain revenge crits but you have no random critical hits and smaller clip size, tomislav (minigun) has faster spin up time but has slower fireing speed. In tf2 there is so mutch teamwork, one team is probably going to lose if they have only one class on a team or if they don't have a medic or if they have 6 snipers and no engineers to defend. Overall this game is great and it's free, so if you are reading this on computer that you own, why don't you download the game. BTW sorry for my English ;)

review: You can't go wrong with this title. Not only is it fun, but it is ridiculously varied. Valve has worked on this game with additions and fixes since its launch, so it has undergone a lot of changes, and it barely resembles what it was when it first launched. If you get into it now, sadly you're probably going to have a hard time understanding what's going on under all that cluster of weapons, hats and whatnot, but even though it became such a chaotic mess, Team Fortress 2 remains my favorite Team-based FPS of all time. You have lots of options with every class thanks to the sheer number of weapons available to them. Each one is balanced and focused on a specific role, so you're bound to find one that fits your gameplay preferences like a glove. Don't like being an useless sniper who stands way back, away from the action? Fine, get up close and go with a bow. Your team needs a strong offense in order to fend off enemy attacks, and you're playing as a Medic? Switch from the normal Medigun which confers limited invincibility to a Kritzkrieg for guaranteed crits, no problem. Are you so pro with your aim that you feel disgusted using the stock Rocket Launcher as a Soldier or Grenade Launcher as a Demoman? No problemo, use the Direct Hit or Loch'n'Load to show off your mad skillz and deal more damage as a result of your prowess. Do you love being a soldier, but feel a glorious desire to help your team with temporary buffs? Okay, give up your shotgun and go with a Buff Banner, Concheror or Battalion's Backup so you can help everyone push with increased damage, increased speed or increased defense, depending on your equipment of choice. There are a lot of options available to you. It's simply amazing what this game offers. Plus, since it became F2P, there is no reason not to try it. Get it now!

review: you want a review? well even if you didn't I'm giving you one anyways. TF2 is not like most FPS games, let alone one that is free to play. TF2 is the sequel to a game known as team fortress classic, a mod using the unreal tournament engine. blah blah blah historical stuff I prolly got wrong. ANYWAYS: TF2 is quite simply an amazing game, with 9 different classes, each with their own unique roles in a successful match. 1. scout: he runs fast, capping intel, capping control points, and pushing the bomb cart with the power of 2 people! warning, since he runs so fast and has a double jump, allowing for high evasiveness, hes also pretty squishy, having a measly 125 base health. 2. soldier: soldier is a powerhouse, holding 200 base health and a rocket launcher that deals splash damage to multiple enemies. his rocket jumping ability (though this takes a LOT of practice to fully master) can get him to the point even faster than a scout! 3. pyro: the most controversial class, having 175 base health, medium-paced walking speed, and a short-ranged based primary (the flamethrower), pyro can be seen as the weakest class. while most newbies would complain to him being an overpowered fire demon here to eat your babies, they really just don't know how easy it is to counter her. (ONE SECOND THOUGH: PYRO CAN AIRBLAST PROJECTILES AND EXTINGUISH BURNING TEAMMATES BY USING M2, OR MOUSE 2). 4. demoman: arguably the most powerful class in the game, demoman is here to bring diversity to the game. (y'know, because hes scottish). anyways, demoman, while having the same 175 health as pyro, has one distinct advantage: the stickybomb launcher. this bad boy does 60 damage per sticky, meaning that spamming it on a public game makes you a bad player that should go back to playing minecraft and the hundredth jumpscare game pewdiepie just played. 5. heavy: also considered one of the weakest in the game (especially without a medic latched onto him 24/7) heavy is the mascot for TF2. this bald, bear wrestling, russian giant shows none of his ruthlessness in the game, but rather the comics (which even then he realy kind of doesn't). heavy has 300 health! "wow!" you must think, until you learn his disadvantages. he is the slowest and has the largest hitbox in the game, making him easy to pick off from afar. 6. medic: oh boy. medic is the second fastest class in the game, just after scout. he also has 150 base health.your CoD-washed mind might think "hey wheres his souper smg ding?" well thats because TF2's medic is actually here for healing. sure, he has a syringe gun (which is basically a flamethrower without afterburn) but no sane medic would rush into a fight like that, as he'd die near instantly. (each class has their own way of dealing 100+ damage in one shot, though this is mostly up to crits/ actual skill). instead, medic uses his medigun, a long, black, healing device that can patch up your teammate's wounds in seconds! plus, when you have full "ubercharge" you can either have increased healing, full invincibility, 100% chance of everything your teammate does being a critical hit, or a tiny uber that increases your resistance to a certain type of attack, and gives you health for the damage the person you're healing recieves. 7. engineer: engineer builds sentries, dispencers, and teleporters. sentries will guard an area, sitting in place waiting for some unsuspecting scout to run in and get blasted away by tons of bullets (and rockets when your sentry reaches max level). dispencers health and provide ammo for you and your teammates. teleporters are capable of sending your teammates from one side of the map to the other, however, all these buildings require a lot of care, as they are susceptable to many attacks, and will do no damage to stock ubers (the kind that grants full invincibility). and since you'll probably be taking care of your buildings and aimbot, engineer only has 125 health. 8. sniper: sniper, if played right, can outdamage demoman! even though sniper only has 125 health, he has the longest range out of every class, what with a sniper rifle and all. sniper is the one of the only classes that can kill a fully overhealed heavy in less than 3 seconds. the sniper rifle isn't like most sniper rifles in other games. having good aim is essential to playing sniper, as his main source of damage is getting headshots, otherwise he'll normally do only 50 damage. 9. spy: spy is a real sneaky rat. he can diguise as any class, sap buildings (turning them off and eventually destroying them unless the engineer hits and breaks the sapper), his main "deal" is that he can "backstab" enemies. backstabbing someone is always an instant kill, with only for a few exceptions. TF2 is a great game, and I suggest you look into it.

Despite unpaid efforts from the community creators for a year. A new gamemode with grappling hooks and 9 modifiers is okay though, because Valve. Fundamental changes to classes that have existed in a thriving game for 7 years, because apparently they were the reason this game went downhill. Also, gimmick weapons that seek to support the handicapped players. Danger Shield still in. Minisentry is still broken.  you, Valve.

review: Short Review: Go And ing Download It Long Review: Team Fortress 2 is definantly the best Free to Play game out there. There are so many different game types in TF2 from CTF,Mann vs Machine and even the Hidden. You can get any weapon by crafting,trading or finding, without using real money. Although you are limited to a short backpack space as you start off, you can easily purchase a 10c item to upgrade to premium and get heaps more spaces. Even though being released 7 years ago there is always an update around the corner. One of the best things about TF2 is that if you get an item which is festive,vintage, strange,genuine, collectors and more you can sell it on the steam market and get real steam credit. I know I have got a a lot of moeny from selling my items, some people even get 500 of steam credit, by selling a rare/awesome item. I can`t possibly list all the things you can do in TF2, but overall Team Fortress 2 is the best game ever, it even beats all my paid games. :)

review: First off, I want to start by saying that I have had quite a lot of experience with this game, and all the different mechanics in it, which make it very interesting. TF2 really isn't just your ordinary shoot-and-run game, it has much more to it than just aiming a gun and pressing M1. The classes are what really make the game stand out of the crowd. Classes are divided in to three different types, offensive classes, defensive classes and support classes. I'm going to go through all of the different classes and their purposes in the game. OFFENSIVE CLASSES: The Scout: He's fast and effective at doing objectives. Double jumps and speed make him move quite unexpectedly. He might be fast and do good damage, but he is quite weak. Equipped with a scattergun, a pistol, and a baseball bat. The Soldier: He's slow, but deals quite a big splash damage with his rockets. He has quite a lot of health so he can take quite big hits as well. Equipped with a rocket launcher, a shotgun, and a shovel. The Pyro: It's quite self explanatory with the name. Pyro does a lot of damage with it's close range flame thrower, and can also airblast enemy projectiles (rockets, grenades, sticky bombs). Equipped with a flame thrower, a shotgun and a fire axe (ironically) DEFENSIVE CLASSES: The Demoman: He is a drunk black scottish man with one eye. Demoman is the class who uses explosives, much like the Soldier. He can also take a big hit, but not as well as the Soldier. Equipped with a grenade launcher, a stickybomb launcher (the bombs stick to walls, and are detonatable) and a bottle. The Heavy: A big man, with a big gun and a big Russian accent. He's the most tanky class in the game, and has a freaking minigun. Be wary though, he is very slow, and usually depends on having a Medic. Equipped with a freakin' minigun, a shotgun and his bare freakin' fists. You really wouldn't want to mess with him. The Engineer: He's one of the more unique classes in the game, he can build an automatic sentry gun that shoots at enemies, a dispenser which gives him and teammates health and ammo and a teleporter to get your comrades faster to the frontlines. When an engineer is good, it is a game changer definitely. Equipped with a shotgun, a pistol, a wrench and a construction- and destruction PDA. SUPPORT CLASSES: The Medic: He's the one who is responsible of keeping the whole team alive, and you should definitely protect him. He's a german doctor, who might be a bit on the crazy side... Equipped with syringe gun (ouch), a medi gun (a gun that is used to put a healing beam on your teammates) and a bonesaw. The Sniper: He can quite easily pin down key enemy targets like heavies from a long distance, but is also quite weak, and vulnerable to Spies. This Australian man is effective in long range, but starts to get less effective when in close range combat, since the Sniper doesn't have much health. Equipped with a sniper rifle, an SMG, and a kukri. The Spy: A lady killer (figuratively) and a man killer (literally). The spy is a stealth class who can get behind enemies, turn invisible, disguise as other players, disable and destroy Engineer buildings and effectively kill unaware enemies with one stab in the back. Definitely one of the more interesting classes. Equipped with a revolver, a butterfly knife, a disguise kit, an invisibility watch and a sapper. I would also like to point out that this game has had an unusually long lifespan! It's been over 7 years since the release of the game, and people still play this actively! Although the economy has went down the shitter. I was thinking of typing about the different types of unlockable weapons in the game, but this is already a really long review in itself, so I'll let you guys look into them yourselves. If you want to play an FPS-shooter that's out of the norm, TF2 would definitely be something I would recommend. It's free and fun. Phewh. It's been quite a job writing all this. Lastly I would like to state that this is my favourite game of all time, and I hope you guys found this review interesting and or helpful! Go out and play this awesome game (for free). Peace.

review: Though my actual in-game hours is closer to 600 hours, Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is one of the best first-person shooters of all time. Feeling the need to just fool around? TF2 is hilariously comical. Feeling the need to play competitively? TF2 has a very high skill cap. Feel the need for variety? TF2 has mounds of variety. Verdict: Team Fortress 2 is a game where just when you think you have had enough of it, it lures you back in and leaves you thinking, "man, I totally love this game."

review: Team Fortress 2 is a unique game in many respects, first and foremost being just how much (and for how long) it's been updated. While it's only recently gone Free, Valve has been supporting the title for years with rather significant content additions, and game-breaking bugs tend to get squashed within hours or days, rather then the months that some other companies take with even their flagship titles. It's also interesting in the fact that you don't actually have to be a living god at first-person shooters to do well or support your team. The Engineer and Medic help their allies out with their buildings and healing abilities, and the hundreds of items available can change any of the classes' capabilities significantly. And, of course, the game is infamous for it's cosmetic items, such as the hats, which don't typically provide any real bonus but do allow you to customize your character further. You have to play this game. And if you're on Steam, you already own it!

review: THE GOOD Team Fortress 2 is not your ordinary game. Focusing on its cartoony graphics, offbeat humor and wide variety of game modes and player classes, but it will definitely put some people off. If you're a person who likes team-based multiplayer first-person-shooter video games, I think this game is for you. The sound in the game is exciting overall together with the visuals. It's a perfect game. You are always updated with new incredible releases. Last but not very least, a very fun and unique shooter with cool mechanics and great teamplay is totally free to play. THE GREAT The game can be addictive and challenging if you let it. The game is very fun, with different characters and balanced. One of the best Games of all time for sure. People who call this game or boring don't know much about shooters to be honest. Each class is a really funny, cool and interesting character with an unique and awesome personality. You're not running around with an AK47 or M16, but with Syringe Guns and Sticky Bombs, it's quite hilarious. Not to mention its great item-drop system, an amazing fanbase and the community, they are the perks which keep the players from all over the world to play this game. THE UGLY There is no serious gameplay whatsoever. If the developers wanted players to have a real serious gameplay, they would have made an in-game system where players get penalized for quitting the game before the match ends. Face the facts: You can disconnect the current game any time you like even in MVM matches. Perhaps for dynamic joining and disconnecting of players of the current match, but it can be frustrating when you spend the whole damn match without stable players. Gameplay Most Team Fortress 2 game modes have 2 opposing teams, the Reliable Excavation & Demolition (RED) and the Builders League United (BLU), that compete against each other in various maps to complete certain objectives. Some game modes include: Capture the Flag: Each team attempts to steal the opposing teams intelligence briefcase from their headquarters and secure it back at their own base.

review: This is supposed to be a review for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Dedicated Server. Apparently that's not a game. I should have known. Not only can I not play the dedicated server like it is a game, I can't review it like one either. Let me save you some time. Do not try to play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Dedicated Server! It is not a game! If you want a comparable non-game, open the command prompt. That will save you so much downloading. It's like you have to download all the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive content, but only get to access it through command prompt. Why? Sure sure, other people can play the game on your computer because you're running a "Server" but all I get is words in a black box. Who needs that? Certainly not me! Getting shot repeatedly in Team Fortress 2 is much better. I would encourage you to play Team Fortress 2 over something like Command Prompt Simulator for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

review: I have to thank Team Fortress 2 for leading me for several thousand hours of gaming throughout the years. I love all the friends I made along the way aswell, but something changed in tf2. The community has nearly been abandoned by all the "old" players leaving behind a community that comes off as toxic. TF2 used to be my favorite game while update and update have many asking what's the deal with all these let downs, VALVe has started giving TF2 the short end of the stick as CS:GO and DOTA 2 take the spotlight. As TF2 and the community is right now I don't recommend getting into it anymore, both the game and the community are now a drag.

review: I'm playing TF2 since 2010 and still enjoy it. First of all one most important thing about it: it's 10x more fun when you play with friends. Here's my top 10 reasons why I love that game: 1 You don't need to be great at multiplayer FPS games (CS, Quake 3, UT etc.) to be good at TF2, of course skill, reaction and good aim helps, but as long as you know your role and if you're playing it smart you're gonna be just fine and there's always something you can figure out or learn to turn things to your advantage. 2 It has one of the best and most hilarious characters with hundreds of lines and a lot of space for random accidents that make me lol really hard even after playing it for three years. The humor in this game is great and it never gets old. 3 A well crafted balance between teams and classes and really great maps. Unlike most games with good balance this one doesn't make you feel underpowered and pressured to be a real pro or die as a noob in shame (I'm looking at you Starcraft), when you start to do things right you start to feel how powerful your class is, that feel that by doing simple things you're supposed to do is bringing the glorious victory of your team closer every passing second is priceless. 4 Complexity in simplicity: each class has a simple purpose and just few simple tools to accomplish it. The complex gameplay of TF2 is made of very simple concepts, like "rocket launchers hurt people", "if you get an ubercharge you can use it and make yourself and the guy you're healing invulnerable and push through heavy resistance", "airblast - alternate fire of your flame thrower, is pushing things away, players, rockets and even arrows, also it extinguishes allies and saves them from burning to death", "spies may look like one of your teammates, but act suspiciously, smack their face with your wrench" and one more simple thing most new players are having a hard time to figur out for some reason: "engies can actually help other engies to build and defend!" 5 there are no weak or powerful weapons, most weapons are the same as your default weapons except they are slightly better in something and a bit worse in other thing. You don't need to know the entire arsenal of the game, you just need to find the weapons that are most appealing to your playstile. Also there are a few weapons change the way you play, like engie's gunslinger, you can't build big fat and mean sentries, you build a small mini-sentry, however equipping that thing gives you HP boost, and makes you a mobile obnoxious prick who runs around and builds and instantly deploys those annoying mini sentries whenever he feels like. 6 Most items are cosmetic, that means you don't need to have any hats, high level or money spent in game's store to be effective, some weapons that will amplify your strong traits would be a good addition though and those are very easy to get. Also despite those cosmetic items thanks to the good character design all classes are very distinguishable, you always know what to expect from a fat guy with a minigun and you always know you should kill the dude in white coat because he heals others. Still you can get some cosmetic items and look badass or funny. 7 The game is constantly updated, every now and then you get new maps, modes, bug fixes, balance fixes, weapons and cosmetics. Sadly Valve gets more lazy and greedy with each new major update and makes more hats rather than real content. 8 They got it right with graphics. I remember playing other modern FPS games and that was terrible! All those "eye candy" effects, strong contrasts, "cinematic" camera movement, "realistic shaders/lighting/effects, poor character design and "spectacular" explosions were very distracting and were making it really hard to tell what's going on before it would be too late. 9 It's all about teamplay and mission goal rather than killcount and skill. A team of average players who help each other will always be stronger than a team of disorganized show-offs with mad skillz who play their favorite class even when the team needs a medic and engie and don't care about anything but their killcount. 10 Valve puts a lot of effort each year to make the Haloween event in TF2 very VERY awesome. However there are things I don't like in TF2: 1 Community. LOTS of obnoxious kids, trolls, pretentious jerks and total s. 2 Trading. I hate it, I really-really hate it. 3 Painfully stupid people. This game introduced me levels of stupidity I couldn't even imagine. 4 Bugs. There are some really annoying gameplay and performance issues with the game and Valve pretends really hard that everything is cool. 5 Cheaters. Sometimes there will be some  who will ruin everyone's game by flying through walls and spawncamping with 100% accuracy and 100% crits. However there are some guys who use not so obvious hacks and claim they knew where you were and hit you from an impossible angle and distance for ten times in a row just because they are so good at this game and you're a stupid butthurt noob. 6 Server customization. Finding a server that has good ping, vote menu enabled, good map list and doesn't have custom music, idiotic settings like instant respawn, ads or other  are very hard to come by. Hope this was helpful.

review: TF2 is a good game, it is fun in many aspects like characters, voices, hats, maps, etc Nowadays i just play this game to jump around everything and have some fun in community gamemodes like Deathrun, surf, parkour and fun servers. Over the years the gameplay of the game has changed, valve keeps doing small changes everytime, combining those changes the gameplay experience is not the same in my opinion, i think was more fun and attractive when i played the game for the 1st time, small changes like not being able to take your buildings in you hand to the spawn, the distinction between the rocket launcher and the rocket jumper, small changes to weapons... made me abandon most of the competitive gamemodes from valve. The only valve gamemode that sometimes i play is MvM and it is getting more bugged whenever a big update is released and its matching system sucks. Valve added so many hats that i don't even care about them anymore, i'm fine with my old hats. I still recommend this game but not as much as i did before.

review: Team Fortress 2 is one of the best free to play games out there with thousands, maybe millions of players on right now playing. it is really fun and 7 different classes to keep you ocuppied. there is scout class: fast and can double jump, has a very powerful shotgun that can kill an enemy with almost 2 shots. there is a soldier class, has a RPG, very power for taking out large groups of people or destroying sentry guns from long distances. there is a pyro class, has a flamethrower, good for burning large groups of people together and good for taking out surpport classes, spies, snipers and medics are easy to kill unless they have backup. there is a heavy. good for leading the way and taking out lots and lots of enemies at once, even harder to kill with a medic assisting them and healing them, unstoppable when the ubercharger is ready and activates and thats when the heavy is at its best, has a big gun and loves it like his own son. there is a demoman, has a grenade launcher and sticky bomb launcher, lays sticky grenades near doors and waits for a enemy to come through and blows them up which pisses some people off sometimes, their grenade launcher is good for corners and hitting the enemies beside the corner and taking them out, unlocks a sword and can charge at enemies and can kill them with one shot unless its a heavy. there is a engineer which its main weapon is the shotgun and of course its mechanical tools to help kill the enemies, the engineer can make teleporters; entrance and exit point, a dispencer, heals him and friends, and a sentry gun which kills and protects a certain area placed in, has a limited sight and cannot shoot from far distances, all the things can be upgraded to level 3 which is the last and best levels. there is a spy, has a pistol and knife to backstab enemies quickly and quietly, the spy is a quiet and sneaky basterd that pisses off the enemies so they rage quit the game so the friends get a better advantege in life and make their job easier. the spy can go invisable and hide from enemies to help make them live longer and hide from enemies who caught them backstabbing their friends and want payback. the spy can sap the engineers teleporters; both, dispencer and the sentry. the medic has a needle gun and a ubercharger that heals friends. the medic is very important in helping the offensive time. if medic and heavy combine and the ubercharger is ready they are invincible and not a force to be reckened with. the medic and shoot needles at enemies and when the needles hit the enemies the medic gets 2 health back for every hit. the medic gets 2 hp per second as a medic and which no class can do that. special ability is to ubercharge and be unstoppable for a short amount of time. and finally the sniper. the snipers main gun is the sniper rifle, its his best weapon and takes out enemies from a far and safe distance one at a time. he a sub-machine gun and is his secondary weapon for medium range combat. his machette is for close combat situations if a spy tries to take him out or tries to run away or a enemy comes and it becomes a close combat round. the sniper gains focus whenever he keeps his scope in for along time and deals more damage. his machette is a powerful weapon and can kill a spy and a scout in 2 hits, other classes 3 to 5 hits at least. thats all the classes ive covered. the maps are amazing and highly detailed, and new maps coming in from the community every month. new guns being made, skins and character customization to personalise your own class to make u unique and one of a kind. new abilities for classes and more to come, stuff to buy at the tf2 store (man.co) is what its called, i think its highly over priced but if u dont have a thing and u want it bad, go to the store and buy it (dont recommend that when u could just keep playing and wait to unlock it the hard way i better most of the time) ok thats covers tf2, hope u like my review and please rate it. i give Team Fortress 2 9/10 from: arcade

review: Team Fortress 2 is a fun, quite addicting FPS multiplayer game. You can play as 9 different classes, including Demoman, Medic, Heavy, Soldier, Pyro, Engineer, Spy, Sniper, and my favorite, Scout. Each class has their different strengths and weaknesses, and their colorful personalities will keep you laughing while you play. With its fun characters, cool unlockable items, detailed maps, and the fact that its FREE, I would definitely give it a 10/10.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a very decent racing game. First of, the vehicles in this game are somewhat strange. Instead of licensed vehicles we get stuff like Heavy, Soldier, and Scout. The vehicles are all different in their own rights, for example: the Heavy is the slowest, the Scout is the fastest, and the Medic is normal speed. Classes in this game seem to be slightly broken, however. The Medic class vehicle is near useless on its own, and only serves a purpose when teamed up with a second vehicle. This will either serve to slow him down immensely, such as when healing a heavy, or let the teammate he is healing get away from him because the teammate, such as the Solider, is faster than the medic. The level design is beautiful, but Take Two, in an attempt to create an immerse and beautiful world, forgot that these types of tracks aren't really suitable for racing, taking place in such areas as underwater, in long corridors, and intelligence rooms. But some of the levels seem to be made for racing, such as 2fort, but there is no finish line, The fun thing is that each vehicle has a weapon to take out the other players. Of course, you can only take players that aren't wearing your vehicle colors. For example, the Heavy has a weapon that literally takes out everything in sight except that it slows him down to a halt, the Pyro has a weapon that sets fire to anyone and anything, and so on and so fourth. It seems similar to Mario Kart, with the various courses and powerups. However, it fails to capture the fun of Mario Kart, and instead going in an ultra-realistic direction that often looks quite boring and bland The major flaw in TF2 is that there really is no direction as to where you should be going. There are no checkpoints and no wrong way markers. Valve did include a "map" that changes between tracks but it is very confusing and really, isn't beneficial. These maps are nearly identical anyways, so changing the maps seemingly randomly only serves to aggravate the players more. While the tracks and graphics are fun and creative, this racing game is lacking in many ways. I wouldn't recommend this game to game owners if they had access to a console, as this PC-only racer doesn't seem to try hard enough to stand out from the crowd.

review: This game is one of the best free to play games I have ever played and would possibly say that it is the best overall game I have played. I do not recommend this game to any Call of Duty player who thinks they are amazing at games just by playing COD. This game will make you angry if you go in hopefull that all of your hours of COD will pay off. They wont. This game is for the adventurous people who enjoy a community based game. What I enjoy about this game is the fact that you can find weapons from enough gameplay time, the fact you can craft weapons, the achievements, the taunts, how you can install huds and change in game visuals, the range of characters and of course, the taunt kills. The taunt kills give you a sense of achievement when done on an opposing player because they are very hard to do (apart from against lazy snipers). Overall this game is highly recommended by me and others that I know. I would encourage you to download this game. - [YT] Zyaxitron Ed

review: Once upon a time, an Engineer built a sentry near some train tracks. This sentry was the bane of Red Team, killing every pedestrian that strolled by. A pyro and a Medic thought that was quite rude of the Engineer, so they spend the next 30 or 45 seconds training (And by training, I mean we were sitting in a corner building Ubercharge). We then launched an assault on the Engineer and his sentry, with our shiny puffed chests deflecting the measly bullets that the Sentry could muster. We showed the engineer why it is quite rude to fire at pedestrians. Once we were finished, the Pyro turned to thank the medic and promptly gave him a thumbs-up, but tragedy struck as the Pyro was immediately hit by the train, disappearing completely off the map. Once upon a time, Red and Blu decided to duke it out at a train station, but this wasn't an ordinary duke session. It was a "No second chances" duke that punishes dearly for the simplest mistakes. Both teams exit the spawn and commence the duking, turning into a savage mosh pit covered in blood and hats, until Red Spy and a Blu Medic remained. The medic offers a truce to the spy, promising to slap hands together and possibly sing and dance. The spy slowly stepped closer to the medic, giving the medic hope of peace, but tragedy struck as the Spy immediately stepped away and watched the medic get hit by the train, disappearing completely off the map. Once upon a time, a Blu Medic and a Blu Heavy was preparing for an ubercharge upon the Red team. The Blu Medic grinned as he heard the final spark signifying that he is ready to ubercharge. The heavy roared a blood-curdling battle cry as the medic activated the ubercharge on him, both rushing at the Reds. He turned the corner, spinning up his minigun to see a single Red medic, horrified by the sudden appearence. The heavy was about to fire, but tragedy struck as the Red Medic watched the sudden train appear and hit the Blu Heavy and Medic, disappearing completely off the map. What have I learned? Accept the train. Worship the train. Wear hats and sacrifice for the train. The hats are pretty important. Train MVP. 10/10 would train again.

review: I have never seen a game more like Call of Duty in my life. They might as well call this game "Call of Duty: Noobs n' Dudes" Now grant it, there are loads of hot dudes in this game. That is not enough to make me want to play this game over and over. I feel like it is a childish version of Call of Duty. It definitely is nowhere close to as good. This game has awful graphics, unlike Call of Duty, alright characters, and way too many weapons. A video game should not have so much customization. I want restrictions. I think I am just going to stick with Call of Duty. If you like Call of Duty, but can't afford it. I recommend getting this game. It is pretty much the same exact thing.

review: This a very entertaining game that allows you to battle with friends, or just anyone, by choosing one of nine classes that each has their own pros and cons. You will either be on team blue or team red. Obviously, the teams are against eachother and you want to battle the opposing colour. There are a variety of game modes to choose from where you must beat the other team. You can trade items, and there is even a whole currency for this game that is used in trading, or when identifying the price of your specified item. Overall I think this game is great. I highly recommend it for people who love action filled games, and who love to learn new skills. I recommend helping your team out if you would like to win, and don't leave them behind. Team Fortress 2 is a great game, but is better accomplished as a team rather than a singular person. If you've never tried the game, I recommend you give it a shot, it's loaded with entertainment, and you might just like it.

review: I played this for over 2 years and haven't reviewed it yet? Even after getting 100% achievements?! WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?!?!?!?! Anywho, your one-stop shop for all your multi-player needs. A team-based game that turns into a free-for-all 3 minutes into the match. After months of playing and getting bad drops, you'll want better hats. You'll go to trade servers..... a lot..... Then it'll be a game about Hats, Trading, Rocket Jumping, Backstabs, Sniped Headshots, and Lazy Engineers. Well recommended.

review: Take two at a review of this game. I'll make it quick since it's early 2015 now and TF2 has been out for nearly eight years. That said, it's balanced. They keep adding things while still keeping it balanced, with a few notable exceptions. (google Short Circuit, heh) It has lots of game modes, and they keep adding more as well...with Mannpower and its grappling hooks currently in beta. There are tons of communities...many are mature, many are not. There's surely at least one for you and you'll make friends, spend thousands of hours playing. The best part is, it's not an MMO...it's a real competitive and cooperative FPS that you can pick up and put down at any time. Getting bored of the standard game modes? Try mod servers. Versus Saxton Hale/Freak Fortress 2 are the undisputed kings of the modding scene, but there's Deathrun, Prop Hunt, Dodgeball, FortWars, Jailbreak (not my thing, but meh), Slender, Hidden, TF2 Ware, TF2 karts, and so much more. The TF2 dev team has done plenty to rope people in, but it's the modders that fill in the gaps. With the absurd gameplay variety stemming from nine distinct classes, and a Player vs Player foundation, it's impossible to get bored of this game. Also, you might see a hat or two. And some ducks eating bread.

review: Team Fortress 2 is one of the most fun games I have ever owned. It's face-paced comedic FPS that has a very addicting way of making one want to play more. The nine classes (Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy) have their own traits and balances that make the game fun, such as backstabbing (Spy), running faster than the other classes (Scout), and being able to rocket jump (Soldier). With tons of different weapons and a random number of classes of the other team, each round is never the same, so it never gets boring (unless one is playing Deathrun). Team Fortress 2 is also been known as a "Hat Simulator", which it basically is, considering the amount of cosmetics that each class can wear one the battlefield. Their are many different kinds of combinations of hats and miscellanious cosmetics that you never know which kind of combination you can obtain. The game has it's own humor that the characters create and sometime the game itself will cause something that will make one laugh. If one is Free to Play, then one has the choice of being Free to Play forever, or buying something from the TF2 Store and becoming Premium. The game does not force the player to buy something from the store, although the downfall to being Free to Play is that one can not trade with other people and some servers make "[F2P]" appear at the front of your name. But these are just minor things that a player can bypass if all the player wants to do is play the game without the hats and such. I fully recomend this game to anyone who wants a fast-paced FPS that likes to laugh at the often switch between comedy and intense battle. I recommend it even more if you like cosmetics that make your classes look awesome in your own way and the different varieties and stats of weapons that can change one classes health or vulnerability or even strength in damage. To me, Team Fortress 2 is my favorite game I have bought on Steam today.

review: If you're looking for a challenging FPS, that'll give you hours of competitive gameplay, aswell as an unique community, and amazingly fun weapons allowing you to get creative, look no further! Team Fortress 2 is one of the most fun, amazing, one-of-a-kind games that i've played. Not alone does the 9 different classes grow on you, the game itself is amazing! Featuring unique, fun gamemodes as Payload, or atk/def. If you're not conviced just yet, the game allows you to customize your classes with hats and miscs, community created, aswelll as valve's own! All in all, Team Fortress is by the community, for the community. Now i understand if you find looking at people, and clicking hard, or cook that grenade just right, but in Team Fortress 2 you dont nessecarily have to. There's much more to the game, than just being the first to draw fire. Heck, there aint even that many guns! To top it all off, it's free! you might think "Ah, then its a pay-to-win..", and you'd be absolutely wrong. With the unique Drop System you'll be sure to aquire new firearms by the end of the day (If not a hat or two!)

review: Ah, classic ol' Team Fortress 2. There really just is nothing like it. It has team-based combat, unlockable weapons, and most important of all... HATS! But forget about that for just a second, what makes this game so good? The humour of this game is just amazing. Every class has something nasty to say about each other, and you would know what I'm talking about if you played the game or watched the "Meet The ..." trailer/teaser series. It just makes me smile when I hear a line I've never heard before. Secondly, the team-based combat. As with most modern day FPS's (With the exclusion of the Battlefield series, somewhat.), you don't see a lot of team oriented gameplay. Take for example, Call of Duty. It's really just a run and gun experience, and that's not what teamwork really is about. In TF2 though, it really requires a good deck of cards for you to win. You need to work together to capture the control point, get the intelligence, push the cart, and etc. It can get rather intense, with either your team or the other team trying to do a push. That is one aspect that I love about TF2. Next, the unlock/drop system. With games such as Call of Duty, you need to level up in order to gain new weapons and attachments for your current weapons. But with TF2... No need. They drop randomly. Every weapon has its advantages and disadvantages, making them virtually balanced either way. But do note that these are only SIDE-GRADES, not overall upgrades from your stock weapons. Your stock weapons are just as effective as your new weapons, but droppable weapons do have stat bonuses and stat drops that your stock weapons do not have. Every unlockable weapon is suituational to some degree. So it is important to plot out which weapon you will use. The thing you've been waiting for... HATS! While not all that important, hats do add some flair to the game. They give you customization options to your class, which can often result in a rather spectacular looking player to not only look at, but play as. But, how do you get hats? It's somewhat complicated, really. Standard "Unique" quality hats drop rather rarely, but you can get them from unlocking crates or trading. You can get "Genuine" hats by ordering a game that has a special compaign that gives you the hat for free if you buy that game. Then there's the real meat of this whole "hat" thing... The holy unusual hat... Yes, they're rare and expensive to obtain. But they give you a feeling of satisfaction and achievement once you do get one for the first time. ESPECIALLY IF you unbox one, that is rather hard to do on the first try. But hats don't add anything special to the game, really. Same with stranges and killstreak weapons, they only track your kills. (Obvious difference is that Stranges track your lifetime kills, while killstreak weapons count how many kills you got in one life.) But yes, I do recommend this game. It is a nice game to play for a few hours and hopefully find something new to do that you never did before.

review: Let's start with the fact, that I have never write any review, so don't be too harash with mine, please. Team Fortress 2. What can be said about this game? Some people might just look at it and say: "Regular FPS. You play with maybe even 100+ people a day, and shoot to win." Or is it? What I like mostly about TF2, is the fact that everything there is build on the TEAMWORK. After all, this is called "TEAM Fortress 2", not "Deathmatch Fortress 2". Playing as a lone wolf will lead you to no where, and even eventually make you rage quit from playing this game. For good. It's not about your high score, or how many kills you get at the end of the round. (altough it still motivate you to fight more and shows that you are the experienced player to others) It's all about doing the objective together with your team, to win the game. And every new game there is completely different than previous one, so working together as a team is really important with every challenge that comes with every new game mode, team members and map the game is going on of course. So we already know, this game is all about team work, and doing current game objective. Got it? Good, and keep it that way! Let's go with the next thing - weapons! Even though there's not many of them, as the cosmetic items (that would be something) there's still a lot of them, to pick and choose from. And most of the weapons usually change to way of playing your current class, so it makes the game even more interesting and challenging. We have weapons that heal or overheal you on killing your opponent, slow down enemies who are shot, gives you speed boost, hurt enemy after attacking him... the list is long, every weapon have it's pros and cons, so everyone can choose, try out every weapon and stick with it, as this style of fighting with it fits him most. Thus makes your gameplay completely different everytime you join on a random server, with new random people. More guns = more fun. Check them out, and find your style. That's our conclusion here. One tip though - every time you will get a new weapon, don't think you have advanced to a next level or something and this new weapon is way better than the previous one! Carry on... Classes you're playing! There are 9 playable classes in game, avalible from the beggining, so there's no any "This class avalible after reaching that level." No. You can play as who do you want, from the beggining. So you can try out every game style and see which one fits you most, as with every class you're playing completely diffrently than with previous one. So, the classes are: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and (my favourite) Spy. Every class have it's pros and cons, just like the weapons you can get so the choice of your favourite one are a little easier. For example - Scout is the fastest one of all the classes, can make double jumps and even capture points 2 times faster than anyone else. But he is really easy to kill in battle, unless you're good at dodging incomming spam of bullets and rockets. Much better for a frontal attack are classes like Soldier, armed with his rocket launcher and the possibility to do a "Rocket Jump" to help him reach bigger distances in a short time, due to the fact he's really slow. But that's just a short example of everything that each class is avalible of. And honestly? Too lazy to write down all of them, that's all... meh. Worth to mention, that every class have it's own personality, which makes them a bit more cooler and interesting to play with. Another example? Fine. Scout is pretty much kind of a cocky guy, who likes to annoy others, and think that every girl wants him, and every guy wish to be like him. Soldier is a stereotypical example of an American patriot, who most likely lost all his brain cells durning WW2. Heavy is a very calm and serious guy, until his minigun starts to spin and the battle starts. Then he's like a wild, angry bear, that hates people. And so it goes as well, with the other 6 classes. So, 9 different mercs for a usually 12-24 teams. Sounds cool? Because it is... that is, until most of them are only Spies or Snipers. Exactly, most of the players think that this game is like CoD - thus they go full sniper force, believing they have nailed everything. No, no, NO! This game is nothing like CoD! A team full of snipers, will never win. I was once in a team where out of 10 players we had 8 snipers, one spy and a soldier which was me. So, I think you can say how that round went? (inb4 MLG jokes) So, what I mean is - teamwork is important, we know that. But, when there's not enough classes that will provide enough firepower for the team, the teamwork won't help you much, or does not exist there at all. Okay, time to move on to... HATS! This is something completely random, that makes this game unique. In this game, you can wear on every class a nice and fancy hat, or other cosmetic, that will make you look diffrent from the others. Here's my question - can you wear a hat in every other FPS, than Team Fortress 2? No. Or dance Conga? Of course not. Or being a total annoying brat and taunting after every kill, no matter how much skill you put into your kill? Of course not! Another reason why TF2 is so unique, and why we love it so much. Okay, slowly getting tired of thinking what to poot here. So, conclusion time! Team Fortress 2 is an awesome game, unique in her own beautiful way and great to play. I recommend playing it, together with your friends! "But they have no money..." This game's free! Just download, learn how to play and get good! The only thing that makes me really angry about this game are most of the time unbalanced teams, the autobalance curse in the worst possible moment of the round, or the fact the prices are getting higer in its shop...

I don't think I'm the only one who thinks this game is not only helping Steam, but Valve as a whole. They make money off of hats and the market, and we have Awesome looking hats/weapons that are fairly balanced, and have fun. It is truly the Win-Win situation at hand. Keep Making great games Valve!

That is one aspect that I love about TF2. Next, the unlock/drop system. With games such as Call of Duty, you need to level up in order to gain new weapons and attachments for your current weapons. But with TF2... No need. They drop randomly. Every weapon has its advantages and disadvantages, making them virtually balanced either way. But do note that these are only SIDE-GRADES, not overall upgrades from your stock weapons. Your stock weapons are just as effective as your new weapons, but droppable weapons do have stat bonuses and stat drops that your stock weapons do not have. Every unlockable weapon is suituational to some degree. So it is important to plot out which weapon you will use. The thing you've been waiting for... HATS! While not all that important, hats do add some flair to the game. They give you customization options to your class, which can often result in a rather spectacular looking player to not only look at, but play as. But, how do you get hats? It's somewhat complicated, really. Standard "Unique" quality hats drop rather rarely, but you can get them from unlocking crates or trading. You can get "Genuine" hats by ordering a game that has a special compaign that gives you the hat for free if you buy that game. Then there's the real meat of this whole "hat" thing... The holy unusual hat... Yes, they're rare and expensive to obtain. But they give you a feeling of satisfaction and achievement once you do get one for the first time. ESPECIALLY IF you unbox one, that is rather hard to do on the first try. But hats don't add anything special to the game, really. Same with stranges and killstreak weapons, they only track your kills. (Obvious difference is that Stranges track your lifetime kills, while killstreak weapons count how many kills you got in one life.) But yes, I do recommend this game. It is a nice game to play for a few hours and hopefully find something new to do that you never did before.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a popular F2P FPS over the country. This game is actually one of the best game Valve ever made, I'm not saying that this game is the best one among all the games that Valve made. The only thing players love about this game are hats, yes, hats, the economy of Team Fortress 2 will be hats ans cosmectics. Why not weapons you said, well, it is very difficult to have a new weapon because of the weapon's stats and when a weapon goes wrong, the game will not be balanced making this "unfair". So, I know some of the players in Team Fortress 2 just focus on weapons and not focusing on hats and they just quit Team Fortress 2, I know a lot of players did this because who doesn't want new weapons? Now... Valve are now looking into the Steam Workshop of Team Fortress 2 to find new weapons for the game and even hats, every damn time. Yes, you're actually playing the future Hat Simulator. When I first played Team Fortress 2, around 2008, I forgot where I started playing it, but nevermind, just stick to around 2008. This game is well optimized, but it sucks up a lot of your CPU Usage though. This game is well optimized, I said again, I mean, most maps are smooth making you having a good FPS. Well, Valve is actually a big company due to popular, fun, optimized game and etc... The graphics in this game looks "cartoonish" and when the Graphic settings are all "Low" the game will still run the graphic to "pretty". I know that graphics doesn't make a game better, only story does. Oh and I forgot to mention that this game has a story, just check their wiki and read the comics, the story won't show up in-game. And let's get back to the graphic I last said, the graphic looks "cartoonish", I mean, who doesn't like cartoonish graphics? Trust me, it's beautiful, just like the Borderlands series, it's cartoonish. There are 9 classes in this game: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, Spy. The Scout focus on speed and agility and Scout captures Control Point x2 faster. The Soldier focus on DPS by using his Rocket Launcher, very useful on a pocket Medic. The Pyro will uses "his" or "her" Flamethrower to start a fire to the enemy for afterburn damage. Demoman will focus on defense and offense with his Stickybomb Launcher due to the DPS or he can focus on Melee or Demoknight for short. The Heavy is the tank, he's also good at being a pocket and also wield a Minigun but the damage isn't high. The Engineer focuses on defending and uses his Sentry Gun to defend points, he can also equip the Gunslinger to build Mini-Sentry and also becoming Offensive Engineer, the Engineer can use his Shotgun or Pistol to deal with enemies instead of his Sentry doing it. The Medic focuses on Support, the medic is a MUST on all team due to healing and ubercharge. The Sniper also a support class, the sniper stays back front of the battlefield to support his team-mates. And lastly, the Spy, he is very mysterious, you won't know he is behind you or not you better watch out his backstabbing skills and also watch out for your "fake" team-mates, the spy can disguise as your team-mate and act like them so watch out! After a lot of hours playing this game, I should like to rate: 10/10 Amazing

review: It does hurt not to recommend this game after I've spent so much time on it, but I just can't recommend it anymore. The last updates prove that the TF2 development team is just not in touch with the game anymore, the awful optimization issues make this game unplayable, sometimes even for people who have great computers, and the community is slowly dying. People are moving on to CS:GO and DotA 2, just like me. I really do feel like TF2 is dying. Hopefully a Source 2 port and a competitive matchmaking update can fix these problems.

review: Probably one of the greatest time and money sinks that Valve has ever come up with -- Other than Steam itself -- Team Fortress still holds up years after its original release, regardless of what anyone is telling you. Yes, the hats start to get annoying and sometimes just a bit too flashy, but it still retains a brand of humor that is wholly unique in what it does. For those unfamiliar, TF2 is a Class Based Shooter, based on the Team Fortress mod for Quake and Team Fortress Classic, which was a mod for the original Source Engine. A CBS is commonly a First-Person shooter, such as Enemy Territory, Battlefield, and Battlefront, although some CBS titles, like Battle of Heros, is a Third-Person shooter. TF2 is the former. Unlike the example titles, however, both teams are exactly the same, and neither side has any kind of special unit or weapon that's only available for that side (Unlike Battlefront giving each of the four factions a Unique Unit with Unique weapons). There are nine classes in total: Scout, Pyro, Soldier, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy. This is also quite a few more classes than some other game have had (Again as an example: Battlefront had only six classes per team, and some Battlefield titles, such as Hardline, only have four classes). Although it is a lot of classes, each one carries a bit of weight, and can be very important to a team (Although in general play, teams will have multiple members of each class, and some cases one class will not even exist during a game). The Scout is a fast moving class that can get in close with a shotgun and blast enemies at close range, and then quickly pull out to evade a counter-attack. The soldier, while slow moving, is armed with a very powerful rocket launcher. The Pyro moves fairly quickly, and needs to get close to make use of his flamethrower. These are considered to be the offensive classes, and are meant to push for an objective. The Demoman can create explosive traps with sticky bombs, and has excellent melee capabilities. The Heavy wields a minigun and has a very high amount of health, which makes up for his slow walk. The Engineer can build ammunition dispensers and automated turrets which will shoot any nearby enemies. These are the defensive classes, and are used to hold a position (Although Heavies, when paired with a medic, can also turn into a menacing offensive force). The Medic, as the name suggests, heals team-mates in the thick of battle. Snipers, again as the name suggests, use a sniper rifle to pick off enemies from a safe distance. Spies can cloak themselves and get behind enemy lines to take out deadly players with a swift one-hit-kill backstab with a knife. These are the support classes, and are meant to help the rest of the team succeed. As mentioned this game has objective based gameplay, such as capturing points, stealing intelligence (Capture the Flag), King of the Hill, and several kinds of demolition based missions. So, probably not as advanced as an Enemy Territory game, but probably a bit more mission related flesh than a Battlefront game. So if you like team based class shooters, give TF2 a try. The base game is free, and the cosmetics are optional. There are a lot of extra weapons available to all players, and new content is added semi regularly, though mostly in the form of cosmetics. Sometimes new weapons are added too. Also, the community is still quite large, and community servers host a barrage of custom maps and content that can enhance the experience.

review: I like this game but it WILL ruin your life let me tell you now First it starts out simple... you don't want to be that scrubby f2p who achivement farmed for the dumb f2p hats... you spend your first 5 dollars on the mann co store... clearly not understanding the market much at this point you uncrate the keys you already feel you've wasted your money on you get absolute rubbage you cry you unbox more (repeat for at least a month) You now realise you've begged your parents multiple times to just spend "5 dollars..." You've wasted it all on overpriced mann co store items or cheap genuine cosmetics every other p2p player has You have succesfully spent more money on everything besides the nice items "unusuals for example" you wish you had one you cry you realise if the amount of steam funds you have wasted on the game was your backpack value you wouold have atleast 30 dollars more in inventory items. you learn about tf outpost you think its magical you either get lowballed a/o phised more then once your desperate attempt to profit has failed you go full  you loose your cool you take your (at max 20 dollar value) inventory and spam the first person you find on outpost who has an unusual with trade offers giving them your whole backpack you get lowballed an unusual you dont care its got a purple font and crappy special effects... you must be rich now right? You realise i've used the word "you" 30+ times already you keep reading the review you now decide to sell your unusual on the market wait... 30 bucks oh my god sells for 20 in rage to get quick money wastes on overpiced games he could of got cheaper on r/gametrades cry's even more you wish you were dead you decide to take the 4 ref value backpack you somehow scraped up in the time you suffered from your lowball depression endurance stage, You go full  again and give it away you quit tf2 to play counter strike you miss tf2 you come back and get depressed again (repeat) Note: this actually happened to me Another note: I have 600+ hours of gametime and still can't decide wether i like tf2 or not

review: This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes. At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'. Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve. 'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, "Mann Up", gives rewards upon completing a "tour". In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available. In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them. The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since November 2007 and I still return to the game on a regular basis.

review: Always on the first favorite game on my library, First time trying pyro class and got stuck on it! Awesome game for try our Teamwork to win on battle, And have been returned and got bored on pyro class ,head over my pointer to try scout class with killstreak gun and and its my favorite class till now. You can't just go soloing on the arenas, you need a great Teamwork to get in the good place like in the game title. Highly recommended this game at all first person shooter sequel, would try and should try this game! The first thing that you must know from this game is, This game was fully for free to play, doesn't valuable player can win at once you can just start with item drop to be the great one at battle but i'm not. Let me tell some deep thing about this game, the grapich and texture on the game already at the top points and depend on how far you can handle it. There are two team you can join that is Red and Blu or Blue(mostly called it Blu). Many class that you can wanna be like Sniper, a burner, a medic, an heavy man, a spy class, or as a scout bring deadly itself small shotgun and more class that make you into the core. Many awesome map made by community and official creator, a Crowded server by player and official server make this game more enjoyable for in random gamer community. An stats detail about your gameplay to beat in some records, as much as achievement to unlock beat the average players and meet stranger and be a good team, all is about shoot and some teamwork require to win i need to say again. Few fun mode that you can play, the game always updated, so don't be minded is this game was old and bored, like in other day i check up on SteamCharts, almost got 70K player everyday! An active player every hours! don't think you're lonely, you can start your own story and friendship by just playing this game and be a good person, all will accepting you well. Grab your favorite class and combined item and start chillin with your friend for more fun!

review: Don't take it as a negative review, steam lacks a mixed button, some stuff in this game I like, some I hate, but I keep on playing, but first let's talk about the bad stuff. 1. F2P. Sure it boosted the game's lifespan for a few years, but all we get is idiots who kill themselves, and steal healthkits from dieing teammates when they have 1 hp missing from their total amount of hp. We were all noobs at one point in a game, however I was never this  when I joined TF2 back in 2010, HECK nobody was this stupid, how come all these F2P act like the biggest idiots on planet earth, while all the noobs back in 2010 were actually pretty good? Answer COD. Also if you say, well play on 6v6 or highlander if your serious about TF2, no, I played them multiple times and it was the worse experience I have had in any game, nothing but sticky spammer demoman, "Pro" scouts all in your face, Snipers camping and having a seizure when you go near them, and the Soldier who is the biggest  you will ever meet. Highlander is awful and 6v6 is ing dreadful, I will never play these again. 2.Hitboxes. All multiplayer source games suffer this, basiclly shoot at wall = Kill 5 enemies, and shooting AT THEM = Nothing, is it an actual glitch to even hit people in this game? *Update. FOR F*CK SAKE THE HITBOXES ARE STARTING TO GET WORSE, A SNIPER HEADSHOTS ME ( I COUNTED) 16 TIMES IN A ROW WITHOUT AIMING AT ME AT ALL AND THROUGH WALLS AND TEAMMATES! (no machina) WHAT THE SH*T?!?!? WHY DO I HAVE TO HIT SOMEONE 63 TIMES WITH A WEAPON UNTIL THE GAME DECIDES ONE OF THE ATTACKS COUNT? AND HOW COME THEY CAN INSTA KILL ME WITH WEAPONS OUT OF RANGE AND THROUGH WALLS? DO I HAVE TO SINK MORE MONEY INTO YOUR WALLET VALVE TO MAKE YOU GIVE ME BETTER HIT DETECTION? INSTEAD OF FORCE FEEDING US WITH UNCREATIVE SH*TTY HATS, HOW ABOUT YOU FIX YOUR POOR EXUSE OF HITBOXES, THIS IS THE BIGGEST REASON I LEFT THIS GAME, HOW COME EVERYONE GETS MAGIC TINY HITBOXES WHILE I GET HITBOXES THE SIZE OF THE F*CKING MOON? Thanks valve you made me look like a hothead, if you actually cared about actual fun gameplay instead of filling your wallet, we wouldn't ever had this issue. I'm sorry for that massive rant, it's the largest reason why I left, to be honest I hate most source engine games because of it, PVK2 is decent, TF2 is bad, CS:GO is awful and DINO D-DAY IS HORRENDOUS, to me the source engine is good at visuals, but it's the worst engine for multiplayer gaming of all time, I'M DEAD F*CKING SEROIUS, I PERFER RIDE TO HELL'S GAME ENGINE THEN THE SOURCE ENGINE, I hope to god that Source 2 has better hit detection. 3.Slow rate of updates. Valve is slowly leaving this game, during the 1st part of the year since 2012, we get no major updates until May-Juneish time, while we do get small updates inbetween, nothing MAJOR changes, except for the start of this year we got the strongbox pack, which gives me hope that this game comes back. 4.No weapons for a long time. I'm sick to death of seeing the same old weapons, I'm aware we are getting the EOTL update soon, but its not soon enough. The Love war weapons are all sh*t except for the shield, it makes the other shields worthless. *Update* Well EOTL is here, no new weapons and no new maps, are you f*cking kidding me, Valve just gave us the middle finger because F*ck you have some hats! The weapons from what I heard from the wiki that they have been moved to the Love&War update a few months back (for no reason) but for the map we have a  reason, "It's too hard for new players" THIS IS THE BIGGEST *T I HAVE EVER HEARD, CP_STEEL, RD_ASTROID AND TC_HYDRO OR ALL FINE, EXCEPT FOR A NEW MAP WHICH IS JUST AN EDITED CP MAP.... Valve, I know EA is your wafiu and your idol and all, but stop this, I want to enjoy an update without using my wallet, plus after 500 hats, IT'S GETTING OLD. And the EOTL movie was amazing, a review is going to be made and uploaded on my channel, let's just say it's going to be very positive. 5. The mess of balance in most weapons. Some weapons are fine, like the Buff Banner and Krizkerg, and there's  weapons that never get touched, like the Warrior's Spirit and Sharpened Volcano fragment, there are weapons that are nerfed for no reason, the Axtinguisher and Fists of Steel, there are weapons that are gimmicky and are useless without a certain weapon, like the Flying Guillotine and Air strike, and lastly there are weapons that need to be nerfed but people keep defending them because killing people hasn't been easier, like the Gunslinger and Degreaser. Valve, stop r*ping the weapons that are fun and balanced while the actual overpowered weapons get away scot free, I'm sick of seeing Gunslinger engies and Degreaser crit wh*res after 4 years of dominating, nerf them please! 6.Too much character development in one character and none in the others. Soldier is way too ing devloped, we know so much about him I'm sick of it, why don't we learn about Heavy or Medic? They have a intresting backstory, I want to know what happened to Heavy's family! Not soldier having a Raccoon Sanctuary, honestly I really don't care and all I want is some good backstory for some of the other characters. The Expiration Date movie while good has some flaws, go look on my video on my youtube channel (Channel on my profile) 7. Price of hats,miscs,taunts and weapons. 5 for a hat? F*ck that I can get 3 new games at that price, honestly its too dam high of a price, if it was like 1 per hat then that would be ok, also weapons are stupidly overpriced the most, 7 for a phlog? Yet I can find one buy drops or buy one for a scrap.... u srs vavle? *Update, all the prices have been increased..... 8.19 for a coat for Soldier? Yeah if 7.99 wasn't high enough. 8. The Community. TF2 Originally had one of the best communities ever back in 2010 and early 2011, if you were new to the game and asked for help, instead of LOL NO F2P NOOB or F*CK OFF SCUM, you get a positive response, but since the Uber update and TF2 became F2P the community became salter and salter, eventually becoming worse then the COD community and over the past few years it's getting worse, here is the best example of this "Amazing community" BP.TF is a popular website where people get the prices of items, however due to the admins being bullied or some sh*t like that, they are rising the price of keys to destroy the economy this game created, that's just sad that no one is stopping them at all, and all because of profits, if your a trader who sells keys a lot, you don't give a  until all your keys are gone or until the economy collapses which will be around June 2015 (Just a guess for now) I admit I'm a bit salty around free players, however those are mostly the ones who beg for items and act like s and act so stupid like I described on my first complaint, I have met free players who are very intelligent, but for every smart F2P, theres a million  F2P. Despite all of this I still keep playing TF2, why you ask? For one reason... Halloween. Halloween has added lots of things into TF2, spells, bosses, awesome maps and bumper cars, honestly if you find me playing TF2 I'll possibly on the following maps. Event maps Custom bumper car maps. Halloween also introduces some of the best cosmetics the game has ever seen and some of my favourites like the Cadaver's Capper for Soldier, it did introduce some crap though like the brony hat, but it's better then most hats in the game like the overrated piece of sh*t which is the Team Captain. Thank's to halloween 2014, I'm back into TF2, however I'm still very mixed about it, the awful hitboxes, terrible commuinty and awful balance make me pissed everyday, but let's be honest, what other game can you use a Bow and arrow along with some crocodile skin and a Frying pan in your pocket?

review: It was fun. It was enjoyable. Then it was free, with purchasable items. And it all went horribly wrong. Full of suspicious players, full of....STUPID items, and full of half-baked maps. It can be really fun for killing some time on a 20 player spammy server, but I'd rather stab my eyes out with spoons than try and play it competitively again. Recommended as a piss about with your mates. Trying to play it more competitively will make your brain implode.

Not since the Halloween update gave us no new bosses, infinite appearances of Merasmus and an event version of the worst map in the game. Not since the most hyped update EVER turned out to be, surprise surprise, just more hats. 10/10 scientists would confirm EotL is worse than Robotic Boogalo. Not since Smissmas gave us 7 festives instead of 9, and crappy festives at that. But before then 20/10 would spread my wallet wide for Gabe.

review: I got TF2 last year some time and have been playing ever since. You may not think 100 hours is much but it is seen as tho i play so much Minecraft. Anyway, I would reccomend TF2 to anyone because it is a really fun 'Free to play game'. I found the tutorials on how to play very easy to understand, the tutorials consist of being a certain character and going through what weapons they have and what they do. Once gone through the tutorial i went on to mulitiplayer, The multiplayer of TF2 is faultless with Countless amount of servers to choose from all having different aims like capture the point or team death match etc. You may be thinking to get better weapons you will have to buy them in the store like in other games, well thats not the case as you find items while playing, which you can use or trade with others. Making it ideal for all gamers no matter there budget. Graphics side TF2 has decent graphics with a low to zero lag experience. If you like third person shooters TF2 is for you! 10/10!

But the overall experience of this game is amazing. There are so many different game modes and so many people to play with. There are also many different ways to customize your characters. So if haven't already gotten TF2, get it. It's totally worth it.

review: Once upon a time, in a far away swamp, there lived an ornery game named Team Fortress 2 whose precious solitude is suddenly shattered by an invasion of annoying Free-to-players. There are blind mice in his food, a big, bad wolf in his bed, three little homeless pigs and more, all banished from their kingdom by the evil Squeakers. Determined to save their home--not to mention his own--Team Fortress 2 cuts a deal with Squeakers and sets out to rescue the beautiful hats to be the Squeakers' bride. Accompanying him on his mission is wisecracking Free-to-play, who will do anything for Unusuals... except shut up. Rescuing the hats from a new trader may prove the least of their problems when the deep, dark secret it has been keeping is revealed.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a popular first-person shooter, wherein you can choose to play as one of nine different classes to fit your play style. Thanks to the reliability of the community, it's usually not very difficult to find a good server. You can gain access to a diverse range of weapons and accessories to equip your character with (either by trading with other players or just playing the game on a regular basis) that further enhance your gaming experience. I always have a lot of fun when I play this game with my friends, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the genre.

The gameplay was way overwhelming for me at first. The good thing is that I wanted to join in, be more of a team player, so, I started playing more to gain more experience in how to basically, as some might say "Get good" at this game. Its really enjoyable, and with updates every now and then, it stays fresh, fun and the community are always welcome. I'd say that this game, is the one that everyone should have a go at, and if its your kinda cake, then pick up a slice, place it next to your sandvich, and get your lunchbox to the battle field and place a dispenser here! Its go time!

review: So, Team Fortress 2 is a game that is free to play and offers a fun user experience to people of a large age range. TF2 gives players the choice to play with friends and have a good laugh, or even take it to the next level with competitive gaming. One thing which I love about team fortress 2 is that almost everyone is happy to play with you and that some items in the game are created by our online community. This gives people the chance to display their own creations and hopefully bring them to life in game. TF2 is more of a relaxed game and does not require you to be good at first person shooters. This is because there is a class suited to every style of play. If you prefer to stealth and be hidden, then the spy is for you. However, if you having a bad day and you cant concentrate, why not throw out some flames with the pyro's flamethrower which requires no practice to use. There is also a large amount of different gamemodes on TF2 such as pushing a large bomb into the enemys base or even sending a rocket into space. If your a relaxed person looking for a bit of fun with a game that is not full of try harding people... then tf2 is definatly for you! I highly recomend it :) Happy gaming

review: For as long as I've been playing Team Fortress 2, I have never found myself being bored. The constant updates and additions keep the game fresh and fun. The game is starting to become more of a social experience, what with the conga lines and friendly players on opposing teams. My only concern, however, is that Team Fortress 2 may be rather intimidating to the newer players, maybe a bit overwhelming. With all of these new cosmetics, a vast arsenal of weapons, and the ability to turn any bloody battlefield into a parade has changed the face of shooters. I'm afraid that newer players may start playing and will be immediately turned off by either the vast personalities and items, or just the overall sillyness. Regardless, TF2 remains a great game over 7 years after its initial launch. Props to you, Valve!

review: Hey random, watch out, theres a super subjective review ahead! After over 3000 hours of playtime in this game I can surely say that it is one of the best games I have played (yet), the 9 classes, numerous maps, many gamemodes and huge number of weapons in the game just make this a super-diverse game and very enjoyable to play once you figured out HOW to play it. Looking at TF2 from an outsiders perspective: its free2play, first downside, it doesn't look too serious, theres are a ton of cosmetics and you can buy stuff from a store... seems pretty much like a pay2win game right? Well it isn't! Cosmetical items ALL only have visual effects on your character and don't matter, weapons however do all have diffrent, sometimes even completely classchanging stats, which may or may not be usefull, depending on the situation you are in. (Stockweapons being the most realiable ones in pretty much EVERY situation) You get weapons through item-drops, there are around 7 item-drops per week, the counter resetting on thursdays, so there you go, you can get all the items (except some special ones that have diffrent visuals but otherwise are just reskins of their "normal" counterparts) through just playing the game! It might take you some time of course, but I think that being overwhelmed by all the unlocks and not knowing what they do as a starter, could more easily lead to frustration than getting them after each other and checking out what they do, then deciding if they are usefull or not. (Psst, you can also find HATS!) Gameplaywise, its a pretty fun experience (occasionally annoying randomcrits and some unbalanced weapons aside) and you can actually have a BLAST playing it with your friends! TF2 has a class for every type of player, there's a stealth-guy, theres a sniper-dude, theres some big slow guy with a freaking minigun, theres some really fast dude, and so on, also it's, like I mentioned before, free2play, so whenever you are bored, why not jump into the game with some friends, have fun for an hour or 2 and quit the game without having spent any money! Actually, if you get further interested in the game, it also has a competitive side to it, the skill ceiling is incredibly high, I myself for example have only managed to be semi-good at ONE of the nine classes, and am not able to play in a competitive division higher than steel (one of the worst), even with my 3000 hours of playing the game! Yes there are people like me that take that game serious! And you know what? It's amazing to play in a team of nice people and try your heart out just to lose because of teams that actually know what they are doing wrecking you... (You can't blame it on unfair unlocks or randomcrits either, both aren't existent in comp...). SUMMARY! Good: -many maps, classes, gamemodes, weapons, for alot of variety -actually not pay2win, pay2lookgood instead -huge trading community, if you are good you can trade your way up and own virtual items with real world value! -enjoyable competitive formats (go to playcomp.tf to get more info) -playstyles for everyone -visually appealing artstyle -ALOT of mechanics -features amazing fun, hilarious moments and people falling off cliffs Bad: -some unbalanced weapons (though counterable with an ounce of coordination) -occasionally annoying randomcrits (random critical hits) -hard to get into all the diffrent mechanics at start -actually pretty badly optimized, all the updates made the game run slow on "casual" machines -as a free2play you only have 50 backpack slots, any kind of investment in the store however (which start at a few cents), increases your backpack size to 300 slots (defenitely enough) P.S.: Theres quite some stuff I haven't actually talked about like the actually challenging co-op missions in MVM and community created gamemodes and maps! Go ahead and boot up the game in order to have a nice time! :D

review: I recommend this game to anyone who has never heard of Steam before. I've been playing TF2 since 2009, and I wish I had instead been playing since the 2007 beta. This is a fun game to play, and the ability to use SourceMod to create custom plugins to add new features to the game is one of the greatest selling points in my opinion. Look at all the wonderful gamemodes we've received such as VS Saxton Hale, Slender Fortress and many others. As well, being a lover of beta/unused/cut content in games, and TF2 being jam-packed with beta/unused content....well it's just plain awesome.

review: In EA's new hit title, Team Fortress 2: Band of Brothers, you play as one of nine different characters through gritty war scenarios that tell the tale of two PMC companies embroiled in a privately funded war. On one side is the REDfor team, a band of experienced Veterans based in Europe. On the other is BLUfor, a ruthless mercenary group based primarily in Russia. From the minigun-toting cigar smoking character Ivan "Heavy Weapons" to the cocky, accented demolitions expert Tavish "Smokey" DeGroot, this game will provide a whole new level of immersion with characters you care for, realistic battlefields and vehicles, and over 100 real weapons including the P90, Mossberg, M16, and a fan favorite, the Gluon Gun. For only $79.99, this game is what is described by reviewers like IGN and Gamespot the "pinnacle of modern FPS's." Pre-order it now and you can get two tactical maps of Teufort and Coldfront, a limited edition Gamer's Guide, and the "End of the Line" DLC for free!

review: This game was the reason to join Steam. After all this years, they keep adding new content that can change the way the game is played or the way your character looks with a lot of HATS!!! All the characters are different and you can be entertained by their voice-lines. The gameplay can change a lot depending on the weapon you use. It can give you an advantage on the battlefield, but they will always find a way to balance that by using a different class or weapon to stop you. The maps are very diverse and you have a lot of game modes to play. Except Hydro. Nobody plays Hydro. This game was created with the whole purpose of having fun killing each other and, after all this time, it doesn't get old. Even if you think that you still have to spend money on the game to have a bigger backpack, think it better as an investment. Because this game will give you more than just hours and hours of fun. Mann vs Machine can be as cancerous as Dota 2. So you better play it with friends or else you'll be kicked because you didn't do what some  told you to do.

Now you can equip your weapon sent to you by the achievement gods and grab a small rock, place it on your W key to win! Don't forget to hang your massive scrotum over your microsoft mouse and flail it around madly while screaming in mumble until desired success is achieved. Yes I used to main pyro. It was a necessity.

Kanye West has proven to be the most Kanyeest Kanye you can ever Kanye because his cosmetics are so Kanye. I personally use the "Best in the Kanye West" and the "West Kanye" in my Kanye slot. Overall Kanye West has given me much Kanye in Kanye Fortress 2. Kanye/Kanye would Kanye again.

review: Team Fortress 2 is the perfect Steam introduction game; if you already haven't been pulled in by the fact that this game is no less than zero dollars then let me persuade you. TF2 is filled with clever humour, wacky hats and weapons and hundreds of hours of online play. Even without a premium account you can enjoy all of the weapons bar a few promotional items and have access to any server you choose. There is a class for everyone; whether you like capturing points and intel as the scout, building sentries and dispensers to aid your team as The Engineer or remaining disguised and unseen as the Spy, Team Fortress 2 can provide this along with much more. There are 8 gamemodes in total including Mann VS Machine; not including several spin-offs and countless community generated content. The community holds considerable power in TF2; almost all of the latest updates have been under a strong community influence; including items and maps. Get TF2. Now. You have nothing to lose and I can almost guarantee that you'll have a great time.

review: I haven't played much of the game yet, but Team Fortress 2 is an incredibly fun experience that shouldn't be passed up. The game follows 9 mercenaries on two teams battling each other to the death in order to complete a certain objective depending on what game mode they are on. What really makes the game unique is that each class doesn't seem too highly overpowered like in Call of Duty or Halo. Each one has their weaknesses and relies on other classes to help them stay alive. For example, the Medic class is designed to heal teammates and occasionally grant them invulnerability to bullets at the expense of a poor arsenal. He needs to be protected by the class he's healing because he can't defend for himself very well. The Engineer class relies on his Sentry turret which can be deployed to wreck havoc on enemies trying to invade his base. Along with this, he can deploy a dispenser which grants ammo/health to his team and two teleporters (good for helping them get out into battle quickly). Although he can't be with most of the others fighting on the front line, he still helps them immensely with these inventions. Along with uniquely designed classes, the art style of the game is gorgeous in its own way, as it's not too realistic with a fun cartoon art style. The voice actors for each class are hilariously over-the-top which adds to the enjoyability of playing as each of them, and even if you don't like what they seem to offer they're still worth a go. I'd defenitely recommend this game to anyone. The classes are fun, the gameplay is fun, and the visuals are even "fun", I'd say. This is probably one of the best multiplayer shooters you can come across - and it's free, too!

review: Team Fortress 2 is the best FPS Multiplayer Game I have ever played! 10/10 here's my review: Team Fortress 2 is one of Valve's games that you should have first once you made your steam account There are 9 classes you can play as so what are we waiting for? Let's meet them all! Scout: He is not as weak as you think, he has a scattergun, pistol and a bat, He is a offensive class and he can beat you up by bonking you on the head plus he's pretty fast too! Soldier: He is a pretty balance class but he is equiped with a Rocket Launcher, Shotgun and a shovel (yep, it's a shovel) He's also offensive too and also can rocket jump too as in jump very high with the help of his Rocket Launcher. Pyro: What's with the fire guys? Oh it's the pyro that makes the fire with his Flamethrower, Shotgun (Same old shotgun) and a Fireaxe, He's the last offensive class and he can burn you alive. WATCH OUT SPIES Demoman: Sure he's drunk but he's a defensive class and he has GRENADES well not really unlike tf1/tfc but he uses Grenade Launcher, Stickybomb Launcher and a bottle (cuz he drunk BURB!) He is a powerful class if you use melee :) Heavy: The Heavy is a heavy weapons guy that holds the Minigun, Shotgun (again) and he's own fist. He is a defensive class and he is heavy I mean he's slow so keep that in mind if you dont want to get SNIPED in other words: He's the face of TF2 Engineer: Our buddy likes to build stuff and these buildings are useful, He Builds Sentries, Dispensers (heals) and teleporters. he fights with Shotgun, Pistol, and a wrench which use for building as well. Look out of sappers [He is the last defensive class] Medic: MEDIC! we need healing and that's where medics comes in, He's a support class that heals his teammates and he wields with a Syringe Gun, Medigun (Heals teammates) and a bonesaw. MEEEEEDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICCCCCCC! Sniper: G'day mates, Let's headshot our victims with this supportive class. He shoots with the Sniper Rifle, SMG and a Kukri (well not for shooting with) Watch your head and avoid getting shot by snipers. Spy: Our last & Support class, The Spy, He is very sneaky but also weak. He's uses a Revolver, a Sapper (to sap the engineer's buildings but it takes time) and finally a knife which he backstabs people with. That's Spy a Spy.....wait what? That's all of the classes and now let's talk about gamemodes, there's CTF, Control Points, Payload, Payload Race, KOTH and Arena. Okay, I don't have to explain what this game is all about because this game is SO AWESOME, you'll have fun and download this game Play Team Fortress 2 a FPS Multiplayer Game that will keep you busy for hours and also get new weapons and last thing: There's hats for your classes to wear and also some Misc such as clothes now anyway DOWNLOAD THIS GAME AND HAVE SOME FUN!

review: Team Fortress 2, seems like such an understatement when I say I recommend this. It's probably my favorite game of all time with over 2000 hours logged on it. Even though people may not like the hats and new items, personally I think that's what keeps this game alive. Every time the game feels like it's getting boring or repetitive, they add something new that makes the game feel fresh and fun. This is the only game I think I'd ever give a perfect 10/10, because the game's always expanding. The community on the other hand, is quite a lot like the Sonic fanbase, and I'll just leave it at that. In conclusion, if you haven't played this game before, DO IT; I cannot stress that enough, download it and play it. It's free, but I highly recommend buying something in it at some point in time.

review: Basically a good first-time-game, if you want to play shooting games. Graphics are unique when you compare it to other team vs team games. A big shop with a lot of clothing and free weapons makes the game more interesting, in a way that the users can get creative and style their own characters. Nine classes, makes the game more challenging and less boring, as you can just switch class when you feel like it. The videos about the characters and their histories are absolutely terrific, and the medic is something you don't see in every game, as you heal with a medic-gun and shoots with this incredible "syringe shooting gun", where in other games it's often a character with a medic-back and often with normal (often normal) guns or in use of some type of magic. Also is the game always active with players and new products in store. In all is the game catchy and available for everyone. 5/5

review: Team Fortress 2. A great game believe it or not, and the best part...it's free. Now just because it's free don't think it'll be some crappy game that's insanely pay to win, because it's not. It uses a great F2P model (that was around 8 months before the game even went F2P). The model the game uses is that everything you buy is purely cosmetic, and the weapons you can buy from the mann co store, everyone else including you can find and craft ingame. The game has many things to offer, hell the game is 7 years old and has 7 years of great content in the game. Between the hundreds of hats and weapons in the game, you can literally customize your loadout to be completely different than other players. The game has 9 playable classes: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy. I know, the class names sound generic as hell, but anyways. The classes are broken down into three tiers. Offensive, Defensive, and Support. Scout, Soldier, and Pyro being offensive. Demo, Heavy, and Engineer being defensive, and Medic, Sniper, and Spy being support. Of course that doesn't mean that you can't play any of the classes differently. If you want to be an offensive sniper then you can do that, just use the huntsman. If you want to be a defensive demo then sit back and place sticky traps. Scout: Fast, agile, can double jump and get in and do serious damage and get away easily. Soldier: Slower, deals great damage with his rocket launcher and shotgun, can rocket jump to higher ground. Pyro: Pretty high health, can ambush with his flamethrowers and cause havoc. Demoman: Can place sticky traps, charge at you with huge f*cking swords, and simply p*ss you off. Heavy: Highest health count (300), slowest class, huge minigun to tear through people. Engineer: Same health as a scout, can build sentry guns to defend areas of the map, heal teammates and give ammo with dispensers and teleport teammates closer to battle with his teleporters. Medic: Very useful, can heal teammates and overheal them and upon full uber can make said person being healed including hisself invincible for a short period of time. Sniper: Can take out classes from long distances, same health as scout, pretty easy class. Spy: Same health as scout, can disguise as teammates AND enemy players, also can sap engineers buildings to destroy them, and can cloak to get away silently. I just described the classes in their vanilla form, there are literally thousands of ways to customize your classes to change their playstyles and it's amazing. Game Modes Team Fortress 2 has tons of gamemodes to play, and their are community made gamemodes and maps. Modes: Capture The Flag (ctf), Capture Point (cp), King Of The Hill (koth), Payload (pl), Payload Race (plr), territorial (basically cp, but slightly different), Special Delivery (SD), Mann Vs Machine (mvm), and Robot Destruction (map currently in beta, BUT you can play it) CTF and CP pretty much describe themselves for you, however the other modes are different and I will explain them. King Of The Hill: Hold a capture point for 3 minutes to win. Payload: Red has to stop Blu from pushing the cart to the objective and winning. Payload Race: Both teams have carts to push to an objective and have to stop the other team from capping at the same time. Territorial: Basically CP expect the map is divided into different sections. The map unlocks by whichever team caps first. Special Delivery: Basically like Capture The Flag, but you're delivering a package of Australium to a rocket. Mann Vs Machine: Horde mode, also Mann Up mode can give you awesome rare loot. Robot Destruction: Both teams work to get a certain amount of points by killng enemy teams robots or by stealing the others teams points from their vault and returning it to their own vault. Maps I'm not going into great detail with the maps, simply because there's way too many to just list off, but all the maps have a way different feel and are all pretty damn amazing besides Steel and Hydro. Team Fortress 2 in all honesty is a very good game, I've spent a lot of time on this game (over 2000 hours) in the past 4 going on 5 years I've owned it. Really you can't go wrong with this game. Just download it and give it a shot. It's pretty f*cking amazing. Rate: 9/10

review: Team Fortress 2 is a prime staple of a First-Person Shooter that balances "casual" and "competitive" gameplay very well. Since game sessions are fairly short, you can always drop into a game and play even if you only have a short amount of free time. If you like FPS games, different team roles, random item drops + crafting, and fun, action-packed gameplay, then you will really enjoy this game. As a Free to Play game, TF2 is one of the best of its kind available, and you can play without having to spend any money - it gets very tempting though, especially the more invested you get into the game. The aesthetics are fantastic, the character models are very well-done, and there is also a lot of detail in the environment. There are a multitude of different weapons and cosmetics (ex: hats, outfits, etc), allowing for huge character customization; however, most of these things must either be purchased with real money or traded (if you don't want to rely on the random item drops). The sound effects are good, and there really isn't any music, so I just play my own in the background. The character taunts and dialogue are great and comical. The controls are very straightforward and the learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with FPS games. There is a coaching option, where players can volunteer to train new players, and new players can be matched with any available coaches. This is a great option, considering that there is no real tutorial and playing against bots does not compare at all when playing against real opponents. Understanding the different character roles + equipment configuration (different loadouts can change your playstyle considerably) can take some time, but I personally find this part to be very fun. For example, you can equip the Demoman with a melee weapon (each character has a primary, secondary, and melee weapon), and give him a shield and special boots for his other weapon slots - this will effectively turn him into a whirlwind of melee death, so long as you are able to close the distance between yourself and your opponents (swords will give him a charge ability). This differs from his default loadout, where the Demoman can use his grenade launcher and also set up trigger-able mines. The gameplay is extremely fun, and there are a number of different game modes available - territory control, capture the flag (briefcase), and push the cart (get your cart to the other end of the level) to name a few. The different character types and equipment make for high replayability and can also make each match different in its own unique way. I strongly advise you to try out every character type at least a few times, as each class can be very fun (and complementing your team makeup is always helpful). The cosmetic items and weapons are fun to craft, and you may be very tempted to purchase a few things (basic items are very cheap on the market). If you don't want to spend money, there are frequent item drops that happen while you play, as well as achievement items that will be unlocked when you fulfill certain requirements. Overall, this is an excellent game that you should try if you are interested in multiplayer and/or FPS games, especially since it is F2P. If you aren't into those type of games, you should still try this out, since it is much easier for people to get into than say, Battlefield or Call of Duty (again, the perfect blend of casual and competitive elements makes this game very appealing for all types of gamers). Highly recommend! Cheers, DJSF

review: Team fortress 2, a game that removes all of my stress. Team fortress 2 is a game that is as great as the portress. You play on various maps, no matter what I always find it hilarious. You play as one of 9 mercenaries from different countries, on each map there is no gap, designed tactically so that every class can be able to kick some  equally. If you want you can go scout, to double jump about. With high speed, to fight hard with good dodging, and making them bleed! You can distract a sentry with a chug of bonk from another entry and with one konk from a mate that sentries fate is decided. Or grab the intel and run like hell has broken out in the area for fun. If scout is annoying and you want someone with a louder shout, you could go soldier the man who is as scary as a boulder, armed with a rocket launcher the results are grandly stauncher! You have multiple banners an trumpets, each with different manners of effect to protect your allies, or boost them to the enemies roost. Or if you're bored, get out a shovel and pulverize the enemy like they've been hiding in a hovel. But if you want to be a drunken scott, you certainly can and its as fun as being shocked by 1000 electrical watts! You fight with a grenade launcher and a bottle, or a blade if you want to add onto the throttle. Pull out the eyelander and charge'n'targe to pander to your sick barge. Fight your best to destroy whatever pest is attempting to melee fight, because clearly they weren't that bright to fight a drunken man who can stomp you like a tin can. Or if you want to dawn a gas mask for my favourite class, the pyro spewing fire to change enemy attire into ash, while you laugh and dash in to smash their heads with an axe. A psychopath who doesn't hesitate to unleash his wrath upon the map. Charred and scarred bodies in burning coal mines, which is probably costly in fines. But with flare in hand do you dare to land a critical strike, and extinguish your cohorts while they're burning like a shrike. Or to easily kill a tankier enemy just become a , with the sniper a foot blowing heads open from the root, of where you stand which I find very grand. The satisfaction from their reaction and watching the brain matter patter to the ground. You have a smg and a shield to help protect you in the field, but if thats not enough you got a machete for when things get tough. Or if you're normal you can be very formal, with jarate in a jar you chuck from far soaking the enemies in urine. Better yet do not fret, pick up a minigun and have a lot of fun. Mowing down the opposition with destructive suppression, enjoying a sandvich whenever you find yourself cornered in a ditch. Though it'd be wise to use it to help heal allies, cooperation is a major key to the enemies destruction. But if angry, break out a tangy steak, and go break an enemys face with your fist, each hit spilling so much blood like a huge mist. Or to become near immortal and quite vital to your teams survival, you could become the medic an interesting pick. You stay close to the group not wanting to stray, with a medigun in hand you run with your crew to ruin the enemy like a bad bowl of stew. With an ubercharge you make a huge barge. Critical strikes or ubercharges for real, which are very analytical when they deal true damage. If cornered don't get bothered get your ubersaw out and cut the enemy like a cat paw, use a crossbow when you need to allow for long range heal. A medical vow which Is very high brow, to do no harm but I laugh while making a human limb farm. If camping is what you prefer pardner, than look for farther. Be smarter and barter with sentries a lot of kills which fills my heart, watching so many die to my sentries like pennies on the sidewalk. You can help your cohorts with some teleports, teleporters ready to help steady the fight on the front which I'll be quite blunt, is wasted often because someone became somewhat too soften. Building them five steps away from spawn, a major thrive to a  swan. To aid the fight an supply the braid of the team, a dispenser can help condenser the teams health. But again it is wasted like a pasted chain, kept mostly beside the sentry to guard an entry instead of make a fight quite tight. But if its a bore grab a mini sentry and even the score, get in on the combat being as threatening as a gnat. But if you want to be subtle like a cuttle, pick up a watch and attempt to botch the enemys defenses, forcing them to hesitate their offenses. Disguise yourself and chastise the enemy for trusting you, before busting their spine with a fine knife to the back. Go through an odd entry, and sap the engies sentry. When he charges aim your ambassador, like a bally matador and headshot them right on the spot. Before cloaking away to enjoy more smoking while choking the tactics of the enemy. Gameplay is far from all but lets stray to a plot, which is quite an unexpected clot. It's very comedic like my relation to a Hasidic, in the form of comics on their website which are very great to some peoples plight, and I enjoy whatever they write, the fact the plot is good is an extra to be stacked on the many pact reasons to love it. The characters are just perfect like a group of barristers. And with trading that is never fading, you can get other material like games an such which I love a bunch, without it I don't doubt I'd have no bout with any other games to play. That aside I play it competitive as well I find it hard to get repetitive. To drop the rhyme for a moment, I have to be honest. Without this game, I'd of been bored so often. And I've met some of the greatest people, and my best friends through this game. No matter what I will love this game, I may have arrived late to the party only joining a few years ago, but I will always be happy to be a part of the team fortress 2 community. Otherwise can recommend.

review: This game is now 7 years old By rights this game should be relegated to the dark dank corners of the internet played by only a few die-hard geeks with fond memories of the days gone by Instead its now the internets premier hat collecting game, spawned a trading system only slightly less complex that a wall street derivatives trading unit, and added far more weapons, maps, and silly items than anyone can shake a stick at. Yes the game has its faults..... but I've never found any (except arena mode) and its cheered me up on more occasions when I've been down merely by enabling me to set fire to people without the risk of another long jail sentence

review: Want to play with a great community and skilled economy. Play TF2! The game where you could level up your stranges unbox unusuals and even yes even, taunt kill. Yes in this game you can die with style with the medic's ubersaw kill he literally impales you in no time at all. You thought i forgot about this but no i didn't Heavys finger blaster. PRepare to be fingered by the heavy and it will blow you away wit ha stunning killcam. Now i know what your thinkin. "Your crazy this game cant be that good." Oh but it can with the infinite number ofhats and taunt you can be the ultimate pokemon master..... wait wrong game. HAT MASTER!!! Also use backpack.tf when in trading cuz it could come in handy in trading. Team fortress 2 is the most updated with over 300+ updates and has been released since 2007 and is still on the top 3 list and is compatible with almost every computer (exept 98) Also the game has an abundance of classes to chose from to suit your playstyle. Scout the team postage stamp everywhere and anywhere, as long as you have aim and bonk atomic punch. Soldier (recomended for newbs) is a rocket launching General and was kicked out of the army for being "stupid" and has a rocket launcher a shottie and a shovel to dig your grave in. Now for a favourite, the pyro a flamewielding alien with no soul and has 3 weps (flamethrower, shottie, and axe) also the afterburn is op so use it when spies are around. Now for the Demoman an overpowered drunk scottish man with only one eye and can shoot grenade and sticky grenades. Also if your nice he would share a drink with you. with his beer bottle as his melee. Now for the Pootis.. i mean heavy with an abundance of humor and lack of chorus he will sing you to laughter and with his minigun if your mean, also he carries a shotgun and his fists as his melee to beat you down. Now for the engineer a texan who doesnt tell much about himself other than his close relationship with his machines (sentry, dispencer, and teleporters.) he likes to chill and drink beer while his sentry takes up the defendin the point/intel. MEDIC! MEDIC! MEDIC! here we go. this man lost his medical liscence and is a crazy doctor with his bonesaw, medigun, and his syringe gun to support his team. Everyone needs a medic support the team! Now for the sniper the hired assasin workin for the army (sort of) he takes out his sniper rifle and takes out enemies from across the map to sure his teammates safety. He carries a jar of "jarate" with him to reveal spies in the area so the team is aware or the sniper can take him out with his knife. Finally we have the Spy a man who knows secrets nobody knows he carries a knife and could make a costume party if he wanted to. He can be you or me, he can even be *BOOM*. The spy comes with a knife, pistol, disguise kit, and a sapper for enemy buildings to take out their defences. As a spy you need to stay low so the enemys are unaware of your presence. Just watch out for pyros. Anyway thats my review i love the game nearly put 1000 hours into it and one more thing. MANN VS MACHINE is the zombies mode for tf2. That is all that needs explaining for now i just wrote a book and if you read all this congrats. IF you thought my review was helpful or you want to meet me friend me we can talk about it Thanks for reading!

Use certain weapons/classes with a degree of teamwork against the enemy team with a decent plan of attack or tactics, and score a win for your team. That's what this game used to be. Now the game is all about the microtransactions for flashy weapons and useless cosmetics. It has been transformed into a virtual shopping mall for kids and autistic manchildren.

review: This game is a must have for 12 year olds with low self esteem. Seriously if you have the maturity of a 12 year old child and want the opportunity to make yourself feel better about your crummy life by belittling people on an online multiplayer fps game then download this game right now. I have experienced many times on this game absolutely disgusting behaviour from other players in the community. It is sad. It is sad knowing that there are so many children growing up in this world who show complete and utter ignorance, unprovoked to people they do not even know. For instance: A kid said this to a friend of mine while in a match. Hey liked how I wrecked you last round? (No reply from my friend) Oh what you got nothing to say? Must be too poor to buy a mic. (So poor yet he owns a computer right?) (I then attempt to kick this child from the game for his ignorance) Random other guy who must have been this childs friend starts. What the f#$% you trying to do? (My vote to kick the initial child fails) (They try and kick me) Shouts Kick this f@#$^% out of here he's trying to send me pictures of his d$%^ (I get kicked). Now I don't care about being kicked out of a game. There are many other lobbies I can join to play and try to have fun on. What I care about is how completely toxic the community is on this game. Yeah I get it, it is the internet you have to at some point accept the reality that there are many trolls and immature children out there. The problem for me is not ignoring it and moving on. The problem is when I, like many others, sit down to relax in their spare time and try to have fun playing a team based game get put into situations of unpleasant, abusive, conflict constantly it becomes something besides fun and enjoyment but rather stressful and disturbing. Literally every server will have people on that have nothing better to say besides overused insults. There is absolutely no need for it. There is not a single thing that requires someone to be a complete piece of trash in order to have fun or even be good at a video game. It ruins everything video games are meant to be about. Besides the absolutely toxic community in which you cannot really change in anyway there are other issues. The game is goofy with it's cartoon style which is a hint that you should not take it too seriously. If you find yourself taking tf2 seriously then that is the point in time that you should uninstall it. Trust me once you start taking the game seriously you will degrade yourself by involving yourself with the toxic players, you will lose money, you will lose friends and you will no longer enjoy something you once did. I realized this after seeing how much I spent on the game, the situation I explained above and when I started to become frustrated at people dancing around the spawn wasting time (which should be the fun of it yet it became annoying). Looking at the lucrative micro transaction style system involved, it is at least how I see it addicting. Who wants to use ugly stock weapons when they can open crates to get fancy shiny ones or simply buy them? Constantly buying more keys, to open more crates, in the hopes of getting something valuable to get your money back or make a profit (it hardly ever happens). It is exactly like gambling and the risk is greater than the reward. You may get an unusual hat but what does that actually do for you? Can you sell it and make a profit? Yes. Can you withdraw that money and buy yourself a bike, or a baseball bat, or pay the rent and bills? Nope. Every dime you spend on this game is forever invested into Steam. So you don't really make anything off of buying and trading these types of virtual items and they do not improve your skills in the game or increase your enjoyment. It gives you this false sense that you did but in the end it eats your money and that is it's only purpose. Spending money on games like this is okay if you really feel like it will bring you enjoyment but fair warning it can end up costing you a significant amount of money especially if you do not know what you are doing. I let myself became consumed in this system and have spent much more than I should ever have with next to nothing to show for in the end. I regret spending any money on this game on the virtual items especially now that I have lost my enjoyment of the game. Overall I had fun. 800 hours on a free to play game in my opinion made it worth it. What I realize now though is that games like this are only as fun as the people you play them with. I started seeing a significant amount of toxic players no matter what server I was on and that killed my enjoyment. Listening to people constantly insult each other over nothing gets tiring. I guess maybe I am just at an age where I have to move on to another saga of gaming to find more enjoyment. Will I miss playing tf2? Probably not now that I have expanded my game library. Will I play it again? Likely but only for an hour or two here and there just to have fun. I will never invest my time, like I used to, back into this game because it is really not worth it. I would recommend if you want to have some fun (100-500 hours) try Team Fortress 2 out, BUT my warning and the point of my review, DO NOT invest a significant amount of time and/or money into this game. It is really not worth it once you become tired of the toxic community. Everything you worked on getting will increase your disappointment when you make the decision to stop playing the game.

review: Team Fortress 2 Is One Of The Best Multiplayer Games I've Ever Played. It Does Take Time Out Of My Life But I'm Glad It Was Something Fun. With Unlockable Weapons + Wearable Costemics, TF2 Lets You Kill Others In Style. Each Class Has Their Own Personalty, As Shown In Meet The Team Series + The Great Music That Valve Made For The Series Too. The Teams, RED + BLU Have Very Nice Colors + With Names Tag, That Let You Rename, Hats + Weapons. Each Slot (Offense/Defence/Support) Have 3 Classes, Showing What They Do Best. I Would Highly Recommend This Game To Anyone.

It's hard to grasp the trading and crafting and other stuff when you're just a beginner at this, but the point of this game is pretty simple; just kill the enemy. There's different game types, Payload, Control Points, just to name a few. It's action-packed and and great fun with friends. I highly recommend it.

Blaming on teammates and your computer are also included as well in the package and you get to meet some rare species such as the vocal commands spamming dude, the guy calling everybody a noob and of course the 9 year old kid who needs to talk constantly. You will find very balanced skilled-classes like the mini sentry engineer and the sticky spamming demoman. Overall a pretty mediocre game, would definitely recommend.

review: Of all the 300 odd games I have, I've played this one more than all the others combined (as of 7/2013), which says a lot about this game's quality and replayability. In my opinion it's one of the best tycoon games ever, as you work your way up the ladder of hats and unusuals, but instead of earning money proportional to the quality and quantity of your hats, you have to play a cute FPS minigame to earn basic items, that you can use to trade your way up to more hats. This is an interesting take on the tycoon formula, but puts more focus on economy and trading, and obviously works well for this game. 10/10, would wear hats again.

A fast guy comin' to beat you up with a bat! that's a skull fracture for sure :P) Heavy (Fatty big man coming at you with a Machinegun! he is the Big and slow but powerful one.he has a MachineGun,Shotgun and beats you with his fists) Pyro (If you like flames / Burning people this is the one for you! He has a Flamethrower,Shotgun and a Fireaxe) Sniper (He is a long range only type of class,though he can fight melee also but is bad at it at the start,He has a Sniper rifle,SMG and a Kukri) Soldier (He is pretty good,he is fully derp and has a Rocket launcher.He can Rocketjump and other things,He has an Rocketlauncher,Shotgun and Shovel) and last but not least,The Engineer! (He can build sentries and dispenser that can give health and Teleporters.The spy can Sap enginners buildings with his Sapper which in many cases destroys them,But the engineer can destroy sappers by slapping it with his wrench.The engineer has a Shotgun,pistol,wrench,a build PDA and a destroy PDA) Have fun in the game of Team Fortress 2.Bye and good luck!

review: Team Fortress 2 is an awsome FPS (and TP) Game, it has some weapons from the future, some of them are historical, someof them are existing today... And there are cool gamemodes too! Like Control points (cp_) Payload (pl_) King of The Hill (koth_) and Sd_. Let me explain one of them: Control points is a Team Fortress gamemode, and the most popular C.P. maps are cp_gorge and cp_dustbowl. The gamemode is simple: the Re team is defending, and the Blu team is attacking. The Blu team's goal is to stand on the Control points for a time. The red team's job is to prevent the Blu team for "controlling" a point. Usually, control point maps have 2-3 Control points, but there are C.P. maps which have 4-5 points too! The other gamemodes are good too, so go and check them out for yourself, in the great world of Team Fortress 2! ~By: =[o.W.n.]= Kirito

Team work is what makes the game, hence the name "team" fortress 2, you have to learn that you can't just go kill a whole team by yourself, it ain't gonna work that way.

review: Hat Simulator 2014 is an interesting, engaging game where you trade hat for hat, hat for key, key for hat, hat for metal, metal for hat, and metal for key, and much more. Also has FPS elements but nobody cares about them. Get Hat Simulator 2014 today for a true hat experience like you never could in real life.

review: It's a First Person Shooter, and seems famous with all the players roaming around. Sometimes the community is good, and I like how this allows voice chat, even though I don't use it, and sometimes kids are annoying. Practically, I like it because it has 9 classes. Overall the 9 classes, some have a certain job and place to be. For example, Spy would hide in enemy lines while Sniper would hide behind team lines. I like how the gameplay is somewhat balanced, like how Heavy has alot of health, but is slow and sometimes an easy target for Spies, whil being a bullet magnet, and Medic can heal from a distance. But I like the different gameplay as there are Slender servers out there, and they're fun to play. Overall, I like it because it has 9 classes which are somewhat balanced, an FPS, and social gameplay.

review: Team Fortress 2 is, at heart, a gloriously simple game that's been created with style, panache and an undeniable love of gaming. It's the kind of game that you want to show to people who don't play games so that they understand and then either get involved or go away. There is life before Team Fortress 2, and there is life after. After is better.The action is fast-paced and furious, the game's presentation is hilarious and exciting and the gameplay is very easily approachable.Team Fortress 2 is a beautifully designed game with a visual style reminiscent of old Warner Brothers cartoons, and battles that combine strategy with frenetic action.

review: After playing this game for a while now, I would recommend this to anyone. It has a competitive side, casual minigames, the vanilla is extremely fun, and tons of hilarious moments. When you light someone on fire, and they try to give you a high five, it just adds to the overall fun and experience of the game. With constant updates and new items, Valve is ensuring players stay interested. As mentioned above, there are some funny group or solo taunts, that can be traded for in the games expansive trading economy. Also, hats. Hats are worth a lot, and valuable in trade. They are fun to collect and allow you to make your character look as ridiculous as possible. However, new players be warned, don't expect a shoot-em-up style game, as it takes numberous amounts of good meatshots to kill somebody, or a few rockets. Weapons are vastly different than other games nowadays, and take skill to learn to use effectively. So be prepared to have fun, wear hats, and hone your abilities with flamthrowers, rockets, miniguns, and even A FISH?!?!?!

review: In this game, you can: 1. Rocket Jumping 2. Extinguish teammates with a flammable gas 3. Double jump, and change direction in mid-air 4. Absorb 3 rocket strikes, and die by a single knife 5. Picks up a weapon made out of ice, and gets ammo for flamethrower 6. Immune to headshots when you wear hats 7. Fall down 100 feet without breaking anything 8. Heals rocket wounds with 1 tiny sandvich 9. Use a hammer to precisely remove a electronic jammer wired into a machine 10. So what are you waiting for? IT'S COWARD KILLING TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review: Tf2 is a fast paced game with a crtoony look and will make you lagh so much on how stupide the custom made gamemodes are. But if you want to get serious you can buy hats and wepons to look good and get a head of the game. Finally if dont want to pay at all just keep playing and youll find tons of items whe you die.

review: A really dumb FPS focused around hats, sandviches and conga-lines. I highly recommend it. (In all seriousness though I had never played a FPS before TF2, they all seemed boring, dull and over-competitive. TF2 is not like that. All the classes are hilarious and full of character, it has a thriving and friendly community, and there are weapons suited to every play style. No class is better than another. Everyone should give it a go if you haven't already.)

review: As one of my most played games of all time, Team Fortress 2 is an incredidibly original and fun FPS. It not traditional, in a way. But I can honestly say no other game has come as close as being as fun as TF2. I mean, you know when a game is good when it has it's own economy. Anyway, play TF2. It's free, it's fun, and it doesn't pull too much out of your pockets like other "Free to Play Games".

review: Team Fortress 2 Is One Of The Best Multiplayer Games I've Ever Played. It Does Take Time Out Of My Life But I'm Glad It Was Something Fun. With Unlockable Weapons + Wearable Costemics, TF2 Lets You Kill Others In Style. Each Class Has Their Own Personalty, As Shown In Meet The Team Series + The Great Music That Valve Made For The Series Too. The Teams, RED + BLU Have Very Nice Colors + With Names Tag, That Let You Rename, Hats + Weapons. Each Slot (Offense/Defence/Support) Have 3 Classes, Showing What They Do Best. I Would Highly Recommend This Game To Anyone.

review: This game excells in being a great classic red VS blue game, with all of its customization and new features being released (which i love about games), it gives you a variety of playstyles from being a spy relying on your cloak, or a spy who relies on his disguise and backstabs. The main feature of this game is basically a TDM or Capture the flag style game, or even holiday events where red and blue will sometimes gang up to kill a boss. I don't actually have much to say about this game other than that it is a really good game that takes 2 teams fighting, to a whole new style of gaming. Overall i would rate this game a 9/10.

review: I predict this game will be alive for another 6-8 years. Dies both from from old blood AND outdated code. Also because it's not WoW. ... wait a minute... Anyway, when it dies, I also predict that in later years when talking about this game people will joke around about the fuc king hats (it's such a great platform for jokes, isn't it?) and not the great balance and fun possibilities this game had. The *TEAM* play, the impact it had on us, as experienced gamers, and the new ones - which started when the game was around, with the game. The money Gabe made with this game. Truly a successful game by all elements and terms. Don't talk about hats.

review: Well hello, my name is Esau (ryhmes with seesaw). Ive been playing games for a while, wether its been console or pc or handheld. But there was one game that stuck out for me. It was Team Fortress 2. This game literally made my life what it is today. I downloaded it and booted it up and immediately fell in love. So far ive put over 2k hours into this game and ive made such amazing friends that its hard to believe its a video game. Rayne, Jade, Fluffy, Krys, Reindeer, Walrus, ing noir, and Gawd. You guys in particular have made my life so god damn amazing. Thanks. But now i have to leave this game. Ive played it for many a good time and i think its time to pack it up and move on. What will i replace it with? I have no idea. Maybe ill fall in love with Overwatch. Maybe ill start playing Indie games, maybe ill go full time CS:GO. But whatever it is i want to thank this game. It literally morphed my life and i plan to take advantage of the things its given me. I now have a love for my friends and gaming. So yeah. Thanks. Bye.

review: After long hours of gameplay in Team Fortress 2, and after playing every single mode in the game (except a few mods), I guess it's time to do the review! :3 The game is very unique. In everything. It's not everyday you see a game which you have to choose between 9 different classes, with unique abilities for steal out some kills. It's not everyday you find a game with crazy guys hired to kill each other, just because silly brothers. It's not everyday you see the both silly brothers being killed by their lost brother and then starting a war for get the company. It's not everyday you find out a game where you have to kill a lot of hordes of robots made by the crazy lost brother. ...Seriously, TF2 has even story behind the mercenaries protecting briefcases, pushing giant bombs and capturing points. Also fighting not-so-smart robots. It's not only about the hats (actualy), it's the gameplay! It's not the same thing in comparison with others FPS's. Entering even more inside the game, you can discover more random stuff, like the in-game fads. That's what attract more players, in my opinion. And for being a F2P game, everyone can enjoy the randomness of Teufort! And don't think the F2Players will only noob: some Gibus guys will dance over your corpse in-game. I'm being serious. Curious now? :D Get the game. Doesn't have space in the computer? At least get some "culture" of the game. Don't know where to start? Watch all the "Meet the Team", pay a visit to the TF2 Official Wiki and check out the most famous TF2 fads. Two famous ones are Demopan and Painis Cupcake. ;D Meet ya around Teufort!

review: Team Fortress 2 is a simply phenomenal title if you're looking for a Free to Play First Person Shooter. It has nine classes which are distinctly different in how they look and play, and there are dozens upon dozens of weapons you can unlock either through simply playing the game and getting free drops, crafting them, earning certain items through achievements, or trading other players for them. These unlocks can further change the way you play a class allowing for even more variety. One class has the ability to be a bomb wielding maniac, or use a magic, head collecting sword and shield to slice off heads. There are 50 official maps, and 10 different game modes. Variety is the spice of life, and Team Fortress 2 certainly has variety. It can be daunting to get into considering just how much there is to learn, but it's worth the investment.

review: I've always historically been terrible at shooters of any kind, so why do I love TF2? The answer is very simple. This game is so non-sensical, so seditiously idiotic, and so unreliant on actual gun-play that I CAN be good at this, and still say "Im terrible at shooters" Basic gameplay boils down to strategiclly (or mindlessly) killing the opposing team with a selection of weapons that range from: fish, milk, soda, syringe guns, golf clubs, shoes, and stylish (or not so stylish) hats In fact, this game should just be called Hat Simulator

Since the game is Free to Play now you need to try it out.

review: This is an amazing game to play. I got it using the Orange Box Pack. I was planning on using it only for Half Life 2, but noticed that I enjoy the Team Fortress 2 game a bit more! It is an infinately addicting game, with easy multiplayer, and plenty of maps. I give them 6 stars, if possible. XD

review: This is by far the best Free to Play Game ever Made. TF2 Is More than just a Hat Simulator. Its a Hat Simulator with Guns! No Seriously, TF2 is Awesome. It Features 9 Classes which are All Needed to make a Perfect Team. (Except for Pyro. No one needs Pyros). It does have it Bad Sites because the Game is sometimes full of COD Kids who only Choose Pyro and also the Medic which is Highly Needed is Very Unpopular. Most People wont get that its TEAM Fortress 2 and not KILL EVERYONE ON THE FIELD Fortress 2. Also, The Trading is a VERY Big Part of TF2. So TF2 is VERY Different from Shooters like COD, Battlefield or Halo. I Recommend it. Highly.

review: Let me start off, with another review of a good awesome game. Team Fortress 2. The best game ever. Team Fortress 2 is an online game, basically about 2 groups of mercenary fighting for victory, or stuff. One team is called 'Red' and one is called 'Blu', yes, 'Blu', not Blue. (BUILDING LEAGUE UNITED) Or I think thats what it stands for. Team Fortress 2, is an online first person shooter games, with not only basic default weapons, but many, lots, and lots of different weapons! Some can be made, some can be recieved through boxes, which can be unlocked with keys. You can get keys by either buying them or getting them in-game. Also by playing in a server and simply PLAYING in that particular server, you might get random weapons! Some might be bad, some might be good, and some might be awesome. And thats how I got most of my cool weapons. Personally, the only downside I see of this game is that you need about 13 GB of RAM Space, which is quite big for my mac laptop, but, thats for me! And Team Fortress 2 has alot of player-made server in it, and theyre not made up of bots, but actual real players. It has 9 different classes, The Scout, Spy, Sniper, Medic, Heavy, Pyro, Engineer, Demoman and the Soldier. All of them has separate, and different weapons with different stats. I guess thats all I have to tell to you guys, and oh, also you can play this offline in 'Training mode'. Well thats all I have to say now! (THERE ARE ALSO EVENTS!!!!!) (AND YOU CAN BUY STUFF FOR REAL MONEY IN TF2!!!!)

review: An economical simulator which will make you want to pay to look cooler than everyone else and will make you want to spend more time to be better and make people rage. Blaming on teammates and your computer are also included as well in the package and you get to meet some rare species such as the vocal commands spamming dude, the guy calling everybody a noob and of course the 9 year old kid who needs to talk constantly. You will find very balanced skilled-classes like the mini sentry engineer and the sticky spamming demoman. Overall a pretty mediocre game, would definitely recommend.

review: Of all the 300 odd games I have, I've played this one more than all the others combined (as of 7/2013), which says a lot about this game's quality and replayability. In my opinion it's one of the best tycoon games ever, as you work your way up the ladder of hats and unusuals, but instead of earning money proportional to the quality and quantity of your hats, you have to play a cute FPS minigame to earn basic items, that you can use to trade your way up to more hats. This is an interesting take on the tycoon formula, but puts more focus on economy and trading, and obviously works well for this game. 10/10, would wear hats again.

review: "The most fun you can have online." True to the last word. Add to this the fact that TF2 is free - it makes for a great deal! :D I bought the game along with The Orange Box via retail, so I have a premium account; and boy, is it worth it. Though there isn't a lot of difference in free and premium, you should buy it (I recommend the orange box - it costs like USD15 when bought via retail in India, and just USD15 for 5 games is awesome!). The multiplayer game modes including King of the Hill, Payload, Control Points, are all great. The team behind this game releases new game modes as free updates at times (the Halloween game mode) - these "extra" game modes are epic! You aren't even restricted to one set of weapons, you can keep collecting weapons via random drops or craft them; almost every weapon in the game is obtainable in this way, excluding limited edition ones, etc. The new co-op mode (Mann vs Machine) has added a whole new dimension to the gameplay. THUMBS UP!

review: Team Fortress 2- Absolutely no words can express what I feel about this game. Main reason is I have mixed feelings about this game. Its a great First Person Shooter game, with many servers allowing you to customize your character. The downside to this game is the creator's will to continuosly aim the game towards a money-making process. So much of this game is money-oriented, its quite sad and ruins the cartoonish aspect the game provides. But besides that, this is one great game that would not disappoint. Through the hours I have logged, I have spent countless hours playing competitively, casually, and even just sitting there and helping coach other players. Its a fun game, and I really do love the time playing it. The cartoonish feeling and effect has a major voice in my opinion. Reason being is just that after coming home from a long day of work, the cartoonish characters, with all their personalities, is a real pleasure to see. Would recommend you get it. (Its free!)

My dad overheard me and calls me a n00b. I call him a console peasent. He slaps me and sends me to bed. It's cold now, and my face hurts. I feel a warmth come towards me.. It Gaben! I was so happy! He kneels down beside me and hands me a game called "Team Fortress 2" I begin to play it. I see that everyone is wearing hats. I buy some and Gaben lets out a mighty roar. My dad walks in and sees Gaben. 'Your wallet's empty now" He flies out of my window. Gaben is love, Gaben is life... 11/10 Supah MLG

review: What I think of the Game: Its alright I guess, I mean there are some flaws like hackers and such. But its not bad really. Its basically for anyone. To all the destructive people out there play as the Soldier or the Demoman or the Pyro. For all those people who love to help out to be the team player, play some Medic or Engineer. A little story I wrote for Team Fortress 2. Once upon a time, a little boy named Jimmy had finally got himself playing some "Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2" and he said to himself. "Gee, I wish people aren't so mean and hateful of other people!" and so Gaben flew into little Jimmy's window on a unicorn with laser eyes with armor made of Chuck Norris Beard hair, and so Gaben took little Jimmy on an little adventure into the world, of Team Fortress 2. He showed him ctf_2fort a magical place to live (if you are a maniac who has a barn full of guns.) and he showed him the magical-ness of Team Fortress 2. Little Jimmy couln't believe what is going on so he fell asleep and the next morning he gathered all his lunch money and bought himself so many hats he became! A hat lord! Something truely amazing!(Not) So he went on and bought even more which made Gaben very happy. The End Basic Steps: Launch Team Fortress 2 Get on a server Buy hats Buy even more hats Rename Team Fortress 2: "Hat simulator" Give it the "Game of the Year award" fifty times Eat Sleep Play Anyways, to be mature about this. Team Fortress 2 is a wonderful game which players can interact with each other. Either by relentlessly murdering them or just giving each other high fives. It has many game modes like Capture the Flag(Briefcase) or Control Points. It really gives players control over many things. There has been other things like custom community content or Mann vs. Machine. It also has many abilities to make players smarter. Each class requires you to play differently everytime. I would recemend Team Fortress 2 to many people. But I don't have that kind of communication. Although you'll first end up as a Free To Play you'll soon invest some cash into the game. Word of advice: If you get the Ghostly Gibus, Throw it away. People will criticize you for it. All of all things enjoy the game don't just mess around, time will fly way past your head if you do. But you might find yourself addicted to it after a while. That has been my review hope it helped you!

review: It's almost hard to review this game. Most of what I say has been said many times before. This is an amazing game. Despite any glitches or bugs this game has, it is always fun. It has an incredibly unique multiplayer fps experience that is absolutely unrivaled. It doesn't even really compare to CoD, Battlefield, or Counter Strike. Valve never lets players down with new content and is always changing any sort of metagame or unused aspect. This is the shortest way I can describe how great this game is, and for free it is almost impossible to not at least try it. Give it a go if you haven't. It might not be for everyone, but you won't know unless you try.

review: Team Fortress 2, some people call it TF2, just in case you didn't know what they meant when they would say TF2. its massively multiplayer, first person, action, shooter, and just plain fun. You play as a character of 9 choices and fight the blue or red team to the death! Do I prefer this? Yes. It is a stunning massively multiplayer team selection game that anybody can get into. I don't know a single person who doesn't play this. If this isn't convincing enough for you to get it (it's probably not), then you should watch some of the trailers, they are hilarious. The best part about Team Fortress 2 is that it isn't $20, not $15, not $10, not $5, and not even $1. It is free. This amazing game that evrybody loves and is talking about is free. So go and get it! Nothing stopping you!

review: This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes. At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'. Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve. 'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, "Mann Up", gives rewards upon completing a "tour". In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available. In addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them. The game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since November 2007 and I still return to the game on a regular basis.

review: Ok lets start with the pros so team fortress 2 is all about team work even when you dont know that your working you are because you are doing the objective secoundly you can customize you charcter with cosmetics such as hats and clothing there are many hats and some can get pretty expensive unless you earn them in game they can go as high as 145 $ yay thats expensive and lastly for the pros each chacter has its ups in down i dont wanna get to deep in but they each are unique now lets head over to the cons now there can sometimes be bugs and glitchs but besides the point it kind of like a freemium game with u having to buy things if you want more but thats an option there are many game modes in tf2 incudeing the new mvm i think this is just a great game so if you have a chance check it out and im giving this game a 9 out of 10 check it out and thanks for reading this review

review: Fun addictive, great gameplay and just downright cool game. though i must say i wish it was easier to find weapons and other cosmetic items but once you become a premium member im sure thats no longer an issue. I personally hope that they add a new character to the game something like the engineer where he can place down support, but without the permanant effect but the trade off is his is stronger in some way.

review: Alright, there might be some people with some problems with my opinion. This game was good until updates just came by and stuffed TF2's er3ctum with hats. I mean, so far I've only seen hats then some more hats, but then maybe by a little chance. Some weapons. But also. Trading... it screwed my life over. I started with trading a bit later and it was fun. Til I actually got this massive drop from MvM and got scammed by someone. So I started with the real serious trading. I traded for a year to get one single worthless unusual and people trying to scam me all of the time and if I didn't accept someone offer they kept calling me for a scammer/sharker. In my opinion is... this game was a good game once, but it isn't anymore. I'm leaving this game forever, it have wasted so much of my life that there isn't a single chance that I will jump back into the hole of darkness. My last words will be.... SO LONG SUCKERS!!!

review: This game is a must for ANY fans of FPSs or shooters for that matter. I wish most FPSs were half as good as this game is. It's free-to-play. Got that? FREE... and guess what? NO IN-GAME PURCHASES THAT MAKE YOU BETTER. This game is in NO way a P2W (Pay-To-Win) game, it is in it's whole goodness a free game that's easy to pick up and play, easy to start off with and always fun to play. The game has 9 different balanced classes that are excellent both in design and in gameplay, with each one changing your team's options of beating the enemy. With tons of weapons that can be gotten freely without paying, and are completly balanced, the game keeps throwing options of changing your playstyle. This game is great no matter what kind of player you are. Like to take it easy? Go as a sniper. Want to rush in and out before anyone notices and get in the enemy's faces? Go scout. Or do you feel like punching somebody in the face? Well guess what, there's a class for you (It's the heavy). With plenty of character, plenty of options, plenty of weapons and plenty of hours of fun in it, this game will not disappoint when you play it. So have fun!

review: (IF PARENTS ARE READING TO SEE IF THIS GAME IS OK FOR YOUR CHILD SKIP TO THE BOTTOM) Since nobody has written a serious review and your probably biting your fingernails whether or not you should dowload this game I will. I may just have 67 hours but that is still a lot of experience. TF2 (Team Fortress 2) is a class based game. The Spy- He has the ability to disquise himself has one of the enemy team members. He also has the ability to cloak and get out of situations. There are also unlockables in the game. To name a few of Spy's he has a Your Eternal Reward. You lose your disquising kit but upon a succesful backstab you instantly disquise as them. Aslo dead ringer where you can fake your own death. The Medic- He is probably the most important class in competitive play. He has the abllity to heal teamates quickly, has an insanely awesome melee arsenal, and can build up a ubercharge while healing teamates to make both of you invincible at the same time. Medic also has unlockables. The Sniper- Just as he sounds. A headshot with his hlfway charged sniper will nearly gurantee an instant kill (unless it is a heavy) Sniper also has a good melee arsenal and his secondary isnt very good. Trade it out for a Razorback. Prevent spies from backstabbing you the first time while your scoping in, or jarate, throw pee at enemies to make them vulnerbal to mini crits with your sniper or melee weapon. The Demoman- He has a gernade launcher which can be powerful at some points, he also has a sticky launcher. It shoots sticky bombs at any surfac e and you can right click to make them explode. His melee arsenal is awesome too. (Actually nearly every class has an awesome melee) The eyelander. Chops enemy heads off and blood splattering everywhere. Also onee secondary is a shield which gives yiu the power to charge at enemies at a ridicoulousy (pardon my english) fast speed. You dont need to equip that in order to do that either so the charge and eyelander are a great mix. Oh and did I mention that he can stickky jump. shoot two stickies on the ground. Hover over and jump and blow them up at the same time to fly around the map. FLIPPING AWESOME. The Heavy- This class has the most health and firepower in the game and the slowest. You might be thinking well he is overpowered. Especially if he is paired with a medic. But he is not, It is not likely you can take him on your own. But maybe a soldier there and a sniper there perhaps and demoman and medic there can take him down. It requires teamwork. Note with that many people it will probably take 5-10 seconds to take him down unless he is paired with a medic then 15-20 seconds. The heavy's main is a minigun and all he has is miniguns for his primary and thats AWESOME. I love miniguns. The heavy's secondary is a shotgun (Looks awkard in his humongous hands) or a sandvich (Tasty loooking sandwich) Which can heal him if he is low on health and there are no medics nearby. Aslo his melee is his FISTS. You can equip him bare fisted or have a vairety of boxing gloves for him. The Engineer.- Perhaps his loadout is not the most important but his abilities are. The Engineer's main is a bunch of different shotguns (note when I say different weapons those weapons can be completely different with there different powers) some wrenches (for his awesome creations) and a pistol. Now he has a currency which is metal. If you pull out your contruction PDA you can build a sentry, dispensers, and a teleporter entrance and exit. First of you start with 200 metal (That is the max metal u can have) You should build a dispenser first. The dispenser can supply you with metal, health and ammo, it will aslo supply your teamates with health and ammo so thats cool. Then you can level your dispenser to a level 2 and 3 to supply you and your teamates faster. Now build your sentry (130 metal I think) It starts off as a small sentry but if you hit it with your wrench you can level it up to a ultra machine gun sentry. Level 3 includes rockets with your machine gunning sentry. But watch out for any suspicous teamates. They could be a spy and they could sap your sentry and destroy it. (I forgot to mention the spy could do that sorry) Same for your dispensers and teleporters. Now on to teleporters. when your playing a gamemode like Attack/Control when you respawn it can be a painful trip to walk to the frontlines. So you can build a teleporter! Build your entrance and exit. But dont forget to level them up to level 3 because there are charges between teleports (which can be dreadfully long) The good part is you dont need to level them up seperately. As you level up your exit your entrance levels up so thats cool. The Scout- He is the fastest class but has the least health. THE SPEED IS MUCH LIKE QUAKE. I like to think of Scouts primary as his speed because it is very lethal to other slow moving classes but his primary is a epic shotgun arsenal whether it has an insane knockback or a crazy mini crit in close quarters it is going to punish you for messing with you but if you manage to push him back he will just finish you off with his pistol. His melee is awesome like the sandman. If you charge it up you can hit a ball at an enemy and stun them (They cannot shoot and walk faster) for a moment. The scout is important for capturing points because he captures points twice as fast as other classes. The Soldier- His main weapon is a rocket launcher! Then a shotgun or buff banner which can momentarily grant you and nearby teamates mini crits with every shot that the enemies deal, but requires to be charged. There are other like the rocket boots too. His melee arsenal on the other hand is terrible. Just stick with the stock shovel they give you. Though the soldier doesnt sound like much he is very important and can go on sprees but his most important ability is rocket jumping. Go find a youtube video of it. Type in "TF2 Rocket Jumping and find a video. It's hard to explain. The Pyro- His primary is the flamethrower, a shotgun or different flare guns, and some good melee weapons. He is porbably one of the most feared classes on the field especially for spies. If they are disquised in accidentally walk into the crossfire of a pyro's flamethrower it can reveal his diquise. The meet the pyro video is self explanatory. Trading-Now this game has a very unique trading system. With metal being the currency. People trade hats for metal, key or buds. Trading servers are your best chance for selling something like a bills hat but sometimes you can just go on regular servers. Find some trading guides for more information Game Modes- There are games like Payload where you escort a bomb to a location where it will blow up Attack/Control where one team defends some points or attacks them Payload Race Just like Payload except there are two of them and you have to race each other King of the Hill It's just plain King of th Hill Capture The Flag You just capture each other's flag Special Delivery Deliver a pack of Australium to a rocket ship There are also special game modes like Halloween that come out every holdiday Let me know if I forgot one abd by the way I have no favorite I jump around to every game mode once in a while The Store- The sotre is where you can buy every item in the game. Hats are the most popular and people are obsessed with them. They basically dont play Team Fortress 2 but Hat Fortress 2 9/10 cuz of squeakers with mics and ocasional crashes PARENTS READ There are no cuss words in the game itself but the community does, People have mics and can cuss or use the chat system in game. But you can easily mute their mic or the chat. Look it up fi you want to know how. There is a LOT of gore and when I mean gore I mean body parts flying everywhere and blood splattering. There is no setting to censor this BUT there is this item called the Pyrovision Goggles. You can get this by buying them on the Mann Co- Store for like .99. Hope this helped!

The pyro lighting people on fire, and trying to talk to his teamates. The demoman planting stickybombs while being drunk. The heavy firing bullets everywhere and eating sandviches. The engineer making buildings to defend the intelligence. The medic healing teamates and shouting words in german. The sniper headshotting everyone who comes out of spawn. And finally the spy being a backstabbing heavies, medics, and snipers. That is what i like about Team Fortress 2.

review: This game has been a constant source of entertainment for me for a long time. It is a lot of fun for the competitive gamer, the casual player, or any junior economist. Not only is the shooter gameplay fun as all hell, the trading and the economy will keep you coming back to find that ONE GUY WHO WILL BUY YOUR SMOKING STATELY STEEL TOE UGHH This game has been around for a long time, and in my opinion, it is starting to die a little. The developers have choices, now. Should they keep satisfying dumb hype, or should they change the game entirely? Needs: New gamemodes New maps Better support for competitive All in all though, if you have not played this game yet, you need to. It's a game that, while kinda hard to understand at first, will definitely keep you coming back for more. Team Fortress 2 is an experience that all gamers need to try at least once... or twice... ...or forever... 9/10 would be 10/10, but devs are slacking

review: I strongly reccomend TeamFortress2 (TF2)! The game is perfect. It has many different playing styles, you can never get bored of it. Every class is well balanced and requires different skills. Some may say the graphics aren't that good, but that really isn't the most important thing in a game, is it? Anyway, TF2 is amazing, there's thousands of different ways to play! TF2 also has a really nice charm to it. It's not just a bland boring army game, the characters are colorful, and actually seem to be legit characters, which is hard to find nowadays. The whole P2P thing is kinda stupid about how f2p are treated differently than others, but some are not so bad. But I will reccomend being a P2P, I just like having fun with hats and stuff.. Anyway, TF2 is an amazing game! GET IT NOW, OR GABEN WILL RAIN ACID OVER YOU! Nah, I'm just kidding, or am I?....

review: Team Fortress 2 is one of my most favorite First Person Shooter Games that I have played so far. It offers a unique playstyle for all 9 classes. Each of them come in different shapes and sizes, along with a aresonal of weapons and personalities. The game is also incredible because with new updates and items like cosmetics coming in, it also offers a unique playstyle. Unlike most First Person Shooter games where everyone has pretty much the same weaponry, in this game, you don't. Each class has their strength and weaknesses, which makes this game more challenging and unique, thus making it more fun for players. If I had to rate this game, I would honestly give it a 9.4 out of 10.

review: *Skip this first part if you just want to read my review* Ah, I see you see my review. Well, not really, because it hasn't started yet, and I can't see you. Anyways, now that I've wasted a good thirty seconds (that's an aproximation, if it hasn't been thirty seconds, replace the word thirty with the time it is currently taking you to read (if you don't know, I encourage you to go back and read it again, with a timer)) Now, on to my review. TF2. Two letters, one number. These three characters have a meaning to all of us "gamers". To some, TF2 is merely the sequal to Team Fortress, or Team Fortress Classic. To others, this game brings meaning to Steam. Unsurprisingly, TF2 still remains one of the most popular Steam games. A while back, the game officially became F2P (free to play). Ever since the official release, as I said before, it has "touched the hearts of hundrends, if not thousands, of Steam users." The game cleverly mixes first person shooting with the cartoon graphics you see in Disney movies (except Valve makes it work). Though this brilliant combination attracts tons of people every day, it is very much a reason not to play for the harcore graphic obsessed Steam users. To combat the people who say things like, "The graphics of this game are horrible, I will not play it." and, "A cartoon first person shooter? No. Let me play Call of Duty and Halo.", I must say that you learn to love the commical blowing off of the head and watching your vital organs fall here and there as a handful of characters that could only be created from the mind of a serial killer run around shooting this and blowing up that. Overall, the game is very fun and entertaining.

The pyro lighting people on fire, and trying to talk to his teamates. The demoman planting stickybombs while being drunk. The heavy firing bullets everywhere and eating sandviches. The engineer making buildings to defend the intelligence. The medic healing teamates and shouting words in german. The sniper headshotting everyone who comes out of spawn. And finally the spy being a backstabbing heavies, medics, and snipers. That is what i like about Team Fortress 2.

review: This is a great game, An amazing game. The best first person shooter on steam, at least in my opinion. Colorful graphics, balanced classes, you can choose your own weapon, mods, classes, great gamemodes... This game pretty has everything you want in an FPS. Also, it has hats. I'd give this game an 11/10, but I can't. So I'll have to give it a 10, outta 10.

review: If "Free to Play" scares you away from this titile: don't let it. It is a great game! There is no need to pay anything, as all items are given though "drops", the more you play, the more stuff you get, Premium Player or not. Speaking of "Premium Player". you become one by spending ANY amount of money in the game, even under $1, and you will always be a Premium Player, no subscriptions. This basically lets you have more items, and sometimes get hats and rare (but only cosmetic) items through the drops. Players are not hindered by being Free to Play, or by not playing a lot. The default guns given are balanced, and unlocked guns provide benefits in some areas, but have negatives in others (ex. a larger clip, but no random critical hits). All in all, the only thing that will make you like or hate the game is the gameplay, not the pricetag. If you like FPS games, you will love it, if not, still give it a try, you could have fun, and not need to worry about being locked behind a paywal.

review: This game?? It is the best hat simulator created on the face of the earth. No other game will surpasses this games addicting hat simulator play style. The purpose of this game is to show off your hats and collect them, once you download the game you will need to join a server. Once your in it you will need to fight against players with normal hats or flaming or sparkling hats, the latter will be the hardest to defeat. As a new player you will need to use your skills to ' Dominate' a person, when you accomplish this you will receive the legendary ' Gibus' which will help you along the journey to become a Team Fortress pro. 10/10 Best hat simulator will recommend to friends or family

review: Now, before you skip past this review, just take a moment to have a look. This is my opinion: Team Fortress 2 is one of the best Free To Play games I could ever have. I belive the game used to cost something, but now it is free. The download time isn't one of those games that take 2 days and then if you quit you have to restart it. You can resume the download at any time, and it doesn't take long to install the game. Now for the actual GAMEPLAY. The TF2 Gameplay is amazing. Powerups, Taunts, Upgrrades, AI's, Weapons. Thy are all amazing features that is each something that makes Team Fortress 2 well, Team Fortress 2. The way the game is animated, and the blood, means it is a bit more friendly towards younger players. The controls can be edited to the desired key (as most Steam games) which makes it easier to play, and you don't have to remember different controls for different games. The maps are very good within content, and features. They are very detailed and hardly ever glitch. The game doesn't usually lag, ranging from (worst) 4 - 37 (amazing) FPS rate. This is a long review, so lets summarize... Team Fortress - as I said earlier - is one of the best (if not best) F2P game I have, and many others have. Hopefully, if you don't own the game yet, you soon will. Enjoy the game.

review: Review: If you like a cartoony animated FPS, then this is your dream game. It has good gameplay and the classes have their own strengths and weaknesses which makes gameplay very unique. Also the classes are made to work together to win a match. My Most Favorite Part of Team Fortress 2: The Halloween event is my favorite part of TF2, It's all crazy and very funny when you play on the Halloween Event maps. But the downside is that you can only play the Halloween Event around the time of Halloween. I also like the unique classes What I Don't Like About Team Fortress 2: I think the prices on many items in the shop are outrageous. They should also have more weapons instead of many more cosmetics. Also, there needs to be a more secured VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) system because I have been in games where the hacker doesn't take any damage, I have played with at least 26 hackers in my entire time playing this game.

review: Well hello, my name is Esau (ryhmes with seesaw). Ive been playing games for a while, wether its been console or pc or handheld. But there was one game that stuck out for me. It was Team Fortress 2. This game literally made my life what it is today. I downloaded it and booted it up and immediately fell in love. So far ive put over 2k hours into this game and ive made such amazing friends that its hard to believe its a video game. Rayne, Jade, Fluffy, Krys, Reindeer, Walrus, ing noir, and Gawd. You guys in particular have made my life so god damn amazing. Thanks. But now i have to leave this game. Ive played it for many a good time and i think its time to pack it up and move on. What will i replace it with? I have no idea. Maybe ill fall in love with Overwatch. Maybe ill start playing Indie games, maybe ill go full time CS:GO. But whatever it is i want to thank this game. It literally morphed my life and i plan to take advantage of the things its given me. I now have a love for my friends and gaming. So yeah. Thanks. Bye.

review: This game is a must for ANY fans of FPSs or shooters for that matter. I wish most FPSs were half as good as this game is. It's free-to-play. Got that? FREE... and guess what? NO IN-GAME PURCHASES THAT MAKE YOU BETTER. This game is in NO way a P2W (Pay-To-Win) game, it is in it's whole goodness a free game that's easy to pick up and play, easy to start off with and always fun to play. The game has 9 different balanced classes that are excellent both in design and in gameplay, with each one changing your team's options of beating the enemy. With tons of weapons that can be gotten freely without paying, and are completly balanced, the game keeps throwing options of changing your playstyle. This game is great no matter what kind of player you are. Like to take it easy? Go as a sniper. Want to rush in and out before anyone notices and get in the enemy's faces? Go scout. Or do you feel like punching somebody in the face? Well guess what, there's a class for you (It's the heavy). With plenty of character, plenty of options, plenty of weapons and plenty of hours of fun in it, this game will not disappoint when you play it. So have fun!

review: Team Fortress 2... where to begin, you were the game we as a community needed. You didn't care about the generic shooters and made something so interesting, addictive and fun. Life was awesome at your early years... but then the bronies struck. The bronies were unrelentless in their assault, roaming in packs, server to server to give every unsuspecting player autism as they spread their "love and tolerance" to our precious, fragile community. They began to take root in your server lists with maps like "trade_bronycraft" which to this day have given me a huge traumatic experience, with your dumb high value in game item but have little to contribute in gameplay. But that's a ludicrous topic, Team Fortress 2 skill is based on your hats' value and if you owned items with little "value" you were shunned by these low lifed basement dwellers. The community had to accept the fate that their precious Team Fortress had succumbed to, they tried to tend to the damage the neckbeards had caused. But then the salt was poured on the fresh wound, the weeaboos came. As if some coordinated strike from the scumlickers of the internet, the weeaboos steamrolled throughout the already diminishing community, morales were low; such a dark time. It almost happened instantly, the game was flooded with autistic splash damage mains with their pockets, spamming binds like the Lenny, renaming their items to names that were almost as original as their characters. Currently the assault of these degenerates continues, will the game that fell from such grace ever regenerate into the jewel that Valve had uncovered? Only time will tell. I rate this up due to the fun I've had from this game.

review: After playing 1000+ Hours, I might do a re-write of the re-write of my review Stage 1: Graphics Everyone knows the cartoony graphics of Team Fortress 2, IMO, the change from a Realistic Shooter that Team Fortress 2 was supposed to be, was a good idea. The graphics are amazing, HD and no lag when at high, hopefully, TF3 (If they actually do make one) has the same graphics from the current game that everyone loves. Rating: 10/10 - Beautiful Art Design Stage 2: Gameplay and Mechanics In the usual FPS, its simple, WASD to move and Mouse 1 to shoot and kill everyone to win. Well, in TF2 its much different, Custom Weapons that allow whole new styles to play, Gamemodes that never get old (Especially Payload and Control Points) and the creative maps, no map is the same except for its gameplay mechanics. One problem I have with this is, they don't have a filter that allows premium players who have higher skill than free to players, this causes unbalance in some teams when a team where its mostly free to players and and other team where its highly skilled players always destroy the other team. As well as the auto balance, it makes people who are about to win then BAM! the player is now on the losing team. But overall, the mechanics of the game may have little downsides but never stop people from enjoying the gameplay and different weapons. Rating: 8.5/10 Close to amazing Final Stage: Community, Updates and Content First, I'll start with the community, the TF2 Community is amazing, a lot of faithful players who love this game to the very end, but it has some flaws, free to players, These people are so stupid, these players can't even listen to direction, I've tried coaching and it sucks so much, they don't listen to you at all and clueless to what is happening. Second, Premium, those people are mean, in trading they force you to pay more than what its worth, they should add rules to trading, chatting and other things that can effect new players. I hope those who are mean, become good and help those who are new and change the way they play. Second, Updates, the updates are lacking very lacking, Valve step it up, after some updates, TF2 is losing their community I mean the EotL was overhyped, there was supposed to be new weapons and a new map then Valve says "the map was too confusing for new players" how about rd_asteroid? Even players who played for a long time don't get cp_steel. Basically, step it up Valve. Finally, Content, there is A LOT of content in this game, mostly hats. They should focus more on weapons than hats. That covers most of that but now, gamemodes, no new game modes for a long time, except for Mann Power but recent players of the Gamemode think its bad. Valve is focusing on hats and bugs. Rating 1: 9/10\ Rating 2: 4/10 Overall:7.1/10 Need a bit of work Rating 3: 7/10/ Overall Rating: 8.6/10 - Amazing Game

review: I'd heard some talk about this team fortress 2. My friends loved it and seemed so enthralled in it's HUGE community. I eventually got to playing it myself at a friends house to try it out. I thought it was very complicated and too confusing at first. My friend was screaming, "We need a demoknight over here, but everyone's too busy being spy and trading!" I thought he was insane. My friends badgered me to install it on my computer and told me to play for eight hours straight with them. So I did. My hours are short, and I still am utterly terrible at the game, but here I am just a few hours before writing this screaming into my monitor (mic off accept for my friends) "We need a demoknight over here, but everyone's too busy being spy and trading!" My mom thinks I'm insane. And even on my crappyt DELL computer, this game runs great (with a few graphical adjustements) and keeps me entertained. Bottom line, if you get this game, you won't come out of it.

review: Best war-themed hat simulator ever
game-hours: 3896.8
review: People asked me alot, why I play this game, they mostly say: "Geez, such bad graphic." or "What's that for a kind of shooter? Not even realistic like Call of Duty." But I tell you why I play this: This game is called TEAM Fortress 2, so it basically has a teamplaying role, something what many shooters don't have. To get more into detail: This game IS a bit surrealistic, but that makes more fun. TF2 is a game for FUN, you can work together or against and still play relaxed. The "role-playing" with the 9 classes makes a perfect synergy with the term TEAM, so you wont get bored by doing always the same thing and you can help each other out by just doing something different. Another thing which is good in this game is that you can first TRY the game, so its a Free-to-play game and gives beginners a good chance to try it out. And if they like it, they buy something and get premium, so they can have full access to the game. (and for you F2P-haters... be honest, 70% of all TF2 mercs were F2P when they started, so still calling F2Ps n00bs is a bit respectless...) There are so many more reasons why this game is actually good, but if you want to know more about the game, just try it out! It's free for everyone and has a lot of gamemodes to play for you and your friends and so on. So try this No.1-hat-simulator-game from Valve out and THEN you can shout at it :)

review: The most awesome first person shooter ever! I started off as a F2P, like almost everyone else. Some time went by and now I have over 1000 hours of playtime and I became one of the many virtual hat traders. This game is not all about shooting the bad guys and winning the game, this game has a whole economy running behind it and when I first discovered trading, I became obsessed with it. I learned everything about the prices and I am still learning new things. The game also has a fantastic community, constantly providing content in the Steam Workshop while Valve decides which content is being added to the game. Besides the trading and the awesome community, it also has great gameplay. What makes me play it more is the amount of fun I have while ingame. Like, in every match I play there will be something that gives me a big smile on my face. Is there someone in the server annoying you with Mic-spamming or just being a total ? You can mute, kick and ban that er, thank you Valve for that! What also makes me play the game more is the great sense of humour. The personalities of the 9 classes are so well thought out and they all have great voice lines. To win the game, you have to work together with your team. You can try to win without them, but that is basically impossible! It's the best teamwork-based Hat Simulator FPS on the planet, what else needs to be said? 10/10, Go play it now!

review: Hello. If you read this, you should be feel good, because you got something of my handyness. Okay, Team Fortress 2 is truly one of the best games I've been playing to this day.It's gameplay is smooth and easy and there aren't any bugs*(Only map related bugs*) and the game , steam in common has a complicated, yet easy trading system that allows you to exchange your items with other users. You should give Tf2 a try, it's free!

review: Rocket flies above your head. Fire burns the surrounding. Grenade lies over the floor(it will explode any second). Bullets spam everywhere. People running around trying to hit you. Intensely feel that you will die from 1 shot kill. Nervous and worry about backstabbing. You have no way to escape except for doing the things above. That's right. CHAOS!! One shall not simply stop! If you stop at the middle of the road, you die. If you jump, you die. You walk, you die. Yes. Every single move is towards death. All you can do is fightback! This game is extremely ENJOYABLE! What's so fun about keep dying in a game? Well, you can respawn and go for alternate way. Do this game has replay values? Of Course. You must play at your own risk, as you may get addicted to it. You get to play every classes with different tactics. Therefore, you'll experience different kind of gameplay. I'm afraid that this game will be dead and the server would be empty. Well, no worries, mate. Is Counter-Strike dead yet? No. TF2 is more fun than CS! Besides, Valve always keep this game updated with special event such as Anually Halloween Event(which is my favourite event). This game provides trade system. Trading is another fun activity you can do in TF2. Due to the massive amount of items in TF2, you can trade to get your long-wishes item! Overall, this is a comedy-filled action rpg-like multiplayer game. You will like it. I promise.

review: Many people wonder why one plays tf2, when there are many other better online shooters. I simply say to them: you don't pay a dime to waste your time Of course it is not a complete waste of time. The thing that makes tf2 unique is that it is not just a shooter. It is a stabber, healer, runner, sneaker, jumper, builder, burner, boomer, and of course, a team strategy game. It has spawned many internet memes and youtube videos, and has many different weapons and customization items. Of course, it would take hours to describe the whole game, so I will just say this: install the game, try it out, and have fun.

review: This game ruined my life. First it started, with me just shooting stuff as soldier. I died. and died. and died. I got mad. I then pressed the , button. And that is where it all started: Spy. I sucked at it sure, and kinda do still. But as I got my first backstab. I went insane. Backstab after backstab, it felt so good. Soon, I just went offline on tr_walkway, not to practice, just to get a few backstabs. Then I met some people, who would let you backstab them for only a few Mann Co. Crate Keys. I bought one key and did it, then all of the sudden, it turned into dozens and hundreds of keys. I had to sell my dog, sell my house, and go to 7/11 just to buy a damn steam card. I just had to get THOSE DAMN STEAM CARDS MAN. Every backstab I got felt so good, but I knew it was wrong. So damn wrong. So then the night after. I invited my family over. I went to "get a soda from the store" When I came back, there were police cars, and all of the sudden, when they let me inside. My family was dead. With the wallets on the floor. Nothing inside. Then I realised. There were 50 dollar steam cards in my hand. The cops rammed me to the ground and started to tell me my rights. I went to jail for 7 years. I bought a crappy apartment and a Mac. and now here I am. Still getting backstabs. This game ruined my life, made it impossible to get a good job, killed my family, and am now going to kill myself soon. I guess the game is pretty good, 10/10

review: Team Fortress 2 is an amazing game. It is very skill based. Unlike other games, such as CoD, tf2 has no weapon unlock system and the weapons are as balanced as possible (unlike games like CoD where a weapon is better than another no matter what). The game play is very fast and fun. You need to pay attention to everything around you in order to play at the best of your abilities. Even though there is a limited number of weapons (there is quite alot though) there is always new gameplay stratigies and tactics to discover and learn. No one class is the best class to play, each one has their own advantages and disadvantages that may make it better to take out one class but harder to counter another. Many people that begin playing tf2 often give up quickly thinking they are not good enough, but everyone needs practice we all started bad at one time. Even if you are not getting alot of kills you can still be a great deal of help to the other team by being a distraction, providing health and damage buffs, or picking off a single class on the other team that would otherwise give your team a dissadvantage. Regarding the trade system, i consider it a quite good economic simulator. I have used the trade system to gain funds in my steam wallet and buy even more games without the need to spend alot of cash in real life. Team Fortress 2 also has things such as a costom scripting system, and the ability to make your own hats and game modles. But that is mostly not for all people and tf2 is not generally played for that.

game-hours: 2943.1
review: Team Fortress 2 is not your typical first person shooter. Why is that? Hats. Shiny hats. Vintage hats. Strange hats. Still don't believe that makes it different? Alright, then picture this : nine mercenaries, fighting over... gravel, all of them with a whole set of diverse, original weapons, starting from a fish wrapped in newspapers to a sniper rifle loaded with urine filled syringes, and available for free*. Now imagine them defending their supplier's facilities from hordes of robots and getting sweet, sweet l00t out of it. If you're more of a business man (or woman), those nine mercenaries can trade anything they get their hands on. Always dreamed of wearing a burning hat? Just find the guy who wants to get rid of his! Many, many game modes are available in TF2, and the gameplay varies greatly from one to the other. Capture the flag will have you run to the enemy base, grabbing their intel to bring it back home; attack/defense will make you work with your team to either cap or protect one or multiple control point(s); Payload has your team pushing a bomb through an entire battlefield, trying to bring the other team's plans to an end... And that's just three of the official ones! TF2's community is filled with creative, interested people who constantly come up with new things to do - have you ever played a game in which you end up facing the CEO of the hat company that had the guns you use built? I sure did! -, and whose work potentially gets added officially to the game. Scared to play because FPS's are not your cup of tea? Fear no more! Valve's matchmaking algorythm and official servers usually let you play with people whose experience won't leave you hopeless compared to yours (I would highly recommend going on those servers first, before hopping onto a community made one, just to get the basics). In-game tutorials for each class as well as community made guides will also help you through your learning the ropes. Overall, this game is fun and unique. I have been playing it for over four years, and have seen it get bigger and better as time went by, without ever getting bored of it. It's updated frequently with new content, new maps to play on, as well as mind-blowing holiday events such as the annual Scream Fortress updates (the one that happened this year brought wizardry to the game. How awesome is that?). So what are you waiting for? Click that "Play game" button, download Team Fortress 2, and join us in this crazy world of glorious, gorey, genuine fun**! * That is, unless you actually /want/ to buy them. But you can find all those weapons and more for absolutely no money! How nice is that? ** May contain hats.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a game hard to write a review for, its constantly updated, new things are always added (Mostly Hats) but Valve does a good job keeping it alive. The community ingame is a bit like being in the deep end of the Pool not expecting whats to come when you go deeper into the pool, Some people are generally nice to talk to and very kind, some are a  and racists but hey its the internet what can you do? but generally people are nice. Classes are balanced....a bit to a point where most of the time classes can kill each other easily if you play that class really well, The classes have their Pro's and Con's but its really all up to how you play that specific class. MVM is a bit of a push and shove trying to get a good team that does Not compose of prepubescent children who have such a squeaky voice they could do a voice over for mickey mouse if need be. but MVM is a nice addon for TF2 killing robots instead of Merc's. As i said before TF2 is hard game to make a review about but its really fun...Buggy sometimes but the bugs usually get patched quickly.

review: I'm personally not a fan of first person shooters...I always found them to be somewhat bland, unoriginal, repetitive, and can get really boring after a while... That being said, I freaking love this game! With a total of 9 unique classes, each having their own play style, awesome personalities, and a HUUUUUGE amount of weapons to obtain, each with their own unique attributes, you never know what you might face when playing this game. Onto the classes: We have Heavy, who wields a... Ahem. "Mini"-gun, and a freaking HUUUGE HP stat of 300, the Medic, who can keep his teammates alive with his Medigun, as well as increase their base health for a few seconds in a process called "overheal", the Scout, a fast, powerful, but fragile class that can provide a large amount of satisfaction when you annoy the crap out of people... The Soldier, the most basic, yet reliable class, wielding a deadly rocket launcher, and some intersting unlockables such as the Buff Banner. We have the Pyro, a class who is good at ambushes with his flamethrower, can deflect projectiles with his compression blast, and his afterburn technique can do insane amounts of damage if left untreated.. We have the Demoman, a class who excels at indirect fire, wielding an arching grenade launcher, and a useful sticky bomb launcher, making him essential to the team's efforts. We have the Spy, who wields a cloaking device, a basic yet useful revolver, a disguise kit, allowing him to blend in with the opposition, an Electro Sapper, letting him mutilate the buildings of Engineers, and the most OVERPOWERED KNIFE IN FICTION, where he instantly kills you upon a sucessful backstab. However, he also hosts the most glaring weaknesses of any class, making him the hardest to master. We have the Engineer, an absolutely essential class that can deploy Teleporters, Sentries, and Dispensers. Teleporters warp teammates from point A to point B, Dispensers provide health and ammo to teammates, and Sentrys: They just tear  appart with their rockets and huge machine guns.. However, if a Spy decides to stalk you, you'd better switch class, because unless you're using the Gunslinger on an offensive push, he will sap everything you have. And last, but not least, is the Sniper, who can help take out enemies from afar and use his Jarate, which is basically a jar of piss, to help eliminate key threats. Notice I haven't even gotten to the game modes. From Payload, to King of the Hill, to Capture Points, and Capture the Flag, there are a lot of different game modes that require the different strengths of different classes. But say you're not that good at multiplayer. Maybe you want to play with people instead of against them: They thought of that, and made Mann Vs. Machine as a result. Basically, the robots have bombs that they use to try to kill Mann. Co: Where all of these classes work. And they have a large army of them, including giant robot versions of those classes. But, to even out the compitition, you can upgrade your weapons upon killing robots that drop money, which they are apparently powered by...Yeah, I don't get it either. Either way, these upgrades can range from being able to deploy a second Sentry gun, to being able to regenerate health, to being able to set up a projectile wall of death that kills any robots that touch it, there's a lot of fun to be had here. But say you've played everything for hours, and you're getting bored. Thanks to the brillaint art of modding, they can at least help cure your bordom. From playing dodgeball with a OHKO rocket and airblasting Pyros, trying to take down a Spy who can only be seen when attacking, and getting insane upgrades for Mann Vs. Machine, such as afterburn to normal weapons, max health increase, and up to SIX additional Mini-Sentries, there's a lot to be had here. Overall, there's something for a everyone in this game. The characters are funny, the weapons and gamemodes are unique, there's plenty to do, the art style is colorful, and if you're tired of getting your butt kicked by people who have been playing much longer, you can go mutliate some AI Robot Classes. The virdict? A 5/5.

review: I bought Team Fortress 2 before hats even existed. Remember the "meet the-" Videos? Never even existed. This is one of my favorite games, even with all the hat hate. If you dont know what this game is by now, god bless. This game is an example of Free to Play done right.

review: A classic steam game with shooting and first-person elements all packed into one game. Plus a wide assortment of accessories to choose from including hats, outfits, weapons, and many others. Can't go wrong with the huge number of game modes and customized game servers to add to the excitement. Definitely the first game to find and play when starting steam.

review: Hello. If you read this, you should be feel good, because you got something of my handyness. Okay, Team Fortress 2 is truly one of the best games I've been playing to this day.It's gameplay is smooth and easy and there aren't any bugs*(Only map related bugs*) and the game , steam in common has a complicated, yet easy trading system that allows you to exchange your items with other users. You should give Tf2 a try, it's free!

review: Have you ever played a first person shooter that you really loved? After a while, they usually get a little drab if the developers don't update them.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a game hard to write a review for, its constantly updated, new things are always added (Mostly Hats) but Valve does a good job keeping it alive. The community ingame is a bit like being in the deep end of the Pool not expecting whats to come when you go deeper into the pool, Some people are generally nice to talk to and very kind, some are a  and racists but hey its the internet what can you do? but generally people are nice. Classes are balanced....a bit to a point where most of the time classes can kill each other easily if you play that class really well, The classes have their Pro's and Con's but its really all up to how you play that specific class. MVM is a bit of a push and shove trying to get a good team that does Not compose of prepubescent children who have such a squeaky voice they could do a voice over for mickey mouse if need be. but MVM is a nice addon for TF2 killing robots instead of Merc's. As i said before TF2 is hard game to make a review about but its really fun...Buggy sometimes but the bugs usually get patched quickly.

review: I'm personally not a fan of first person shooters...I always found them to be somewhat bland, unoriginal, repetitive, and can get really boring after a while... That being said, I freaking love this game! With a total of 9 unique classes, each having their own play style, awesome personalities, and a HUUUUUGE amount of weapons to obtain, each with their own unique attributes, you never know what you might face when playing this game. Onto the classes: We have Heavy, who wields a... Ahem. "Mini"-gun, and a freaking HUUUGE HP stat of 300, the Medic, who can keep his teammates alive with his Medigun, as well as increase their base health for a few seconds in a process called "overheal", the Scout, a fast, powerful, but fragile class that can provide a large amount of satisfaction when you annoy the crap out of people... The Soldier, the most basic, yet reliable class, wielding a deadly rocket launcher, and some intersting unlockables such as the Buff Banner. We have the Pyro, a class who is good at ambushes with his flamethrower, can deflect projectiles with his compression blast, and his afterburn technique can do insane amounts of damage if left untreated.. We have the Demoman, a class who excels at indirect fire, wielding an arching grenade launcher, and a useful sticky bomb launcher, making him essential to the team's efforts. We have the Spy, who wields a cloaking device, a basic yet useful revolver, a disguise kit, allowing him to blend in with the opposition, an Electro Sapper, letting him mutilate the buildings of Engineers, and the most OVERPOWERED KNIFE IN FICTION, where he instantly kills you upon a sucessful backstab. However, he also hosts the most glaring weaknesses of any class, making him the hardest to master. We have the Engineer, an absolutely essential class that can deploy Teleporters, Sentries, and Dispensers. Teleporters warp teammates from point A to point B, Dispensers provide health and ammo to teammates, and Sentrys: They just tear  appart with their rockets and huge machine guns.. However, if a Spy decides to stalk you, you'd better switch class, because unless you're using the Gunslinger on an offensive push, he will sap everything you have. And last, but not least, is the Sniper, who can help take out enemies from afar and use his Jarate, which is basically a jar of piss, to help eliminate key threats. Notice I haven't even gotten to the game modes. From Payload, to King of the Hill, to Capture Points, and Capture the Flag, there are a lot of different game modes that require the different strengths of different classes. But say you're not that good at multiplayer. Maybe you want to play with people instead of against them: They thought of that, and made Mann Vs. Machine as a result. Basically, the robots have bombs that they use to try to kill Mann. Co: Where all of these classes work. And they have a large army of them, including giant robot versions of those classes. But, to even out the compitition, you can upgrade your weapons upon killing robots that drop money, which they are apparently powered by...Yeah, I don't get it either. Either way, these upgrades can range from being able to deploy a second Sentry gun, to being able to regenerate health, to being able to set up a projectile wall of death that kills any robots that touch it, there's a lot of fun to be had here. But say you've played everything for hours, and you're getting bored. Thanks to the brillaint art of modding, they can at least help cure your bordom. From playing dodgeball with a OHKO rocket and airblasting Pyros, trying to take down a Spy who can only be seen when attacking, and getting insane upgrades for Mann Vs. Machine, such as afterburn to normal weapons, max health increase, and up to SIX additional Mini-Sentries, there's a lot to be had here. Overall, there's something for a everyone in this game. The characters are funny, the weapons and gamemodes are unique, there's plenty to do, the art style is colorful, and if you're tired of getting your butt kicked by people who have been playing much longer, you can go mutliate some AI Robot Classes. The virdict? A 5/5.

review: This is by the best FPS I have ever played. The gameplay at its core is outstanding, and is auguemented to unbelievable levels when you add in the different gamemodes and subclasses. Each class has its own unique playstyle, meaning that there's over 9 different ways to have fun in the fast-paced team-objective game. For those of you who are considering picking up this game, do it. There's no reason not to, it's one of Valve's masterpiece's, and it's FREE! If you think it might be a bit difficult to pick up at first, don't fret. The Team Fortress 2 community is typically a friendly and humurous entity, and within it you will find several references (TF2 guides, forumns, Tutorials videos on Steam and Youtube) to improve your gameplay and have even more fun! I hope you will enjoy this game as much as I and countless others have!

review: The moment I clicked the "Download now" button, a celestial light bled through the cloudy skies and swept through my home. I heard heaven's voice. My ragged bathrobe and spaghetti sauce laden wife-beater undershirt instantly metamorphosed into an elegant, untouched, and fully tailored tuxedo: a gold-lined cummerbund, 42-carat diamond cufflinks, and a coat that was laced from the pubic -hairs of Zeus himself, still odored from the blood of his enemies. My Ikea chair began evolving into a throne - carved by Jesus himself and lumbered from the woods of Narnia - as my hair turned into platinum locks, so lustrous, elegant, and untamed that a jealous and envious Samson would have chosen me over Delilah. I felt like a deity. But it did not end there. My doorbell rang; I noticed the sound had changed from the hackneyed, generic tritone noise into a cathedral choir of a thousand virgin women singing in harmony to announce the arrival of my hat. I quivered in fear of the presence of such a thing. But alas, I marched onward as each of my steps left a silver-lined footprint on my now diamond-tiled floor. My hands shook and my palms ached as I felt the sweat drip down my nose and onto the floor only to see the perspiration alchemize into liquid gold on my floor. I opened the door and there it was: Gaben he was fully nude, modeling in a contrapposto fashion - he was engulfed with a halo of warmth and handed me the package. His voice was near ic as I listened to him say: "Sign here, please". I shuddered in awe as I took the emerald pen and signed my signature with ink from the blood of a unicorn. He vanished in a slow cloud of menthol with a hint of nectar vapor. I took the package to my now 50-foot dining table and examined it. The box had a superficial wrapping made from what I could only guess to be the Golden Fleece, procured from the winged ram of Ancient Greece. I untied the silk bows and unraveled the package and opened the box to discover the hat. The experience was ineffable. When I laid eyes on the hat, I instantly saw into the eleven theorized dimensions of space-time. I saw past, future, present, and everything in between. I knew the reasons for everything and knew the reasons to come. String theory was simple arithmetic to me and all the mysteries of life and existence embodied the slow, ticking hands of the watch. I put the hat on my head and instantly became ambidextrous. It seared into my hair and skin and it was then that I felt the rush of purity. My diabetes, hepatitis, and hypertension washed away from me. Cancer cells were eradicated from my anatomy and the concept of aging was a thing of the past. My saliva tasted of sweet syrup and nectar. I bled liquid fire. I had obtained immortality. I must end my review here for I have seen the deterministic events that will entail with the divulging of any further information.

This game can be scary sometimes in my opinion XD not because of the servers. Because of when someone pops up and I someone could scream xD. Its pretty much very active,fun, and sometimes taking it seriously. But there is a workshop for valve to add miscs,weapons and stuff. :3

But about 2 years ago, I upgraded both. A couple of months ago, I decided, on a whim, to give it another go. This game is a lot of fun. The balance between the players is fantastic, with the short-range (but very powerful) Pyro to the far more tactical demoman, you can find what suits your flavor of play.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a multiplayer shooter that defines its genre. Every class is a completely different challenge to master, and just when you get tired of how they play, you can use a different item set (which require some work to unlock) to completely change the game. With a variety of gamemodes, including the recently-released Mann Vs Machine hoarde mode, that all add whole new layers of replayability to the game keep it fresh even 6 years from initial release. Team Fortress 2 is possibly the best Free-To-Play game on the market, and you have absolutely no reason to not give it a try.

review: Want fast paced action? Want hours of entertainment from the stupidest of things? Want constant updates that will break the game? Look no further than Team Fortress 2! Valve's sequel to the even more broken Team Fortress Classic delivers non stop surprises as you journey through a dessert, and a factory,and a barn in order to complete objective such as pushing and standing. You'll start your voyage as a f2p "gibus" but once you earn your wings, you'll notice people with shiny guns and fancy hats. From then on your life will be hell trading and trading, metal and hats just to get the one unusual to make it all worth it, and you'll be trapped, unable to escape the reality that you've playec this game flor nearly 600 hours. Also, if you're a sensitive, impressionable youngster make sure to disable multiplayer sprays (not as bad as gmod). Good game i r8 8/8

review: Rocket flies above your head. Fire burns the surrounding. Grenade lies over the floor(it will explode any second). Bullets spam everywhere. People running around trying to hit you. Intensely feel that you will die from 1 shot kill. Nervous and worry about backstabbing. You have no way to escape except for doing the things above. That's right. CHAOS!! One shall not simply stop! If you stop at the middle of the road, you die. If you jump, you die. You walk, you die. Yes. Every single move is towards death. All you can do is fightback! This game is extremely ENJOYABLE! What's so fun about keep dying in a game? Well, you can respawn and go for alternate way. Do this game has replay values? Of Course. You must play at your own risk, as you may get addicted to it. You get to play every classes with different tactics. Therefore, you'll experience different kind of gameplay. I'm afraid that this game will be dead and the server would be empty. Well, no worries, mate. Is Counter-Strike dead yet? No. TF2 is more fun than CS! Besides, Valve always keep this game updated with special event such as Anually Halloween Event(which is my favourite event). This game provides trade system. Trading is another fun activity you can do in TF2. Due to the massive amount of items in TF2, you can trade to get your long-wishes item! Overall, this is a comedy-filled action rpg-like multiplayer game. You will like it. I promise.

review: To begin I would like to say that TF2 is a F2P game and I would recommend it to anybody. The following is a Shrek Is Love Shrek Is Life parody that is CHILD FRIENDLY. I was only 13 years old. I loved TF2 so much. I had put countless ammounts of money onto steam to get al the TF2 miscs. Every night I pray to the scout, soldier, engineer, medic, sniper, spy, heavy and demos that I would get a good trade in the morning. My parents hear me and say I have an addiction. I knew he was jeleous of my pro skills at TF2 so I said he should leave me alone. My parents ban me and send me to sleep. I know I will never gte my Level Three Chin anymore now. I feel a warmth approaching me in my bed. Its a fat engineer that says "i see you found my teleporter enterance". I tell the fat engineer that I am ready. He gets out a chair and sits down drinking beer. He offers me one now but I say no. I feel my eyes tearing at his fat face. But I know that one day I want to be like him. So thats my parody of Shrek Is Love Shrek Is Life. Please go check out the video afterwards if you already havn't to understand this fully. WARNING THHIS VIDOE ON YOUTUBE WILL CONTAIN RUDE WORDS AND SCENES! So in the end I think of TF2 as a fantastic game!

review: The Cat in the Hat Game is designed for parents and children to play together. The rules are simple and the game is played in the same manner every time, so children can quickly become comfortable with the game. This game teaches and reinforces early reading skills: children look for letters that form words and learn to recognize words as they see them paired with pictures. The game also features counting, matching, and introductory strategy skills. Since the game is not over until the last player reaches Finish, every player stays involved in the game until the very end.

Its all about the team effort in this game if you don't have it then your going to die, die agian, and die some more. Theirs also only 8 characters in this game, so now that all the characters have been released its almost unnecassary to play.

review: Il migliore FPS Free to Play. Assicurato. Presente sin dal 2007, la community  pi attiva che mai. Sembra non possa morire. Gameplay intuitivo, facile da capire, assolutamente non pay2win, ogni arma ha i suoi pro e i suoi contro, quindi si pu benissimo giocare con le armi standard che si hanno sin da l'inizio, le cosiddette 'stock'. Lasciamo stare i famosi cappelli, utili solo a decorare il nostro mercenario, niente di pi. Se sei bravo  grazie alle tue abilit, non di certo ai cappelli. Community molto buona, una delle migliori che io abbia mai trovato. Basato molto (se non interamente) sulla cooperazione e sulla squadra. Le nove classi sono tutte molto differenti e ognuno ha il suo compito o ruolo; Il Cecchino per esempio, dovrebbe stare nelle retrovie, uccidendo eventuali Cecchini nemici o minacce importanti al team, come un Medico con la Uber pronta. Il Soldato ed il Grosso, ad esempio, sono classi che dovrebbero stare sul fronte, insieme all'assistenza di un Medico, magari. Medico indispensabile per i cosiddetti push, mentre l'Ingegnere aiuta tutta la squadra ad arrivare velocemente sul punto grazie ai teletrasporti, e rifornire quest'ultima di munizioni e salute con i dispenser. Questo  solo un'esempio di una classica squadra di TF2. Con pi di 1,400 ore spese su questo gioco, posso certamente dire che  uno dei giochi pi divertenti a cui io abbia mai giocato. Vi lovvo tutti <3

Myself alone have clocked about 1600's Hours on this game and still find it fun. AND THE BEST PART IS. Its a free online (And offline) Fps With dynamic gameplay and a large diffrence than the rest of the fps market (Such as battlefield and Call of duty). Now a simple thing about this game is it is Free to play and also if you do want the premium benifits it is litterly as cheap as 49 cents U.S Currency

Team Fortress 2 was my first love, it was what it made me get Steam and even if I preffer the classic for my reasons and even if I was pissed at it because people mocked that I was non-premium user, I learned to ignore that fact and enjoy the actual game. You'll love TF2 for the game, not the hats, not the weapons, just the proper game. Mann vs machine, payload and a lot of new unique game modes are waiting for you. It's free, go ahead and get it if you haven't already.

review: Yeah when I play heavy, a lot of stuff goes over my head too since it's such a complex class. A lot of people think it's just an easy class where you hold m1 over the enemy, but they don't understand that m2 allows you to spin your barrel but not fire, which can fake the enemy out. In fact one of the most exciting meta games in tf2 is watching two heavies duke it out, since a lot of times it's really not about aim but about the sheer determination and willpower and how badly each player wants it.

review: I have a lot of time and effort put into this game. After 6 years of playing, and how I experience games these days... Wasn't worth it. This game, in my opinion, is horrible. Many people are addicted to it, but if they saw what I see, many would agree. This game is poorly balanced and developed. The only way to possibly have fun in this game is by being those players with tons of expensive items and infinite skill with top-notch computers. Usually these people also take advantage of cheap flaws in the games as well. Soldier, in my opinion, is the most absolutely over-powered class. I say this because it's always that class experienced players play, since Soldier has pretty much no downsides when played well. Nothing can touch them. Then there are snipers that never miss, sporting their unusual and professional killstreak sniper rifle. Sticky spamming demos that taunt after every kill. Combo pyros, demoknights, so on and so forth. Now everyone can agree that these are a part of the game, but they get rediculous. The only way TF2 is fun, for me at least, is by actually being able to be successful. Unfortunately for me, I have ADHD and stuff, so that makes it much harder. Especially when there are servers full of unusual-wearing players who absolutely destroooy everything and take advantage of public servers full of learning players. It makes this game unbearable and kills any aspect of fun when instead of doing a role or playing for fun, all you're doing is trying to out-war that one player who is ruining the game. Lately, for me, MvM seems to be the only thing I can consider always fun about TF2, however you have to pay for a rewarding experience. That wouldn't be so bad if free MvM games weren't dead or full of people who haven't yet learned the rocket jumper deals no damage and such. While on the topic, I feel like Mann Up should have tour match ups, so players with few tours only find games with players with few tours, and the same for people with higher tours, since MvM is basically kicking that no tour pyro who's using the degreaser. I used to have sooo much fun with this game, and I was addicted. Sadly I feel like this game has become nothing more than a money harvester for Valve, since you see things that give profit to them get added 100x more often than something the players have fun with. I understand maps and weapons have to be tested and balanced, though. (Although I feel many weapons have failed their tests and were added anyway.) My main reason for this review was that I wish Team Fortress 2 was about just what it's called: TEAM Fortress. Instead it is "Free-to-Play team carried by advanced players" Fortress. At the end of the day, the only people who have fun are the ones who are beyond professional and Valve. Being professional takes time, but some people can't catch up to that point, and it's not fair for new players or those who struggle with the game. I only wish the game was more balanced for newer players and had more about the game itself, and less about hats and Valve's profit. I miss my old Team Fortress 2.

review: This game is a must have for 12 year olds with low self esteem. Seriously if you have the maturity of a 12 year old child and want the opportunity to make yourself feel better about your crummy life by belittling people on an online multiplayer fps game then download this game right now. I have experienced many times on this game absolutely disgusting behaviour from other players in the community. It is sad. It is sad knowing that there are so many children growing up in this world who show complete and utter ignorance, unprovoked to people they do not even know. For instance: A kid said this to a friend of mine while in a match. Hey liked how I wrecked you last round? (No reply from my friend) Oh what you got nothing to say? Must be too poor to buy a mic. (So poor yet he owns a computer right?) (I then attempt to kick this child from the game for his ignorance) Random other guy who must have been this childs friend starts. What the f#$% you trying to do? (My vote to kick the initial child fails) (They try and kick me) Shouts Kick this f@#$^% out of here he's trying to send me pictures of his d$%^ (I get kicked). Now I don't care about being kicked out of a game. There are many other lobbies I can join to play and try to have fun on. What I care about is how completely toxic the community is on this game. Yeah I get it, it is the internet you have to at some point accept the reality that there are many trolls and immature children out there. The problem for me is not ignoring it and moving on. The problem is when I, like many others, sit down to relax in their spare time and try to have fun playing a team based game get put into situations of unpleasant, abusive, conflict constantly it becomes something besides fun and enjoyment but rather stressful and disturbing. Literally every server will have people on that have nothing better to say besides overused insults. There is absolutely no need for it. There is not a single thing that requires someone to be a complete piece of trash in order to have fun or even be good at a video game. It ruins everything video games are meant to be about. Besides the absolutely toxic community in which you cannot really change in anyway there are other issues. The game is goofy with it's cartoon style which is a hint that you should not take it too seriously. If you find yourself taking tf2 seriously then that is the point in time that you should uninstall it. Trust me once you start taking the game seriously you will degrade yourself by involving yourself with the toxic players, you will lose money, you will lose friends and you will no longer enjoy something you once did. I realized this after seeing how much I spent on the game, the situation I explained above and when I started to become frustrated at people dancing around the spawn wasting time (which should be the fun of it yet it became annoying). Looking at the lucrative micro transaction style system involved, it is at least how I see it addicting. Who wants to use ugly stock weapons when they can open crates to get fancy shiny ones or simply buy them? Constantly buying more keys, to open more crates, in the hopes of getting something valuable to get your money back or make a profit (it hardly ever happens). It is exactly like gambling and the risk is greater than the reward. You may get an unusual hat but what does that actually do for you? Can you sell it and make a profit? Yes. Can you withdraw that money and buy yourself a bike, or a baseball bat, or pay the rent and bills? Nope. Every dime you spend on this game is forever invested into Steam. So you don't really make anything off of buying and trading these types of virtual items and they do not improve your skills in the game or increase your enjoyment. It gives you this false sense that you did but in the end it eats your money and that is it's only purpose. Spending money on games like this is okay if you really feel like it will bring you enjoyment but fair warning it can end up costing you a significant amount of money especially if you do not know what you are doing. I let myself became consumed in this system and have spent much more than I should ever have with next to nothing to show for in the end. I regret spending any money on this game on the virtual items especially now that I have lost my enjoyment of the game. Overall I had fun. 800 hours on a free to play game in my opinion made it worth it. What I realize now though is that games like this are only as fun as the people you play them with. I started seeing a significant amount of toxic players no matter what server I was on and that killed my enjoyment. Listening to people constantly insult each other over nothing gets tiring. I guess maybe I am just at an age where I have to move on to another saga of gaming to find more enjoyment. Will I miss playing tf2? Probably not now that I have expanded my game library. Will I play it again? Likely but only for an hour or two here and there just to have fun. I will never invest my time, like I used to, back into this game because it is really not worth it. I would recommend if you want to have some fun (100-500 hours) try Team Fortress 2 out, BUT my warning and the point of my review, DO NOT invest a significant amount of time and/or money into this game. It is really not worth it once you become tired of the toxic community. Everything you worked on getting will increase your disappointment when you make the decision to stop playing the game.

review: Ive played the  out of this game but for some people 500 hours is nothing. TF2 is a awesome FPS that is very different from most, for the reason of it being pretty comical and a cartoony style which makes it so great. Why i love this game so much is the community of all the weapons you can collect and the hats you get to show whos inventory as the most vaule. The maps people create are amazing when i comes to achievement idle or trading maps or just plain goofing off in a mingame based TF2 Ware this game never gets old. Hell the real best part is ITS FREE! so no reason not to get it.

review: In my opinion, THE BEST free to play game on Steam available from what I've seen. If you love FPS's, you will love TF2. If you love a mix of strategy and classed-based combat, you'll love TF2. If you like comedy and goofiness influenced in gameplay, you'll love TF2. And if you like hats, well, you get the point. But truthfully, this is an amazing game. I honestly don't know why it's free, because it deserves to be a pay-to-play game. And another thing, my laptop is probably around 5 or 6 years old, and I'll be honest, not the best. But when I first launched it, it acted like it was nothing...high quality, too. So you really don't have to worry about it lagging so much, at least from your computer. Still depends on your connection to play multiplayer, of course. And if it is laggy on your computer, it was free anyways, all you have to do is delete it. But that should'nt be necessary. I'd actually play this game instead of any Call of Duty game anyday. Really you have to at least give it a try. My personal rating, 10/10. Hope you guys enjoy the game as much as I am!!

review: Highly competitive shooter for tryhards. Make no mistake on that. Valve markets it as something else but it doesn't change what it is. It's NOT easy to pick up. If you're new to quake-like shooters, you'd better have a friend already playing it explain the basics to you, or you might get frustrated by some things. Public pvp and pve (known as mvm in tf2) servers are suitable for casual players once the basics are learned. If you don't want to go comp you can stop there and have quite a bit of fun. Sweaty competitive tryhards will really see where this game shines though. Well balanced, competitive modes will bring your tactical sense and deathmatch ability to a real test. Despite Valve overlooking the competitive format, multiple leagues have arisen offering unforgettable experience for teams on any skill level. If You want to do team based esports, look no further than TF2, this game has more competitive spirit in it than LoL and DOTA combined. As for visual aesthetics the game looks well despite its age, thanks to its stylised look. Some items from content updates are very much out of the game's theme, though, which is very disappointing given how unique that theme is. The game is poorly optimised in some instances too, (especially mvm), but that can be solved by fps boosting configs. All in all: Iz good.

review: I would recommend this one to everyone. Lots of laughs. Seems that there's a lot of people playing it. Free to play unless you like to spend money and have what many others can't afford. As for myself? I'm starting to stay away from F2P/P2P games. It's not worth the time to me anymore. Box it and I'll buy it, if, it has SP for it. I want to learn a game before I jump into multiplayer.

review: TF2 is a game that I, on multiple accounts, have accumulated about 3,000 hours on. I love it to death. I'm even happier that it is still WELL populated and regulated. If you are looking to buy TF2, here are a few things you might want to know. Pros: Skill-based yet accessible gameplay. TF2 is a perfect mix of difficulty, with each class giving a different level of skill. With some very basic twitch skills you can do quite well. At the same time, with practice you can become a god of the field, dominating enemies with a long range rocket hitting them in the air. Gameplay suited to you. Different classes and weapons offer you any placestyle, suited to you. Balanced gameplay. All of the weapons, classes, and mechanics of TF2 feel well-tested for balance. There are few items that are unbalanced, and none that are gamebreaking. Team-based gameplay. As the name implies, a good team is needed to win. You will get more-or-less randomly paired with a team. You don't necessarily have to be good: you just have to contribute. F2P in the best sense. You do not need to buy anything to be good or have fun in TF2. While you cannot trade or find hats as a F2P, those are very little things that do not affect most gameplay. Plenty of gamemodes and maps. Team Fortress 2 keeps the gameplay fresh with plenty of new maps and old, and many gamemodes. Constantly updated. Valve still updates TF2, and even when major updates are scarce, they still care for the game. The community is very much alive as well. Cons: Bad community. There are many good people who play TF2, but there are an equal number of bad who play it too. Nothing can take the fun out of a game of TF2 more than some embittered teammate complaining about how bad you are doing. There are all manner of villainy (I love that word) in the game: scammers who dedicate their existence to getting virtual items with no effect on gameplay, annoying players who key-bind after every kill, little children who think they're in charge (those are more cute than annoying) and elitist players who will scorn you for every failure. The last is perhaps the most irritating: there is many a player who, at the first sight of you being new or bad, will not hesitate to call you a noob or otherwise call you out. There are also many who judge your skill based on your number of hats: I recall on one occasion a behatted P2P getting dominated by a F2P who was better than him, and remarking that the F2P was "lucky" and was a "noob." It was deplorable. I advise going into the game with a thick skin. All in all, I give TF2 a 8.5/10. The game is the best-made I have ever played, and although the community can be a bother, the game itself is remarkably solid. Also, if you don't like it...well, it's free. Seriously, go download it right now. RIGHT NOW.

review: Being upfront about this game is about as hard as a baloney sandwich. Nine classes, 3 base or "stock" weapons each, (unincluding the spy and engineer classes) with multiple abilities and different playstyles for each. That was the base game. Being upfront about this game now is about as hard as wrestling a polar bear with a machine gun strapped to its back in zero gravity. Same nine classes, same stock weapons. But due to updates, content additions and big roll-outs of weapons and hats, this game has changed unbelieveably. Now with new weapons for every class with all new statistics and abilities, strange-teir weapons, vintage-teir weapons, genuine-teir weapons, collector-teir weapons, strangifies, chemistry sets, killstreak kits and fabricators, unusual hats, australium weapons, keys, refined metal- you get it. There's a lot to take in. Team Fortress 2 even has it's own economey that functions similarly to real life ones. But after you learn about it, the game is truly a gem. Hundreds of gamemodes both company and community made, thousands of servers, thousands of maps- there's still a lot to take in. Playing well, developing a strategy, finding new friends and groups- still not done. Trading and finding new items to have, hats to wear, modifiers for your favorite weapons, and much more. If you'd like a quirky, challenging game with thousands of things to do, you're in luck, as Team Fortress 2 has it. If you'd like a serious, hardcore game with clans to join and other clans and groups to beat- you're still in luck, because Team Fortress 2 has that as well. Now stop reading! Go get the game! (p.s. it's free.) 10/10

review: Great game. Another game where you have to apply teamwork to achieve the goal. Unlike many other warfare games, you can't just rush into the battlefield and get #1 on the leaderboard. You might be able to do this, but it 's only helping you and not your team. Each class has their own fun, creative, and interesting personality and styles. Any of these ranging from a German mad scientist, all the way to a mysterious pyromaniac that no one really knows much about. It's overall an amazing game. There's hundreds of different game modes, communities, maps, and much more. You'll never get bored (I mean.. You might)! graphics are pretty sweet, characters are fun and enjoyable to play as and of course, is probably one of the best "Red vs. Blue" stories ever.

review: Oh TF2. I started steam wanted to play Garys Mod, but i did not have the money at the time. As i was looking on steam, i saw this and said "Hey, isn't that the multiplayer game i played on the orange box on Xbox" (I was little at the time. About 9-12 years old.) So, me being a new steam user, also with a slight (Major) case of not paying attention at the time, I didn't look at the price..... and accidentally "bought" the game. I cried for hours at the time because i had my father's credit card attached to this account. (i was 13 at the time, so be quiet.) When my dad looked at the price, he had his trademark sarcastic smile and he said: "well good job Co(errm, Trace, noone needs to know mah name.) you just made me spend $100 on a game!" Let me tell you, i saw my life flash before my eyes. (again, 13 and i had very little common sense... this was before I grew out of being a kid.) Then my dad laughed and said: "Oh i was just joking, dummy. it's a free game!" And that is how i got this game. Oh, what's that, you want a reveiw, not me rambling. *sigh* fine. This game, is Free. (uh Hurr Durr Dummy) Now, Free games are usually sub-par. But this game is different, due to it starting as a paid game, so it had a metric s*** ton of development. So the game is VERY polished. And is STILL polished. Now, time to divide this review into catagories. Gameplay, Controls, Graphics, Community, and it's Total Score. Gameplay: 9/10 This game has a great style of play. You want to know why? It's different. It is not call of duty with regenerating health, or BattleField with Giant maps. The maps are actually not that big, but are of decent size. TF2 has health bars. According to the COD fan that is my friend, That is Bulls***. But don't listen to him. Health bars are great. It makes the game FAIR.... most of the time. You see, with a health bar, it makes you see how long you have to live, and you care about that. without a health bar, you feel like you could run around and spam the SMG or AR. And, along with the health bar, you usually have long as hell respawn times, so you really do not want to die. Now, let's talk about the classes and importance. There are 9 different classes, each with a use. The scout is there to piss off the other team and do chip damage, so others can kill them easy. The soldier is there to deal explosive damage to take down the guys with high health. The pyro is there to act as a counter to the soldier, demo, and spys, with fire to get the spys and airblast for rockets and stickybombs. Then we get to the demo, who can use sticky bombs for traps and deal explosive damage. The heavy is the allclass deterrent, as he can soak up damage, as long as you have a medic or sandvich. The engineer is there to add a line of defense, but the spy can ruin his day easily. The medic does what a medic should do, keep the team healed and shove a medigun up the heavy's . The sniper is there as the heavy killer as headshots at full charge do massive damage. The spy, the hardest class to master, is to get behind the enemy's lines and generally ruin the day. Now, along with nine classes, there are many weapons that are unlockable or craftable, each with an upside and a downside compared to the defaults. If you need to get to the action faster, get the Gloves of Running Urgently for the heavy, or the PowerJack for the pyro. Need to survive as a soldier? Use the BlackBox. The gameplay itself is very polished, fast-paced and generally fun as hell. And more than anything, it is balanced. Shall we move on? Controls: 7/10 The controls are good, but not the best at times. Yes, you can configure it, but i love playing with default controls on every game. WASD is always good, and M1,M2 and M3 are also good. But when the non-essential controls come to play, we have some problems. ZXC are used for character speech. Thats fine and dandy, but there are 9 different types of voicelines. so, the order goes as followed: ZX or C, then 12345678 or 9. But that's not the worst. CTRL is for crouch. not only does that hurt the pinky finger, but crouch is used a lot for explosive jumping and helping with jumping up larger objects. But the reason why the score is not lower is due to the customization for it. I, personally only changed crouch to L. SHIFT and that's really all, other than decline is at O and not K. And with that, let's move on. Graphics: 10/10 Now, Graphics do not make a game good. It only enchances the game. But that aside, the graphics are amazing Many people would say the cartoon-ish graphics make it a kid's game. Faaaaaaaaar from it. this game actually gets quite high with the gore factor, not as bad as some games, but still, quite the amount of gore. But the cartoon atmosphere gives the game a nice, fun feel. Sort of that stupid fun you get when you watch the loony tunes or play Little Big Planet. (my little sisters force me to play it with them.) Heck, sometimes it reminds me of Pokemon emerald with it's bright graphics. (yes, i grew up with emerald.) And when i look at any light-ish green in the game, I get a large rush of nostalgia because it reminds me of my favorite pokemon. (yes, i know i got the dress wrong in my pixel art. I'm working on it.) So, in short, the graphics are great, and gives me nastolgia, but will not contribute much to the score. Moving on to my least favorite part. Community: 6/10 Oh the TF2 community. you can be great at some times, but not all the time. Now, I am not a hater of anything, so long as you do not shove it in my face. Right now, TF2 is full of COD lovers, Bronys, pegasisters, demopans, Star_ lovers, Demospams, unusual flaunters, and more. Now, i am not saying these people are bad, far from it, but a large amount of these people shove it in our faces like we NEED these to survive. Not all, but a lot of them do this. But what redeems this catagory are the workshopers, map makers, good admins and hateblockers. The steam workshop has great stuff that would be great if it would be added. Some of the maps that people make are great, like Black Mesa and TrainSawLaser, even though that is a joke map. The admins on a lot of servers are nice, friendly, and generally are helpful. Hate blockers help with Haters, usually by adding logic into arguments and generally are great people. So, in general, there are a good amount of Fans who shove their interests in our faces, but the rest of the community helps with redemption. Total Score: 8/10 This game is amazing. For a F2P game, it is more than worth getting and is mostly essential to a steam user. Now, this is Silph Co. is a Lie, signing out to eat an omlet. Make sure to rate, post a comment and if i got anything wrong, feel free to correct me, as this is my first reveiw. so, thanks for reading, and tune into my Amnesia, The Dark Descent reveiw next mont.

review: I never was a fan of the first prson shooter games, I just thought that they were all the same Call of Duty style gameplay and nothing more. *Course I forgot that games that I've played in the past like Spyro 3 had some first person gameplay* This game eventually chnged my mind on that. Team Fortress 2 is a sequel to somewhat lesser known Team Fortress. Some of the basic missions in the game include capture the flag where you have to capture the enemies intelegence, attack/defend where one team attacks and the other defends, payload where one team has to deliver a bomb to the enemy, and various other missions. Then there's the co-op mode, Mann vs. Machine where it's one team defending an area from an army of robots. The gameplay is a lot of fun as there are tons of different choices in class and weapons. It helps experimenting with them to see which class you are better at and which weapon works best for you. Unlike in the first game where everyone had the same line, each class member: Scout, Soilder, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy have their own personalities and dailouge. just listening to them talk or watching the Meet the Team series gives you a good idea on what these characters are. one thing that I'm not fond of are the mann co creates that ocassionly appear in your inventory as drop items. In order to open them, you need to buy a key at the mann co store for about $2.30. You think by now they would've been a nit more friendly and just redused it down to a buck instead of people having to deal with crates pilling up in their inventory and can never sell. There are also Stranges, Vintage, Unusual and other named titles to make the weapons or asscessories sound more vailuble, but I don't really care for it that much. I'm just glad that I bought the Mining Light hat for Engi before they stopped selling them. So yeah, TF2 is a fun first person shooter game with it's missions. And if you get tired of that, thre are tons of fan made servers on other styles of gameplay, Saxton Hale Mode, Zombie Survivl, servers for trading or hanging out at like all of those FiM servers, the list never ends. And since it's free, it's a good deal, the only thing you have to pay for is for buying stuff at the Mann Co. Store, unless you get lucky with trading.

review: Okay, I should maybe make this review more fair. Team Fortress 2. What is there to say? This game is pretty fun. Hours of entertainment await in this free game by our favorite developers, VALVe. Hats, guns, giblets, servers, and Pyros make this game extremely fun. But there are some things you should know before using your space for the game: It crashes. A LOT. This game is only slightly more stable than your average Bethesda game, where it appears to be being held together with scotch tape, so if you think you can just pickit up and play it uninterupted for hours, wise up. The hitboxes and lag compensation is also a problem. Beware if your'e Spy or Sniper, as you'll likely miss an obvious headshot/backstab, likewise fighting spies or sniper, as you'll almost definately get backstabbed while looking at the spy face to face or headshot when the sniper wasn't looking at you at some point in your experience. You'll also notice some balancing issues, when 3 engineers start camping your spawn with 3 level 3 sentries with 4 heavies being healed by 4 medics with ubers on standbye. Aside from all that, the game is fun, modable, dumb, and has lots of comedy. If you have patience, this is one of the best shooters you'll ever play. If you have anger/patience issues, beware.

That's not in my TF2 -tionary! - Tryhard Genuine AWPer Hand + Genuine Anger Snipers! - Refrigerators! (Huntsmen!) - Tryhard "I know all 5000 tricks in the book" cornerstabbing Spies! - People who are actually friendly! (Wait, a good highlight? Time to make another bad one.) - Speaking of friendly people, that one guy who kills everyone when you're all having a friendly party! - Tryhards with Unusuals, Buds, and Bills! (10 pages of Keys included.) - Overpriced and overcomplicated economy full of *intelligent* people running it! - Tryhard Spacebar-masher Scouts with Botkillers! (Yes, with Botkillers, usually Silver MKII, or a Soda Popper.)

review: What is Team Fortress 2? It is a game FULL of variety and choices. Team Fortress 2 or TF2 for short, has been out for quite some time and building up a story for TF2. Now the question "What is TF2?" will ne answered. TF2 Is a multiplayer only game about 9 mercenaries who fight against each other to complete certain tasks the 9 mercenaries are: the Scout. the Soldier, the Pyro, the Demoman, the heavy, the engineer, the medic, the sniper, and the spy. Each one of these classes have they're own personality and tricks to hide. Starting off with the scout he is a runner born in boston and learned quickly how to fight living where he did. He takes an interest in baseball and constantly suggests that he should be in a team. The scout in-game is a very fast runner that has a shotgun called the scattergun a pistol and a metal bat. Used in combination he has a double jump manuever. Although he's very fast he has very low health; the lowest in the game. The soldier: A man who claims to have been in the army is a man who takes things way too seriously, Is kinda wierd in the head, and is homeless. We dont know too much but his old house he lived with a magician named "Merasumus" Anyways, the soldier gets a rocket launcher, a shotgun, and a shovel as his weapon. he has average health and uses his rocket launcher to his advantage by shooting a rocket at his feet making him shoot into the air. this is called rocket jumping. The pyro: We have NO idea who this is and where he/she came from this is a man/woman in a flame retardant suit that wears a gas mask and can't speak with it on so the pyro's talking comes out in mumbles. When the "Meet The Pyro" video came out we figures out the pyro is delusional, Believing the world is full of rainbows and instead of a flamethrower he's carrying an orchestra but in real life he's using a flamethrower. So many people either think the pyro is a gay male or just a really wierd woman. The pyro comes equipped with a flamethrower a shotgun and a fireaxe, But we don't have much more information than that. The Demoman: A scottish man who specializes in demolition takes to the battlefield drunk and really angry. As a child it is said he lost his eye to a book called the Bombinomicon But many believe since he talks about it so much that the loch ness monster was the cause. Not much is said about the demoman other than that, except he has average health like the soldier and the soldier and him seem to have a good friendship. He carries a grenade launcher, a stickybomb laucher As he can stickybomb lauch like rocket jumping and a beer bottle. The heavy: A big russian man who carries around a giant minigun fighting off people on the battlefield. It is said he lives in siberia. We don't have too much information on him because the meet the heavy video didn't explain much like the others. The heavy carries around a minigun, a shotgun, and as a melee his fists. The engineer:A texas man who is a builder that can get a nice sentry gun built up in a few minutes. He builds things for the team like dispensers which give ammo and a little health, Sentries which are helpful for defending and teleporters to get to the battlefield. Like the heavy we dont have too much info on him. He carries around a shotgun a pistol and a wrench he can also upgrade all of the said buildings by hitting them with his wrench. The medic: The medic is a german medic who cares not for the patient but for the treatment. He lived in Rottenburg and kept a bird named archamedies. The medic carries around a syringe gun, a healing gun or medigun, and a bonesaw The sniper: an austrailan sniper who lives in a camper van on the road. He specializes in headshots and shooting sniper rifles. He carries a sniper rifle an SMG and a kukri or a big claw looking knife. The spy: A frenchman shrouded in mystery his main attack is backstabbing people with his knife. The spy carries around a revolver a sapper that destroys engineer's buildings, a knife, a invisable watch and a disguise kit. The part that makes the spy so dangerous is the disguise kit he could be anyone on the other team he disguises himself to look like a class of his choosing so the spy could be anyone. The pyro is a good counter to the spies though as the spies when they use they're invisable watch they will be shown by the fire around them. The economy: TF2 is a game that is FILLED with hat's and cosmetics and people are willing to pay for them. This means there is a currency as well. It is metal. In the game there is a crafting option you can take a couple of weapons you have and craft them together to make metal take that metal you made them make 2 more then craft those 3 together and you have a bigger value of metal. This is a frustrating thing to do but if you want that item that bad then go for it. Choices: When i said the game was full of variety and choices i mean this: you have the ability to use HUNDREDS of weapons at your disposal but to do that you must play. After a while of playing it will say you have found an item this is how you earn weapons and eventually cosmetics. Each class varies in weapon. That being said your loadout could be COMPLETELY different in every way to someone elses. Man vs machine: In TF2 there is a gamemode called man versus machine or MVM for short. It's about robots that attack certain areas with a bomb you have to defend the area to make sure these robots dont reach that area and put the bomb in or you lose. The robots are robotic versions of all mercenaries and some are giant versions. There is also a tank but im not going to get into that. Trading: This will be the final part of the review. Trading is a bit of a problem in this game as there are, but few scammers here. You can trade metal for items like taunts, cosmetics and weapons Or you could trade a weapon for a weapon or a taunt for a taunt. In trading there are items called unusuals do not bother trying to get one unless you have mann co keys from the store. I'm sorry but this is the end of the guide but in short tf2 is a fun game full of variety for people to enjoy like myself anyways i hope you enjoyed the guide and i will see you later :3

review: This is the best JRPG I've ever played. The customizability of your teammates is just ridiculous, and with over 400 Personas to summon, the game just oozes with content. My only problem is there are only 8 social links to do, and there aren't enough male characters; don't get me wrong, I love a JRPG with powerful female companions, but there's only one male in this game and it's the main character. There are also over 50 dungeons in the game, and while the game can be hard, the challenge is certainly one of the most enjoyable aspects of TF2. I give TF2 a 10/10, because it is the best JRPG ever since Call of Duty on the PS1.

review: Being upfront about this game is about as hard as a baloney sandwich. Nine classes, 3 base or "stock" weapons each, (unincluding the spy and engineer classes) with multiple abilities and different playstyles for each. That was the base game. Being upfront about this game now is about as hard as wrestling a polar bear with a machine gun strapped to its back in zero gravity. Same nine classes, same stock weapons. But due to updates, content additions and big roll-outs of weapons and hats, this game has changed unbelieveably. Now with new weapons for every class with all new statistics and abilities, strange-teir weapons, vintage-teir weapons, genuine-teir weapons, collector-teir weapons, strangifies, chemistry sets, killstreak kits and fabricators, unusual hats, australium weapons, keys, refined metal- you get it. There's a lot to take in. Team Fortress 2 even has it's own economey that functions similarly to real life ones. But after you learn about it, the game is truly a gem. Hundreds of gamemodes both company and community made, thousands of servers, thousands of maps- there's still a lot to take in. Playing well, developing a strategy, finding new friends and groups- still not done. Trading and finding new items to have, hats to wear, modifiers for your favorite weapons, and much more. If you'd like a quirky, challenging game with thousands of things to do, you're in luck, as Team Fortress 2 has it. If you'd like a serious, hardcore game with clans to join and other clans and groups to beat- you're still in luck, because Team Fortress 2 has that as well. Now stop reading! Go get the game! (p.s. it's free.) 10/10

So I threw a jar of urine at him and headshotted him with a bow and arrow. Then he stabbed me in the back with an ice pick and froze my corpse. So I set him on fire with a gun that fires rainbows. We became best friends, then spent the rest of the round doing the Conga. 11/10 would conga again.

Overall the gameplay is great, also the characters have their own story to tell. If there is a character that you like to play, then Team Fortress is just the game for you! Hop in and choose a character of your liking, sadly as I said in the previous lines.. The cosmetic items are sometimes really expensive, so loosen up your wallet a bit! Good points: -Dynamic gameplay -Easy going and fast learning -Fun with friends -a wild variation of weapons to choose of! Meh points: -Not as free as they telling you -A very annoying kick-system -Alot of trade requests

review: team fortress 2 is a brilliant game which sucsesfully orients its self around extream vilonce (first person shooter) but pulls it off with a comical feel hopeing to make people take it less seriosly. the game also has an ultrapenerial aspect to it with scrap banking involved and also some items with more than 5000 you can get lots of money for doing these things. i would recomend this to someone who has never had much experiance with FPSs and especily someone who has not played call of duly alot becuase of the very diffrent battle styles. this game would be perfect for someone who is above the age of eight.

review: First it's a fun game, but then you get a hat. Then you want more hats AND MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND MORE..... And then you play the actual game. And holy sh*t it's a masterpiece. Best Class-based shooter I have ever seen. Has a nice engine, artstyle, original fun weapons and cool game mechanics. It also has MVM and of course... And the upcoming BREAD MONSTER Turns out valve didn't add a bread monster. Shame on you Valve, shame on you...

review: This game is 1 of it's bests and so I will like it. Why? 1) It's one of the best F2P(free-to-play) games ever created, because the concept of this game itself is just great. 2) This game is not as PTW(pay-to-win) as any of F2P games that I have yet encountered. 3) It is really a game that is build on cummunity and is great to play with friends, really... almost every item here from now included is made by community. 10/10 - "Best free-to-play game existing" I hope my comment to this game "Team Fortress 2" was somehow usefull, if you think I was wrong at some point please contact me. Have a nice day. Bye. THANKS FOR READING

review: Team Fortress 2, after 7 years of its lifetime, still hosts a great community(Mostly) The grand feature of this game, is the classes. They all have something unique about them, comparing spy and sniper. Spy is more relaxed, mischivous(Is this how you spell it?) and a guy likes to **** with your head. Sniper is rude, curses WAY more than spy(Spy does say **** you occasionally) and even likes to mock the dead, charming. But theres more, their isn't just "Pick sniper cause 360 No scopes(although a new weapon allows for this)" they all are handy in different situations, spy is great for sapping and destroying strong enemies behind enemy lines. Sniper is great for picking off the medic and engineers(Weirdly, sniper is a counter to engineer) Theres all unique playstyles in the game. But some might not be your cup of tea. Scout is fast moving. Soldier is strong and has high mobility. Pyro burns ****. Demoman blows up whatever the **** he sees. Heavy is tank nuff said. Engineer is the high intelligence defence builder. Medic is that most is the most helpful class on the front lines. Sniper stays back and shoots peoples heads off. Spy is the chaser or the chased. 9 different playstyles, but none of them might fit you. But we have someone to spice up the playstyles. Some weapons in TF2 can COMPLETELY change your playstyle. E.G the Air Strike encourgages you to rocket jump for that extra firing speed that is fast as Usain Bolt. Another E.G the B.A.S.E jumper encourages you to put on the Air Strike for soldier for extra damage and mobility. Overall a 10/10 but does lack in major updates, but that dosen't matter as they change up the game most of the minor ones.

review: HOLY  THIS GAME IS AMAZING. sorry had to get that out, but if a friend tells you to get this game, DO IT IMMEDIATLY, it is so amazing the cartoony gameplay is new and fresh the controls are amazing and you can make a good profit from this game, Play your cards right and you just might get a lot of free games or good items (seriously from only spending a total of .41 cents on this game only to get premium i didnt regret it and i met some guy online we played and he gave me a free copy of bioschock for no reason). Plus it is extremely addicting and i cant stop playing, in a period of 6 months or less i have spent almost 400 hours on this game, it is amazing. TIP never say that hats are useless IN CHAT people will call you a noob and you kind of are. Just to say, Hats show your rankings as a player for me i am decently respected and I have a couple of really good miscs, The hatless the hated on a lot and BUY AN ITEM to get premium, trust me it is worth it in the long run.

review: For those who don't know what this game is, it is a M+ rated game about a war between 2 teams/robots. The gameplay is extremely varied in a good way. You can choose from 9 classes to play as, each with strengths and weaknesses. As well as training, there is multiplayer which is great too. There are 8 gamemodes to play in multiplayer. From pushing a bomb down a road to delivering a briefcase to a missile, these modes are also diverse. Plus trading items obtained or crafted in the game to other players to collect new ones and this game is just amazing. 5 out of 5, 10 out of 10, however you want to say it. Also in terms of graphics, the game is pretty good in that department. 9 out of 10 for graphics. The in-game store works very well and adds people's creations for sale. The Steam market also lets you sell stuff but in a different way: selling marketable items in your inventory. You can get money out of this to buy stuff from the in-game store so about a 8 1/2 for the store and overall a 9 1/4 for the entire game. Last thing: hats are the most important thing in the game.

review: The rockets represent the hardships and malice that the soldier has been weighted with throughout his life of war. He doesn't believe what his eyes are telling him. All they show is limitation, the heavy burden of only succeeding with violence. He looks with understanding, to find out what he already knows, that his violence is essential for the team, for survival. And then he sees the way to fly.

It lets me make s mad with my 1337 h34d5h0t 5k1ll5. It lets me rage at a certain area-denial class. It lets me feel helpful by pointing a healy beam towards people with nice hats. It lets me huddah my huddah while reflecting huddahs' huddahs. It lets me be a giant Russian man with nothing but a sandwich and mittens, protesting violence.

It is free-to-play, and although there are in game transactions, you can run through 90 hours of gametime and not have to pay a single cent to have a lot of fun. The only real problems are the occasional few squeaker brats and the power of the computer your using.

review: Everything good about this game as already been said but regardless it's a good game has guns n' classes. This game you could be a team player or a lone wolf and theres a class for each and anyones play style but best to test each class for yourself. One problem is the outrageous prices for stuff just to find out it's alot less than what you traded for so if your not being ripped off by a player your just supplying Valve with more money than they need. Overall is amazing and the custom maps and gamemodes not to mention skins and sounds you can mod in makes the game all the more enjoyable.

All I know is I got up from the bed, like I was going down to the can or something, and then I tried to sock him, with all my might, right smack in the toothbrush, so it would split his goddam throat open. Only, I missed. I didnt connect. All I did was sort of get him on the side of the head or something. It probably hurt him a little bit, but not as much as I wanted. It probably wouldve hurt him a lot, but I did it with my right hand, and I cant make a good fist with that hand. On account of that injury I told you about.

review: Team Fortress 2 is a game about the most cut throat thing in human history, fashion. Every aspect of this award winning game is made as an allegory to the ever changing world of fashion and the pitfalls that can befall any who wish to partake of this amazing experience. You must find hats and accessories through a random drop system that represents the elusive mistress of, 'inspiration.' Then you must find the perfect colors, names, and descriptions for your hats and accesories to set yourself apart from the other less fortunate players of the game. This would be a boring system much like the many you can find in the bland JRPGs that litter the market. What sets TF2 apart is their inclusion of a fantastic and complicated mini-game about shooting each other that blends wonderfully into the allegorical narrarative of cut throat, fast paced, deadly fashion.

review: Highly competitive shooter for tryhards. Make no mistake on that. Valve markets it as something else but it doesn't change what it is. It's NOT easy to pick up. If you're new to quake-like shooters, you'd better have a friend already playing it explain the basics to you, or you might get frustrated by some things. Public pvp and pve (known as mvm in tf2) servers are suitable for casual players once the basics are learned. If you don't want to go comp you can stop there and have quite a bit of fun. Sweaty competitive tryhards will really see where this game shines though. Well balanced, competitive modes will bring your tactical sense and deathmatch ability to a real test. Despite Valve overlooking the competitive format, multiple leagues have arisen offering unforgettable experience for teams on any skill level. If You want to do team based esports, look no further than TF2, this game has more competitive spirit in it than LoL and DOTA combined. As for visual aesthetics the game looks well despite its age, thanks to its stylised look. Some items from content updates are very much out of the game's theme, though, which is very disappointing given how unique that theme is. The game is poorly optimised in some instances too, (especially mvm), but that can be solved by fps boosting configs. All in all: Iz good.

review: Welcome to profit simulator 20XX. The jist of this game is to buy stuff as cheap as possible, sell that stuff as expansive as possible then rinse and repeat. I don't always play this simulator as the gameplay gets quite repetitve and it's hard to get items that are on fire "cause fire n warm glowy stuff" - Trading cornmunity on a regular basis. Other than these flaws the gameplay is fine. You have 9 classes, Scout he has +50% profit and +75% chance of ruining your day and sadly you can only play him in 4 colors black, white, pink and green he isn't a very good stealth class because his vibrant colors standout on the maps making me think they didn't think it through when choosing his color scheme. Soldier he has +40% profit -15% speed and +60% dressing apeal. He too falls to the same flaws as the scout having only 2 color choices pink and green. Despite his -15% speed he can sacrifice a chunk of his health to do a super jump, although they say you use the rocket launcher to do this you end up exploding into millions of pieces you actually hold down right click to charge it and let go while looking up to perform this move. This class is overall good and can help you out if making profit is a bit time consuming and boring with his increased dressing apeal can add a few extra hours of fun just by dressing him up. Pyro he has +25% profit +999% speed while target is in contact by flames, +85% outfit diversity and 65% more confusion. Her main weapon is the flamethrower which allows major bursts of speed if you set people on fire making him a very interesting but new players should avoid using her as his most game changing ability is her comrpession blast which can defend you by deflecting rockets, grenades, plasma grenades, ariplanes, soldiers, wild cabermen and steam flash sales but you have to time his ability or else you'll be hit which is why she isn't recomended for new players. With the highest outfit diversity in the game he can create intersting and profitable combos which also requires a decent amount of experince to even pull off. Demoman has +35% profit, +50% boom, -25% outfit diversity, +999% damage only active with stock secondary and +45% stealth (Only active during the night). This "unique" looking individual is the explosive expert of the team with his loadout that consist of sharp blades, shields and boots making him an agile tank of destruction, pairing this up with the stock secondary makes you invincible because your aura becomes so strong from the damage increase everything gets ripped from reality and only requires you to press two buttons repeatedly making him easily the best class in combat. Unfourtunatly despite his godly stats in combat he falls short in profiting abilities with having outfits of things from the past, making diversity a problem and can hinder his profit stat. Heavyweapons has -35% speed, +90 more ammo, +10% profit, +60 more gun, +45% outfit diversity +175 bulk. This character is a mixed bag for combat and profit his combat ability is soaking damage and retaliating but he is slow forcing him into a more defence gameplay which can be quite slow and doesn't feel rewarding and the fact that demoman's damage is off the charts the heavy can only last 3 seconds once he enters the demoman's 30 metre aura making this class redundant. As for profit he can be very effective if you can find someone who prefers this characters outfits which because of his offical mascot status can make this quite easy to find. Oh an also the heavy has a hidden ability called "Thick Fat" which makes him take 50% less damage from temperature based attacks. The Engineer has +35% profit, +90% calm down, +35% fun and -20% height. Don't look at that -20% height as a bad thing that can be the difference between life and death (even though the characters share the same hit boxes for most projectiles.) and with his sentry gun ability you can create a machine gun that has aimbot and can even upgrade it to shoot rockets aswell making this class easily the most defensive class and with his +90% calm down stat makes him a good switch after a stressful day of ripping people off. The engineers outfit divirsity is interesting and quite large but nothing like the pyros. The elusive Medic has +0.005% speed, +80% happiness, -45% damage, +60% crit ratio, -90% common. The medic is a god send in the meta-game and has the most complex and useful magic attacks in the game with such abilities such as partner shield, skill crits and restore these along can be used together to create devastating combos that can counter even the demomans destructive aura which is why they used this spell combinations on the already powerful demoman to tripple his aura's damage and radius. The truth to why the medic is so powerful is because of how rare and fragile they are but when someone experienced enough gets ahold of one they can unleash hell. The medic is soley combat orientated the only ability in profit he is capable of is restoring hats to their original form. Sniper has +90% common, +90% new players, -100% usefullness in large numbers, -70% productivity, -35% vision and -75% interesting outfits. This class can be beast in the hands of a pro but will still be destroyed by demomen, making him pointless and all you can do for fun is scope in atleast with soldier and scout you can do something intersting with them and too many new players choose him like some kind of god or something as if it's the  in some other game or something like and fail with him that and then we end up having just scouts, snipers and spies. It's just as bad for profit they only have 2 colors pink and green which is a small choice for making profits plus people are lazy with how they look and take the generic stuff angus hood, outback interlectual, that berret with a little shield on it, those sound thingys from apple that hurt your ears and that leather thing for his face and nothing else making him a very linear and boring class combat and profit wise. Spy has +80% commons, +90% new players, -80% usefullness in large numbers, -55% productivity, +60% style, -75% visibility and +55% stealth. The spy has the same faults as the sniper combat wise the demomans arua wrecks him and and too many inexperienced players choose him. The worse part is that they don't even bother trying to use the revolver his only way of self-defense other than the energy shield watch. Along with this he is a very paitent and slow class that requires finding the right momment to strike and the right momment to run. Profit wise he has a hole wardrobe of stylish fedoras and diverse suits making him a very interesting class for profiting. If you're a fan of tycoon games this might be right up your alley. 8.9/10

review: I love TF2 so much! Even though people are now obsessed with hats (I am a victim), it's still fun for just it's gameplay between the nine classes, the awesome weapons for multiple play-styles, and even the modified servers and the Valve servers. Sure, there's "join this server, type giveall, get all achievements for weapons and hats!" servers (which someone pranked me to type giveall and gave me tons of acheivements that I wanted eo get legit) and strange leveling up servers and the occasional AFK or whatsamacallit ones where you just sit there and get weapons you can just get legit by the weapon drops, but there's amazing ones! Such as randomizer, TF20, TF10, sandbox servers (I think PoniPoniPoni Sandbox is the only one that does this), trade servers (there is an amazing trade system on this game if you haven't tried it out yet), Prop Hunt, and many other ones! If you haven't played TF2, play it! NOW! 10/10 Ruined my life and...... well, fun, I guess

review: This game is very fun, because of its difference with the other FPS games (or should I say TFPS?). Its difference is in the personality of the characters, and they each do different things. Not like 4 people do the same thing just different models. The main reason I play this game is because I am a server hoster and I love modding the game. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Q1: Is that Redstone?

review: I'm just gonna make a short list to make things clear: Pros: + It's not pay-to-win (unlockable weapons are sidegrades but almost no upgrades) + 9 very unique classes with extreme up- and downsides (if you wanna win, you need teamwork) + Since there are almost only sidegrades, they offer different playstyles to discover + Fast gameplay + Overall nice balance (Nothing is too overpowered) + A fun Coop-Mode ("Mann vs. Machine" - 6 players against waves of robot enemies) + Unique 60's comic-like style (Watch the trailers to get an idea of the games style) + Great humor (Character's voice lines, in-game news, item descriptions, ...) + A nice way to individualize your characters with cosmetic items (they dont affect the gameplay) + Still a lot of updates which include bugfixes, new cosmetic items, maps and weapons + Steam Workshop implementation (community items are actually often put into the game) + Nice competitive scene + Much game modification possible (custom skins, custom sounds, custom HUD... you know the drill, it's source engine) + Premium-Accounts don't bring any gameplay advantages + Long-time fun since theres much to discover Cons: - Some unlocks are rather annoying - Some classes need much practice until you become effective for your team - Content upgrades often only bring new cosmetics, less maps and rarely weapons - Still lots of minor bugs which need to be fixed - Workshop is only for items but not maps Some facts you should also know when you want to try specific weapons: * You gain items randomly when playing. It's a random amount which resets every Thursday. You usually "find" weapons (you can also find cosmetic items, but only when you're premium). * If you wan't to try a specific weapon, try the the ingame shop and look out for a "Test"-Button. Usually, you are able to test the weapon for some days. * If you want to have the weapon as your own item, play the game until you gain some random drops and use the trading system to trade for items with other people (People usually trade 2 random weapons with 1 specific weapon). * Don't buy weapons from the shop, it's horribly overpriced. That's about it. If you like a fast teamwork-based online shooter, you will also like Team Fortress 2. Give it a shot and download it.

review: As far as I know, it's the only class-based multiplayer shooter where a crazed rogue soldier can detonate a fast talking kid from Boston using only a futuristic rocket launcher meant for mangling cows. Oh, and did I mention he was flying through the air at Mach speeds, while sporting a bright lime green Santa beard, a Dr. Seuss hat with money forever falling from the brim, and an eagle taped to his shoulder? Not to mention the Scout was doing the conga with a massive man from Russia, who was obsessed with sandwiches. Yeah. The Soldier's probably screaming something along the lines of "MAGGOTS!" too. Gabe, we waited nine years. We got update after update, waiting for the incredible potential of this masterpiece to be unleashed upon the PC gaming community. Now, because the situation mentioned above is entirely possible within ANY game I have ever played (and enjoyed, for that matter,) I can die a happy person. My soul will be rested with nothing left desired from this world. I can indeed say, this game was, without a doubt, worth the weight. PLAY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW, OR GABE'S WRATH WILL FOREVER BE INFLICTED UPON YOU AND ALL OF YOUR FAMILY TREE. *not really. But, seriousally, play the game. It is extremely good, the best in the FPS genere, in my opinion. Give it a whirl. IT'S FREE. 10/10 Best Gabe Ever

review: Simply put, TF2 is a comical FPS that redefines what we look for in a shooter game. This game never gets old. In addition to the addicting gameplay, there's a whole economy of trading that comes with it. All in all, TF2 is a must-have for any and all game collections.

review: Graphics - The graphics for Team Fortress 2 might not seem up to par with other Valve games, but it's the art style that matters. The cartoonish graphics fit so well with this game, I wouldn't have it any other way! 5/5 Music - This game has amazing music! It's a shame we typically only hear it on the menu and during events. 3/5 Story - While Team Fortress 2 does have a story, it's never told in game. The story can be found on the wikipedia page, if you're interested in reading it. It explains why the two teams are fighting, at least. 2/5 Replayability - Many gamemodes, maps, and weapons always being added. Don't like what they have? Modded game mods range from far and wide, Prophunt, Saxton Hale, the list goes on. It's never a bad time when you launch this game again. 5/5 Gameplay - The gameplay is nice, and balanced. Something other FPS's can't always say. Not pay to win, either, which should be noted considering it's also Free-to-Play! 5/5 Overall Score - 4/5 Good.

review: TF2 is a must have and you should feel ashamed and dirty if you don't already have it. Everyone and their mother is boasting their F2P game nowadays, but it usually turns out to be a Pay2Win. TF2 is not like that at all. While some people may argue the whole Mann Co. Store makes the game Pay2Win, they're lying. Every weapon in the game can be aquired through random drops. No painful leveling, no grinding. Just play at your own leisure and the weapon will eventually fall into your lap. If you are an impatient little  you can always just go to the Mann Co. Store and spend a candy bar's worth of money on whatever weapon you want. TF2 is an incredibly balanced game with no class being better than the other *COUGH* Pyro*COUGH* All of that aside you have 9 completely different play styles if you don't count the plethora of different weapons and gamemodes where you might play a class entirely different. Valve, the sweethearts they are, also host holiday events and constantly add in new weapons and hats. Oh yeah, there are hats. Along with competitive play you can spend money to play with friends COOL RIGHT?! In all honesty, the TF2 Co-Op gamemode is lots of fun and is really hectic and chaotic, but DEAR GOD IS IT DIFFICULT. It's probably just cause I suck. TF2 is truly a spectacle in the FPS world, managing to rake in more money than Ethiopia in a year by selling hats. Now, these hats are not real. They are a line of code. They don't increase health or make you jump higher. They make you look cool. This is one of the aspects I'm not so crazy about. This hat-hierarchy if you will, causes a lot of discrimination between the community as to who's free to play and who's not. Along with that, the community is not the best in the world, especially not the Man Vs Machine one, TF2's Co-Op game. Overall TF2 is a great game to have in your library. It brings hours and hours of fun and excitement and is great to play with friends or by yourself. As an FPS in general it is more goofy than Battlefield or Call of Duty. What it lacks in seriousness it makes up for in charm and being better than Call of Duty. My final rating for TF2 is 8/10 for being a fun and totally replayable FPS for everyone. It is great as an entry level FPS or one for veterans. ALSO IT'S FREEEEEEE! So go on, go get it. What are you waiting for? I'm going to stand here until you go and get it. If you disagree with me feel free to tell me why and try and sway my opinion otherwise.

review: You know what? I recommend this. Not because it's a good game, which it is, but because I know that somewhere, SOMEWHERE, there is a person. A person that doesn't give any bulls about the outside world. If that person is readint this right now, pick this game up. You'll never see the outside world again, or the rest of your house, or anyone you held dear to your heart. But who cares when you have all these hats?

review: an overall brillant game with good gameplay classes and modes to choose from but some of the weapons are just either too overpowered or just too weak,but most are very balanced.Another complaint is that when i try to trade it says i must get steam guard from the settings but i lack the knowlegde of where it is in the settings,i do not dislike this too much though because i dont realy need to trade much.I also suggest a new class as it slowly gets boring if you use the classes too much.But my complaints dont realy bother me much and i still find myself coming over to my laptop to play it.You did good valve, you did good.Anyone who hasent played this,go search it up and start the download.

review: Team Fortress is the first, and the best, hat-based war game ! Using a totally new hat system, it will force you to kill other people to steal their hats ! And, even if you finally get a hat, there's no better showroom than a battlefield !

review: This...Is actually really fun, though I tend to suck at multiplayer FPS games. Smooth gameplay, fun classes with personalities, a whole array of items like a flare gun, bow and arrow, ING QUICKSCOPING SNIPER RIFLE WITH A ROBOT HEAD ATTACHED THAT TRACKS KILLS, cosmetics, ING COWBOY HAT WITH FIRE SWIRLING AROUND IT, and a...A DECENT COMMUNITY. Usually I see teamwork which is always good, the rare friendly heavy that throws sandviches, and Crash Bandiscout using Bonk and running to the intel, medics healing everyone, yada yada yada. It's even free, though their is premium-Which can cost as little as 69 cents. It's a real fun game, but the only downside is the new player friendline-Oh who the  am I kidding, it's good for new players, takes a little while to learn the ropes but it's easy, fast paced (sometimes.) and fun. Only pet peeve about it is sniper class when players learn how to quickscope. Walk outta spawn, die in 0.3 seconds flat. Overall: 8/10

review: This game is like a leech. It slowly sucks the life-juice out of your body with every passing minute. Your funds will drop and you will be forced to eat soggy pieces of bread off of the ground as a source of nutrition. You will lose your religion, GabeN will become your love and your savior. Hats will become your only friends, as your real friends matter not. Overall, I rate Hat Simulator 2 a 10/10, would waste life to ValvE again.

review: This game has absorbed hours, upon hours of my life. And my money. For what? Ill tell you: Hats. Hats become your life once you begin playing tf2. I had a friend, he went insane. Everyday at school, he would sit in the corner whispering, "Hats... hats... hats..." Until he disappeared. The game is fun, but im telling you, people have gone missing because of the hats 10/10 would recomend this to small children

review: Quite an interesting design may I say, the game is a cartoony-realistic shooter based on the american outbacks of the 1970s which introduces you into a very exciting fantastic world of endless battles led by free willing mercenaries that face no consequences for their wars and magically respawn after being shattered into pieces by rockets, fighting on land and not in law for the territories of two dramatically cursed brothers that bicker until the end of their century long lives and after. And you also have hats. Lots.

review: I have played Team Fortress 2 since the day it was released (Oct. 10 2007). It's changed a lot since then, but I still consider it the best multiplayer FPS ever made. I have about 460 hours in this game at the time of this writing, and I still laugh my  off every time I play. By reading this, I'm going to assume you're thinking about trying it for the first time, so here's some things all newbies should know: - Some classes are much more difficult learn than others. I'd start your first games playing as Medic, Soldier, Heavy, and/or Pyro. Until you get a decent grasp of things, stay away from Engineer and especially Spy. - Don't worry about the custom weapons that many other players will have. Although some are good, the base weapons are still often the best choice for every weapon of every class. As long as you don't take the game too seriously, it's impossible to not have fun playing it.

review: Honestly, I cannot find any avid gamer that is on steam and does not play Team Fortress 2. It's almost sacriligious to even have steam installed without also having TF2, as it's called by the players, on at least one computer capable of running it well, and boy is that not surprising. This game literally eats up time like no other (except maybe Dota 2 for some, or call of duty for others), and to be honest, the community is just as great. I can easily find a server where nobody gives a crap about killing as many other players as possible, or I can join one with an internationally recognised player for their prowess or two. The amount of hats too! it's all mind boggling that there are still gamers out there that haven't found TF2 enjoyable or have not even heard of it in general. What else to talk about...oh, the support. Obviously, due to its enourmous fanbase and it's publisher being the great and powerful Gaben (Steam creater and CEO(?)), it will almost always be there, as even Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is still supported and given server-space on top of all the newer games. Anyways, I highly recommend this game, and the game in summary would have to be: Hat Simulator 2014 :3 Happy Hat hunting my friends! I hope to see you in-game.

The cartoony characters, the unique playstyles for all the classes, the unlockable weapons (and hats), and the different types of matches will keep you playing this game for tens to hundreds of hours. Best part: It's completely free!

review: Team Fortress Two, the name itself is well known enough to sell the game. TF2 has existed since for over 6 years now and has still outlived most shooters. Unlike the other team fortress games/mod it is much more quirky than serious. However do not let its good nature fool you, it is still a very competitive game with communities ranging from trading based to competition. Even though it is very serious sometimes, it is also very easily to find a game focused just on having fun, which is rather difficult in most games now. TF2's community is mostly responsible for the current content in the game. Maps, weapons, and character cosmetics are mostly created by the community and added in Valve's official updates. The community is even responsible for creating a currency system using the crafting materials and a few notable cosmetics. Even though the game has existed for many years, there is so much balance amongst the nine classes and their various weaponry that new players and beta testers alike can be engaged in a battle with no clear outcome until the final seconds. In short, there is no reason to not try TF2. There is a class for any playstyle and its a free game that i so fun, I don't think anyone would mind paying for.

Otherwise, I'd be playing it all the time. My advice to anyone who values their current social life: Don't play this game too much if you don't have good real-life friends who also play. And remember, kids, TF2 is not real life. I'm generally considered a noob at this game, but I still have plenty of fun being killed, or if I'm lucky, finding someone else I can kill. Let me repeat myself: don't take this game too seriously. It's a lot of fun until you forget it's a game.

review: Team fortress 2 is unlike any other game ever, its a game where the community rules and they have a say in almost everything, from voting for the top maps to getting their dream items into the game. and the best part is Its Free to Play for everyone. I recommend this game to people who want a difference in a shooter who want originallity in what they play. If you believe that then i recommend team fortess 2 to you.

review: This is one of the best games I've ever played (besides Halo) and I just want to say that I love it a lot. (You can tell by my hours lol) It's true, this game is basically only hats and cosmetics, but I think you could really have a lot of fun on this game. Look at every review, I'll bet you they're ALL positive. This is the best F2P game on steam, so go ahead, get it for yourself all of you noobs out there. Buy some hats (no really don't, this game will clean out your wallet), kill a lot of people! An lastly, get a gibus and wear it on your head with a smile.

review: It's alright, it should be the first free game for everyone but it could be heavily improved if they had better game modes, more realistic weapons (such as machine gun), and if nothing costed money in-game.

review: This game is definitely part of my "top 5 best games vis" In this game you have 9 classes with different features, personalities, stories and of course weapons. Hats plays a big role in the game, but it is completely illogical because no other FPS does not have any hats :3 Hats are awesome as well.

Now, find yourself a strong, friendly, accepting community of fun people to play with, and you don't need any other games.

review: This game is... it's... it's too great to be described with mere adjectives! This game is absolutely with out a doubt one of the best games out there! It was indeed "Worth the Weight". It's art style is amazing because it is so unique and different from anything I've ever seen, this goes for both the characters, items, and enviorment. I find the game's visual appearence breathtaking. For the small amount of soundtracks this game consists of, they are amazing. This game is great because it seemingly never gets old, with dozens of different gamemodes, exciting new content updates, and its annual Scream Fortress, Smissmas, and other events. Yet, the best thing about the game (at least to me it is) is the nine classes that the game consists of. Each class is full of personality and dialogue, whether its insulting taunts or hillarious cathphrases. All of the classes are very different from each other with weapons, dialogue, attitude, style, and the way you play as them. First off you have your Offensive category, consisting of the Scout, Soldier, and Pyro. The Scout is a fast, smart-mouthed, "all bark and no bite" kind of kid with weapons that are most effective at close range, requiring a hit-and-run sort of tactic. The Soldier is a dedicated American with a strong passion to fight. Possessing a Rocket Launcher as his primary weapon, the soldier is a powerful threat to his opponents, but all that power leaves him with a slow speed, requiring him to use a maneuver known as the "Rocket Jump" to travel faster in exchange for some health. The Pyro is a mumbling lunatic, whose history is a mystery to just about everyone, he (or possibly she) wields a Flamethrower as his/her main weapon which makes him/her lack a lot of range, but gives a lot of potential power if used correctly. He/she is best used for ambushing enemies and his/her Compresion Blast (Airblast) can be used to reflect many projectiles back at opponents. Next is the Deffensive category, the Demoman, Heavy, and Engineer. The Demoman is a one-eyed, drunk Scottish man who has no bullet-based weapons and fights instead with 2 explosive weapons. He can take out enemies that he can't see with his Grenade Launcher or lay traps with his Sticky Launcher. The Heavy is a large, strong, Russian beast that uses his beloved Minigun. His immense power and large size leaves him with a very slow speed but with very strong fire power. He may be considered an easy target due to his size, but as long as he has his Minigun he should be treated as a threat just like all the other classes. The Engineer is a intelligent Texan that relies mainly on his buildings to fight. His Sentry Gun is generally a threat to any enemy within it's range, he can build a Dispenser to heal him and his teammates as well as refill there ammo, and he can also build teleporters so his team can access areas faster. The last category is the Supportive classes, consisting of the Medic, Sniper, and Spy. The Medic is a German doctor with amazing medical technology at his disposal. He is not one known for attacking but instead he is known for healing. Using his Medi-gun, he can quickly heal his teammates. Once charged enough, he can deploy what is known as an "Ubercharge", making him and whoever he is healing temporarily invincible to any damage from enemy weapons. The Sniper is an Austrailian outdoorsman who, as his name suggests, uses a Sniper Rifle as his main weapon. He can do extreme ammounts of damage at long range, making him a valueble teammate when used correctly. At short range though, he is more vulnerable and can easily be overwhelmed by enemies. Lastly, we have the Spy, a French trickster who can disguise himself as his opponents and quietly sneak behind enemy lines. He can perform a "Backstab", resulting in an instant kill, use his Sapper to destroy enemy buildings such as Sentries, and use his Cloaking Device to become temporarily invisible to sneak around danger. Playing as a Spy requires stealth and smarts to succeed. The best thing about all these characters is the fact that, other than the Heavy being the games main Icon, none of the classes seem to be better than the rest. They all have their own special weaknesses and none of them are generally favored over the others. The game is a masterpiece and that's all I can say.

review: This is a great fps game. It has a cartoony feel to it which is not very common among most first person shooter games. However if you have played games like COD or other games with guns, be aware that this is nothing like those. It has specific classes with set weapons, all classes have weaknesses and strengths. Not recommended for people who like to play offline either as the training games are not the best.
game-hours: 2299.5
review: Team Fortress 2 is an FPS game with a singleplayer and multiplayer servers. I think that this game is awesome, but they need to upgrade the weapon/item drop system, it needs to give new players a few more items than people who have been playing the game more often. The textures are somewhat realistic with a sort of "cartoony" feel to them. The player models are good but could use a little more detail, even if it's a "cartoony" game. Basic plot: Mann CO. a company run by the tough Saxton Hale who had 3 sons, Red, Blu, and Grey. Red and Blu exiled Grey and fought with eachother like maniacs. Grey came back with replicas of Red and Blus armies, Robots. Classes: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demo, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy.

Even if people say, "TF2 is stupid because everybody is only worrying about hats and cosnedics." still, dont judge a book (or game) by it's cover. In my opinion, TF2 is so much better than any other FPS game, mostly because of that they're barely any 3 year olds playing and complaining about how this one guy keeps backstabbing him. 200000000000000000/10 (edit: and mostly always i'm the one doing the backstabbing...)

review: I really like everything in TF2, (hats, weps, random drops, etc). My three favorite classes, are, Pyro, Demo, and, medic. Run in with Pyro and try to fry as many as possiable, hope that theres no medics so that your run wouldn't be ruined, Demo, I had one awesome round with Demo, my team was really close to getting the last cap point, and then i used the "Charge N Targe", and ran on the point and won for us, and i noticed when, i turned around, everyone was coming in. Medic, first class i ever played in TF2, i like how Medic is a simple class, just go heal, maybe heal yourself a bit, but not too much, because you want your teammates to live for a bit longer, and, thats all you gotta do, nothing more...

review: Team Fortress 2: One of the most amazing FPS games of this generation, even if you arent too much into FPS there is always trading and a long list of custom gamemodes. Now "Whats trading?" you may ask, well. Trading is one of the strongest points of TF2, you can swap hats, weapons, tools and ingame currency, now dont worry you dont have to pay A DIME even the ingame currency as mentioned is free (exeption of keys which have to first be bought then traded). Now even if you dont enjoy trading but want swanky new items you can try crafting them or by playing the game and getting random item drops BUT you can also spend some real life money and buy some items! Lets talk about the actual game now, the game itself is one of the most balanced and skill based games ever made. There is 9 classes that are all 100% balanced, over 50 maps and hundreds of custom maps and hundreds of balanced weapons to use! My overall rating for this amazing FPS is 10/10, I have played it everyday and will keep playing forever! ~Delta

review: Truly amazing game, and its been like that for the past 7 years! From the day I started, I have thoroughly enjoyed this game. Valve has chose and done bad mistakes, but people just shake it off, and deal with it. The trading system is very good but Pishers came with it aswell, that can upset some people after clikcing a link. Otherwise, a extraodinary game indeed.

The weapons are so varied and each has a possible potential to be useful. Also has a variaty of maps, and different gamemodes.

Also, there are lots of fun smaller servers and a great trading community along with a competitive community. Also, you can go on special non-official servers such as randomizer, where every quality about your character is randomized to anything on any class, including having 3 different-class weapons.

review: Team Fortress 2 is easily one of the most addictive games I have ever played. The gameplay is very simple, You are either on RED or BLU, Fighting one and other ina variety of objective based gamemodes. This forces players to work together as a team. This game is NOT for the Lone Wolf. What makes TF2 unique is it's insane amount of customaztion. The game features 9 distinct classes, Each with their own Personality, Play-Styles, Designs and weapons. From the Speedy, Loud-Mouthed Scout, To the Insane, Mad Scientist Medic, Each class is unique. This add's depth to this game. There is ALWAYS something new to do and experience. The Community have kept this game alive with constant Mod's and inventive gamemodes, While the TF2 team keep the game fresh with constant free content. Whether is new weapons or New hats, Each update keeps players interested. On top of all of this, TF2 features a very unique art style. This makes it stand out amongst all the other Military shooters. It's cartoonish, 1960's style, Makes it simply beautiful. Valve certianly did a fantastic job in creating a unique world for this game. TF2 is also damn hilarious, With a barrage of Meme's, Quotes and Dark Humor to keep anyone happy. While the humor isn't always for everyone, It certainly get's me laughing to myself as I Gib a Pesky Spy. While TF2 has lost some of it's core charm due to trading/players, It still remains one of Valve's greatest hits. TF2 is a must have for ANY PC gamer. Also, It is free. And you can wear fancy Hats/ If you have yet to experience TF2, I would heavily reccomend to download it right now. 9.5/10.

It's very friendly and welcoming to new players as well- the tutorial and training system is excellent. Weapons are distributed randomly and have certain strengths and weaknesses. And with the 9 classes, each with at least 3 loadout slots, there are a lot of potential strategic loadouts to choose from. Valve amazed me with both TF2 and Left 4 Dead 2.

If so, those are just 3 out of 9 classes with their own unique roles and stratergies. This game can use stratergies such as the use of sticky bombs or turrets or can just be a rush in and destroy everything with a minigun and a knife. Has many gamemodes for the player's desire and many weapons that can change the battlefield and is free to play. There is nothing to lose except all the time you'll be using to play this game!

I get bored of playing 1 class? switch to another and play maybe 34 more minuets. then do it over and over. The different weapons are fun to use, and the hats look sexy. Very fun game, i highly recommend this to any other FPS gamer out there.

review: Probably one of the best online multiplayer shooters to exist. Team Fortress 2 provides a lot of fun with different classes, customizable loadouts, and of course.. hats. The player can choose from 9 different classes, each with different advantages and tactics. The nine classes are divided into three categories: Offense, Defense and Support. Offensive classes would be; The Scout: A faster class that uses a scattergun, a secondary pistol and a bat for melee. This class has less health but can easily avoid enemy fire, and capture enemy control points twice as fast as any other class. The Soldier: A slower offensive class that carries a rocket launcher, a shotgun and a shovel. Soldiers can be used to take care of buildings like sentry guns and teleporters, made by the Engineer. Or, if you're skilled enough, you could "Rocket Jump" by simply pointing the rocket launcher down at the ground below you, before jumping and shooting. The rocket will explode on impact of the ground, launching you high above the ground and give you the ability to quickly fly into enemy grounds. The Pyro: Pretty self-explainatory, the Pyro uses a flamethrower to set enemies... well... on fire, giving additional damage even if the enemy flees. (Unless said enemy flees into water) Other weapons include another shotgun, and a fire axe. Pyros can also shoot strong air out of the flamethrowers muzzle, which gives it the ability to "air blast" rockets back at enemy Soldiers, or grenades back at an enemy Demoman. For the Defense category, we have; The Demoman: A class known to maining on explosives, and to drink. The Demoman wields a grenade launcher, a "stickybomb" launcher and a glass bottle. "Stickybombs" are pretty self explainatory; Bombs that can stick to any surface. These bombs can be used strategically to blow up the enemy when they least expect it. (For example, planting the stickybombs on a control point.) Stickybombs can also be used to launch the Demoman high in the air, similar to "Rocket Jumping". The Heavy: A slow but effectively defensive class who wields a minigun as a primary weapon, shotgun for secondary and uses his own bare fists for melee. Heavys can easily defeat any enemy in close quarters, but skilled players can easily turn the tables. If paired with a Medic, the Heavy could be difficult to take care of. Having a Medic paired with a Heavy can make for a very effective defense, as long as the Medic stays safe. The Engineer: A class that's not as focused on charging into battle, but more on staying back and building different machines to help the team succeed. The machines vary from sentry guns, health and ammo dispensers, and teleporters. The Engineer also has the ability to upgrade any building using "metal", a secondary ammunition that Engineers collect from parts of destroyed buildings, and dropped weapons from defeated enemies and allies alike. And for the Support category, there is; The Medic: Medics have the ability to heal injured allies using a "medi gun". Of course, Medics are also armed with a syringe gun and a bonesaw, for close combat. As the Medic heals an ally, he builds up an "UberCharge" which, when fully charged, can shield the Medic and any ally he's currently healing from any enemy fire for a limited time. Medics can be very effective when paired with the defensive Heavy, so as long as the Medic stays away from enemy fire and keeps safe. The Medic also has the ability to heal over time, but only by a small amount per second. The Sniper: Self-explainatory, the Sniper can be used to hide back unseen and snipe incoming enemies with the Sniper Rifle. This class is also equipped with an SMG, and a kukri knife for close encounters with the enemy. When you stay zoomed in on the scope, a small meter is filled on the side of the screen, leading to a lightning bolt. When this meter is filled, the rifle can fire a "charged" shot that can take most classes out, even if its not a headshot. And the Spy: A unique class that can be used to disguise as an enemy class using a Disguise Kit. The Spy can sneak over to enemy territory and use his Knife to backstab an enemy, instantly killing them no matter how much health they have. Spies are also wielding a Revolver and a "Sapper". Sappers can be used to disable and destroy buildings from the Engineer class. Spies can then sneak behind an Engineer focused on the sapper, and backstab them. But attacking while disguised risks being caught, as a Spy's disguise instantly goes away when attacking. Spies can also cloak to appear invisible, using their watch. But such power is limited, and goes away if used for too long, forcing the Spy to stay visible until its fully charged. Spies cannot attack while invisible, nor can they capture control points cloaked or disguised. Team Fortress 2 also features a completely customizable set of loadouts for your classes. You may recieve different weapons for different strategies, such as giving the Demoman the ability to charge and bash into enemies with the Chargin' Targe. Or the player can give the Heavy to heal quickly with the popular Sandvich. Players may also recieve accessories and of course, hats. Players can also paint certain accessories any color they wish, if they ever get the right bucket. There are also "decal tools", "name tags", and "description tags". Decal tools allow the player to put custom images on certain weapons and accessories, as the Name and Description Tags allow the player to change the name and description of the item to anything they wish. Players may purchase or trade "Mann Co. Supply Crate Keys", which they can use to unlock and open "Mann Co. Supply Crates", which are randomly found in-game. Doing so will grant the player special items, like more accessories or weapons. Most common from crates are the Strange quality weapons. These special weapons can track the total amount of kills the player makes with that specific weapon. Increasing the total kills by certain amounts can "rank up" the weapon, giving it a special name for others to see. (I.E: "Truly Feared Minigun") Team Fortress 2 gives an unforgettable multiplayer experience. Its cartoony graphics, remarkable voice acting, and its unique classes and characters, makes Team Fortress 2 a must-have for gamers everywhere. And best of all, its FREE. Players can also communicate over mic, spray custom images on the wall, and chat in the server's chatbox. But its strongly recommended to NOT do so these days, given the community. (Also, as a warning to new players; Don't enter "unbindall" in the console commands. )

review: Well... How do I talk about a game which dosen't really have a purpose? How do I convey the hours of enjoyment I've gained... if I haven't been doing anything useful. This game... now this game is not a first person shooter. It is a hat simulating, conga lining, unusual trading, strange gathering, killstreak hoarding, taunt collecting piece of beautiful magic that we are lucky to have graced the earth. Deeper into the game you encounter hours of fun which are never the same no matter what you play! This my friends.. is the only game in my WHOLE STEAM LIBRARY THAT I PLAY. not to mention that its free. (If you want to be a gibbus noob) One thing i must say: download this game. It's not serious; its a joke. but its the best joke ever told.

review: Truly amazing game, and its been like that for the past 7 years! From the day I started, I have thoroughly enjoyed this game. Valve has chose and done bad mistakes, but people just shake it off, and deal with it. The trading system is very good but Pishers came with it aswell, that can upset some people after clikcing a link. Otherwise, a extraodinary game indeed.

review: It is a very good game with lots of good things that are good, but the servers are not good why are they not good, i'll tell you why. They are not good because the people are mean to me so that is not good but what is good is the random drops that is good i got a gun which is very good because it is one shot kill that is good. what is bad the op weapons that people use it isnt very good, but what is good is that the characters are funny so that is good becuase it makes me laugh with kek thanks for reading my good review tell me how good it is by messaging on my good steam page bye - Good Gamer1

review: Really nice game to just pick up, join, play. Yes, yes there are a lot of people going on: WOW i got 18 spys on my team; Only M1+W Pyro's; I got this medick with nothning buth shooting syringes... And so on. Also there is a lot of hype about the hats... BUTH THAT DOSENT MATTER!!! Free to play or Pay to play its all the same... You get the best weapons (well almost all) at the beggining as stock weapons! Yes you can upgrade to strange, vintage, unusual, genuine and so on buth it dosent matter if you do or not... Also the hats are just something you have to look like something... They are not really a big deal. And if dont wanna spend any money on this game buth on another steam game you get to "half premuim"-That means you get 100 slots (maybe more), you can craft metal into hats (really spend your usefull weapons for metal and spend 3 refinds to get a hat... Any then you just do that and you can get up to stuff fast and quick and with almost no "no-fun-time" couse even knowing that tradeing is kinda ruining this game you can still have some fun douing it if you got a reason to. Owerall: greate game, fast and slow paced, difrent stuff to do (my favorite: Rocket/Sticky jumping, difrent game mods as you get in GMod)... Has greate "get a competitative game fast" option if you just go to: TF2 Center and click the first link log in and play (you wanna have about 1000 hours so people wont go on and on about how bad you are. Also dont play the medick, pocket for the first time! Accept if you really got lots of hours like about 3000-4000. So just get in dont worry and have fun. 10/10 Steams. 11/10 Hats. 1/10 Gabe's. 10/10 Nice game!

review: This game may be free to play. But it does free to play right. No gems or time limits on guns or classes. every single item is possible to obtain without a special currency. And most of all you NEVER need to buy anything. You can buy things if you are impatiant to find a weapon but you never NEED to. I would rate thise game easily a 10/10 it is an amazing shooter. And teamwork is actually in this fun class based FPS. Looking at you Battle *COUGH* field. Anyway if you are looking for some fast paced action and buckets of fun. This is the game for you my friend.

review: Good game, what sucks is the community. It consists mostly of around 18 yr old YOLO-idiots, homophobics, bronies, furries, sexists and ignorants. There can hardly be a single MVM without harassing, whining and idiotic behavior, annoying setup and ragequitting. There are hardly servers without stupid people on the mic, puking out their racist and intolerant opinions nobody gives a damn about. Maybe I'm too old for this bull frickin' horse , but I'm really tired of the majority of players here. BTW, there are also female players out there, so shove your lesbian sprays up your  and take some more Medic/Engineer action, you homophobic morons.

review: I think there are enough reviews to show that this game is highly recommended, but here's another anyway. TF2 manages to do a few things quite flawlessly: 1. Classes. TF2 has 9 very distinct classes, each with a very different style of gameplay attached to them, making the game very replayable. 2. Clarity. TF2 is a very approachable game, as the classes are very well defined and their roles (from the eyes of a newbie) are fairly clear. The art style in the game also makes it very approachable, catering for pretty much all audiences. 3. Variety. To add on to the classes being varied, there is also a massive set of weapons, which range from minor cosmetic differences to completely different utilities, making weapon combinations become something personal that you can tailor to your style of play. TF2 also boasts a decent range of game-modes, from CTF to Capture Points, to King of the Hill, and even a vastly different co-op mode MvM (Mann vs. Machine). 4. Community. TF2 has a very active trading scene, competitive lobby and league scene, and Steam Workshop. Many items created by fans of the game have ended up being implemented, producing revenue for the artist and Valve itself, which leads onto my final point: 5. Free-to-play done right. Their monetisation methods are non-intrusive and not in your face. There is incentive to gamble with crates for strange/unusual items through buying 'keys', but in the end the high-tier loot are all COSMETIC in nature, rather than unlocking some weapon with vastly OP stats like so many other F2P games. Everything that can be bought can also be traded for, and with the activity of the community it is not too difficult a feat to do. The game also provides you with free items based on play time, which can of course be traded, and non-tradable basic weapons for completing achievement milestones with the different classes. All in all, it's a great class-based shooter/hat simulator with a great setup behind it. Go play!

review: A comical First-Person Shooter, Team Fortress 2 comes right into the top few games in anyone's library. Shoot stuff. Blow up stuff. Sometimes even burn stuff - and progressively get better at it all. If you're the sort of person who likes to shoot other people online, then I see no viable reason that this could NOT be a perfect game for you. If you're a clever tactician, several in-game gimmicks and combos exist to aid you into better combat. That's what I enjoy the most myself... And even if you're a concientious objector, there's a peaceful protest sign with your name on it - literally. Uh... maybe the rest is better left unsaid... All in all, a good and timelessly entertaining game - bring a friend or two along!

review: After 9 years of development, Valve made another very good game that made me lose nearly 2000 hours of my life. Team Fortress 2 came out in year 2007 and is still getting updates which clearly shows how popular and awesome this game is. Game is really free to play which means that you don't have to pay any cent to wreck player who spent thousands of $ on it but you can buy premium to get 300 backpack slots instead of 50, free hat, ability to trade your items and ability to get rare items from weekly items drop but you will have to add at least 5 to your Steam Wallet and just buy cheapest thing in Mann Co. Store (if you have already money in Steam Wallet, you don't even have to spend 0,10 to buy one). I can easily recommend this game to everyone who wants to have fun without spending much money (or doesn't want to spend at all) and loves games with some team work, many mods (custom too) or just loves hats

review: How to feel good playing this game: Heal people on fire about to die with 1 health left. Bonk a heavy about to decimate your team. Snipe that spy about to chain stab your team. Build teleporter exit to first spawn point near the end of a match. Backstab a sniper until he switches to razorback. Headshot him until he switches to pyro. Win a match after team sh*ttalker moves to other "winning" team. Kick a bad medic for trying. Getting 50 kills in a row also feels pretty good, if you can do it. Don't acknowledge the people who defecate in their living room instead of their bathroom. People who bring all their life problems to the game, known as ragers, don't realize the fundamental aspect of entertainment. Whatever good or bad thing happens while playing, is ultimately for your entertainment. You will forget this playing TF2 though just saying and become a rager yourself.

review: I used to think that games used to be about skill and how well you work with a team of freinds/strangers. All that changed when I got TF2 (Hat Simulator 2014). I am educated now and know that the things you need to be good at this game are: -Unusual Hats worth only $50000 -A once full, now empty life savings account -Hats -Hats -Hats In this game you will select one of 9 characters which all have their special OP power which will make even the most patient monk rage quit. This game is about your character going on a pointless, perilous journey in order to get all the keys ever made by Valve. No one knows why you try and complete this story, but if you don't your freinds might get more keys than you and you don't want that. Eventually you spend all your money and/or life to buy these over-priced hats and boast to some guy on the other side of the world about how cool your $560000 hat is, only to have him call you a n00b and show you his $560001 hat and proceed to kick you from the server for being a skrublord. In this game you will experience several gamemodes such as: -Kick everyone on the server who makes a mistake A.K.A Tour of Duty -Practice of Kick everyone on the server who makes a mistake A.K.A Boot Camp -Show off your sexy hats to people who you deem beneth thyself A.K.A Trade servers -School of sniping A.K.A 2fort -Custom gamemodes which can somtimes be more fun the the default game A.K.A Custom games -Every other gamemode with people who you deem Free2play A.K.A Every other gamemode with people who you deem Free2play The best part of the game (apart from the 10/10 hat simulation) is when after 10 mins of you being one of the only contributors to your team and right about to win the game with your freinds, you get switched for "auto-ballance" ad end up on a loosing streak. SO FUUUUUUUUUUUN AND BEST FEATURE OF ANY GAME!!! Because of this game I have no money, no freinds and no life, but I have hats and really... isn't that what life is all about? 10/10 would play again

There is alot of fun to getting this game, and since this game is free there is no reason to not get this game. I reccomend it to any person who bothered to read this ramble all the way through.

review: I've played this game for so many hours, but I'm still not even that great at the game. I can't rocket jump for anything, I still can't properly time airblasts, I'm pretty bad with the Scout, I've barely played Sniper at all. But you know what? There are a few things I can do: I can pop a perfectly timed Uber, I can be useful as a Heavy and heal my teammates with my sanvich, I can stickyjump and aim the Loch'n'Load pretty well, I can setup buldings in strategic spots to be as useful to my team as possible, I can get backstabs half the time I try, and I'm pretty damn good at prop hunt. You see, tf2 is a game you can play for the rest of your life if you find some servers with a good crowd of regulars that use their mics. I've had so many fun times just effing around on some servers, that alone makes the game worth trying. Unfortunately, the tf2 community is extremely divided nowadays. This community used to be one of the best around, a part of it still is, but the more updates there are the more the community splits apart. If you plan on playing this game, it being free there's no reason not to, PLEASE use your mic. Another unfortunate thing about today's tf2, there's less people using their mics than ever and that's how you really work as a team and have fun with one another. Don't be afraid about being new to the game, a lot of people in the community may look down on you, but myself and plenty of others won't. Feel free to ask for help, start with Heavy as your first class and work from there. The shenanigans that occur in this game are limitless, I feel Valve has strayed quite a bit from the game's artstyle with all the cosmetics they've added (originally a pair of windowed shades were how far they'd stretch tf2's artstyle and now that restraint is non-existant) but the game's core mechanics are still great. This game has an incredibly high skill ceiling, it's near impossible for someone to master ALL the classes in the game, so just find 2 or 3 that you like and play them to your heart's content. I maybe only have 1 hour logged with Sniper because I'm terrible at sniping in video games and don't like being a sniper in general, but I'm sure if I practiced with him as much as a played as Demoman or Heavy or Engineer or Soldier or Medic, then I'd actually be decent at sniping. In this game, like most games, practice makes perfect, well not really perfect, more like practice makes you credit to team. Initally, no you won't be credit to team, but the more you play the more useful you will become so keep at it and find a few classes who's playstyle suits YOU! tl;dr I've played this game for a while and I still suck as Sniper, Scout, and Pyro, but I do make a pretty great Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, and Medic and an average Soldier and Spy. The classes I'm good at I'm good at because I played with them a lot and I liked their playstyle. If you play this game you're almost guaranteed to find one class who's playstyle you enjoy so I encourage you to delve into tf2 and find YOUR class. After 9 years in development this game was worth the weight, thanks for reading this review and have fun!

review: Team Fortress 2 is a team-based, first-person shooter multiplayer computer game developed by valve. It is the successful sequel to Tream Fortress Classic. It first came out in a compilation called The Orange Box, which is no longer avaliable. As of 2011, Team Fortress 2 is a free to play game, where you can upgrade to premium via purchasing something from the Team Fortress 2 in-game store. Gameplay: This fun game is based on two oppisite teams, Builders League United, often refered to as BLU team. And RED team, Reliable Excavation and Demolition. Players can choose to play as one of the nine character classes in these teams each with their own unique strenghts, weaknesses and weapons. Each class consist of a primary weapon, a secondary weapon, and a melee weapon. Although certain classes contain PDA's and other unique items. Team Fortress 2 was released with six offical maps, but many more maps have been added. A neat little addition to this game is "The Administrator" a woman announces different game events over PA or Loudspeaker, so that everyone in the game can hear it. Stats are a extreamly nice addition to this game, where time played as a certain class, most kills as that class and most objectives achived in that life, etc... Game Modes: -In Capture the Flag maps, the objective for both teams is to obtain a briefcase of intelligence from the enemy team's base and return it to their own base while preventing the opposing team from doing the same. The player carrying the intelligence can be killed to drop the briefcase, or the player can willingly drop it; in either case this starts a brief timer. A team can only score by delivering the enemy's intelligence to their base. A match lasts until one team scores a set number of points or time runs out. A variant of Capture the Flag, called Special Delivery, has teams vying over a single briefcase to attempt to deliver to a common target. Once the intelligence is picked up by one team, only members of that team can carry it until either it successfully delivered, or the drop timer expires and it is returned to its original spawn point. -Control Point modes are more varied in their objectives, but share the common aim of capturing a particular point on the map by having one or more team members stay on the point without the presence of the opposing team for a short period of time. In standard control point maps, each team already controls an equal number of points, with one additional point left unclaimed; teams can only attempt to capture points that are nearest to those points they already control. Each team attempts to progressively capture all the control points to win the round. In attack/defend-style maps, the RED team already controls all the points on the map, and must hold these points from being captured by the opposing team (BLU Team) for a length of time. Attack/defend-style maps can come in either single-round or multiple-round maps; Rounds past the first will only be played if BLU wins a round. -Territorial control is a more complex version of Control Point, in which each map is divided into a number of closed sections, held between the two teams. Each round has one team attempting to seize control of the opposing team's capture point for that section in a fixed amount of time. Once a team holds all but the enemy's home base point, they then attempt to capture the enemy base point while the enemy defends for a fixed amount of time. -King of the Hill features a single control point in the center of the map, with teams vying for control over it. The control point is locked for a set amount of time after the round start. Once the point is unlocked, either team can capture it. Capturing the control point starts the team's clock counting down. The clock that is currently counting down will only stop if the other team captures the point, the clock reaches 0:00, or another map-specific event occurs such as a Halloween boss spawning during the Halloween event. Teams win the round when their clock reaches 0:00 with the control point currently under their control. If the other team is capturing the point, the round will not end until the point's capture progress resets to 0. -Payload maps feature a length of track atop which sits a bomb mounted on a cart. These maps come in two varieties. In normal Payload maps, one team must escort the cart through a series of checkpoints in a limited amount of time to reach a final target that the other team defends. The cart moves when one or more players of the team are near it without enemies nearby; during this, the cart heals and provides ammo to those close by. If no one is by the cart, it may move backwards towards the last checkpoint, or roll off uphill sections of the track. In Payload Races, both teams race to deliver a bomb-cart to a final target; there are no checkpoints and unmanned carts will not move in reverse, but still require team members nearby to fully complete uphill sections. Both types of Payload maps can come in single-round or multiple-round maps. In standard payload, further rounds will only be played if BLU wins. In Payload Race, all rounds will be played regardless of which team wins, but the winner of previous rounds starts with their cart farther up the track. -Arena is a team deathmatch mode, typically occurring smaller environments featuring a single control point. In each round, players do not respawn on death; a team wins the round by capturing the control point or eliminating all of the other team members. -Medieval mode can be played on maps dedicated to this mode, or enabled for any other mode type. This mode forces players to use melee or similar medieval weapons. -MvM - Mann vs. Machine - is a six player co-operative mode where the mercenaries are defending a structure against increasingly difficult waves of robots. Players have the ability to buy upgrades and improvements between rounds using in-game money earned during previous waves. A "Mann Up" version is available by purchasing tickets with real money to participate in larger events on official servers with the opportunity to win unique cosmetic items after successfully completing a Tour of Duty. If you decided to read this far in, thank-you for reading. :)

review: Team Fortress 2 has been one of my finest gaming experiences ever. I've played many multiplayer games over the years and I must say TF2 has proven to be one of the most innovative and constantly changing (for the better) title I've ever dealt with. Though I'll keep this short I will comment that every class feels unique and every character organic; with a playstyle and personality that each can call their own. This is perhaps my main drawing point to the series as their are few thinks more fun then dominating your enemies while your Demoman slurs drunkenly about the battlefield with a sword and decapitates a Heavy with a Minigun. In all my time playing this game the experience has never diminished and I hold high hopes for the future of this game,

review: Team Fortress 2 is The Best First Person Sprayer Game in existence. It's an extremely popular game with 9 different Classes wich are so balanced and unbalanced at the same time its confusing. Some Classes has guarantied 1 Hit KO Attacks that might make you rage, and some classes has such a ridicolus damage output you wont even see yor enemy before your dead. But in this game you have to remember something the title says it self, TEAM Fortress 2. This is NOT a one man army game, this is a Team Work Game. So Gather up your friends, find out what Class fits you and your friends best, start training, work together, and win together. Welcome to Team Fortress 2

review: Glad that you ask. Team Fortress 2 has been quite an eye catcher since it's release in 2007 Gaining Game of the Year awards Having it's own Large Fan base with Fads and Memes This is one of those games that seems to live on forever It's artistic style never goes out of style due to it's cartoonish rendering Customization is also a pinnacle of this game Hats and Items are bought nearly every day, netting Valve lots of cash each passing day. The game itself is FUN More fun than you could imagine In fact, there are servers that are even dedicated to Fun However, if you're a Tryhard, Go ahead and try those Competitive Servers ! If you're a bit of both then just simply join a Public Server Gameplay-wise This game is VERY FLEXIBLE Almost each class is tweakable to your own style of playing (Yes, there are a few OP weapons) The Scout can turn into a Speeding Powerhouse The Demoman can turn into a Melee Behemoth Even the freaking Medic can turn into an Offensive Class when used properly The Community is also a Mix of Kind Players, Some could be Tryhard but will usually say the Good olg "GG" or "GG NO RE" on Arena However, Kids do appear in the game at times Some of them might even Mic-Spam, but don't worry ! You can just mute them, You can even kick them if the rest of the Server Clients agree with you Overall, This is a GREAT GAME Community, Gameplay, The Game itself 9.9/10 -0.1 Due to the fact, If You're F2P You're considered a Second Class Player Unless you can Prove your Skill at this game You even get less backpack space Spend money on the game to get the full experience.

review: An FPS that introduces a different style of play. Nine classes, each have a different task in the team, and each require different skill sets to play. Not only does one strive to master the classes, but also the various weapons unique to each class. Despite coming with a cost to have weapons (whether money or time in trading), it is definitely worth it if you have time. I don't recommend this to people who are in a busy point of their lives, as it may be addicting to experiment with loadouts and whatnot. Though, if you've got time, take a shot, it's worth your while even if you don't stick around. Also, as a final note, this game is far from a Pay2Win scenario. I've gained enough hours to have experimented with the many weapons, and I will say this: There are no weapons in the game that can be bought in order to destroy in a server. Even if a weapon has great stats (ie. The Back Scatter in the most recent update), in the long run the default is usually superior (unless someone has gained enough skill with such weapon). As long as you have skill, you can make a weapon destroy. Good luck and remember: This is TEAM Fortress 2.

review: If you have not played Team Fortress 2, then you should sit in a corner and think about your life! Team Fortress 2 might just be my favorite first person shooter games. You can choose from 9 classes, each one that has tons and tons of weapons and hats. If you think that it is boring just killing the other team over and over all the time, then you are wrong! Be warned that if you get this game, you will be sucked into it and you will not stop playing it! You will spend your days locked in a dark room with a bowl of Doritos by your side. You will become fat and lazy with no wife, no kids, and most importantly no life. Trust me, it has happened to me already. Remember that this game appears to be free except for one thing.... your life.

To see that VALVe has kept a F2P game up like this, is impressive and is one of the reasons why VALVe is my favorite Game company. This game is great and will be for the years to come.

review: Alright, listen up. I may be a conjurer of evil moons and spawner of children's nightmares, but I have something to say. This game is a good game in general. You know, violence, murder, hat simulation... wait, what? I'll get to that later. Anyway, ever since the game became Free-to-Play (which I shouldn't be saying this because thats how i got into the game), little children and C.O.D Fanboys/Fangirls came in and ruined the game as we knew it. Those who already own the game, think about it. Whining 7 year olds, tryhards, servers dedicated... DEDICATED... to idling and getting pointless (and sometimes not so pointless) items... are you KIDDING ME? Valve has made a huge mistake here. Stupidity at its finest, people. Now, don't get me wrong. I like this game, not just because of the hat simulation. The 9 classes all have unique personalities witha variety of weapons, which the collection of the weapons is slowly building up. The End of the Line update is coming soon, and I hope to Talos that they don't  up this one. After the Love and War Update, the game's tables have been turned. Remember the whole hat simulation thing? Yeah. They added 40 new hats and other cosmetics in this update, along with only 5 weapons. Also, about 14 taunts. Valve, I just hpe you can get rid of all of these little kids begging for Keys, because everyone is tired of them. Now, about the actual gameplay. The gameplay itself is pretty nice, but some of the people playing are not. There are tryhards, whining kids and just plain idiots who join some servers. But if you like competitive play, then you'll like it. The 9 classes have a variety of tools in their arsenal to bring your team to victory. I like this game. Nuff said. Feel free to dislike this, for it turned out to be a humongous rant about little children. Thank you for your consideration.

review: Join Hat Simulator Fortress 2 now! This game is filled with awesome mercenaries that will be better if you make them wear hats! Because hats are their life. 10/10. Seriously though, get this game. It is not your regular FPS game. This game has enough charm to make your head explode. You will have hours of fun and hats. So stop reading and download this game for FREE. (And later on, buy hats on the store.)

review: I love this game, because of the fact that it has, over the past 5 or so years, developed a diverse and mechanical economy of its own. I have spent countless hours trading, crafting, and buying several hundreds of items over the past year. And the fact that this economy has been almost entirely developed by the Steam Community is remarkable. I would be shocked if I found a steam user who did not already own this masterpiece of a game. Any other MMOFPS game that has been thrown my way has not even come close to the mastery of this here game. 10000/10. (TL;DR)

review: This game may be free to play. But it does free to play right. No gems or time limits on guns or classes. every single item is possible to obtain without a special currency. And most of all you NEVER need to buy anything. You can buy things if you are impatiant to find a weapon but you never NEED to. I would rate thise game easily a 10/10 it is an amazing shooter. And teamwork is actually in this fun class based FPS. Looking at you Battle *COUGH* field. Anyway if you are looking for some fast paced action and buckets of fun. This is the game for you my friend.

review: Team Fortress 2 is without a doubt the greatest shooter game I have ever played. While 11 year old tryhards slobber over rehashed Call of Duty garbage, real gamers are playing this colorful, creative, funny, well developed, well written, well put together and very well done First Person Shooter game. The game is free, so there is no excuse for you not to check it out. You really shouldn't regret it (Unless you suffer from addiction to games, then avoid this game at all costs).

review: I think there are enough reviews to show that this game is highly recommended, but here's another anyway. TF2 manages to do a few things quite flawlessly: 1. Classes. TF2 has 9 very distinct classes, each with a very different style of gameplay attached to them, making the game very replayable. 2. Clarity. TF2 is a very approachable game, as the classes are very well defined and their roles (from the eyes of a newbie) are fairly clear. The art style in the game also makes it very approachable, catering for pretty much all audiences. 3. Variety. To add on to the classes being varied, there is also a massive set of weapons, which range from minor cosmetic differences to completely different utilities, making weapon combinations become something personal that you can tailor to your style of play. TF2 also boasts a decent range of game-modes, from CTF to Capture Points, to King of the Hill, and even a vastly different co-op mode MvM (Mann vs. Machine). 4. Community. TF2 has a very active trading scene, competitive lobby and league scene, and Steam Workshop. Many items created by fans of the game have ended up being implemented, producing revenue for the artist and Valve itself, which leads onto my final point: 5. Free-to-play done right. Their monetisation methods are non-intrusive and not in your face. There is incentive to gamble with crates for strange/unusual items through buying 'keys', but in the end the high-tier loot are all COSMETIC in nature, rather than unlocking some weapon with vastly OP stats like so many other F2P games. Everything that can be bought can also be traded for, and with the activity of the community it is not too difficult a feat to do. The game also provides you with free items based on play time, which can of course be traded, and non-tradable basic weapons for completing achievement milestones with the different classes. All in all, it's a great class-based shooter/hat simulator with a great setup behind it. Go play!

review: This game is fun and you should start out official server multiplayer. It is fairly easy to learn and i suggest playing as the pyro first, then moving on to the heavy. Also, there are lots of fun smaller servers and a great trading community along with a competitive community. Also, you can go on special non-official servers such as randomizer, where every quality about your character is randomized to anything on any class, including having 3 different-class weapons.

review: Team Fortress 2 is easily one of the most addictive games I have ever played. The gameplay is very simple, You are either on RED or BLU, Fighting one and other ina variety of objective based gamemodes. This forces players to work together as a team. This game is NOT for the Lone Wolf. What makes TF2 unique is it's insane amount of customaztion. The game features 9 distinct classes, Each with their own Personality, Play-Styles, Designs and weapons. From the Speedy, Loud-Mouthed Scout, To the Insane, Mad Scientist Medic, Each class is unique. This add's depth to this game. There is ALWAYS something new to do and experience. The Community have kept this game alive with constant Mod's and inventive gamemodes, While the TF2 team keep the game fresh with constant free content. Whether is new weapons or New hats, Each update keeps players interested. On top of all of this, TF2 features a very unique art style. This makes it stand out amongst all the other Military shooters. It's cartoonish, 1960's style, Makes it simply beautiful. Valve certianly did a fantastic job in creating a unique world for this game. TF2 is also damn hilarious, With a barrage of Meme's, Quotes and Dark Humor to keep anyone happy. While the humor isn't always for everyone, It certainly get's me laughing to myself as I Gib a Pesky Spy. While TF2 has lost some of it's core charm due to trading/players, It still remains one of Valve's greatest hits. TF2 is a must have for ANY PC gamer. Also, It is free. And you can wear fancy Hats/ If you have yet to experience TF2, I would heavily reccomend to download it right now. 9.5/10.

review: I played in this game from 2008, right from the first time when i read review on this game in a cozy "Igromaniac"... Author said the game has a lot of advantages, 9 distinct glasses, and the main thing... cozy, expensive and cool customization... Later (about a week later) we played on some custom map with my friends and were thinking how this game was cool, how it is well balanced and stuff... But later, we noticed one more thing:the game was always changing. The gameplay was changing, there was added new custom parts... and you know what? i left from this game, because i didn't like all this changes... In 2012 (or 2011) my friend sucked me back in the game with the arguement of "dude, you have to check it out". And the thing was men vs. machine update. I was more than amazed... so much changed for all this 4 years while in most other games stuff stays the same! I highly recommend this game to everybody: from the ones who likes bloody shooters, to the people who likes fat eastern eggs on stuff from media. And especially changes, because this game lives more than 8 years now, and it keeps changing, it keeps being popular, it keeps being fresh.

On top of that, it's 100% free, and the only free to play game I've seen yet that is NOT pay to win. On top of THAT, I love that you can play it in super-serious tryhard mode or just run around doing something silly and have fun either way (and not get yelled at, I should mention the community for this game kicks ) What I'm trying to say is, GET THIS GAME, IT'S AMAZING Plus, even if you don't like it, it's not like it cost you anything

review: This game is silly fun.. Nothing is more satisfying than backstabbing your mate, great over skype. The teamplay is above average , it actually HAS a physics engine, which I like. The unlock system is a bit odd and I dont rally understand the crafting, there arent really enough tutorials. I do however have a reocurring problem, on Gmod and any other valve game... Servers get connection failed after four retries and when I refresh the servers disappear... Anyways I have to rate this game positively becuase it is one of the most fun games I've played and I feel the developers put lots of effort into it. 8/10

review: This is certainly the billionth recommendation for TF2 ever made, most likely. If you need one word to sum up the game: Hats. Need another? Fun. This certainly is a top favorite game of mine for a good reason, and that it's just too much fun. Really, I can say it's one of the best, if not the best, free-to-play game out there, and that's not doing the game much justice. The game has multiple objective-based modes inplemented into a truckload of maps that have been either made by Valve or the community, and contains a pretty deep metagame thanks to the amount of weapons placed in the game and the varying ways that people play each class. Each match may play differently from the last, considering that everyone's going to play differently, which requires you and your team to adapt to survive. Oh, I mentioned it has hats, didn't I? Yeah, think of this as Valve's way of earning money, along with some of the community members who contribute to the game. i really like this system, as you can customize each class however you want to, and it's a way to give back to the community. I could go on about how this is one of the greatest games ever made, but you're probably sick of me rambling on about this game, by this point. And of course, you're already playing this game on some sort of time basis if you're on my friends list, so I guess I'm just talking to myself. I'll shut up and let you get back to playing now XD

review: I used to think that games used to be about skill and how well you work with a team of freinds/strangers. All that changed when I got TF2 (Hat Simulator 2014). I am educated now and know that the things you need to be good at this game are: -Unusual Hats worth only $50000 -A once full, now empty life savings account -Hats -Hats -Hats In this game you will select one of 9 characters which all have their special OP power which will make even the most patient monk rage quit. This game is about your character going on a pointless, perilous journey in order to get all the keys ever made by Valve. No one knows why you try and complete this story, but if you don't your freinds might get more keys than you and you don't want that. Eventually you spend all your money and/or life to buy these over-priced hats and boast to some guy on the other side of the world about how cool your $560000 hat is, only to have him call you a n00b and show you his $560001 hat and proceed to kick you from the server for being a skrublord. In this game you will experience several gamemodes such as: -Kick everyone on the server who makes a mistake A.K.A Tour of Duty -Practice of Kick everyone on the server who makes a mistake A.K.A Boot Camp -Show off your sexy hats to people who you deem beneth thyself A.K.A Trade servers -School of sniping A.K.A 2fort -Custom gamemodes which can somtimes be more fun the the default game A.K.A Custom games -Every other gamemode with people who you deem Free2play A.K.A Every other gamemode with people who you deem Free2play The best part of the game (apart from the 10/10 hat simulation) is when after 10 mins of you being one of the only contributors to your team and right about to win the game with your freinds, you get switched for "auto-ballance" ad end up on a loosing streak. SO FUUUUUUUUUUUN AND BEST FEATURE OF ANY GAME!!! Because of this game I have no money, no freinds and no life, but I have hats and really... isn't that what life is all about? 10/10 would play again

Possibly the only multiplayer game with built in aimbots. Just choose the Engineer class and build a sentry. Do you like OP one hit kills? TF2 is the game for you. Go sniper or spy and headshot or backstab all the baddies. They'll hate you for it, but really- do you care? No. If you do, you probably shouldn't be playing a game with guns in it. If you don't care and you like aimbots, don't cheat in other games. Play TF2 instead, because here it's allowed.

If you never even played it or worse if you never heard of this game I don't think you're human. So sitback relax and wait for the very long download of this game If you are planning to play, which you will.........

review: Hilarious FPS that has Valve written all over it If you've played games by Valve before you know each of there games has an almost unexplanible comedic charm and TF2 is no different, the graphics aren't the best, but thats part of what makes the game funny and what makes it great...Another awesome Valve game!

review: It is a very good game when you get some weapons that you are better at. At first it may seem that everyone is better than you because they have better weapons, stranges,miscs and the most popular- unusual hats. This can change when you play it for a while (don`t end up like me playing over 128 hours in 2 months) and you get good weapons. And then you get to purchace items. It`s a game of cometition, but there can never be 'a best player'. Overall, I am addicted to this game. I love it.

It isn't P2W game, but it is nice to buy a keys with money and trade them for hats, misc, outfits, weapons and unusuals. the trade in tf2 is really fun! you can play f2p, you dont must buy stuff, you can get it in drops. Have in this game a drop weapons and you dont must to buy them, you can craft them but you can trade them for a scrap or other weapons. PLAY THIS GAME!!! Classic, funny and good game!

game-hours: 2323.1
review: This is the best hat simulator in existence. This sounds silly and it is... until you've played it. It won't be long before you find yourself involved in the meta trading game crafting weapons and on the quest for ever cooler hats to replace your Ghastly GIbus and prove you are no longer a noob. You will finally give in on microtransactions and be glad you did. As far as gameplay goes... well, it's probably the best class based shooter out there. The game works and is always kept polished and regularly updated and supported by the community and Valve. With the 9 different classes, there are many more ways to play just based on what your item loadout is, but nothing is really overpowered, just situational in it's advantage. The competative scene is real and there is an incredibly high skill cap within that; time and experience in the game to the tune of thousands of hours actually mean something in terms of your ability to be good at it. And probably the thing that's better than any of this: It's freaking FUN.
game-hours: 814.9
review: i'm 100% addicted to this game, its a really fun game with many ways to play it. its unlike most games in terms of its game play yet probably better than any other game ive ever played, you are able to customize your character loadout (and theres 9 different characters/classes you can choose from to start) tons of game modes and maps plus its free! ive meet many people and made many friends by playing this game, and i know you will too. id rate this game 11/10 and id recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a new amazing game to play, and a new addiction.

review: WOW. This game impressed as soon as I "hit play". It has timeless cartoon-ish graphics that fall right in the boundary line between too animated and too realistic. It has a wide variety of characters, and a lot of items to find, so there will always be a reason to keep playing! Most of the characters are easy to play, but hard to master, so it wont be too difficult to switch characters and play as that one. I reccomend this game to anyone 10 and up. You can turn of the blood, and as long as a kid understands that it's not ok to do any of this in real life, and to keep a positive attitude, he/she should be find. See you in Pyroland!

I can buy a real one for less.) - Many people try scamming you in a trade - Players in pub servers usually start swearing/screaming for various reasons (Another Pro: you can mute them)

review: I've owned Team Fortress 2 since its release on the orange box and over the years its still enjoyable to pick up. Team Fortress 2 dominates areas of team play that hardly any other game compares to. A game where distinct classes are all important to a teams success in the battlefield. Each class comes with its own unique skill ceiling meaning that mastering each class can become its own challenge. Some classes even have multiple play styles that all require different set of skills that differ between styles, for instance while you may be good at being a pocket soldier that protects the medic from harm and kills whatever comes near you, you may not be good at a roaming soldier that does quite the opposite and rocket jumps around the map bombing enemies below. While no game has perfect balancing, Id say Team Fortress 2 comes reasonably close. The game is very fast paced and always keeping you in the action, and to this day it is still one of the best team fps games available. Looking at the marketing side of TF2, I would have to say there is no free to play model I enjoy greater. The micro transactions are 100% fair and are centered around buying cosmetics instead of buffs for your player. You dont have to spend a single dime on the game and be on the exact same playing field as everyone else. However buying an item from the Mann Co. Store opens up trading which allows users to make exchanges with each other. The game has successfully amassed its very own economy within the trading community. I would recommend anyone who enjoys team based fps games to pick up this awesome free title.

Look no further: don your derby, show off your chapeau, and kick  and take names while wearing your toque on Team Fortress 2!

review: There are 2 companies: the Reliable Excavative Demolition (RED) and the Builders League United (BLU) who are competing against each other. Both of the company owners (Blutarch of BLU and Redmond for RED) hired mercenaries to put an end to one another. This is where TF2 multiplayer takes place. In the multiplayer there are 2 teams (RED and BLU) and you can choose between 9 characters. These characters include the: Scout, Demo man, Pyro, Sniper, Medic, Spy, Heavy, Engineer, and Soldier. Each class has their own weapons and abilities (such as the Medic can heal people, the Spy can disguise as other players, the Scout can move twice as fast than others, etc.). The gameplay is SO much fun! Overall, Team Fortress goes beyond great gameplay; it has one of the most fun/best First Person Shooter multiplayer out there. There is just the multiplayer, no campaign mode. But, the multiplayer is enough and Team Fortress 2 still outstands many of the video games out there. Also, ITS FREE. Ok, its sort of free... You still can to buy items from the in-game store (which is relatively cheap). So, if you like FPS, this is your game.

review: Team Fortress 2 is such an addicting game. When I first played it on my old PC, it was freaking laggy, I thought it would be a boring game. My friend kept asking me to play it when I got a new PC, but I had doubts because of how big the file size is. I decided to play it anyway. It was freaking fun! I couldn't stop playing! All the game modes are cool, all the classes are good in their own way. My KDR in TF2 is good unlike in other FPS games where I'm horrible. I recommend playing this game, it's a shame if you can't run it, but it is worth trying :)

review: Great game, highly addictive. Offers many servers and quite a few different gameplay options. Their way of making sure both teams are fair is remarkable, and allows for players to vote on certain things which gives players some control. Not really any hackers. This game is super fun and it's worth it to download and give it a try.

review: Team Fortress 2 was one of the first games I had in my Steam library. I got it in December 2010 and I still play it. I've almost got 2000 hours of playtime, because it IS awesome. The gamemodes are different from each other and the classes, too. You have a choice of nine classes, which can be useful for attacks, defense and support. Find a character who fits your playstyle or more than one and get on the battlefield!

review: You might know Team Fortress 2 as "Hat Fortress 2" or stuff like that,if we ignore the hats and talk about gameplay: It's amazing and totally awesome. i think it's the best Free to Play you can ever find. it's not Pay to Win, it's all about team work. It's addicting and truly a brilliant game. but of cource we can't make a review about Team Fortress 2 without mentioning the hats of cource, well- it makes the game even more beautiful. Have fun playin' it maggots!

review: I was a white teenager with no odd habits. The quintessential student athlete. I barely played this game, because I prefered things like Zelda and Mario galaxy, they made me remember my childhood playing smash bros and mario kart with my family. Then I tried the demoman. Ya know mate, this game aint too bad, no? I played as demo ALL the bloody time, n' I got really in gud at it. I got me a replica eyelander, and I accdntly b'headed me cat with it. I didnt mean fur whiskers to die, but the ole bloody carse was olready thar. I started drinkin. I git really ed up on noight, and tried makin' a wee little pipebomb, jus like me pal demoman!! I' blew up, and the pewder and soot made me skin black, and I loost me eye. Me mum came in me room an started shoutin a' me. I lust control and swung me eyelander, and off went 'er 'ead!!

review: Don't even get me started on this game. I was introduced to it back in 2012 and since then I have never looked back, unbelievably addictive. Team Fortress 2 is one of the most well optimised, consistent performing and superbly balanced games I have ever played and has no Pay to Win aspects at all. A person who has had FPS experience on computer can pick up the Sniper on the first day of playing the game and come top scoring in a pub, this game is so simple and complex at the same time which is why it is so much fun! If you don't play this game more, and have passed it over as another of Valve's ploys for money, seriously think again because unlike what most comments say this game is MORE than just hats. TF2 has teamwork that is unlike any FPS I have played and puts COD and even Battlefield to shame as it is ALMOST impossible to lone wolf in this game. Even the pro snipers can get crowded by sphees or gibus scouts and get killed... nobody is perfect. GIVE THIS GAME A GO THOUGH, just... don't go full  and at least learn what things do by watching videos before playing. Don't be that spy that stabs the sentry ;) Also, PLEASE GO MEDIC IF YOUR TEAM DOES NOT HAVE ONE! 10/10 :D

review: I just realized that I have played this game for more than 1K hours and haven't made a recommendation for it so here I am. When I tried this game (first time), the voice of the "announcer" was so strange I said "I won't be able to tolerate this voice" so I stopped playing basically right after I started. After like, a year maybe I picketed it up again, thanks to "GameDay Iroda". I thought "why not try it again" and boy, after few hours of struggling with... well any class I fell in love. I wasted few hundred bucks on virtual items since then but you know, I don't mind it. This game gave me so many awesome hours and I still like it, I don't know when it will wear off but one thing is for sure: if you haven't played it already just give it a shot (You can't lose anything since it's F2P).

But this game has a charm to it, that incredibally fast-paced, all action... STUFF that makes it great. AND it's a free game! So, really, you don't need to worry about wasting, like, $15 or $200,000. Honestly, if you JUST got steam, you NEED to try out this game first. Like... Need. I'm not kidding. Go play it.

review: Hi, This game is amazing. I would know that because I've played it for 300 hours. This is an amazing FPS game, and you may be thinking "Uhhhg another FPS game." It's not like that. This is some of the most fun I've ever had. There are nine classes to suit your mood and all have their own drawbacks. First off is the scout, he's got 125 Health (which isn't that much) and runs very fast, he can also double jump. The scout also has a Scattergun, pistol, and baseball bat as weapons. Next is the soldier, he's a huge patriot and has 200 health. A Rocket launcher, a shotgun, and a shovel are his stock weapons. That's right a shovel. Next is the Pyro, first off, he is a pain in the butt to deal with. He has 175 health and he also has a flame thrower, a shotgun, and a fire ax as stock weapons. He's only not effective at long range. Next is the demoman, who likes to blow sh*t up. He has 175 health, with a grenade launcher, a sticky bomb launcher, and a bottle as stock weapons. There's also the heavy who has a whoping 300 health. He has a minigun, shotgun, and fists as stock weapons and always targeted first on the battle field. Next off is the Engineer who has 125 helath. He has a wrench, shotgun, construction and destruction PDA, and a pistol. He can build one sentury that kills the other teams player. He can build one dispenser which give him metal, and others health and ammo. The other buildings are the teleporters which can get you into the battle quickly. Also there's the Medic which has a medigun, a syringe gun, and a bonesaw. He also has 150 health. The medigun heals players and even overheals them. They usually be all pocket medic and heal heavys (a pocket medic is one that only heals one person). There's a sniper which gets an insta-kill on any class even with a heavy overhealed if he charges up his sniper shot all the way and get's a headshot. He has 125 health and carrys a sniper rifle, a SMG, and a kukri (which is a sword). He is a goto class for COD players because they want to be all "Quickscope 360 weapon switch knife headshot MOFO!!" What if I told you that Valve incouraged "hardscoping" which is staying in your scope for a long time before getting a kill. So there's that class. Next is the final class, the spy. The spy carrys a knife, invis watch, revolver, and electrosapper. The spy can go invisible, get backstabs which kill any class instantly for 6 times their health, and can get pretty annoying. The drawbacks of spy is you have 125 health. You can only stay invisible for a little while, and is very hard to play as. The sapper will drain the health of engineers buildings. You can also disguise as enemy players but don't bump into anyone since you walk strait through team mates but you dont walk through enemys. Be sure to hide in a corner that's dark. You thought that was long? I'm only getting started. There are also weapons that you get randomly. Theres keys that cost $2.50 and you can open a crate which you also find randomly. Opening crates will give you an item that's diffrent for each crate type. The biggest nag on this game is that there's too many hats. That's actually how most people hear about this game. You end up trying to do challanges such as trading a random weapon up to an unusual hat. Unusual hats are unlocked by a very rare chance when unboxing a crate. That's all I'm going to include so thanks for getting to the end. Hope you have a good day :D

It is so fun and addicting that sometimes i leave myself trapped in the game, Yet some classes are kinda boring and yet useless its fun to switch around with classes so thumbs up for that!

Or 3,500 dollars on a dead person inside of a coffin that you used to get out of a small, 4x4 compact crate that comes with a skull from Five Nights at Freddy's following you around? Or 2,000 dollars for a haircut that makes you look like a crazy, sadistic punk rocker that recently came from Chernobyl? Or 5,500 dollars for the fire hazard named the Sorting Hat from Harry Potter with a demonic face that got lit on fire? Or 928 dollars for a gigantic, burning fish that does nothing but leech off of your brain tissue while you mindlessly slaughter others? Or 200 dollars for a satanic Christmas tree that you can wear? Or maybe even the grandest deal of them all, a Frying Pan or a Wrench painted in pure gold in exchange for your house, your car, and your virginity? This is for you! I still reccomend buying spinach with the money instead.

With lots of colourfull game mods, hats, personalities, weapons, classes and ways to play each of them. A game where payment is truelly optional. Being a f2p doesn't necesarlly mean you're any worse than a p2p, it just means u can have at most 10 hats. In some simple words, this game needs more skill then any CoD and is wai cooler in his cartoonish way.This game is just amazing.

review: Team Fortress 2, a game so drawn out from the First Person Shooters seen in modern day life. The sequel to Team Fortress Classic, it comes with all the unique little inventions that seems to have escaped the worlds of FPS Gaming, such as humor, character, stratergy and general fun. Team Fortress 2 includes a variety of killing machines, the Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and the dreaded Spy. Each is a threat, each have weaknesses, each is an absolute B@#[]&$?~! The Scout (by default) is tied with the Engineer, the Sniper and the Spy with the lowest health in the game (125), but he is NOT to be underestimated. His weapons consist of a Scattergun, capable of doing massive damage depending on the distance, a Pistol, to do subtle chip damage and to perhaps finish off retreating foes, and a Baseball Bat, turning you into the blur across your screen slowly chipping away at your health. Made to be annoying, The Scout is also the biggest, cockyest B@#[]&$?~ of them all. What I consider the second hardest class to master. The Soldier has the second highest health in the game (200), a very offensive-driven class with some support options, the Soldier can easily bust through an enemy's line of defence. Mister Jane Doe has no shortage on power, busting through the wacky merceneries with: A Rocket Launcher, doing massive amounts of damage with questionable accuracy, splash damage is a useful tool, a Shotgun, rather average, doing more damage the closer you get, and a... Shovel, because why wouldn't you want to kill someone with a gardening tool, much more embaressing if you think about it. The Pyro, this multi-personality man/woman/thing has the most average health of 175 (Along with the Demoman), many many people curse the Pyro's name in death (Whatever it is) for one of the Pyro's best features, after-burn. Losing three health per half-second for ten seconds is never a position you want to be in. He uses a; Flamethrower, which is responsible for the dreaded after-burn and the just-as-scary air-blast, able to reflect rockets, arrows, pipe bombs, you and more, not to mention the base fire damage! Next is the Shotgun, which is no differant from the Soldier's, and finally the Fire Axe, rather ironic. The Demoman, a bomb throwing drunk from Ullapool, Scotland, Tavish Finnegan DeGroot is a force to be reckoned with, whether defending or attacking. His weapons include a Grenade Launcher, to abuse the laws of physics and blow the opposition to smithereens, a StickyBomb Launcher to wait and blow people to smithereens, and a Bottle of whiskey, to do something with the left over piece of trash, remember kids, reduse, REUSE, recycle! The Heavy is a giant loveable bear-of-a-man from Soviet Russia, willing to give everyone his worth-his-weight-in-gold amount of bullets. Mikhail is a man to be feared due to his truck tone of health (300) and his own set of weapons: The Minigun, holding a total of two hundred bullets, it can moe down enemies like they where the pawns against a queen, the Shotgun, a useless addition due to the giant minigun you might want to use instead, and, what else? His Fists, may the toughest Mann survive! The Engineer is a mann of BRAINPOWER! Del Conagher is not a man to get out there on the front lines (for having 125 Health), he's either slightly behind the front line, gettin' his team to the front or struggling to keep an area under their control, either way he is one to be feared. He is equipped with a simple Shotgun, a Pistol and a Wrench, not much explaining needed, however his buildings is where he shines. Using a Sentry (Representing Attack) to slaughter the enemy, using a Dispencer (Representing Defence) to resupply his team on health and ammo, and a teleporter (Representing Support) to get his comrades to the front in a snap. The Medic, a true help to the team. The homocidal maniac from Germany is here to aid and laugh maniacly while doing so, being semi-weak on the offence, he tends to park himself behind a rather large offensive class, mostly Soldiers, Heavies and possibly Pyros. He owns a Syringe Gun, doing considerable damage if the aim is good enough consistently, a Medigun to heal those classes in need, and finally the Bonesaw to slaughter the enemy and maybe do a diagnostic on them after the round. The Sniper is a damn good assassin from the harsh place known as "The Bush". Mr Mundy is probably the simplist class to grasp, for snipers arn't excatly new to First Person Shooters. The primary weapon isn't hard to guess, zoom in, take aim, and watch the pink cloud as it decends on his allies which leaves them with a dread of exiting their base... until you get backstabbed. The SMG is, to put it bluntly, an awful weapon in TF2, doing next to no damage with the accuracy of a crane fly, and finally the Kukri, a rather badass sword that will help you out. The Spy is one truly feared Frenchie. A man of mystery, the Spy is capable of instantly killing any class simply by stabbing them in the back. He is equipped with a Revolver, not doing that much damage, but enough to annoy people with, a Knife, able to insta-kill, keeps everyone... on their toes, a Disguise Kit to disguise as any class from each team, and finally the Invis Watch, to go fully invisable, but it limits you to just running around until it runs out, not to mension the bane of all Engineers, the god damn sapper, slowly wittering down the health of buildings and making them un-usable. Not to mention the unlockable weapons, their unique personas and funny gags, Team Fortress 2 is a fun game that will suck more out of your life than a wh@#[] ever could, if you have a PC you have no excuse to not have this game, get it and maybe we will meet someday. Thank you for your dedication! -Jay

review: This game shows how Best graphics doesn't make a first person shooter good, and I've always loved this art style way more then this Realistic Crap. And it's not just simple RUN OUT THERE KILL EVERYONE, it's many unique game modes make it fun and never ending and you have to rely on your Team as well as your self. Amazing, this is just one of those game's you had to have played at LEAST once. Not forgeting all classes are evened out, (But not Pyro, Pyro Is So Over Powered It's Not Even Funny) And the final thing I love about this game is how all the classes have there own funny personality!

review: Do you like very serious games? do you like games that have dramatic stories, in-depth gameplay, and touching scenes? WELL THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU! This game is not your standard FPS game, this game has so much humor in it, you can't take it seriously. "How do I know that this game isn't some generic FPS game and you're just talking bs?" watch meet the pyro and meet the spy....just..ju.just watch. To conclude this review, there are many different things you can do in it, you can play on custom maps, like mario_kart_v20, randomizer maps, you can purchase hats and costumes to make your character look like a baddas fighting machine, or a strange person in a wierd outfit that makes you cry "I NEED AN ADULT!" i highly suggest this game to anybody who is into whacky and silly stuff, if you find this game to be interesting, i ma going to give you a little advice. remember to spy-check! ;)

review: TF2 is a crazy FPS where you can battle friends and kill them in one foul swoop with a frying pan, make a fat man look like dovakihn, make a one-eyed black scottish man jump across the map and drink a grenade, laugh over your bff's corpse, have a burning Top-hat, kill people with bubbles, get hats, and more hats, and more hats, and more hats, and more hats, DON'T YOU GET IT YET?

This game is a bit like COD, in the FPS side of it (My view) but it offers something compleatly amazing. A community around hats! I have never known a other game that attracted people who likes cosmetics. And we also cant forget the weapons and there uniquability, and their comical factors. Why should you even consider getting this game: ? In my opinion, if you where wanting too ruin your life, and never have a social life this game is for you.

review: Graphics - The graphics for Team Fortress 2 might not seem up to par with other Valve games, but it's the art style that matters. The cartoonish graphics fit so well with this game, I wouldn't have it any other way! 5/5 Music - This game has amazing music! It's a shame we typically only hear it on the menu and during events. 3/5 Story - While Team Fortress 2 does have a story, it's never told in game. The story can be found on the wikipedia page, if you're interested in reading it. It explains why the two teams are fighting, at least. 2/5 Replayability - Many gamemodes, maps, and weapons always being added. Don't like what they have? Modded game mods range from far and wide, Prophunt, Saxton Hale, the list goes on. It's never a bad time when you launch this game again. 5/5 Gameplay - The gameplay is nice, and balanced. Something other FPS's can't always say. Not pay to win, either, which should be noted considering it's also Free-to-Play! 5/5 Overall Score - 4/5 Good.

review: If you have not played Team Fortress 2, then you should sit in a corner and think about your life! Team Fortress 2 might just be my favorite first person shooter games. You can choose from 9 classes, each one that has tons and tons of weapons and hats. If you think that it is boring just killing the other team over and over all the time, then you are wrong! Be warned that if you get this game, you will be sucked into it and you will not stop playing it! You will spend your days locked in a dark room with a bowl of Doritos by your side. You will become fat and lazy with no wife, no kids, and most importantly no life. Trust me, it has happened to me already. Remember that this game appears to be free except for one thing.... your life.

I had to learn how to walk again and learn who my friends and family were again. Naturally, when i got out and couldn't remember passwords to anything (emails, steam, my laptop, nothin') betchyer  i still d/l'ed TF2 the second i got my new laptop, all i can do is gaze upon my former glory thru my old crew profile i managed to rejoin but im still ballin' (still lampin') and still enjoying EVERY ING MINUTE of Team4tress. i love you guys.

review: I was like you once, you know, just browsing the steam store, getting all the valve games. Then I got this one... I was F2P for a long time. Until one morning I decided to buy like, one weapon to get me premium. I'd seen scrap banking videos on YouTube, so I wanted to buy a huntsman and build it up to a strange killstreak. Then, fate looked down on me and decided I didn't need a life. I went on the man co store, planning to buy the huntsman and spend the rest of the fund card on games. Then, I saw the hats. Line by line, those beauties, shining and glittering in the darkness of my bedroom. I bought one. Then my life chsnged forever. Trading, banking, buying, uncrating and just being addicted to these hats... Now it's to late for me. I got a team captain, and realised I'd exceeded my target. But I wanted to spend more money on the store... Pour money into valve... Buy hats. Now I feel hats whispering my name, I feel their prescience. I see them on those I love... I see them in my food. I can feel Gabe Newell in my soul, pressuring me to buy more hats... I can't take it anymore. As I type this, I feel a key in my mouth. Fake hats on my head, professional killstreaks burning my eyes... Help me. I love tf2, deeply recommend this game to anyone, be it a COD player or just an idiot.

With the knowledge anyone can join tournements after 50 hours it motivates you to keep playing. another thing is the items, you want the best of the best and again more motivation to play... finally I got scammed and the dropped my morale so low i haven't played this in 3 months. And yet I still recomend this, I wonder what is the motivation is this time.

review: What can I say, You are a Pixel character that comes in many forms with given skills and weapons to do tasks. Whether it be to defend your base, capturing a point or Killing that Backstabing Spy, This game enhances your gaming experience and takes it to a whole new level. Lots of people gave this bad and good reviews but if you really thing about it, go to anyones profile and 90% of the Community has this as their main played game and over 1,000 hours. This is a good game under the genres Shooter and lets you show off your skills, techniques, items to flaunt, trade, collect and so much more. I give this game a positive review and it's gonna be a perfect score for me.

review: This game is... it's... it's too great to be described with mere adjectives! This game is absolutely with out a doubt one of the best games out there! It was indeed "Worth the Weight". It's art style is amazing because it is so unique and different from anything I've ever seen, this goes for both the characters, items, and enviorment. I find the game's visual appearence breathtaking. For the small amount of soundtracks this game consists of, they are amazing. This game is great because it seemingly never gets old, with dozens of different gamemodes, exciting new content updates, and its annual Scream Fortress, Smissmas, and other events. Yet, the best thing about the game (at least to me it is) is the nine classes that the game consists of. Each class is full of personality and dialogue, whether its insulting taunts or hillarious cathphrases. All of the classes are very different from each other with weapons, dialogue, attitude, style, and the way you play as them. First off you have your Offensive category, consisting of the Scout, Soldier, and Pyro. The Scout is a fast, smart-mouthed, "all bark and no bite" kind of kid with weapons that are most effective at close range, requiring a hit-and-run sort of tactic. The Soldier is a dedicated American with a strong passion to fight. Possessing a Rocket Launcher as his primary weapon, the soldier is a powerful threat to his opponents, but all that power leaves him with a slow speed, requiring him to use a maneuver known as the "Rocket Jump" to travel faster in exchange for some health. The Pyro is a mumbling lunatic, whose history is a mystery to just about everyone, he (or possibly she) wields a Flamethrower as his/her main weapon which makes him/her lack a lot of range, but gives a lot of potential power if used correctly. He/she is best used for ambushing enemies and his/her Compresion Blast (Airblast) can be used to reflect many projectiles back at opponents. Next is the Deffensive category, the Demoman, Heavy, and Engineer. The Demoman is a one-eyed, drunk Scottish man who has no bullet-based weapons and fights instead with 2 explosive weapons. He can take out enemies that he can't see with his Grenade Launcher or lay traps with his Sticky Launcher. The Heavy is a large, strong, Russian beast that uses his beloved Minigun. His immense power and large size leaves him with a very slow speed but with very strong fire power. He may be considered an easy target due to his size, but as long as he has his Minigun he should be treated as a threat just like all the other classes. The Engineer is a intelligent Texan that relies mainly on his buildings to fight. His Sentry Gun is generally a threat to any enemy within it's range, he can build a Dispenser to heal him and his teammates as well as refill there ammo, and he can also build teleporters so his team can access areas faster. The last category is the Supportive classes, consisting of the Medic, Sniper, and Spy. The Medic is a German doctor with amazing medical technology at his disposal. He is not one known for attacking but instead he is known for healing. Using his Medi-gun, he can quickly heal his teammates. Once charged enough, he can deploy what is known as an "Ubercharge", making him and whoever he is healing temporarily invincible to any damage from enemy weapons. The Sniper is an Austrailian outdoorsman who, as his name suggests, uses a Sniper Rifle as his main weapon. He can do extreme ammounts of damage at long range, making him a valueble teammate when used correctly. At short range though, he is more vulnerable and can easily be overwhelmed by enemies. Lastly, we have the Spy, a French trickster who can disguise himself as his opponents and quietly sneak behind enemy lines. He can perform a "Backstab", resulting in an instant kill, use his Sapper to destroy enemy buildings such as Sentries, and use his Cloaking Device to become temporarily invisible to sneak around danger. Playing as a Spy requires stealth and smarts to succeed. The best thing about all these characters is the fact that, other than the Heavy being the games main Icon, none of the classes seem to be better than the rest. They all have their own special weaknesses and none of them are generally favored over the others. The game is a masterpiece and that's all I can say.

review: Team Fortress 2. Three words to describe it are Addicting, Superior and Cosmetics The only problem is that once you buy/find a cosmetic you can't stop so unless you want this showing up on your screen 'R.I.P Wallet' then i recommend limiting yourself to cosmetics but unfortunatly my 'R.I.P Wallet' happend a very very long time ago... But I would definetly recommed this game to the ages of 8+. It is one of my favourite free to play action games on steam and if you do go on TF2 make sure to go on at halloween times because they are always fun So may the cosmetics be ever in your favour HARRY POTTER IS REAL

review: This is a great fps game. It has a cartoony feel to it which is not very common among most first person shooter games. However if you have played games like COD or other games with guns, be aware that this is nothing like those. It has specific classes with set weapons, all classes have weaknesses and strengths. Not recommended for people who like to play offline either as the training games are not the best.

review: Team Fortress 2 is an FPS game with a singleplayer and multiplayer servers. I think that this game is awesome, but they need to upgrade the weapon/item drop system, it needs to give new players a few more items than people who have been playing the game more often. The textures are somewhat realistic with a sort of "cartoony" feel to them. The player models are good but could use a little more detail, even if it's a "cartoony" game. Basic plot: Mann CO. a company run by the tough Saxton Hale who had 3 sons, Red, Blu, and Grey. Red and Blu exiled Grey and fought with eachother like maniacs. Grey came back with replicas of Red and Blus armies, Robots. Classes: Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demo, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy.

review: This 3D animated shooter is the perfect game for all Valve fans! A complete 10/10, but you have to make sure not to be tempted by the "hats". The "hats" are the way to show victory and coolness in TF2, but some hats require purchasing them with real life money and are not aquireable in any other way. The classes are amazing and one of my favorites being Spy, you can unlock certain items by playing the game or earning achievements without paying money. This aspect of the game brings the fun of showing off your items without paying the five dollars for an awesome hat! Honestly not the best game I've played, but possibly the second or third. The classes are fun in many different ways. - The scout has super speed and can really mess up the other team. - The soldier has a rocket jump which can be used to camp and fire. - The pyro gets an airblast that can deflect most things. Rocket? AIRBLAST!!! - The demoman can spam grenades at you and sticky bomb the entire base if he wants. - The heavy has loads of ammo and good strength, but bad speed and bad aim unless up close. - The engineer can place sentries, dispensers, and teleporters to protect areas. - The medic has a very rapid gun as well as a Medigun which heals other players (best with the heavy). - The sniper can be horrible up close, but he can make headshots and instakill players with his sniper rifle. - The spy can disguise as the other team and even take down the engineer's buildings. Even if the game costed money, it would still be worth it. Once again, a full 10/10.

review: Team Fortress Two, the name itself is well known enough to sell the game. TF2 has existed since for over 6 years now and has still outlived most shooters. Unlike the other team fortress games/mod it is much more quirky than serious. However do not let its good nature fool you, it is still a very competitive game with communities ranging from trading based to competition. Even though it is very serious sometimes, it is also very easily to find a game focused just on having fun, which is rather difficult in most games now. TF2's community is mostly responsible for the current content in the game. Maps, weapons, and character cosmetics are mostly created by the community and added in Valve's official updates. The community is even responsible for creating a currency system using the crafting materials and a few notable cosmetics. Even though the game has existed for many years, there is so much balance amongst the nine classes and their various weaponry that new players and beta testers alike can be engaged in a battle with no clear outcome until the final seconds. In short, there is no reason to not try TF2. There is a class for any playstyle and its a free game that i so fun, I don't think anyone would mind paying for.

I have played this game for so long, and while I occasionally get bored, I am yet to find a game on par with TF2, gameplay, uniqueness and trading-wise.

review: Welcome to profit simulator 20XX. The jist of this game is to buy stuff as cheap as possible, sell that stuff as expansive as possible then rinse and repeat. I don't always play this simulator as the gameplay gets quite repetitve and it's hard to get items that are on fire "cause fire n warm glowy stuff" - Trading cornmunity on a regular basis. Other than these flaws the gameplay is fine. You have 9 classes, Scout he has +50% profit and +75% chance of ruining your day and sadly you can only play him in 4 colors black, white, pink and green he isn't a very good stealth class because his vibrant colors standout on the maps making me think they didn't think it through when choosing his color scheme. Soldier he has +40% profit -15% speed and +60% dressing apeal. He too falls to the same flaws as the scout having only 2 color choices pink and green. Despite his -15% speed he can sacrifice a chunk of his health to do a super jump, although they say you use the rocket launcher to do this you end up exploding into millions of pieces you actually hold down right click to charge it and let go while looking up to perform this move. This class is overall good and can help you out if making profit is a bit time consuming and boring with his increased dressing apeal can add a few extra hours of fun just by dressing him up. Pyro he has +25% profit +999% speed while target is in contact by flames, +85% outfit diversity and 65% more confusion. Her main weapon is the flamethrower which allows major bursts of speed if you set people on fire making him a very interesting but new players should avoid using her as his most game changing ability is her comrpession blast which can defend you by deflecting rockets, grenades, plasma grenades, ariplanes, soldiers, wild cabermen and steam flash sales but you have to time his ability or else you'll be hit which is why she isn't recomended for new players. With the highest outfit diversity in the game he can create intersting and profitable combos which also requires a decent amount of experince to even pull off. Demoman has +35% profit, +50% boom, -25% outfit diversity, +999% damage only active with stock secondary and +45% stealth (Only active during the night). This "unique" looking individual is the explosive expert of the team with his loadout that consist of sharp blades, shields and boots making him an agile tank of destruction, pairing this up with the stock secondary makes you invincible because your aura becomes so strong from the damage increase everything gets ripped from reality and only requires you to press two buttons repeatedly making him easily the best class in combat. Unfourtunatly despite his godly stats in combat he falls short in profiting abilities with having outfits of things from the past, making diversity a problem and can hinder his profit stat. Heavyweapons has -35% speed, +90 more ammo, +10% profit, +60 more gun, +45% outfit diversity +175 bulk. This character is a mixed bag for combat and profit his combat ability is soaking damage and retaliating but he is slow forcing him into a more defence gameplay which can be quite slow and doesn't feel rewarding and the fact that demoman's damage is off the charts the heavy can only last 3 seconds once he enters the demoman's 30 metre aura making this class redundant. As for profit he can be very effective if you can find someone who prefers this characters outfits which because of his offical mascot status can make this quite easy to find. Oh an also the heavy has a hidden ability called "Thick Fat" which makes him take 50% less damage from temperature based attacks. The Engineer has +35% profit, +90% calm down, +35% fun and -20% height. Don't look at that -20% height as a bad thing that can be the difference between life and death (even though the characters share the same hit boxes for most projectiles.) and with his sentry gun ability you can create a machine gun that has aimbot and can even upgrade it to shoot rockets aswell making this class easily the most defensive class and with his +90% calm down stat makes him a good switch after a stressful day of ripping people off. The engineers outfit divirsity is interesting and quite large but nothing like the pyros. The elusive Medic has +0.005% speed, +80% happiness, -45% damage, +60% crit ratio, -90% common. The medic is a god send in the meta-game and has the most complex and useful magic attacks in the game with such abilities such as partner shield, skill crits and restore these along can be used together to create devastating combos that can counter even the demomans destructive aura which is why they used this spell combinations on the already powerful demoman to tripple his aura's damage and radius. The truth to why the medic is so powerful is because of how rare and fragile they are but when someone experienced enough gets ahold of one they can unleash hell. The medic is soley combat orientated the only ability in profit he is capable of is restoring hats to their original form. Sniper has +90% common, +90% new players, -100% usefullness in large numbers, -70% productivity, -35% vision and -75% interesting outfits. This class can be beast in the hands of a pro but will still be destroyed by demomen, making him pointless and all you can do for fun is scope in atleast with soldier and scout you can do something intersting with them and too many new players choose him like some kind of god or something as if it's the  in some other game or something like and fail with him that and then we end up having just scouts, snipers and spies. It's just as bad for profit they only have 2 colors pink and green which is a small choice for making profits plus people are lazy with how they look and take the generic stuff angus hood, outback interlectual, that berret with a little shield on it, those sound thingys from apple that hurt your ears and that leather thing for his face and nothing else making him a very linear and boring class combat and profit wise. Spy has +80% commons, +90% new players, -80% usefullness in large numbers, -55% productivity, +60% style, -75% visibility and +55% stealth. The spy has the same faults as the sniper combat wise the demomans arua wrecks him and and too many inexperienced players choose him. The worse part is that they don't even bother trying to use the revolver his only way of self-defense other than the energy shield watch. Along with this he is a very paitent and slow class that requires finding the right momment to strike and the right momment to run. Profit wise he has a hole wardrobe of stylish fedoras and diverse suits making him a very interesting class for profiting. If you're a fan of tycoon games this might be right up your alley. 8.9/10

review: Team Fortress 2 (AKA: Hat Fortress 2) is a rather interesting FPS that will surely become addicting as time progresses. Because the game is F2P there WILL be in-game purchases, but keys only cost around 2 bucks a pop, keys being the main currency of TF2. (Which can be used to turn into steam cash.) I personally reccomend this to a bored soul who wants to have a fun time killing time. As sane as I can sound this game WILL MAKE YOU ADDICTED. HELP! I'VE BEEN SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME COLLECTING HATS AND MISCS, I AM TOO ADDICTED THIS GAME RUINED MY LIFE HELP ME!!! AHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHHHHHH!!!!

review: WOW a shooter that looks like it was in a Nintendo carwash! Team Fortress 2, this has been incredibly popular on Steam ever since it debut in 2007. The game is completely different than your ordinary shooter. Firstly, this game is colorful. In most shooters its all HARDCORE and gray. But in TF2, it is the complete opposite of that. It has humor, good writing, an amazing community, different game modes, over 200 (I think) weapons, and SO much more. So, if you are new to Steam and are looking for a good shooter, pick TF2. Because its totally different than the run of the mill Call Of Duty FPS. And its also Free to Play! So you get one of the best games on Steam for free, and if you want a premium account all you have to do is just buy 1 item from the shop! And going premium adds a whole new layer of fun to Team Fortress 2. So please if you haven't already, play this game. Its fresh, its new, and its different. And I don't expect it to go off Steam anytime soon

review: Are you tierd of your standard qick scope, camoflage and camping fights like in call of duty? Sick of all the Proos sqating above your face in games like Halo and Unreal T? Then dos steam have something fore you to day. This was once a not free2play game, but now it is, and it is one of the best and diverce shooters, you wil see. It has a bunch of gamemodes, so you will allway have new stuf to check out. It has 9 classes, so you are sure to find AT A MINIMUM of 3 that you willl like. You can equip everi class with new weapons that you get as (drop or achivments). I sudgest playng againts bots fore some time, so you can se each class specificly, and so you won't get creamed by online competetive play. This game.....DOS NOT CARE ......abaut youre kill death ratio. It isn't displayed aniwere doring game time. So the best way to get points, is to reach your TEAM goal.....Thats why its called TEAM fortres.

review: Team Fortress 2. Arguably the most popular FPS on the PC. This game is insanely fun, even after so many years of playing. Every class is still working as they should. (well, except the Demoman, but let's face it, Valve made every single one of his unlocks make you play him differently) The addition of the steam workshop compatibility makes all new possibilities come up. So, even 5 years after its initial release, Team Fortress 2 is a MUST HAVE FUN GAME, and since it's free now, there's no excuse.

review: oh the memories first game on steam... first game i tried to get good at... first game that vavle pissed me of in... first pc online multiplayer ok, i've had steam for almost 2 years now and this game still has my most hours. Do i recomend it? Does it suck? Is it dead? well prepare to get your questions awnsered IS IT FUN: yes, its a valve shooter, of course its gonna be good with 9 classes and 200+ weapons, it takes a while to get bored IS IT DEAD: No, there are still plenty of servers and players in every gamemode and with community servers there is even more fun to be had IS THE COMMUNITY NICE: No... not really, i face the fact that 90% of the tf2 fanbase are , new and old. New players get their self-esteem destroyed by older players and the new players that call everyone an idiot,noob or skrub suck too. But there are nice players and their always fun to hang around with SO IF THE COMMUNITY SUCKS I SHOULDNT GET THE GAME THEN?: Yes, if you can get some freinds to play the game and play it with you, which isint hard since its the only free valve game, you can have some genuine fun and laughs with them SO SHOULD I GET IT?: Yeah,its a fun,fast shooter with a ehh community and great gameplay, cant miss it 8.5/10 community sucks but is still enjoyable

review: When it comes to Free To Play games ,this game is top. everything in the game is avaliable from the start just waiting to be found or crafted but if you can buy stuff from the Mann CO. store. i will say the Mann CO. store is overprice, i recommend buying at the community market if you're impatient (like me), but if you do buy something from the Mann CO. store you get a premium account where drops are more frequent and expanded backpack, it's worth getting. this game allows you to play to your own playstyle, to take what skills you have and make them a positive feature with a drawback, when used correctly you can be professional, this is why you might see some kids rage because they migrated from COD. Their are many community gamemodes to this game, probably the most iconic VS Saxton Hale or Prop Hunt(yes it's also in TF2), their are also 7 original gamemodes. I will say the hats are kind of "overpraised" upon but still worth(it's not TF2 without hats). This game is about teamwork and it is AWESOME! I recommend.

There can hardly be a single MVM without harassing, whining and idiotic behavior, annoying setup and ragequitting. There are hardly servers without stupid people on the mic, puking out their racist and intolerant opinions nobody gives a damn about. Maybe I'm too old for this bull frickin' horse , but I'm really tired of the majority of players here. BTW, there are also female players out there, so shove your lesbian sprays up your  and take some more Medic/Engineer action, you homophobic morons.

review: How to feel good playing this game: Heal people on fire about to die with 1 health left. Bonk a heavy about to decimate your team. Snipe that spy about to chain stab your team. Build teleporter exit to first spawn point near the end of a match. Backstab a sniper until he switches to razorback. Headshot him until he switches to pyro. Win a match after team sh*ttalker moves to other "winning" team. Kick a bad medic for trying. Getting 50 kills in a row also feels pretty good, if you can do it. Don't acknowledge the people who defecate in their living room instead of their bathroom. People who bring all their life problems to the game, known as ragers, don't realize the fundamental aspect of entertainment. Whatever good or bad thing happens while playing, is ultimately for your entertainment. You will forget this playing TF2 though just saying and become a rager yourself.

review: team fortress 2 is exectly what the name is. its a game where you have to oppose against another team and the best team eventualy wins. this is nothing like Call of Duty as every class in here as an advantage and a disadvantage. for example the scout runs really really fast but has low HP and because you only have shotguns and pistols you need to get close to you emeney in order to take him out quickly. I really advice you to download this game since its free and it has a lot of options. try teaming up with some friends and do some mann vs machine or try to launch a rocked into space. it is all possible with the right amount of teamwork and fun :D

review: Many firstperson shooters feel the same: you're the only one that matters; any weapon will kill in one to two hits; the game takes itself way to seriously; the main goal is KILL, KILL, KILL. Overall, it seems to me that most FPS genre games are lacking a bit in the diversity department. Team Fortress 2 addresses that by giving you a crazy, colorful, whacked-out, and unpredictable world to screw around in. With nine classes to choose from, each with his own arsenal of specialized (and sometimes hilarious) guns, bombs, and blunt instruments to do battle with, you're presented with countless different play styles. Customizing the mercenaries with nonsensical wardrobe changes is a big part of the game as well; just visualize a giant, brutish man wearing a tutu! Team Fortress 2 also encourages a team dynamic of sorts. While you can go off on your own and sucseed, coordination with other players is vital, as each class has his own way(s) to help out his fellow mercenary. I know, this is quite the exstensive review on a free game, but please heed my word and give this a shot. I'm certain you'll enjoy it!

Team Fortress 2 is one of the most played games on Steam and it's not a surprise. It's a FPS with a cartoon-like twist! The more and more you play it the more and more you unlock new things. After a while you just get so caught up into it and BOOM. No life :3. But in all seriousness, I highly reccomend this game for it's extreme balance between players. It doesn't matter if you're a F2P or a P2P, the weapons are always equal. The cosmetics however... different story. All in all, 10/10 stop reading this and go get Team Fortress 2! See you online :L

review: Very fun. All I want is weapons and I've been playing a lot for weapons since that's the only way to get weapons. Weapons are want I want and need. Flamethrowers, snipers, I don't care. As long a I can kill people with it. Also I like the food. This game provides food you can use as combat weapons. Example: The Holy Mackerel (a fish). Again you can kill people with it. One thing I get mixed up with in the game is that if you kill someone along the rails or a fence, it looks like they are standing up, so I waste my ammo trying to kill a dead guy. That's it and remember to get weapons. I recommend this game for people who likes weapons. How many times did I say weapons (not including the time I say weapon in this sentence)?

review: When a FPS meets team play, fun, and strategy :) Team Fortress 2 is a game that looks simple at first glance. Just pick a class, shoot, kill everybody, have fun. But in the end, you realize that it's not that simple. Every class has strengths and weaknesses ; the more balanced is a team, the more chance the team has to win. And once you really understand all the classes and know them all, the game is just bomb. So in this game, being a pro at CS or Quake 3 Arena doesn't mean you'll oneshot everybody here ; you've got to think carefully about what you do, and help the best possible your team. That's precisely what I love in this game : each class is useful, and no class is overpowered. I do not count the number of games that have been won because I was a Medic or an Engineer (which are support classes), and because there were enough big guys in my team to do the rest. And at last but not least, you have in this game a lot of fun contents (cf the pyro glasses ; or when blood becomes balloons, and fire becomes rainbow), which is the icing on the cake. The only backdrop : there is a lot of noobs in public games that don't know how to play, and most of the time, it's the team who has the highest number of non-noobish player who wins. But that shouldn't be a problem for you if you're looking just for fun :)

Even if you don't like the base game VALVe (Volvo Pls) has had good support for custom game modes like Jailbreak PropHunt VS Saxton Hale. The game has a very deep trading system basically created by the community. If you have the space and and bandwith this game is a must get. Atleast try it

review: I love this game. I really do. That's why I have over 1,000 hours on it. Every single thing about it is great. But, the one, SINGLE, thing that makes me hate it is the freaking people who play it. There is a select amount of people who are good, but about, I say, 80% of the people who play it are either: screaming 5 year olds, trollers who wont shut up, hackers who ruin the entire game for everyone, people who think they are better than everyone, and last just your classical . I'm sorry if I'm sounding harsh, but this is how I see it. I just needed to say this and this is the only place I could think of. Thank you for reading and good day.

review: Its cool. Just like other RvB games (red vs blue)...when I started playing I did think it was fun, I did pretty well too, only played CTF really though, overall, it was enjoyable for a few hours a few times, but then it got meh. And when it got a 500mb update I didn't bother at all. I just don't want to write a not recommended review, people who love this game will hate me forever. I mean it was ok and all, but not my fav rvb game. When it comes to gmod, I don't usually bother with TF2, I try to make some themes, but they don't work out too well because I don't favor the game. Pros: Its WAS fun for a time... Cons: ...then I got bored.

review: Well, amongst all the positive reactions upon Team Fortress 2, I want to put in some more critical notes, although the sheer quality of this classic is undeniable. First of all, the game is technically superb ofcourse - it all runs flawlessly and Valve keeps updating and supporting it admiringly. Graphics and sound are also top-notch and deserve nothing but praise. And the sheer imagination of the entire undertaking is gigantic and really awe-inspiring. But. The actual gameplay is really mostly for those who enjoy fast-pacing shooting and jumping action, not for those who enjoy having a bit more time for their actions. Ofcourse it is an option to sit along camping, but that is not what this game is made for, and you won't win many friends by doing that. Also, fir those who are now, in 2014, new to the game, it appears to be difficult to find servers where "newbies" (aka beginners) are really welcomed and encouraged. Maybe I didn't try hard enough to find those, but it seemed like a stiff job to get me going. Don't misunderstand: this game promises tons and 100's of fun-hours for those who just like this fast-paced approach, but for the "others", it is something of a steep mountain to climb. Gameplay: 12/20 (according to taste...) Graphics: 16/20 Sound: 16/10 Stability & patching: 20/20 Long-lasting appeal: 18/20 Overall: 82/100

review: Team Fortress 2... What can one say about this game that hasn't been said already? It's a rather unique game in many ways: How many games have had an entire economy based on hats appear in them thanks to their community? How many games can have an extremely skilled player fragged by another, less skilled yet adecuately equiped player? How many games have a metric -ton of hats that vary from plain and boring to silly and pure awesome? Lets not forget that this is a class-based FPS in which every single class has its weaknesses and strengths twards other classes. As the game gets updated more weapons are added, all of which swap around the classes you're good and bad against. With only a few, minor exceptions, there are no weapons ingame that are a straight upgrade to the default weapons, all are sidegrades. The best weapon in the game is the one that fits your style best, the one you feel most comfortable using. There are many ways to play Team Fortress 2: You can play on official servers, which are all good. Play an objective against other players or play a 6 player coop mode against vast waves of AI controlled characters. OR You could play on community servers, where just about anything can happen. There are servers dedicated to trading, to snipers, to all versus one battles, achievement servers, and a large amount of modded gameplay servers. Play how you like, it's free and it's good.

review: The well known, and appreciated War Themed Hat Simulator, AKA Team Fortress 2. Fantastic game with truly awesome gameplay that does not focus on being realistic, just fun! Unlike many other multiplayer shooters, this one requires a lot of teamwork, hence the title, which can be either rarther frustrating or just plain fantastic! The feeling of when you and your team smashes through the enemy defenses and when you help each other out defeating the enemy is something to experience... You won't find this anytime soon in CoD kids... But of course, there are also some bad sides to the fact that teamwork is such a key element. Often it is seen that a lot of new players decide to go the class that they like- This is problematic since a full 10-man team of snipers simply will have a lot more trouble taking down a sentry nest than a single demoman and medic. Morale is that you have to balance the classes so you have enough of everything. There are a lot of unlockable weapons in the game, but you don't get them by 360'ing 30 people in a row... It's random drops, and to some extent achievement milestones (But not that much really...) Most weapons are simply sidegrades, so there aren't many weapons that are just better! Pretty much everything is balanced. As a final note, there are cosmetics in this game! YEY! These doesn't change anything particular important, even though people love 'em. Just collect them as an extra mini-game! It is not what the entirety is about :) The game is free! So yeah... Go have yourself a good time

With 9 differents classes, Team Forteress 2 has a very various gameplay, if you do not want to play as one class, you can choose one of the 8 others classes of the game! Each class has his speciality and they are all balanced. And, to finish, this game is FREE and you can get all weapons randomly when you are playing ; so this game is not a "pay to win". That is why I recommend this game, also because i have more than 1000 hours of gaming and i still love this game :)

There are nine different classes and you must work together to complete your objective and have fun in the same time. You can play in many ways. Offence , defence you can choose what you wanna play 10/10 PLAY IT WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, JOIN THE FUN FOR HATS!!!!!

review: I highly reccomend this game to anyone that has not tried it. So many year's has it been available, and it's still going strong. and for quite some time now, its been completley free. Not only does this game have quirky characters, interesting mechanics, great crisp-cartoony like gameplay and graphics, and just fun to play with and even then after you get a tad tired of that, tons of stuff to do, like, collect hats, stranges, vintages, Marketing, Unique gamemodes, and many others. So if you havent tried it out, try it out now.

review: Hats. Hats everywhere. So many Hats and other cosmetic items that it's pretty much impossible not to find a combination you like. Also, enough weapons to find a way of killing your opponents that suits you. 9 Classes, each with a unique set of weapons, a fairly realistic personality, and lots of cool hats to wear. So much extra content (Official comics, etc.) that lets you get an incredibly in-depth look at the game's story and the backstory of each Class. Overall, I give TF2 a Hat/10 Best game ever, play it now.

review: I have played Team Fortress 2 since the day it was released (Oct. 10 2007). It's changed a lot since then, but I still consider it the best multiplayer FPS ever made. I have about 460 hours in this game at the time of this writing, and I still laugh my  off every time I play. By reading this, I'm going to assume you're thinking about trying it for the first time, so here's some things all newbies should know: - Some classes are much more difficult learn than others. I'd start your first games playing as Medic, Soldier, Heavy, and/or Pyro. Until you get a decent grasp of things, stay away from Engineer and especially Spy. - Don't worry about the custom weapons that many other players will have. Although some are good, the base weapons are still often the best choice for every weapon of every class. As long as you don't take the game too seriously, it's impossible to not have fun playing it.

review: Honestly, I cannot find any avid gamer that is on steam and does not play Team Fortress 2. It's almost sacriligious to even have steam installed without also having TF2, as it's called by the players, on at least one computer capable of running it well, and boy is that not surprising. This game literally eats up time like no other (except maybe Dota 2 for some, or call of duty for others), and to be honest, the community is just as great. I can easily find a server where nobody gives a crap about killing as many other players as possible, or I can join one with an internationally recognised player for their prowess or two. The amount of hats too! it's all mind boggling that there are still gamers out there that haven't found TF2 enjoyable or have not even heard of it in general. What else to talk about...oh, the support. Obviously, due to its enourmous fanbase and it's publisher being the great and powerful Gaben (Steam creater and CEO(?)), it will almost always be there, as even Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is still supported and given server-space on top of all the newer games. Anyways, I highly recommend this game, and the game in summary would have to be: Hat Simulator 2014 :3 Happy Hat hunting my friends! I hope to see you in-game.

review: Team Fortress 2 is without a doubt the best FPS game I have ever played and probably the best one I will ever play! And that comes from someone who generally dislikes shooters. The cartoony characters, the unique playstyles for all the classes, the unlockable weapons (and hats), and the different types of matches will keep you playing this game for tens to hundreds of hours. Best part: It's completely free!

review: This is a well thought out team based first person shooter. The game encourages teamwork to win against players of higher skill or well-organized teams. Lone wolfing can still be done on lower levels, especially on public game servers. There are 9 classes to choose from, each one offering unique skill sets and abilities that allow them to fill in a unique role as part of the team as a whole. Because of this, the player is rewarded with a challenging and fun-filled experience, especially when faced against opponents or teams with similar or greater skill. Even though this game was released way back in 2007, the game continues to have an active development team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content, such as new unique weapons or game modes. At the time of this review, the Team Fortress community is preparing for the upcoming Halloween update, which has been an annual event in the game since 2009. While this game is extremely fun and rewarding to play, I have noticed how complex the game has become in regards to new items and game mechanics. I became introduced to this game in 2011, and gradually learned the ropes of the game over time. However, I have noticed how newer players have reported having a hard time grasping how all of the items work and in general feeling a sense of information overload. In order for them to not be considered a "noob" at this game, they must experiment and test with all of the items in the game to have a full understanding of what weapon(s) should be used in certain situations. All of this, however, is a small issue amidst the big picture. This game is fantastic and, being a free-to-play game, allows players to have loads of fun without having to make a big down payment to enjoy it. I continue to return to the game on a daily basis.

review: Team Fortress 2: A beginner's guide to multiplayer games. TF2 has it all. Classes, maps, hats and a humourous attitude. That said it's also terribly addictive like most multiplayer games, and whilst I recommend TF2, I can't help note how serious this addiction can be, when people rack up 10,000+ hours playing this game, it really doesn't deserve that. It's not *that* good of a game to be honest. That says it is a fun time with friends or a group of strangers for a few hours here and there, but little more unless you're an obsessive achievement hunter.

review: Team Fortress 2 is undoubtedly the best free-to-play game Steam has to offer. The graphics are great and while this game may look childish to some, the only thing childish about it are the cartoon-esque designs. Outside of that, TF2 is a game suitable for people of any and all ages 13 and up. What I find most appealing about this game is that even though players are allowed to spend as much money as they'd like to equip their characters with extremely powerful weaponry, the atmosphere of the game is generally quite fair and balanced. Of course some people may seem overpowered at times, but they are often veterans of this game. Just as long as you know how to play right, you don't need anything other than the default items the game provides.

review: If I was to summarise this game, I would simply describe it as the best first person shooter ever made. If you don't have it downloaded then hop right over to the steam library and go to the free games section. However, if you're the type that likes a bit more detail in your descriptions, then team fortress is also the right game for you. It is truly a 'easy to learn, hard to master' type of game. Additionally, upon starting the game you will not be instantly swamped by players who can kill you easier because they have weapons that are better than you. Everything in tf2 is balanced beautifully, between the weapons, individual classes and the overall team dynamic. Each new item doesn't bring with it a new advantage, but a new way that you can tweak your playstyle, with it's own individual positive and negative aspects. The overall feel of the game is great as well, due to the cartoony graphics and humorous quips that your team will constantly spout. Even in the worst matches, when I've had my head driven into the dirt by a more skilled team, I still walk away with an inward grin at that one time that four of my team mates and I walked a literal conga line through the enemy team's defence or airblasting an enemy scout and keeping him pinned against a wall while he shouted that I was a spy, followed by us sharing a high five and his character spontaneously exploding. I could go on about this game for days, but you shouldn't be reading it. You should be playing it as I speak.

review: +The game is a fun FPS with multiple classes to vary up your play style and changes the way it is from other FPS's, then it just being a point and shoot with the regular FPS guns: smg, sniper, assualt rifle, etc. But TF2 adds a more expansive take with weapons: flamethrower, minigun, sentries, etc. I'd say this game is worth it since it's been pretty active for 8 years. (to this date) -Although the game has multiple hats, misc. etc. for you to wear on your characters, and different types of weapons (genuine, vintage, strange, etc.) with along the trading the comes along with this game and can get you into a fuss over wanting an item for a long time and then going into the habbit of buying everything from either the Mann Co. Store or the Steam Market. This game will consume your money more then "pickpocketers" in Europe. Although the game is a new a fun FPS with still 8 years of active people and with the downfall of trading I still give this game a.. 9/10

review: What's amazing about this game, is that if valve never made any more updates for this game, the community, even the game itself, could sustain itself, ab kept alive for a very long time. It's almost as if it was made to be alive forever. Crafting, trading, inventory, cards, item drops, events, it's all here. The gameplay is fun, gory, querky, and addicting: everything you need in a game. The absence of an assault rifle is another thing that makes it stand out. It doesn't need to be like COD, or halo, it is what it is, and that's what makes it better than others. It has bird heads, sandwiches, more birds, shotguns, and everything. I highly recomend it. Best game ever.

review: It is a very good game when you get some weapons that you are better at. At first it may seem that everyone is better than you because they have better weapons, stranges,miscs and the most popular- unusual hats. This can change when you play it for a while (don`t end up like me playing over 128 hours in 2 months) and you get good weapons. And then you get to purchace items. It`s a game of cometition, but there can never be 'a best player'. Overall, I am addicted to this game. I love it.

review: Oh boy, Team Fortress 2. Where to start? Gosh I have over 400 hours docked into this game. This game is endless enjoyment and despite the fact there will be trolls and whiney (cussing) eight year olds, the game itself makes up for all of this. I'm not the BEST TF2 player, but I enjoy playing the game FOR the game. Unfortunately, most people, for some reason, tend to overlook the "Team" in "Team Fortress 2" and don't cooperate as a team all the time. But when you get a good team or some good competition, it's easily enjoyable! Many people on Team Fortress 2 are friendly, at least, most of the time, but of course, not everyone that plays the game is mature, nor a good-sport. But more often than not, there will be some friendly people on a server. I've made a bunch of friends just from meeting friendly people on Team Fortress 2. If you like a good FPS with silliness, fun, and of course, HATS, then Team Fortress 2 is the game for you! PROS: FREE!!! Extremely Addictive Fun Well Made HATS Several different gamemodes Did I say HATS? Different cosmetic items (including hats x3) for the classes Hilarious moments 1000s of different items Trading PROFIT CONS: 4 out of 5 servers will either have or eventually get a whiney, mic-spamming, cussing 5-10 year old Some People get too into the game sometimes and take everything personally You will find yourself investing over 400 dollars into the game x3 You will slowly have your mortal soul taken from you by the game Boot Camp bears the dread of a horrible team Mann Up bears the dread of a Boot Camp team People who like to think everytime they kill someone is the time to rant or spam "rekt" [MOST] Free-To-Plays are often Gibus/Pyrovision-Bearing Micspamming little kids [MOST] Free-to-Plays are AWFULLY annoying at times Otherwise, Team Fortress 2 has MANY more pros that I cannot take the time to list right now. But if you can deal with suddenly looking at your credit card balance then realizing you just blew your last 5 paychecks on TF2 or all the whiney 5-10 year olds, then Team Fortress 2 is a GREAT game and I truely recommend this game. I give it a 20/10 If you decide to download Team Fortress 2, I hope to see you sometime in the game! Trixie Out!

review: I've had COUNTLESS hours of CONSTANT fun with this game! I grew up playing this and I've made almost half of my Steam friends through it! I just absolutely LOVE the concept and idea of this game! I'm always getting into duels and battles to see who's better among my friends (We play arena to see who lasts the longets, last person standing) and I usually get into the mediocre sort of range... I'm nothing special at the game, but I see myself as a pretty good Scout, an OK Medic, a good Heavy, and a great Sniper. I find all sorts of different ways to traverse all sorts of maps as Scout and test my sharpshooting on 2Fort as Sniper. I've played with lots of nice people and on servers with "Plug-ins" that allow you to get upgrades and buffs kind of like an overpowered version of Mann vs Machine in which You and your team of 5 others fight for a certain amount of rounds against Robots and they keep getting harder and harder. Just wait until the tank comes! Then you have a full-team target! Great game overall and you should DEFINITELY get this game!

review: TF2, being another one of Valve's best (which is about every one of them) games is a FPS based around 9 classes in colourful and fun maps. The game is of course also known as Hat Simulator 2, as hats are what you do to display your skill, even though said hats are purely cosmetical. This game has sucked up almost 2000 hours of my life, and was the one game to get me into steam, as TF2 is completely free to play (purchasing any item in the in-game store upgrades your account to premium, allowing for a couple of perks as a free hat and more in-game item drops). It should also be mentioned that even though it is F2P, there is no need to pay if you'd like to win! You can get the weapons from in game drops, achievements or a clever crafting system, and I can almost guarantee that you'll be enjoying this game from start to end. Give it a shot, it is free after all. 9/10 This game is at its best with the real F2P and the user-friendlyness, but it does have a couple of bugs and annoying things which will get on your nerves. If you're looking for a casual FPS with competitive possibilities, check out TF2.

Did I mention it's free and has hats and guns and guns and hats and frees and games and mentions and has hases and has ands and hats and hats and guns and hats and guns and frees? If it did not mention that fact, then I need to tell you that it has Hats and Guns. Hats and Guns/10 But I do digress, the latest updates have made the game exponentially laggier, to the point where having fun isn't an option. It was fine before. Dang it, Valve.

review: No wonder why Team Fortress 2 is rated to be the best Free to play game. Unlike other first-person shooter, Team Fortress develops in it's own unique way, by including various diffrent maps, various diffrent weapons and even diffrent class with diffrent ability that reflects the player's personality. Once you enter the world of TF2 ( chopping other player's head's off, burning them with your flamethrower, betraying their trust by backstabbing them physically) you would wish you will never have to stop playing. I mean what I say and I say what I mean, and this is what I will say " Tf2 is the best game I had ever played".

It turned into a riot. Gabe... We know you like Snickers and every other chocolate but stop being so jewish about that money thing...

Maybe just one. Or two." And now I'm an active trader and have bought a bunch of keys for metals and taunts and weapons and most importantly hats.

review: This game is amazing. The weapons are unique, the game modes are fun and exciting, and overall it's a very fun game. I especially appreciate the fact that while there is an in-game store, the game is not pay-to-win, like most games nowadays. By this I mean the "weapon drop" system. For those of you who don't know what I mean, there is a function in the game that at random times while playing, you can find a random weapon or item. This means that certain weapons aren't restricted to paying players. It allows free-to-play players enjoy all the awesome weapons paying players get. There's also a lot of really cool functions and taunts to the game, and an underlying sense of humor that makes the game overall extremely fun to play. And sure, it has its glitches and problems (aghermghermGabeNewallaghermgherm) but if you look past it, TF2 is an amazing game, and I think that almost anyone can find enjoyment in it. The only problem I have with it, Mini-Sentries. Nerf them. Now. Valve. DROP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND NERF MINI-SENTRIES RIGHT NOW. #GibusPride #PyroFoLife

You can play offline with bots, online with other people, or a campaign like story called Mann vs. Machine. While playing, you can unlock new pieces of equipment. There is so many items that it is overwhelming! You can choose between 9 classes. Scout, soilder, pyro, demo man, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, and spy. You can play on different types of gamemodes and maps. There are also always new updates coming out. If you have steam and you don't have this game the GET IT!

If you dont like blowing people up with a rocket launcher or shooting exploding enemies with a grenade launcher, then you can try to run around like crazy and shoot enemies heads off with a scatter gun. If you are just like you wanna camp you can try headshotting enemies with the sniper or just be the engineer, who can build machines like a sentry that aims automatticly or shoot them, build dispensers so you you can heal your teammates, or build teleporters to get your teammates up to the line quickly!

review: This is the best FTP game i have ever played! There is so much to do, no need to buy anything with real money if you dont want to. Everything can be crafted! All 9 classes are awesome. I never feel that one of them is too OP because you can always counter them. Once you mastered one class there is always more! If you master Scout, you can then start to master some else class or just dont master anything and still have a good time wiht this game. PvP mode works like it should, nothing special, just 7 differend game modes and some beta gamemodes, lots of maps and everyone is fun to play. there is also an PvE mode called MvM. Its supper fun with firends and some of them are hard. To top it off, i like this game :)

review: This might be hard to believe, but this man is the leader of a group of lizards from the hyper elite. I know this first hand. I took care of this being as the mentor, as I am a hyper elite of the syntax-sector of the Illuminati. I have experimented with teleportation, Obama, and lizards shape-shifting into Secret-service agents. When the syntax-sector of the hyper elite barracks in the north pole, most experiments broke loose. This prototype, however, was smarter than most. With little to no signs of lizard-like structures when shape-shifted, he was the perfect man for our job. I once used my transformation powers, but was quickly spotted, and the extra-molecular shape-shifting superdinosaur came and saved me, with the hyperbeam harvested from Dialga in the Pokemon dimension. Yes, that show is real, made by the Ancient Gods from Sector-B//AnimationDimension//X-3, we transported the creatures into the "intelligent" planet called Earth, in my opinion, the weakest sector of the whole Illuminati. If you want more information about these creatures first hand, contact me via Google+ or teleportating to the hyperdimension in Class-A.

review: My oppinion of a first person shooter done right. This game has so much going for it. The levels are well designed, and fun to play on. All 9 of the classes are unique and balance well (each class has it's own niche and weakness). Controls are smooth and easy to pick up, even for a person new to the FPS genre. The comunity has an empesis on creativity with a workshop, mod maps, character custimization (both cosmetics and weapon loadouts), trading, and much more. Finaly, this game has something that no FPS has had in a long time, as sense of humor and presonality mostly stemming from the characters unique personas and how they interact with eachother.

review: Originally, I downloaded this game simply for content in Garry's Mod, thinking I would never take interest in it and play it. I made a mistake. I started playing it in early September, and I'm very glad I did. Everything about it is so loveable. The less realistic, stylized art style, the map design, the gamemodes, the variety of the classes, (the satisfaction when you kill a really good player), weapons, hats and outfits, and the constant stream of community made items! In my opinion, it is far better than other FPS games on the market, and it's free! Without a doubt, I recommend this game to anyone who wants exactly what Team Fortress 2 has to offer, or someone who simply wants a game to be addicted to!

He smacks me and takes my computer away, sending me to sleep. I'm crying now, I lay in bed, and my face hurts. It's cold, and I feel a warmth moving towards me. Something touches me. It's Gaben! I'm so happy, he whispers in my ear, "HALF LIFE 3 CONFIRMED." He grabs me with his powerful programming hands, I'm ready. I spread my asscheeks for Gaben, he puts a hat on my butt. It looks so stupid but I do it for Gaben. My dad walks in to check on me and apologize, and shouts, "WHAT THE ?!" Gaben looks him straight in the eyes and says, "PORTAL 3 CONFIRMED." He flies through the window. Hats are love. Hats are life.

review: Ever Look across a lake and see a shooting star fly across the sky? Well, good for you. Nobody cares. The important thing is Team Fortress 2 is not your ordanary FPS game. It's a really fun and challenging game, with up to nine different classes that you can play as. These classes are the scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, and spy. These names need no introduction, they speak for themselves! Also you can use different weapons, all uniquely different! So when you see Team Fortress 2 in the Steam store, you get it! (It's freeee). So when this review asks me if I recommend this game, I say YES.

review: This will technically be my 2nd review on this game as that my last one was 2-3 years ago, i now have ALLOT more expierence in this game and i know nooks and crannies and secrets, but as you are reading this review you probly want to play this game so i won't spoil anything. One of the best things about this game is that it has its own economy... That fluctuates.... what i mean is that the economy changes like a item on E-bay. You know that one VINTAGE Harmonica your DIEING to get and sometimes the price goes up and sometimes it goes down. the price changes bepending on how rare it is, what its made of, and its demand. Second thing i love about this game is just the Variety of how you can play it, and i don't mean just 9 out of the 9 classes. I won't go into the the items you pick up on the way as that would be to much for a little review box. Scout is fast SURE but he can play as a great distraction against the team and i find him to be more to be a class to stall the enemy team. But thats just how i play, a scout can be right in your face a beat you and blast you solidly in the face. Though with strong weapons and agillity he is also sorta weak, work around that issue the way you see fit. Soldier is kinda bulky and his weapons are very strong as long as you know how to use them. There is one form of getting around for soldier called a Rocket Jump, a rocket jump is a blast directly under/next to him using the blast force to push him in the desired direction, issue is rocket jumps can harm him and the fall damage of coming back down from the air can hurt too. Pyro is actually very easy to use if your brand new to the game even if we hate seeing the old fashion "M1 + W" pyro. he can be very helpful with some expertise as he can reflect rockets back into the senders face with a Air-blast. Pyro can Spy-Check as in BURN the area around him hitting any invisible/disguised spies around. but he is mostly for Short-Range attacks. Demo can be used 2 very different ways (other ways are available) as explosives are fine and all but you can also go into whats called a "Demo-knight" and go without any sort of Gun and only use your meelee to cut threw your foes' necks. Issue with explosives he can do harm to himself, and his Demo-knight strategy... well lets face it they have guns and he doesn't... so be careful Heavy is VERY bulky but has allot of fire power with his minigun and stays alive Via his sandvich, and/or medic, you can also do "Heavy Boxing" but in a real fight of tf2 i wouldn't recommend it. Engineer works with his machines but is susceptable to spys, demos, and soldiers. as they can all cause MAJOR harm, even from a distance, to his builds anyhow. Engi is very helpful to his team as he keeps stock to their ammo and health. With a teleporter to get his teammates to locations much faster. But his personal weapons rather than his machines are not exactly strong so you kinda have to rely on your sentry Medic is extremely smart in machines of the medical type, using his Medi-gun or "Uber Cannon" as some call it, he can keep everyone in their Peak physical condition, and more so with Overheal. He can revive the dead itself with his expertise. Trouble is that he is definately not built for a fight by himself as he only carries his Medi-gun, a Syringe gun, and a Bone saw Sniper is pretty easy to guess what his expertise is, he puts bullets threw players' heads! He can be very hard for some to master or some VERY EASY to master, Depending on their past work. He can use a sniper rifles of many varieties or a Bow and Arrow. He uses Jarate wich can be a real harm to the enemy as it causes more damage to them. But as sniper is most of the time scoped in, his peripheral is narrowed, making him susceptable to... well whatevers behind him like spies. Spy can be very hard to master as he has to go unnoticed by the enemy. Why is this difficult? Because people scream when they have a knife in their back. But spy can become any person on the oppisite team and even his own team to trick them with a Dead Ringer to fake his own death! if disguised as his own team its like they die rather than him. Spy can be extremely powerful if unnoticed but is very weak. There is many ways to play the game that i won't get into, enjoy Team Fortress 2 10/10

review: A nice shooter game, Dosent do anything extremely innovative but it plays its cards right and simply assembles a neat shooter game with no Jack Of All Trades classes and plenty of maps, classes and weapons to collect. And whats the cost? nothing! essentially how it works is that you cannot give anything in a trade and cannot earn any COSMETIC items besides the few newbie hats. But if you dont want to spend a dime on the game, go for it you can still earn the weapons without any restriction so knock yourself out!

review: Team Fortress 2 is a very well balanced game it have things for everyone with difference play style, sick of shooting people your self build a sentry and start camping, tired of shooting and sick of sentries be a spy and baclstab people and sap those sentry, tired of killing master the arts healing as the medic and support your team today. Reasons this game can last that long is because of it's massive community and valve's caring toward this community listening to ideas, the End of the Line update is one of the great examples. There is no pay to win in this game the other weapons is not a direct upgrade to the origin wepons, every weapon have it's positive and negatives.

review: This review is split into sections, using numerals to show each section. All in all a 10/10 game. You should be playing this right now. I There are several game modes: CTF (Capture the Flag or briefcase in this game), TDM (Team Death Match), FFA (Free For All Death Match), Control Point (Capture and Hold Controls Points), King of the Hill (One team, or player must defend a single Control Point to win), and Payload (a team must push their bomb to the enemy base in order to win). Graphics are cartoonish. Gameplay is very well done, and holy crap is it fun. Bugs almost nonexistent. Hat Simulator 2 II Gameplay The maps in the game are near perfectly balanced, not giving any team any type of real heads up. There are plenty of weapons, and cosmetics to choose from. It is considered that the default weapons are the best weapons, but each is entitled to their own opinions. There are a large number of maps, and a large number of other content available to the players. There are many items in the game that were created by the community itself, including maps, weapons, and cosmetics. Choosing random game modes/maps will always give you a different map every time (after 40ish hours you might have seen every map rotation), weapons can be earned through achievements, or by purchasing their variants through the market place. Valve does give you an option to switch to their beta maps as well, which of course are being tested by the players who choose to do so. The gameplay is fast paced and very logically developed, and due to its cartoonish graphical style it is very much enjoyable. III Free to Play Vs. Paid to Play The game is indeed Free to Play, but if you receive any item drops, you are unable to use them/sell them. Unless of course you purchase an item from the Team Fortress 2 website, or from the MarketPlace. Purchasing an item gives you many more slots in your backpack for items, and removes all restrictions of Free to Play. All in all a 10/10 game. You should be playing this right now.

review: Quite a nice game. Sorry for jumping on the bandwagon, but here's the positives and negatives. Positive: -BIG community. Even in 3 in the morning you have 1000 servers full of friendly people. -No OP weapons. Even though some people complain, the developers makes sure that no matter how much money you spend in the game, everything is equal. -Flexibility. Whether you want to trade in a minecraft mod, kill idle people in a box, or hook onto walls and be superman, you've got it all. -Cool feature like CONGA and a frying pan. Negative -You will encounter rude people. Whether with micspam, spawncamp, or scammers, not everyone is nice. -Tryhards. By tryhard I don't mean someone who's good. I mean someone who is bad but pretends/try to be good. They sometimes rage and spoil the fun for them and other people. -(Sometimes)Developers hat focus too much on making money, not content. In the recent End of The Line, the only weapon they promised was useless, overpriced "Ducks", canceling the map, and not giving the community enough for their hard work. I'm not trying to hate on Valve, but sometimes they are dissapointing. Overall, since it's free, go ahead, try it out. You might encounter some ups and downs. Don't rage. These are my personal opinion. True or False, I hope you enjoyed my point of view. -Toaster

review: This game is really good because you can play in many varying ways. As a spy you could be sneaky. If you like to be a support you could always play as a medic and heal injured teammates. If you wanna be a bit tanky, though you will probably need a medic to be in the frontlines of a fight, you could play as a heavy and kill everybody with your minigun. If you like being fast and capture points and the intelligence fast you will be playing as the scout. There's other classes such as sniper, pyro, soldier demoman, and engineer. Another great thing is that you can find new weapons to play differently. Definitely recommend, Hell I would give the game 10/10!

review: Valve's Team Fortress 2 is quite different from most multiplayer games that come out these days. First of all, the balance of this game is excellent. Seriously. Out of all the classes, the only one which comes even close to being overpowered and unbalanced is the Pyro, which is terrible at long range, so probably that evens out. Secondly, the humour and the classes are enough to keep anybody entertained. There are 9 classes in the game, and each one has their own unique personality and traits. I definitely recommend this game. If you haven't played it yet, do so right now. It's free to play, but I had bought it when Orange Box came out.

review: I was only 15 years old I loved TF2 so much I prayed to TF2 every night, thanking it for the love I've been given. "Hats are love." I say. "Hats are life." My dad walks in on me as I max out the credit card to buy all the hats and he calls me a theifing , I know he's just jealous that I'm going to raise my steam level, I called him a . He smacks me and takes my computer away, sending me to sleep. I'm crying now, I lay in bed, and my face hurts. It's cold, and I feel a warmth moving towards me. Something touches me. It's Gaben! I'm so happy, he whispers in my ear, "HALF LIFE 3 CONFIRMED." He grabs me with his powerful programming hands, I'm ready. I spread my asscheeks for Gaben, he puts a hat on my butt. It looks so stupid but I do it for Gaben. My dad walks in to check on me and apologize, and shouts, "WHAT THE ?!" Gaben looks him straight in the eyes and says, "PORTAL 3 CONFIRMED." He flies through the window. Hats are love. Hats are life.

review: Before playing Team Fortress 2, I would've said "to hell with first-person shooters." With so many of them being carbon copies of each other, with the same old gritty, realstic style, it's easy to lose faith in there being originality in the genre. Team Fortress 2 is a fine example of everything having an exception. It's always the perfect solution for when I'm having a crappy day or I'm bored. Except for when it's not. But it often is! Moreso than almost any other game. It's incredibly fun and designed to be the kind of game you pour hundreds of hours into, which is very easy to do! It's free and it's fun, there's no damn excuse to not play it! Give it a try, you'll probably surprise yourself with how enjoyable it is! Even if the ordinary gameplay style isn't your thing, there's many other types of servers and play styles to always offer something exciting. Even when I'm getting my  kicked on this game, I tend to be having fun and laughing. It's easy to get into and easy to get addicted to as well. If you're wondering, there is a "catch" to it being free to play, which is that there's also a premium version but to get that version you just need to purchase any in-game item, which can be for as little as 60 pence or something like that, plus it is possible to play for as long as you like with the free version if you're satisfied with that. The main motivation to get premium is the space in your inventory is quite limited in the free version and after a few hundred hours (!) playing you might start to feel like you're running out of space, assuming you like to keep anything interesting you get. As far as catches go, I'd say that's pretty fair, certainly gives you a loooong time to decide whether this game is worth putting your money towards... a potentially very small amount of money, I might add. Getting premium allows you to get rarer drops such as hats and be able to trade items with other players freely, allowing you to get your hands on all sorts of cool stuff. You'll probably only want to get it if you've got really into the game and want to experience it in full and have been playing long enough for the inventory space to become an issue, so don't feel this is a game where you feel incredibly stunted by your free-to-play status. In conclusion this game is super-super fun, few other games have the potential to have so many hundreds of hours poured into them and remain enjoyable. Give it a try, you'll probably be very glad you did! Although having said all that, it does have autobalance, the worst feature to be included in any game ever. Nothing like getting put on the team you've been working against all this time the moment you die, after having called vote after vote to prevent such a fate but everybody adores a gamebreaking flaw too much for there to be enough "yes" votes. If you end up the very opposite to glad that you gave this a game a try after all, finding yourself on the verge of suicide over how something as evil as autobalance can exist in this world, I'm very sorry. Truly, who could have expected that in a team-based game, anyone could think it'd be a good idea to have a feature that targets you the exact second you die, no matter how long you had been alive beforehand and forces you to turn against your own team? A feature that in an instant, turns a highly enjoyable round into an extremely irritating one. A feature that, despite having been criticised for years, still hasn't been reworked, all we've got is a vote feature that people are too stupid to vote "yes" for.

review: In case you can't tell, I love this game. Just look at how many hours I have on it. It is hands down the best Multiplayer FPS out there. Also it's free to play. And free things are awesome. You do need to buy at least one item from the in-game store to get a premieum, but the cheapest item is currently $0.10, so it's not that big a deal. Now, onto the gameplay. This game appeals to all people who like FPS games. Wanna snipe? Go sniper. Wanna be a healer? Go medic. Wanna be an indestructable tank in the battlefield? Go heavy. The list goes on and on. Its wonderfully balanced (except for the gunslinger). Also the hats are pretty neat.

review: All my life I wanted to be a pro...a warrior and I just couldn't succeed.But then,I found it.The fate of the world was now in my hands,a weapon designed by the gods of pootis,a true amazing weapon that would aid me in every battle that I would ever be in it was...........the phlog.This weapon was made for me,but only those with true power could use this righteous glory of pure holiness that is this weapon.The beauty of this weapon gives me a hardcore erection that can not and will not be tamed.People yell and hate on me because I wield the power of the almighty.Not only is the weapon a very balanced item,but it represents life..time...and humanity.The mechanical look of the phlog represents us...as humans it shows that we are gears turning endlessly cought up in many things..but we are like this for a reason.You see...the gears turn and work together to produce the flame of the heavenly guards that once protected this weapon.Anyway what im saying is the gears help each other to charge and activate...the mmph meter.The pure skill and patience it takes to activate this will literally give you the power of everything,demons,angels,and even God himself.Once this meter has run out you go back to your slightly better than normal self.After having this weapon for over 10 milliniums,I finally unlocked the helment of grace and glory...this hat is.....the GIBUS.I CAN'T SAY ANYMORE OR ELSE THE GODS WILL PUNISH ME FOR THE SIN I HAVE COMMITED TELLING EVERYONE AND ANYONE ABOUT THIS IS JUST DEATH FOR ME.SO GO MY FRIENDS AND PHLOG ON. :D :D :D

review: Team Fortress 2 is an amazing, creative, hilarious, and incredibly fun multiplayer first person shooter. This game is one of a kind, and it is incredibly popular for many good reasons like: it perfectly balances the 9 classes to make the game a lot more fun (Because who wants to constantly die against someone with virtualy no weakness?). The balancing in this game makes sure that no one class is too overpowered, and encourages a lot of team work and stradegy. The game probably wouldn't be as fun if it wasnt balanced to perfection. Valve also listens to their fans, something that many game companies don't do. We have the Steam Workshop to show fan - made items that have at least a chance of becoming in game items! They also listen to feedback about for example: balancing issues, or a glitch. The constant updates are great especialy since like the game, they are all free! These important updates could include new weapons, taunts, costumes, maps, or even modes! (Like Mann vs. Machine) The 9 classes are so full of stereotypical humor, bright personalities, and amusing lines. The Scout is a stereotypical teenager from Boston with a baseball bat and an awesome accent, the Soldier is a stereotypical American drill sargent with a bazooka who sounds exactly like what I would think a stereotypical drill sargent sounds like, the Demoman is a drunken black scottish guy with an accent, a grenade launcher, a stickybomb launcher, and an eyepatch, many peoples favorite class: the Heavy is a giant Russian man with a minigun named "Sasha", and a Russian accent who punches people with his bare (or bear!) hands and created an internet meme because of the almighty Sandvich, the Engineer is a Texan who can build Sentry guns, Dispensers, and Teleporters to help the team, has a Texan accent, and palys the guitar, the Sniper is an seemingly everyday Australian man with a Rifle that can do an instant kill (Headshot), an Australian accent, a hat and sunglasses, and is an assasin for hire, not just a mercinary. the Medic is a German doctor that has a German accent, stole a dove from a German prime ministers wedding and named it "Archimedes", and lost his medical liscence who can breifly turn people invincible, the Spy (my favorite) is a mysterious French gentleman who can do an instant kill (Back stab), has a French accent, can turn invisible, can use his Electro sapper to destroy an Engineer's Buildings in time, is an assasin for hire like the Sniper, and is CRUEL to everybody, and my second favorite class: the Pyro is a complete mystery since he has a fire protective suit that covers his entire body, a gas mask that covers his face (if he even HAS one), and only says "Mmph", and has a huge variety of Flame-throwers, secondary weapons, (Like Flare guns) and Meele weapons (Like axes) who is arguably the best class in the game!!!!!! (Even with the Pyro's balances like mostly close-ranged combat) I could go on and on about the entire game, but I dont want to bore any one reading this review by making it even longer that it already is. Team Fortress 2 is one of the funniest, most creative, one of a kind, and best games I have ever played, and the best PC game EVER period. I would recomend this more than anything else, and if it wasn't free when I got it, it would be higher than #1 on my wishlist. Infact, the one reason I made a Steam accout is to get Team Fortress 2! It is truly a godly game. GET. THIS. GAME. NOW!!!!!

review: One of the best online FPS to date. Characters are awesome, voice acting is awesome, weapons are awesome. Class based, with a giant arsenal of different weapons to equip. Smooth and optimized performance, awesome fan made and oficial maps. Has in game store, were all weapons and cosmetics are. (Execpt for a few promo items.) But here is the twist: Almost all of the stock weapons which you recieve from the start, are the best. Weapons drop rather freqeuntly, aswell as having achivements which gives weapons. (Hint: There is a LOT of achivements.) So in short: Play this game. If you dont enjoy, no harm. Its free. Just uninstall and be on your way... 12/10 would play again.

review: Very fun game, in my opinion one of the best games that has ever existed. During my long playtime I learned a lot about the community. With the probably addition of competitive matchmaking valve will "revive" this game since a lot of players say it is dying. All I hope is that Valve will add this new feature and this game will have even more players like CS:GO and DOTA 2. Cosmetics are also a part of the game that keep the community alive! People say traders are stupid and don't even play the game and traders say that people who play the game only for gameplay are stupid and poor. That's not true at all. The F2P players aren't always noobs... There are some F2Ps with expensive backpacks and there are some F2Ps with crazy skills. It's not the gibus or the team captain, it's the skills, no matter what type of skills - trading or playing. It is a fair and balanced game and people can easily get started playing it. There aren't any complex mechanics or anything, just hop on and have fun. Lots of weapons to choose from, lots of gamemodes, lots of fun. The perfect trio. I started playing this game and the first 1000 hours I only played without trading. I got premium at 500 hours and started trading after 1000. I started playing the game without trading just months ago. My backpack is worth a bit and I do not need more than this. As a conclusion, I am both a trader and a player and I suggest you play this game for both of those things! The only bad thing I can say is that the trading community is going to hell.

review: TF2 is a team based hat simulator. The main goal is to collect hats and move your way up the ranks of the top traders. Although Hats are obviously the main part about this game, the shooting game included is great! Well balanced, but with LOTS of inexperienced people calling you a "Cheater" for sticky jumping across the map. Jokes aside, TF2 is a great game and I recommend you try it at least once.

review: TF2 is by far the best free game on the steam market. It has a variety of game modes (plus it's free! (can't go wrong with free games)). With some free games, you find to actually do something, you have to pay, but you can rock on tf2 without having to pay a single penny! Spy and soldier are my favourite classes and my soldier is pimped with awesome gear that i traded for on trade servers. I would reccomend this to anyone who likes action packed first person shooters!!

review: This game is possibly one of the greatest F2P games ever. However, once you reach that premium level, the game only gets better. Starting the game out, people do not realize the potential that they have. They look at their inventories, see the stock items placed in the slots, and connect to the first payload game that they find. And so the journey begins on TF2. But with only .50 cents in your steam wallet, you can unlock all the secrets of TF2. Purchasing their first wrangler opens them up to the world of hats, trading, and of course, unusuals. When a newly found premium player gets his first key, he opens up the crate that had no use before this. The suspense is killing him... 3... 2... 1... You unboxed! Strange Jarate! Not knowing the dissapointment in this. The player screams with excitement about getting a strange! Selling this strange for 1 rec turns into buying another, and getting a ref. This ref turns into a key. And the key into a bud. Now, you are a veteran of TF2 trading. However, with new updates coming every so often (BREAAD), new oppurtunites are created, and the game of Team Fortress get even better.

review: Once you find a server that fits well with your skill level, appropriate ratio of seriousness to humor, and is generally free of s, I've found TF2 to be one of the most enjoyable ways you can spend your time. Luckily, TF2's community is exceptional compared to other FPSs out there, so this generally isn't difficult. I do want to stress, however, how much server jumping can improve your experience if your first few tries aren't stellar. Lots of people play this game for lots of different reasons, so shop around and find a like-minded community. Whether you're super serious or just wanna conga or somewhere in between, who you play with affects your experience hugely.

Not only does this game have quirky characters, interesting mechanics, great crisp-cartoony like gameplay and graphics, and just fun to play with and even then after you get a tad tired of that, tons of stuff to do, like, collect hats, stranges, vintages, Marketing, Unique gamemodes, and many others. So if you havent tried it out, try it out now.

review: Hats. Hats everywhere. So many Hats and other cosmetic items that it's pretty much impossible not to find a combination you like. Also, enough weapons to find a way of killing your opponents that suits you. 9 Classes, each with a unique set of weapons, a fairly realistic personality, and lots of cool hats to wear. So much extra content (Official comics, etc.) that lets you get an incredibly in-depth look at the game's story and the backstory of each Class. Overall, I give TF2 a Hat/10 Best game ever, play it now.

review: I've wasted many glorious hours playing this, and I can say I've had one heck of a time. In Team Fortress 2, you're essentially playing 9 different games at once with the radical gameplay differences each class has, and on top of that the many gamemodes provides even more diverseity to how you play each class, since their role changes depending on the gamemode. It is an unorthodox and first person shooter that continues to break the mold of what a game in the genre can be, and I would recommend it to anyone that, essentially, wants something that is completely different, while still maintaining enough familiarity for those accustomed to the fps genre. Effective teamwork, diversity, balanced and fast-paced gameplay; what more could you ask for in a fun-to-play and free-to-play first person shooter like TF2. Oh yeah...hats...don't forget about hats...

review: Team Fortress 2 is a fast-paced game.From characters as fast as scout to characters as slow as heavy.Although some people might argue,I personally feel that scout is not the fastest. As a soldier,rocket jumping proves to be a good mean of reaching to the front line.A great item to have as a soldier when rocket jumping is the 'Gunboats'.The gunboats is a pair of AMAZING item.It provides lots of mobility.Next we're going to look at the classes. 1. Scout=Fast,good mean of damage with the scattergun,flying guillotine+sandman can take down a heavy fast 2.Soldier=Slow at moving,fast at rocket jumping,highest mean of damage with stock rocket launcher,gunboats for mobility and market gardener/escape plan 3.Pyro=Normal speed,reflecting rockets is the way to play pyro properly i feel and using the flare and axtinguisher gives you lots of damage output. 4.Demoman=Slower by normal speed by a bit,Pipes and stickybomb launcher is a really good mean of taking down sentry nests.You can have lots of fun by being a troll demoman by having the boots,tide turner or sticky jumper(depending of map) and the ullapool caber.The fun factor is high. 5.Heavy=Slowest class,Good mean of damage and very effective at attacking sentries. 6.Engineer=Normal speed,widowmaker teaches you how to aim your shotgun as missing takes out your ammo,pistol for secondary as its your seond long range weapon.Gunslinger as its annoying and fun to use. 7. Medic=Faster than normal by a bit,blutsauger,kritzkrieg for the healing taunt and uber saw to build uber for team. 8.Sniper=Normal speed,challenging but fun,sniper is an effective class to deal with heavies. 9.Spy=Normal speed.Last but not least,we have the SPY.An effective class against sentry nests,heavies and medics,the spy is a very sly class,able to take out sentry nests with the sapper,taking out heavy and medic combos is a huge up side. Overall tf2 is a fun game to play .

review: Ive played this game for quite some time and had much fun in this game, it is quite original and a unique gem in the line of video games out there. For instance, I was walking around in Dustbowl and encountered an enemy pyro. Then astonishingly, he croutched down, pulled out an axe, and called me a "spy" in friendliness. I did the same except with a shovel. Being a new Tf2 player and never seeing this behavior before, I scrounged the voice command list for "spy". Upon completing my feat of seeking the correct word, we walked toward eachother slowly, legs crouched, and stared at eachother, spamming "spy". We did this for a few moments until one of my team mates (soldier) came waddling himself down towards me and the pyro. He stared at us both in confusion, the little ghost dangling off his gibus in the fresh dusty air, and shot a rocket at the pyro, sending his body flying many yards away. Upon seeing my first Tf2 ragdoll, I burst into tears crying with laughter as the pyro's body fell through the air and made the "squish" splat noise. Such a sight is unheard of in any other game and is quite common in this game. I am not a Tf2 fanboy, as I have grown up playing games like the Halo series my whole life since before I was 5, and playing CoD for a few years. I can easily say Halo is a very fun game, but that is another story. You will never find another experience like the ones you find in Tf2 nearly all the time every day, there is much laughter to have and enjoy in this game. 10/10 Is gud stuff. -Heavy

review: Team fortress 2 has quickly grown to one of my faverite games faster than any other game, besides Red Dead Redemption XD. I simply love and sometimes hate this game. This Multiplayer/Co-oprative game is extremly fun with the friends and many more to be made! My friends and I are simply in love with this game as it can be very interesting/Extremly fun to play. TF2's comunity is very dedicated and has been here for 7 to 8 years. The comunity always is alive and is no matter what gonna be here. Untill Valve learns to count to 3 I mean (TF2, Portal 2, Half life 2, Left for dead 2...) ! So I Really Recommend This game to everyone and anyone in general!

review: This game is the very best ive been playing it for a long time and im not even the tiniest bit board. This game mixes random with medevil and future kinda stuff. It has alien robots which I call the that cause the music. And 9 classes which are all very unique in personality and game wise. Hats, sprays, christmas presents(Item Find). Its amazing! ITS A AMAZING GAME ITS FREE?!?!??!?! WHY IS IT FREE?!?!?!! I hope they keep it that way but this game doesnt seem like a free game. 10 out of 10 stars for me.

review: love this game so much, this is such a well balanced game, there is no OP weapons cause there is always a anti weapon, and anti class for each character in this game,this game takes alot more skill then a run and gun game anyday,plus the game gives back to you when you play so its a win win :D

review: When I was growing up in the white trash apartment complex in the 90s, I often spent my days playing outside. I would catch toads, fish, and bugs and often keep them as pets. One day my mother burned my face with a cigar. A few years ago my brother and I were fishing. We caught a catfish and as we were cleaning and gutting it, we noticed a pair of human infant feet in the catfish's stomach contents. More importantly, this taught me a valuable lesson about not running on floors covered in ice or human excrement.

review: Nice free-to-play online game from Valve, that based on a team work. You can play for one of 9 classes: scout, soldier, demoman, pyro, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, spy. Every class has its special limitations, capabilities and features. Universe of a game is crazy, comic, kind of funny, bloody, violent, enthralling. By the way, this game also famous for it's variety of hats.

review: This review is split into sections, using numerals to show each section. All in all a 10/10 game. You should be playing this right now. I There are several game modes: CTF (Capture the Flag or briefcase in this game), TDM (Team Death Match), FFA (Free For All Death Match), Control Point (Capture and Hold Controls Points), King of the Hill (One team, or player must defend a single Control Point to win), and Payload (a team must push their bomb to the enemy base in order to win). Graphics are cartoonish. Gameplay is very well done, and holy crap is it fun. Bugs almost nonexistent. Hat Simulator 2 II Gameplay The maps in the game are near perfectly balanced, not giving any team any type of real heads up. There are plenty of weapons, and cosmetics to choose from. It is considered that the default weapons are the best weapons, but each is entitled to their own opinions. There are a large number of maps, and a large number of other content available to the players. There are many items in the game that were created by the community itself, including maps, weapons, and cosmetics. Choosing random game modes/maps will always give you a different map every time (after 40ish hours you might have seen every map rotation), weapons can be earned through achievements, or by purchasing their variants through the market place. Valve does give you an option to switch to their beta maps as well, which of course are being tested by the players who choose to do so. The gameplay is fast paced and very logically developed, and due to its cartoonish graphical style it is very much enjoyable. III Free to Play Vs. Paid to Play The game is indeed Free to Play, but if you receive any item drops, you are unable to use them/sell them. Unless of course you purchase an item from the Team Fortress 2 website, or from the MarketPlace. Purchasing an item gives you many more slots in your backpack for items, and removes all restrictions of Free to Play. All in all a 10/10 game. You should be playing this right now.

I still haven't unboxed an unusual. I beg my steam friends for free items. I started stealing from my local gas station for fresh food and drinks. I stole my neighbors wallet. This game ruined my life. I hope they update it again, soon. 10/10.

review: Quite a nice game. Sorry for jumping on the bandwagon, but here's the positives and negatives. Positive: -BIG community. Even in 3 in the morning you have 1000 servers full of friendly people. -No OP weapons. Even though some people complain, the developers makes sure that no matter how much money you spend in the game, everything is equal. -Flexibility. Whether you want to trade in a minecraft mod, kill idle people in a box, or hook onto walls and be superman, you've got it all. -Cool feature like CONGA and a frying pan. Negative -You will encounter rude people. Whether with micspam, spawncamp, or scammers, not everyone is nice. -Tryhards. By tryhard I don't mean someone who's good. I mean someone who is bad but pretends/try to be good. They sometimes rage and spoil the fun for them and other people. -(Sometimes)Developers hat focus too much on making money, not content. In the recent End of The Line, the only weapon they promised was useless, overpriced "Ducks", canceling the map, and not giving the community enough for their hard work. I'm not trying to hate on Valve, but sometimes they are dissapointing. Overall, since it's free, go ahead, try it out. You might encounter some ups and downs. Don't rage. These are my personal opinion. True or False, I hope you enjoyed my point of view. -Toaster

review: Yeah, what do I have to say about Team Fortress 2? This game is my most played game on steam, There's so much to do, If you are into trading you could just focus on that, If you just want to have fun with friends then you could just join a server and have fun. People say that "Commpetetive" doesn't exist in Team fortress 2 but it sure does. People also says that "Teamwork" doesn't exist in Team fortress 2 but it also surly does. This is atleast one of the best FPS games out there. Hat Simulator 2, I mean... Team Fortress 2 gets 11/10

review: Team Fortress 2 is always hard to start off. I remember starting and dying constantly but still enjoying it. Eventually I got better and started learning other things like Rocket Jumping and Trading. With all the classes, weapons, maps and gamemodes I never get bored. And they keep bringing more out! There's also all the mods and community made gamemodes such as saxton hale or super smash bros. I would definitely reccomend this to anyone who has a PC. I play on a laptop and from time to time it can lag, but nowhere near as bad as some games and it's still playable. Unlike other FPS games like Call of Duty, the classes in this are just hilarious. They have each of their own personalities and just say some funny stuff while your playing. With the fact that you can still kind of customize your character with all the hats and cosmetics they keep adding, and keep the actual character is great. There's also the Halloween - Scream Fortress (which I'm enjoying at the moment) and the christmas - Smissmas. This is by far my favourite game today and I don't intend to stop playing it anytime soon.
